1,Mr MAUGER,SELECT COMMITTEE ON,"I have been informed-' that the employees in the imported harvester distributing houses frequently work, on Saturday afternoon and night, andthroughout Sunday. My informant tellsme that; recently, some of them worked' until 2 a.m. on Sunday, and that a number of boys worked throughout Sunday and Sunday night, and until 1.30-a.m. on Monday. They had then to walk considerable distances to reach their homes, but were expected-to return at 8.45 the same morning. It is said that lady typists frequently have to work until 10 p:m. In view of these allegations of sweating and' bad conditions of employment in the imported harvester distributing houses, .will"" the Prime Minister, if necessary, widenthe scope of the Royal Commission which;. he intends to appoint, so that all the facts as to wages, conditions, & c , may be made known, to furnish data for the ascertainment of the relative value to the people of the Commonwealth of the manufacturing .and distributing businesses in this in-dustry ?",11
2,Mr FISHER,SELECT COMMITTEE ON,"The honourable member is right in assuming that we intend to convert the present Select Committee into a Royal Commission.

If they are true, will he make a determined' effort to put an end to rthe introduction of these aliens?",12
6,Mr FISHER,SELECT COMMITTEE ON,"I am glad that the - honourable member has asked the question. Ministers are alive to the difficulty of find-ing out and apprehending those who are - surreptitiously introducing prohibited immi, grants, and, if Parliament will pass a short Bill which we intend to introduce, it will very greatly strengthen our hands in - dealing with the matter. Every resource that the Commonwealth possesses must be used to catch delinquents, both the aliens - themselves and those who are, at least, conniving at their importation. I cannot think it possible for large numbers of Chinese - stowaways to be brought to Australia with-out some of the responsible officers of the vessels on which they come knowing of - their presence there.

It is stated that he is to tour the rural districts of Great Britain, under conditions fully set out in the newspapers, whose reports the Prime Minister has, no doubt, read. I ask the honourable gentleman if those reports are correct, and, if not, under what conditions is Mr Drakard to act for the Government.",12
10,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH ADVERTISING,"I am not able to reply to the honourable member, because I know nothing about the matter. I therefore ask him to put his question again to the Minister of External Affairs.",12
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ADVERTISING,"Accordin g to the newspapers, Mr Drakard has already left for London. Are we to understand that he has done so without the knowledge of the Prime Minister?",12

15,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ADVERTISING,"I understand that Mr. Drakard is to have the right of publishing whatever advertisements he chooses in the pamphlets containing information about Australia which he is to distribute. Will steps be taken to prevent the Commonwealth from being made sponsor for advertisements with which we should not care to be associated? If so, what supervision is to take place?",12

20,Mr HALL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Treasurer, upon noticeIn view of the fact that certain 5th class telegraphists have suffered monetary loss to the extent of nearly ^5,000 through an examination which has since been abolished, is he in favour of recouping these officers their loss.",13
21,Mr FISHER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the law all salary increases were discretionary, and the increments of the telegraphists referred to were not granted, as they failed, when required to do so, to show that they had attained a reasonable standard of telegraphic efficiency. The examination was abolished, as it had served its end of providing for promotion of the more efficient telegraphists, and as new en trants to the class were all required to pass an adequate test before admission. The advancement of the residuum of unqualified 5th class telegraphists was allowed eventually as a concession in view of their length of service and general good conduct, but as the reason for denying promotion when the examination was in force was adequate, there is now no more justification for granting the equivalent of the unearned increments than there is for granting increases to others from whom they have been withheld for good and sufficient reasons.",13

ESTIMATES. In Committee of S u f f l y (Consideration resumed from 4th December, vide page 2758) : DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND CUSTOMS. Division 37 (Central Staff), .£28,054. Mr THOMAS BROWN [4.45] - We find provision made in this [104] division for what is apparently a new position, that of Assistant Comptroller-General, at a salary of £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. In last year's Estimates no such item appeared.",14
33,Mr FISHER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It is a new position which was advertised by the Public Service Commissioner.,14
34,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I think that we ought to have from the Minister a statement as to why this new position has been created.,14
35,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.46] - Unti l recently the whole, of the work relating to the interpretation' of' the Tariff and decisions thereunder was invariably referred to the Victorian office, and the duties of the Central staff grew so largely that Mr Lockyer, who was Collector of Customs in Sydney, had to remain in Melbourne, for the purpose of giving these decisions, for four out of the last seven and a half years. The Public Service Commissioner, apparently recognising, through the Minister, the necessity for this appointment, created the position, and advertised it , with the result that Mr Lockyer, who had been doing the work for something like three ancl a half years, was apThe pointed at a salary of £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. That is slightly in excess of the remuneration he received as Collector of Customs in New South Wales.",14
36,Mr FRAZ ER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Kalgoorlie) [4.47] - I wish once more to emphasize the view that I have lorigheld that it would be advantageous to the Department, and possibly of some benefit to the people of Australia, if inspectors and other officers responsible for the landing of cargo were transferred, at reasonable periods, from one port to another. Unfortunately, we have had from time to time exposures in connection with the Department showing that in the various States officers have been deceived, and considerable loss of revenue has resulted. Apparently this is due in some cases to the fact that an officer, having remained in the one position for some years, has falleninto a beaten groove, and has been induced to accept the word of certain importers who were believed to be reputable business men. In this way the revenue of the Department has been seriously depleted, while in other instances frauds have been committed in consequence of inattention, if I may so describe it , of certain Customs (Calare) officials to the duties they are expected to fulfil . In addition to these leakages of revenue, there have not Seen wanting cations of a considerable influx of aliens into the various States notwithstanding the efforts of officers charged with the tration of the Immigration Restriction Act, who, for the most part, are attached to the Department of Trade and Customs. The Minister is at present possessed of inforferring mation as to certain imports being undervalued for the assessment of It would be of immense value to the - people of Australia if responsible officers were periodically removed to other States; and this is a view I have previously advanced. In my judgment, it is possible for a. Customs officer, who has been for long in place, to give certain latitude to importers, whom he believes to be honourable men; time. and experience has proved in the past that such confidence is ' sometimes misplaced, one, too! with disadvantage to the revenue. idea were carried out, it coulcl not seriprised ously interfere with the officers' conveniI ence, and would do much to prevent evation, sion of the Customs. I should like to hear tence passed. the views of the Minister on this point.",14
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Hume) '[4.51]. - I hope that the Minister of Customs will not act on the suggestion the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. speak with some experience, and I know that the men at the head of these branches of the Customs Department are honourable men. I can only suppose that the honoris able member, in his remarks, refers cases in South Australia, where,.no doubt, there was serious f r a u d ; and I should like about that officer. here to say that I could never understand why another prosecution was not proceeded with, as it would have been had I remained at the head of the Department. - Mr THOMA SBROWN - It is not late to proceed now.",15
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"At any rate, the prosecution was not proceeded with ; does in Victoria, where he has and, though I do not desire to mention names here, I shall have no objection to give them to the Minister. Before I office, I satisfied myself that a prosecution would lie and gave that instruction.",15

"" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I shall not say anything as to that. Let it be clearly derstood I do not blame the Minister, was anxious to sheet the crime home; the parties have not yet been punished as firms. indithe information submitted to me showed they should be. I was very much astonished that the principals in the case I refer administo were not brought into Court.",15
40,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Is the honourable gentleman referring to the prosecution of agents?,15

Could Mr Smart do better service anywhere than he lived all his life, and where he knows every individual, importer ? Then, in Sydleft ney, there is, perhaps, no officer who has a better knowledge of the local importers than has Mr Baxter. Why should that be removed to some other place, and one less competent substituted ? If we appoint proper men to these offices, we ought to trust them; and I know that a great deal of latitude has to be given to unvarious firms in the importing business. who The Department has to depend much on but the character and record of honour of",15
48,Mr FULLER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That was not the idea of the first Minister of Trade and Customs.,16
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am now speaking merely of my experience as Minister; and I depended on my officers to find out which firms could be trusted and which could not. It would be a-, deathblow to proper administration if officers were kept moving about.",16
50,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The only reason for removing officers must be that we do not depend on them.,16
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That can be the only reason. I have instanced Mr. Smart; and I can further say that it would be difficult to find a man to take the place of Mr Lockyer, who is one of the ablest officials in the Department. It is necessary to find men of ability and the greatest integrity for such positions; and unless we can get them we had better be without any. Having got such men, however, we ought not to unduly move them about.",16
52,Mr FULLER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It is a most dangerous doctrine that, because an officer knows the importers, he ought to be kept in one place.",16
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"There is no danger if the officer be honest; and it takes men in such a position half their lives to find out whom they can, and whom they cannot, trust. If we have a man of integrity in such, a position, the knowledge he acquires in a port greatly assists administration ; and, in my opinion, repeated removals would only lead to confusion and congestion.",16
54,Mr FULLER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member has advanced two premises, one of which he has himself denied time after time, namely, that the importer is an honest man.",16
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That is so; and the honourable member is very unfair. I have said that some importers are not honest; but I have never said that importers, as a whole, are dishonest. I know from experience of dishonest importing; and I also know many who, in branches of business other than importing, cannot be trusted. But I think that the Minister would be ill-advised if he were to move our officers about as suggested. The Minister soon knows when he has a good officer upon whom he can depend, and when he finds such a man he should keep him where he is doing good work. The Minister is new to the Department, and I venture to [104]- 2 tell him that he will have to depend to a very large extent upon his officers. It is impossible for a Minister to know everything. It is impossible for him to worry out all the details for himself, and to dive down to the lowest depths of the intricacies of administration, in regard to every case that comes before him - If he cannot rely upon the Comptroller-General and aCollector he had better get rid of those officers.",16
56,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The Minister will have a pretty tough job if hetries to worry out all cases for himself.,16
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I can do as much work in a day as most men can, and I know how impossible it is for the Minister at the. head of the Department of Trade and Customs to do his duty without depending upon his officers. There may, of course, be cases where it is desirable to move officers about to some extent.  all civil servants every five years.",16
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That remark shows how little the honourable member knows about the subject. Of course, I know nothing about it, as the honourable member infers; but nevertheless I say that it is not a good thing to shift officers about.  orable member for Hume has put into my mouth words that I never uttered. He said that I stated that he knows nothing about the Departments. I know that he knows a good deal.",16
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member, from his tone, rather suggested that I knew nothing about the administration of the Department of Trade and Customs.  that.",16
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Perhaps I made a mistake. I simply wish to repeat that the Minister should not think of shifting officers when he knows that they, are doing good work.",16
61,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"(Dalley) [5.2] - The honourable member for Hume has made a .statement that I think requires further explanation. The purity of the administration of the Department has been rather called in question in regard to matters which have taken place in South Australia. Now, if there is a Department of the Commonwealth in which there should be absolute purity of administration, it is the Department of Trade and Customs. It is fro m that Department that the bulk of our revenue is derived; it is by that Department that the imposts levied by Parliament have to be collected. The honourable member has said that if . he had remained Minister of Trade and Customs a little longer, the principal of a certain firm in South Australia would have had to stand his trial for defrauding the Customs. That is as serious a charge as I have ever heard during the discussion of the Estimates in this Parliament. The honourable member said that he would not mention names, although he would tell the Minister privately to whom he was referring.",16
62,Mr ROBERTS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The matter is all over now.,17
63,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It is not all over. Time does not wash away guilt or shortcomings in regard to the administration of the Customs Department.,17
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Why did not ex-Minister of Trade and Customs take action ?,17
65,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The question is a per- matters of administration. tinent one, but nevertheless the fact that the late Minister took no action does not excuse this Parliament from insisting that action should be taken. action of the ex-Minister simply, points to the relationships existing between one member of the late Cabinet and another. But the point that we have to consider is, that today for the first time we have been made acquainted with the fact that a firm in South Australia was guilty of such practices that the honourable member for Hume says the principal of it ought to have been prosecuted. To whom did he refer? H a d I known previously that a prosecution ought to have taken place in consequence of fraud upon the Customs, I should have considered it to be my duty to press the matter upon the Government until an inquiry was made. But I been seized of the facts for the first time today. The present Minister of Trade Customs, for the credit ofhis Department, allowed to escape. should immediately institute an inquiry. The honourable member for Hume is to be thanked for mentioning the matter. Notanother for the poor. withstanding the attacks that were made upon him for some years, he has always been, as far as I know, a clean and honest administrator. That is my pression. That impression has been strengthened by his straightforward statement that if he had remained in office longer he would have instituted proceedings Sn the case to which he ireferred. The present Minister is new to the office. Surely he will recognise that he owes a duty to the Department and to himself. I wish to state that I cannot conceive of a more important Department than that of Trade and Customs. _",17
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It is the most important Department that I have ever administered.,17
67,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the Minister may be compelled to rely upon his officers to a very large extent. But nevertheless, the honourable gentleman must not consider that he is relieved of responsibility simply by making himself the mere echo of the views of his expert officers, however able they may be. I know of no Department that requires more attention than does the one under discussion, and I cannot conthe ceive of a conscientious Minister of Trade and Customs sheltering himself behind expert officers in reference to important I can quite understand the advice of the officers in reference to the interpretation of the Tariff being accepted by the Minister, but The in- there are other matters as to which I hope he wili make his own inquiries. Two courses are open to him in the discharge of his duties. Either he must echo the advice of his expert officers, or else he must be an industrious Minister, determined to master the details for himself. I do not think that the present Minister, who is a young man, and full of energy, means to shelter himself behind his officers. Here is his opportunity. The charge has been publicly made that a certain firm has defrauded the Customs. For some reason or other that firm has not been prosecuted.",17
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I said that the have heads of the firm had not been.,17
69,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Instea d of the heads of and the firm being prosecuted they have been There has been too much ground for the belief in this country that there is one law for the rich, and' The present Minister is not likely to give further colour to that belief, and he would do well to inaugurate his introduction .to the Departimment by instituting an inquiry as to the statement made by the honourable member - for Hume. I agree with that honourable member that it would be dangerous to transfer officers from State to State repeatedly. Take the case of Dr Wollaston. He is well acquainted with the practices and stability of various firms doing business in the port of Melbourne. He knows those firms which can be trusted and those which would be likely to be guilty of shady practices in business. Mr. Baxter, in New South Wales, is similarly well acquainted with the stability and practices of firms doing business ih Sydney. Mr Lockyer was brought over to Melbourne to assist in the interpretation of the Tariff, the original Commonwealth Tariff requiring a large number of decisions. I agree with the honourable member for Hume that it would be unwise to transfer these officers, who have gained complete knowledge of the way in which the business of importing is carried on in each State. Lockyer was brought over to Melbourne to assist in special work of interpretation.  men died?",17
70,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The next best men would get their places. I do not put the heads of Departments on such a pedestal as to believe that they could not be done without. What I say is merely that a man who has been trained in the office in Melbourne is likely to do better work here than he could be expected to do if transferred to Sydney. Of course, in each case there is an understudy, who can take the place of the man above him at half-anhour's notice.",18
71,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The r e would be risk of a difference in the interpretation of the regulations in each State.,18
72,Mr WILKS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I believe I am correct in saying that that matter is attended to by Mr Lockyer of the Central Staff, and that he advises as to the regulations, not for Victoria only, but for the whole of the Commonwealth. I hope that the matter to which the honourable member for Hume has referred will not be allowed to pass without some action being taken by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Dr CARTY SALMO N (Laanecoorie) {5.12] - I hope that the Minister will pause before accepting the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The officers referred to by the honourable member have, for a considerable time past, been doing very valuable work in each of the States. The Comptroller-General of Customs, of course, has now a very fair knowledge of the conditions obtaining in all of the States. The Collector of Customs in Victoria has acquired a very complete knowledge of the conditions obtaining in this State by a very long and very honourable connection with the Department. In Dr Wollaston we have an admirable officer, who has shown his fitness for the position' to which he was appointed at the beginning of Federation, and a man whom it will be very hard to replace; but I agree that there is no officer who is altogether indispensable. Mr Smart is not so widely known to honourable members and to the public, but is very favourably known in Victoria.  sent to the other States to fix up matters if the local officers were able to do what was required ?",18
73,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Thing s do not Mr require to be fixed up in Victoria. I do not say that our importers are better than those carrying on business in the other States, but we have at the head of the Customs Department in Victoria a man who has a complete knowledge of the various little ways for which some importers are famed. ",18
74,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not dispute that, and I should be prepared to trust Mr Smart's opinion on Excise matters, because he is a thoroughly reliable officer. I would point out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that a Collector of Customs is scarcely in the position of a detective. a There are plenty of officers under him who can carry out that class of work.",18
75,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I would shift some of them also. I should have periodical changes throughout the staff. - Dr CARTY SALMON - I am inclined to agree with the honourable member that it might be wise to transfer men engaged in the work of inspection, since it is well that they should not be personally known to importers, but I feel that it would be a grave error to remove officers who had risen from the lowest to the highest positions in Aie service from the States in which they had gained' their information. To do so would be to lose the benefit of the information which it has taken them so many years, and so much pains, to acquire.",18
76,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I did not mention any particular officer. I referred chiefly to the men acting directly between the Department and the importers of goods.,18
77,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Then there is much to recommend the honourable member's suggestion. I was speaking chiefly of the higher officers of the Department, who in Victoria, to my own knowledge, have done, and are doing, very valuable work, and whom it would be difficult to replace. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that if the honourable member for Hume hacl at any time in his possession, as Minister, evidence which he believed would warrant a public trial of any importer or manufacturer for evasion of the law, he would not have done his duty if he had not placed it in the hands of the proper authorities.",19
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I advised prosecution on more than one occasion.,19
79,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Then I am sorry that the honourable gentleman's advice was not followed. During the period in which I had charge of the Customs Department in Victoria, I learned how difficult it was to secure a conviction in such cases. But the Commonwealth Customs Act is a very much more perfect measure than was the State Act, ancl under it a great deal more might be done in the Courts. I urge that a trial should be made of the Act, to see whether it would not meet the case which has been referred to. If any importer, or any one who has dealings with the Customs Department, has been wilfully breaking the law for his own advantage, he should be brought to book. I trust that the present Minister will look into the matter, and if he finds the facts are as stated by the honourable member for Hume, I have no doubt that action will soon follow.",19

82,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do, whether they or not. Three inspectors have been pointed, as I think is known to every ber of the Committee, and the intention that every port in the Commonwealth be visited at least once a year, not only ih connection with Customs administration, but in connection with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act.

84,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I understood the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to suggest that transfers should take place of officers directly connected with the landing of goods.,19
85,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I do not think that it would do any harm if the Collectors themselves were sometimes transferred from one State to another.,19
86,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The Collector of Customs for Victoria was sent to South Australia to make investigations in connection with the frauds which were brought tolight there.,19
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It was Mr Smart who discovered them.  the suggestion made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.,19

That report clearly demonstrates the necessity which exists for the exerciseof .greater supervision in this connection.

114,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I say that the firm in question paid the whole amount to its agents who robbed the Department, and who have since been gaoled for their offence.  the principals of the firm did not rob the Customs Department, but that its agents did so, ancl that those agents have since been punished. That case, I contend, evidences the need which exists for the removal of Customs officers from one portion of the Commonwealth to another at stated intervals. I come now to the case in which New Zealand cod was being introduced into Victoria as Tasmanian trumpeter, thus escaping the duty which was properly payable upon it. This thing happened in Melbourne directly under the nose of this '' smart'' officer to whom reference has been made. Yet he did not discover it, and it was only when one man who did not get his proper share of the proceeds "" peached "" upon the remainder of those involved in the fraud, that Mr Smart was smart enough to run it to earth. Two or three Customs officers were involved in that fraud. I think that if they were not to be dismissed they should have been shifted to a Customs House outside Victoria.

I really cannot understand why the positions were created if there was no leakage. Was it suspected that the Department was being got at in any way other than by stowaways?",21
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The Minister has already learned how to hold his tongue.  if we wanted to make him talk.,21

119,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In order to make sure that the administration of the Customs was uniform throughout Australia.  that something was wrong, and that is a satisfactory explanation to me-that 'these officers were needed for performing special services.",21
120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That is the best argument in favour of the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.  ments which could be adduced that these officers should be shifted. The ex-Treasurer interjected that that was why he sent an officer from another State. If it was good then, it stands good today. I do not suppose that any honourable member would ask the Minister to shift the Collectors of Customs, but certainly those who are in close touch with importers and agents should, in the interests of not only the service, but also the Commonwealth,, be shifted periodically. I know that in a little bush town the police magistrate sets up a little coterie, and that his example is followed by the postmaster, the policeman, and the school teacher.

Opportunities for promotion do. not come, and the qualifications for promotion may go be absent. The authorities do not move the teachers for the sake of moving them. There is no reason to do so. I consider that there is quite enough moving of officers in connection with our Public Service. Some very painful cases occur even where promotion is the object sought. Only the other day a friend of mine, who is an engine-driver, told me that he has had to break up his little home and go away 200 miles into the interior in order to get promotion. Either he had to do that, or some one else would have stepped over his head and obtained a better status. It is bad enough for a man to have to betake himself to another part of the country, even when there is promotion to be gained by it.",22
137,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"There is a great difference between a case of that sort and that of a man who is responsible for admitting into the Commonwealth, free of duty, goods worth thousands of pounds.",23
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I admit there is a difference; but officers should not be moved about Australia at immense expense, and so far as I can see, with no practical benefit resulting.",23
139,Mr FRAZER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Surely the amount,£66,000-in the one case given,""would pay the expenses of moving a large number of officers for a considerable time?",23
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member proceeds on the airy assumption that the mere moving of officers would prevent fraud. I doubt if it would. honourable member for Hume referred to officers becoming acquainted with the details of firms' businesses, and knowing whether the firms were honest or otherwise. The honourable member very clumsily stated a matter which is obvious to an)' one who thinks for a moment. I do not agree with him that officers should be left alone because they get to know which firms can be trusted and which cannot. of no more dangerous doctrine than that a man should be allowed to exercise discretion between various firms as to which should be prosecuted and which should not. A Customs official ought to know neither friend nor foe, but should do his duty by the. Department, irrespective of what the reputation of the firm may be. Mr .

He was in the Government; and, when leaving, the Customs Department, left a recommendation that a prosecution should be instituted. He states that he intended to prosecute if he had remained in charge of that Department. He says he does not know why his colleagues did not order a prosecution. I do not know why he should be surprised, after all these months. We are the parties who should be surprised The at having the matter sprung upon us by the honourable member the moment he leaves office.",23
144,Mr WATSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,How could we know anything of the circumstances? Only Ministers could deal with cases of that kind.,23

If he has any justification for such a statement, a prosecution should be instituted. The firm prosecuted an employee' of theirs, named Frewin, on a charge of manipulating the Customs; but the Court dismissed the case. The Customs authorities then instituted a prosecution against Harris, Scarfe, and Company, for certain irregularities in connection with their invoices. It was fixed up. The matter was ended by the imposition of a penalty, the defence of the firm being that its officer had been paid l.y them the sum due to the Customs, although there is evidence that they were interested. Mr W. H. IRVINE. - What defence was raised on behalf of the clerk?  on the plea that he was acting in accordance with the instructions of his firm. He was defended by Senator Sir Josiah' Symon.

The late Mr Kingston in every case left it to the Court to decide whether a mistake had been committed or a fraud attempted. Whenever a firm is brought to book, The it is alleged that a mistake has been made by a clerk, and an underpaid hireling is brought forward as a scapegoat. It was the Victorian system to bring offenders before a Minister or an officer of the Department, and in the two-and-a-half years prior to Federation, no less a sum than .£15,000 was paid in fines by those called upon to make such appearances. It would. be a hundredfold better for the Commonwealth to go back to the Kingston regime, and prosecute in every case. It should be left to an independent tribunal to say whether those charged with offences are or are not guilty. At present the public never knows who are brought up and carpeted, because no names appear in the newspapers.",24

The names are published in the Gazette for every one to see.  will not publish them, the names should be reported to the House, and printed in Hansard. The present system is not fair to honest business men. An ordinary South Australian citizen. probably could not name a firm which has been carpeted, and consequently, of course, suspicion attaches to all firms. Moreover, the present practice is a dangerous one. Customs officials should not arbitrate in these cases. They should be dealt with by those who have no other end to serve than the due administration of justice. I venture to say that hardly a member of the Victorian public knew what firms paid the £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 to which I have referred.",24

In another, seventeen cases of goods were entered as containing linens and calicos, but packed in Ithe middle were valuable silks-agai n the mistake of a clerk 1 That incident occurred in South Australia many years ago, and the firm involved was supposed to be a reputable one.",25

160,Mr FISHER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Certainl y not. I do not think that there is any limit to our right to deal with Customs frauds, no matter when they occurred. The Government will accept its own responsibility, as wallas that of any of its predecessors, in dealing with cases of fraud that are discovered, and seeing that offenders arebrought to justice. There are, however,, cases where fraud cannot be proved-where, , indeed, there has been no attempt to defraud-and they are dealt with by theCollectors of Customs. I once saw in the hands of the late Mr C. C. Kingston thedr'aft of a Bill by which he intended to bring into operation the very machinery now in force for dealing with minoroffences. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Hume should havemade this wide charge without adducing any proof of it ; but, as the Minister of Trade and Customs has said, honourable members will have an opportunity, as far as' possible, to inspect the departmental papers, and, where wrong has been done,, action will be taken.

Notwithstanding that statement, we now find on these Estimates items totalling .£15,300 to reimburse the States the cost of administering, not only the Commerce Act, but the Bounties Act, for which ,£800 is provided, and the Australian Industries Preservation Act, for which £ 2 , 0 0 0 is set apart. If this is to be continued, I do not know where our expenses will end. I repeat that the late Government were not in a position to administer the Commerce Act, and that they were compelled to depend to a very large extent on officers of the States to assist them in that work. Last year, £ 1 2 , 0 7 7 was paid to the States in respect of the cost of carrying out the provisions of the Act, and it seems to me that the late Government did not display that activity which might have been expected of it in dealing with trusts and monopolies under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I enter my protest against this piling up of expenditure in respect of Acts which ought not to have been placed on the statute-book if the Commonwealth Government were not prepared to administer them. Mr W, H . IRVINE - This item of £ 1 2 , 5 0 0 seems to be a large amount to pay in respect of the cost of carrying out the provisions of one Act.",25
163,Mr TOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Parramatta) [6.8] - As the honourable member for Flinders has just interjected, £ 1 2 , 5 0 0 is a large sum to pay to reimburse the States the cost of carrying out the provisions of one Act ; and from all I can hear, the administration of that Act is not giving satisfaction to exporters of produce. seems to be widespread complaint against the way in which it is being administered by the Central authorities. We pass Acts of Parliament, ancl, I am afraid, set out to administer them without pausing to inquire what will be the result of our administration. A week or two ago, I attended a deputation of fruit-growers which waited on the then Acting Minister of Trade and Customs, Senator Best, and preferred a request that the administration of the Act, so far as it applied to fresh f r u it and fresh produce generally, should remain in the hands of the States. In stance after instance was cited in which frui t left here for London in a sound condition, and on arriving at its destination was found to be rotten, although packed in cases bearing the Government brand "" Sound."" Honourable members will see what that may do, and is doing, according to the statements of reliable members of the deputation, for our reputation abroad. Every one knows, for instance, that certain diseases affecting the skins of oranges and other citrus fruits may develop on the voyage Home. An orange or a lemon may leave here in a comparatively clean condition, and arrive in an absolutely bad condition at the Other end of the world. For instance, bitter pip in apples is a very serious disease, which is puzzling the best brains of the world as to its origin and nature, and is ruining many of our orchardists.",26
164,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,A deputation requested that a Bureau of Agriculture should be established for the purposes of scientific investigation.,26
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I was with that deputation, which asked for a special inquiry, in view of the fact that the best investigators of the world confessed themselves in a difficulty as to the origin of the disease. Apples may arrive in London ruined by this disease, and still the boxes are marked "" sound.""",26
166,Sir PHILIP FYSH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And the apples are sound when they leave Australia.,26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That may be, and the same' applies to other fruits and diseases!. Yet, we are guilty of the consummate folly of branding, the fruit "" so u n d "" . ; and I am. told that this is affecting our trade very adversely, not only in London, but all over the Continent. The Minister will promise nothing beyond that he will make inquiry There - that seems to be the best he can think of doing.",26
168,Mr WATSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I remember when the honourable member himself was a very "" p r o m is in g "" Minister in New South Wales.",26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I dare say, though I do not know exactly to what the honourable member is referring. I know that there were a great many problems which I could not solve, and I did not, as some heads of Departments do, pretend to solve them. However, the present system is enough to destroy our reputation and business, as was proved conclusively by some gentlemen who came from London on the deputation referred to. A ll we ask is that the Minister shall exercise some discretion.",26
170,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,'What does the honourable member suggest-that the fruit should be certified sound at the time of examination ?,27
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I say that it is absurd to brand fruit ""sound,"" when we cannot possibly know what will happen to it during a six weeks' voyage.",27
172,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,-The honourable member thinks that fruit ought not to be within the provisions of the Commerce Act?,27
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I think this matter ought to be left to the States, the officials of which know more about the condition of fruit than the Federal 'officials possibly can. At any rate, as to fresh fruit, the branding might be altogether stopped.",27
174,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It should be inspected all the same.,27
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have no objection to inspection under the Commerce Act, inspection being one of the objects of that measure; but in this connection, again, I think there is a lot of nonsense. For instance, when some of the delegates from New South Wales went to the Victorian markets in Melbourne, they saw the inspectors, not content with looking at the fruit inside the case, and inferring that it was sound, tipping all out on the floor, and, after examining it, packing it again. I venture to say that the repacking was not done with as much care as the original packing, and must result in a great deal of injury to the business that the Act is intended specially to guard.",27
176,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The examination of one or two specimens would not be a thorough examination.,27
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I venture to say that a skilled man could open a box of oranges, and, after looking at it, fairly judge the entire contents.",27
178,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable member is assuming an honesty that does not exist.,27
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Not at all ; it would be easy to a skilled and practical man. This tumbling about is a way to injure fruit and, so far as I can see, the present procedure must result in damaging the business. There are similar rircumstances, I believe, in the case of butter. A rancid taste may be developed on the voyage, though the butter may have been perfectly sweet when despatched. It is we'll known that much of the taint in butter develops on the ship, or some days after the examination has taken place; and I think we might do a little in this respect to help the growers and producers of Australia. I should like the Minister to promise to look into this very important matter practically, as it affects the growers of fruit all over Australia. The honourable gentleman will find that in his own State there is very strong feeling about the clumsy and unskilful way in which the whole business is conducted.",27
180,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,There must be some supervision by experts.,27
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"What I am pointing out is that an ex/pert cannot guarantee that an apple which is sound when despatched, will be sound when it reaches London.",27
182,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,But an inspection is of value in rejecting fruit which is bad before it is sent on the voyage.,27
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I am not talking so much about the inspection as the branding. Fruit is guaranteed sound here so far as is known; and there it seems the matter ends.,27
184,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,It seems to me that there ought to be some mark to show that there has been inspection.,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But how can it be guaranteed that the fruit will be sound six or eight Weeks hence? I ask the Minister to exercise a little common sense, and not subject the Department to ridicule in other parts of the world, and our growers to inconvenience and damage.",27
186,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Fawkner) [6.19] This is a very important matter; and I should like to know from the Minister what is the total cost of the administration of the Commerce Act. We are told that ,£12,500 has to be. paid as reimbursements to States officials. It is proper that our exports should be thoroughly examined, so that they may sell to the best advantage in the markets of the world; and to that end the duty should be performed, not partly by the States and partly by the Commonwealth, but by one or the other-onl y one authority ought to be responsible. Divided authority always leads to trouble. Perhaps it would be better to leave the whole of the work in the hands of the Commonwealth, which could do it very well. It seems a great pity to have the work partly done by the States and partly by the Commonwealth.",27
187,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The work is all done under the authority of the Commonwealth; but we pay States officers for doing our work.,28
188,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I did not understand that that was the case. I understood that some of the export work was done by States officers. Does the total set down here cover the whole cost of administering the Act?,28
189,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"There is an additional expenditure of about .£1,000 for our own officers.",28
190,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"For such an important business as the inspection of exports, a sum of £12,500 is not excessive. But I should like to see the Commonwealth wholly in charge and thoroughly responsible.' Why should we be dependent upon States officers?",28
191,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Simpl y because we do not employ them for the whole of their tune.,28
192,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I was under the impression that we spent a very large sum over and above the .£12,500. amount is not excessive. As to the inspection of fruit referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta, the Minister might well take a note of the criticism that has been offered. The Commonwealth brand ought to be above reproach. No rotten fruit branded by the Commonwealth should be offered for sale in any part of the world. If the Minister could make arrangements to have certain exports inspected again in London, it would be a good thing. To do so might entail a great deal of extra machinery, and might require looking into. But I endorse what the honourable member for Parramatta has said, and agree that the subject is worthy of inquiry. I notice the sum of ,£2,000 on account of the 'administration of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I suppose that expenditure is occasioned by the law suit with the shipping companies.",28
193,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Partly .,28
194,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"We shall be luckv if we get off with an . expenditure of £2,000. I am afraid that the outlaywill be larger than that before the matter is disposed of. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [6.23]. - The item under consideration is one concerning which the Committee are entitled to have a little more information. In interjecting that the sum was a large one, I did not mean to indicate my opinion that £12,500 would be a large sum of money for the effective carrying out of the policy of the inspection of our goods for export. But, as the leader of the Opposition has pointed out, there are instances in which the operation of that Act is not only ineffective, but positively mischievous. Would it not be possible to give the Committee more details with regard to this expenditure?",28
195,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,As to the expenditure in the different States?,28
196,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Not so much with regard to the expenditure in the different States, as with respect to the different kinds of exports upon which the money is expended-the amounts for the inspection of butter, fruit, and other commodities. We should also have some information as to the particular work which is done by States officers. I agree with what has been said by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, that the administration of Federal functions by States officers, when it can be avoided, is This unsatisfactory. There are certain functions that it is more economical to perform through the instrumentality of States officers.",28
197,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The cost would be enor- mous if we did not, in some instances, avail ourselves of the help of States officers.",28
198,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am not condemning the practice; there are certain functions that have to be performed, practically and economically, through State officers. But I think that in those cases it is highly desirable that this Committee should be given the fullest information as to the particular class of work that is done by each class of officer, and the proportion of time taken up in any particular class of work-not , of course, in minute detail. The Committee should have a great deal more information about the way in which the work is carried on, because we are dealing, not with officers of the Federal Government responsible to our own heads of Departments, but with the officers of the States. We ought, in other words, to have some definite information as to what we are paying for.",28
199,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Federa l work is being done by States officers in other Depart-' ments than the Department of Trade and Customs. It is done in the Home Affairs Department and in the Treasury.,28
200,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The system runs through several of the Departments. In those Departments in which, the Commonwealth is availing itself of the services - of whole of it. States officers, it would be desirable that the Committee should have presented to it in greater detail information as to the nature and amount of the work actually so done.",29
201,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [6.28] - The principal lines of exports that are inspected at present are butter, leather, fruit, game, seeds, plants, and meats of all kinds. The amount of the expenditure is £12,500. In addition to that, there is an expenditure of about £1,000 paid to our own officers in respect of the same class of work. It would be impossible for the Commonwealth, under present circumstances, to have the whole of the work done by its own officers. For reasons of economy we utilize States officers, and pay them for the work. I have not the details of the work before me at the present time, but honourable members must know that it is so extensive that the expenditure naturally runs into a good sum. I am aware, of course, that the opinion is held by a good many growers that the work of inspection should not be done by the Government at all. But that is a point of view which affects the policy of the Act itself, and not the administration of it.",29
202,Mr WH IRVINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Not necessarily, because the Act is administered by regulation, and the regulations can be amended.",29
203,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I admit that.,29
204,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Does the Minister think it wise, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that ,the Government brand should be put on articles to indicate that they are prime, when, as a matter of fact, they are not?",29
205,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I take it that a person who buys fruit that bears the Government brand knows that it is intended to indicate that the fruit was sound at the - time the brand was put on the box. It can indicate nothing more than that. I have heard the tanners state that the branding has been of the utmost benefit to their trade. That statement was made at the tanners' dinner recently. I believe that when the whole of the exporters come to know more of the administration of the Commerce Act, they will not think it hurtful to their interests.

211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"My point is that these are additional Departments which the Federation is setting up, and we should know whether they are to do work which is now being done by the States or something in addition. We appear to be duplicating work which is now being done by the States Governments, and it was understood that the transfer of these Departments to the Commonwealth would be accompanied by a. reduction in State expenditure.",29

We were given to understand that the coordination by the. Commonwealth of work hitherto done by the States would lead to greater economy and efficiency. I am afraid that that has not been the case up to date, ancl the question is, how far we should go in multiplying these agencies, if nothing is being done to relieve the taxpayers, who are the same all the time, of expenditure which now takes place under the States.

216,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.50] - I believe that New South Wales is the only State that has hitherto made any provision for a Fisheries Department, and the expert official of the New South Wales Department, Mr Dannevig, has been appointed Director of the Commonwealth Department. Whether the New South Wales Government will duplicate that office I do not know. It is not within my province, I think, to suggest either that they shouldor should not do so. The trawler is nearing completion, and will, I believe, be ready to be put into commission at the latter end of January or the beginning of February next. Applications have been advertised for to fill the positions of master, first and second mate, first and second and junior engineer, and three fishermen, and it is expected that these positions will be filled this_week. The work to be undertaken by the trawler, the investigation of the fisheries around our - coast, is being undertaken at the desire of a majority of the members of this Committee.

I believe that no State Government ever had a trawler to carry out an investigation of the fisheries outside the territorial limits of the State. That is the work intended to be carried out by the Commonwealth trawler, and I hope it will prove successful. If any question had been asked in connection with the vote for "" Analyst,"" I should have been able to inform the Committee that the work has been previously paid for under different headings, by the Central Commonwealth staff or by the Victorian State Department.",30
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Parramatta) [7-55]-- I am afraid the Minister did not grasp my point. His reply proceeded on the assumption that this sub-Department is being set up merely for the purpose of trawling.,30

223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"As I understand the matter, the Department will have very much wider functions. Surely we have not engaged Mr Dannevig at £600 a year merely to undertake the work of trawling? I take it that it is intended to set up a complete and scientific Fisheries Department. There have been such departments in most of the States.",30
224,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not think there is such a Department in Victoria. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.'-There is a very efficient Department of the kind in New South Wales, with hatcheries and all the necessary equipment. Are we going to undertake similar work under Federal control? There should be Federal hatcheries, and we should proceed under the Federal aegis to equip and control a scientific Fisheries Department of the Commonwealth.",30
225,Mr CARR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Are these not proposals which the Director of Fisheries should rti3.1cG ?,30
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Ye s j and I think that before any money is voted we should have a report presented from the Director.,30

230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am not saying that we should not. I am complaining that we have no report from him as to the scope of the operations to be undertaken by this Federal Fisheries Department. It is quite a mistake to suppose that we are setting up this Department merely to trawl outside of territorial waters. We are, I hope, setting up what will be a fullyequipped scientific Department, which will busy itself with the acclimatisation of various fish, their breeding and distribution throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and the study of their habits, with a view to making our river as well as our coast fisheries of value. Good work has been done in New South Wales in the stocking! of suitable streams with various trout ova to provide a supply of edible fish in the interior. I can conceive of no more useful work which a Fisheries Department could undertake. AVe are asked to vote ;£3o74> which includes the salary of the Director of Fisheries, in the absence of any scheme for the Department having been made public, so far as I am aware. The trawling which is to be undertaken is. I believe, merely an incident in the work of the Department. I hope that the periment will be successfully undertaken. But even if it should fail, what then? Surely we shall have a Federal Fisheries Department which will have important functions to discharge in regard to the whole of our Australian fisheries ! I say, therefore, that the Minister might very well ask the Director of Fisheries to submit to him a scheme of operations, so that he may know what is to be the scope of the Department, and whether it is to dovetail in with the excellent work which is now being undertaken by some of the States, or whether it is to supersede that work. A Federal Fisheries Department should occupy very much the same relation towards the State efforts in a similar direction as the Federal Agricultural Bureau will , I hope, occupy towards the States Agricultural Bureaux. There is a Federal function to be discharged, and its discharge need not necessarily clash with the performance of State functions. So far as that function relates to the whole of Australia, and to fish in general, there ought to be Federal and not State control of the industry. Therefore, I should like to see a sketch prepared by the Director of Fisheries of what he regards as the proper scope of a Federal Fisheries Department. We ought to entirely rid our minds of the idea that the only function of this Department is to trawl in the deep seas outside our territorial waters. If properly directed, I maintain that this Department will do its best work in regard to edible fish in inland waters. At the same time, we can drag the sea for the purpose of ascertaining. whether the industry can be developed in deeper waters. We are giving the Director of Fisheries a very good salary to begin with, and I venture to say that, at theearliest possible moment, we ought to know what are to be the functions of the Department.",31
231,Mr CROUCH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Corio) [8.0] - I would point out to the leader of the Opposition, that the Department has already decided upon the scope of the work that Mr Dannevig will be called upon to perform. Although no statement has been made in this House regarding it, the plan which the Department has in view was clearly indicated when applications were invited in the Commonwealth Gazette for the position of Director of Fisheries. The adexvertisement in that publication enumerated the qualifications whiich applicants must possess, and these covered every one of thefunctions which the honourable member for Parramatta thinks should be discharged by the Department. Applicants were required to possess a knowledge of the habitsof fresh and salt water fish, of the kinds of fish that can be acclimatised in Australia, of our estuaries in which fish chiefly spawn, and of suitable places for the establishment of hatcheries. Ailthat we are asked to assent to to-night, however, is expenditure in connection with trawling experiments.",31
232,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Calare) [8.3]. - The leader of the Opposition has rendered a service to the Committee by raising the point to which he has directed attention. It seems - to me that we require more information as to the scope of the work of the Fisheries Department. These Estimates merely provide for a very small professional staff and for a trawler. They do not make any provision for the development of the fishing industry in other directions, such as ihe establishment of hatcheries or the importation from oversea of fish which may be deemed suitable fo Australian waters. The suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta that ithe Government should open up negotiations with the States Governments, with a view to ascertaining the extent to which they are prepared to co-operate with the Department in the development of the 'fishing industry, is a good one. I recognise that the Commonwealth can accomplish very much more in this connection than it is possible for any State to accomplish. If it be possible for us to arrive at an understanding with the States as to what are .the functions of the Commonwealth and of the States respectively, I think it is desirable that that course should be adopted. Perhaps New South Wales has developed .the fishing industry more than has any other State. I am aware that Tasmania has done a good deal in this direction; .but it must be recollected that New South Wales has devoted special attention to it, so much so that they brought out from the - Old Country an expert who is now at the head of our Department. A considerable amount of work has been done in that State, but the authorities have experienced difficulty in dealing with the trawling question and cognate matters. So far as I could gather, it was the desire of the State - Government that the Commonwealth should take this matter in hand and deal with it. It has been prepared to assist the Commonwealth to that extent, but to what extent it is prepared to relinquish to the - Commonwealth the work which it has in hand, and to what extent the other States who are engaged in this work may be prepared to go in the same direction, no one seems to know. Now that we have established a Department we should arrive at an understanding with the States as to what are to be the respective spheres of the Commonweailth and the States, and have a clear-cut policy with respect to our own functions. It would be advisable for the Minister to obtain from the Director an annual report as to the work done and contemplated, and publish it for the information of honourable members prior to the consideration of the Estimates. The mere publication of a bald statement with only imperfect information which may be elicited from the Minister, is scarcely sufficient for their guidance.",31
233,Mr STORRER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Bass) [8.81-In Tasmania we have a Fisheries Commission, which has been doing very useful work for manv years by placing fish in different streams and lakes. Only this week some accommodation houses were opened at the Lakes. Altogether, Tasmania is doing very good work, and now that the Commonwealth has obtained the services of an expert, no doubt that State will be quite willing to ask for his advice on any question which may arise. He will be a very useful officer in Australia, and, perhaps, the means of stirring into activity some States which have not yet taken any action in this direction. I assume that it will not be necessary for New South Wales to employ an officer in the'place of Mr Dannevig,"" because, no doubt, his services will be readily placed at the disposal of any State which may need his ' advice. In Tasmania we have many enthusiasts who take a keen delight in providing good fishing in waters and streams in which previously there were practically no fish. I am very pleased that the Commonwealth has engaged an expert, and I trust that he may be the means of doing much good for the people.",32
234,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [8.10] - In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, I desire to say that I shall do my best to obtain the co-operation of the States in connection with this Department. If they are willing to co-operate, I have not the slightest doubt that they will find that the Federal Department, no matter who the Minister may be, will do its best to reciprocate. But unless they do, the Fisheries Department will not be in a position to experiment in any waters inside the three-mile limit. So far as I know, no State has yet established a saltwater hatchery, although in some States there are private and public freshwater hatcheries. . That is a branch of the industry which should be taken in hand.",32
235,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"What about the hatchery in Gunnamatta Bay, at Port Hacking?",32
236,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I was not aware that a single State possessed a saltwater hatchery. I spoke to a representative of New South Wales, and he did not know that one had been established.",32
237,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Oh , yes.",32
238,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I believe that, with regard to that branch of the industry, New South Wales is more advanced than any .other State. If we can secure the cooperation of the States, we shall be pleased to assist them in every possible way.",32
239,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Nepean) [ 8 . IT ] - I ' agree with the Minister that we ought to get the co-operation of the States. It seems to me that, with the consent of the States, we might take over the saltwater fisheries, and leave the freshwater fisheries and hatcheries to the States. experiments have been made in both New South Wales and Tasmania. that the Commonwealth has taken over from New South Wales Mr. who was certainly one of the most able officers which it had, and who is, I believe, one of the ablest experts on fisheries to be found in any of the States. At the present time there is much to be done with reference to not only saltwater fish, but also freshwater fish. One wonders where all the salmon which are turned out in Ta'smania get to. Whether the salmon are preyed upon by other fish, or whether they are not properly acclimatised, and die when they get into deep water, we are unable to say. In view of the number of fish which are turned out from the Salmon Ponds, the whole sea ought to be swarming with them. But we all know how hard it is to get any salmon. In New South Wales the authorities have conducted a good many experiments, especially in reference to trout and pike, in running streams, and, therefore, they have acquired a considerable amount of practical experience. time to time the waters of the Snowy River have been stocked, principally with trout. I think it has been found that the different kinds of trout do not always live together. In almost every stream in which the rainbow trout have been put, they seem to \ have killed or driven out in some wav the ordinary brown trout. I sincerely hope that - we shall do something more than carry out a few fishing excursions with the trawler. We require to have something more than experimental fishing. There is one question which I think has not been mentioned here, and that is-what is to become of the fish which are caiught during the experimental expeditions. ? If the trawler should bring in a good haul, and the fish were sold, it might be said that the Government were competing with enterprise. But the fish, instead of being placed on the market, could be sent to some of the charitable institutions of the different States. In any case, we need to watch very carefully that, in our efforts to encourage the ' fishing industry on our coast, we do not enter into too severe competition with the fishermen. I hope that, in the case of not only freshwater fisheries, but also saltwater fisheries, we shall have the co-operation, which the Minister has Mr Bowden. said he will welcome, of the States. A few weeks ago, a New Zealand firm offered to lend a trawler to the New South Extensive Wales Government for the payment of the expenses incurred, in order that that GoI am glad vernment might try trawling on their own account within the shallower waters of the Dannevig, three-miles limit. I understand that the offer was not accepted. The Commonwealth should work as much as possible in harmony with the States in this matter. We all recognise that there is a great work to be done, and I hope that when the next Estimates are brought down it will be found that this Department has been much extended, that its scope has been enlarged, and' much useful work done in connection; with it .

The time has come when the work ought to be taken over by the Commonwealth, and I do not understand why thedelay has arisen. From Mr THOMAS BROWN - The States are 1 not very anxious for the Commonwealth to take it over.",33
241,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But the Commonwealth Parliament has passed legislation, and unless that legislation is to be a dead letter, we ought to take control of quarantine. I' recognise that there is some difficulty with the States, especially with New South Wales, with reference to the quarantine properties. The North Head reserve is very valuable, and the State Government wish to keep it as a reserve for public recreation instead of its being a perpetuar quarantine ground. I urge the Minister to f all in with the wishes of the State, if possible, in this matter. The North Head reserve is an ideal spot for a recreation reserve, but not for a quarantine reserve. private The town of Manly is growing further and s further out from the quarantine area, and the public are continually casting longing eyes upon tiiis extra land. They are shut ofF completely at present from any access to the North Head by the quarantine reserve. When the American Fleet entered Sydney Harbor, the State Government, as there were no infectious cases in quarantine, threw the reserve open to the public, who availed themselves gladly of that one opportunity of getting on to the North Head. Tothose on the South Head, the people appeared to be 'swarming over the North Head like ants. We; do not want to saddle this sub-Department with any greater capital cost than we can help. surely find, either in Broken Bay or at some other spot, a suitable reserve for quarantine purposes, which will be much less costly than the North Head reserve would be.",33

243,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am glad to hear it. I may take it , therefore, that the Trade and Customs Department intend to go on with the work of quarantine, and that this is not to be a mere idle vote, as it was last year. I trust that the Government will take into consideration the representations of the State with reference to the North Head reserve. If they can see their way to meet the desires of the State, and at the same time satisfy the requirements of a quarantine ground, I hope that they will do so. l f we had to take over the whole of the North Head at the current market value, we should saddle the Department with a primary cost very much in excess of what ought to be incurred.",34

272,Mr JOHNS ON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Lang) [8.35] - The Patent Office is one of the most important Departments in the Commonwealth, but there appears to be some dissatisfaction as to the manner in which it is administered. Some people doing business with it complain that they suffer greatly by reason of its dilatory methods, and its generally unsatisfactory conduct of affairs. No doubt, a large margin must be allowed for personal irritation and resulting exaggeration; but, on the face of these strictures, an explanation of the increases in salaries should be given. It is strange been that the deputy commissioner and chief Some examiner, the examiners, deputy exAp- aminers ' and assistant examiners should the Com- all receive increases, while the lower-paid officers get nothing. the re- Mr TUDOR - Excep t in the case of the Commissioner, these aire ordinary increments under the Public Service Act.",35
273,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"There seems to be a tendency, not only in this Department, but throughout the whole service of the Commonwealth, to grant increases to men already receiving very good salaries, to the detriment of those in the lower grades. I do not .know who is responsible for this; I suppose that the Public Service Commissioner may be said to be nominally responsible, although he has to rely largely upon the recommendations of his subordinates.",35
274,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,He has to take the responsibility for what is done by his officers.,35
275,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"At the same time, we cannot expect one man at the head of the service to make himself familiar with the merits of every case brought before him.

277,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Certainl y not. I say that he has to depend largely, if not wholly, upon the reports of his subordinates, and that they in their turn have to depend upon the recommendations of heads of Departments. Such a thing as favouritism is not unknown in the history of the public services of the world, and some officers may receive advantages to which they are not entitled.",35
278,Mr CROUCH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,How can that be avoided when we have to depend upon men to carry out the work of each Department?,35
279,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not know, but we have to regard it as a possible factor in so far as some of these increases are concerned. Except in special cases where men performing important duties have been underpaid, I think that unless very good reason can be given for these increases year after year, they should not take place while other officers throughout the Public Service, at least equally deserving, are constantly complaining that they do not receive the annual increments to which they think they are entitled. Mr THOMAS BROWN [8-39]--The honourable member for Lang, in speaking of the "" inefficiency "" of the Patent Office, scarcely does it justice. have had dealings with it on behalf of constituents and others interested in securing patents, and have found the officers most courteous and obliging, and prepared at all times to do their best to help inventors. If an inventor has not the money to enable him to employ an agent, the officers are ready to help him ; they are always ready to assist a poor man. I have not heard of any complaint against them, save on the part of certain agents, with whose grievance I have no sympathy. They complain very largely against the office for so simplifying its methods of procedure that people may do business with it without their intervention. The Patent Office has been, and is, doing good work in assisting men with little means at their disposal to patent their inventions, and to obtain the full benefit of them, without the intervention of an agent. The case of the officer to whom I have referred needs to be specially investigated. Unfortunately, there is some friction between him and the Commissioner, or some of the head officers ; but who is responsible for it I do not know. Mr Brown is not connected with me, but he was, for many years, in the New South Wales Patents Office, and earned there the reputation of being an efficient and excellent officer. It is about time the disagreement was settled.",35
280,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Nepean) [8.43] - As one who has had occasion to interview the officers of the Patent Office, I should like to add my testimony as to its efficiency. I have always found die officers most obliging, and, indeed, I do not know of any Government Department which lays itself out as this one does to assist the general public having business dealings with it . The requests made to it are numerous, and often ridiculous. Many of its correspondents are ignorant men, and the officers go out of their way to assist them, and to help all who are not familiar with its procedure. I must express my appreciation of the efficiency of the Department, and of the courtesy and consideration which its officers extend to the general public.",36

Yet, the honourable member says that inventors are afraid to trust the Government. Why this any more than any other GoDoes the honourable member think that the members of this Government would give any inventor's "" show "" away? far as the Patents Commissioner is two concerned, the only people in the counsecret try who ""have him set"" are the patent agents. Whenever one goes about in Sydney, Melbourne, and even in Brisbane, one meets these patent agents who, simply because the Commissioner will not allow them to run his office just as they used to run the Patent Offices in the old State days, ih.ave a grievance against him. The Commissioner is impartial. He occupies a - similar position to a Judge, except that he - requires to possess a greater amount of technical knowledge than a Judge does. I tiave seen inventors in the Office laying their patentable. inventions before him, and know the consideration with which he treats them. But all inventors are not reasonable people. I know one man who thought that he had invented a flying machine. I went down St. Kilda-road to witness a trial of it. I got the machine on to my back. When the inventor startedj the motor, the machine nearly took me up in the air and landed me in a big bush. I almost became the flying machine instead of the apparatus. When be took his drawings to the Patent Office, with the object of obtaining a provisional patent, he wanted to know straight off whether there was anything novel in his invention, and because the Commissioner could not tell him there and then over the counter, he said he would not allow any one to see his plans, and took them off. What does it matter to the Commissioner whether a man's secret, is known to others? He has not a brass farthing of interest in it. All that he does is to tell the inventor whether there is anything novel in his invention. It rests with inventors them-selves to take further steps if they think necessary. Whenever I have taken inventors to the Commissioner, he has assisted them in every possible way. If an inventor were poor, I feel sure that Mr. Townsend would help him in every way. If honourable members are going to attack a man for doing that sort of thing, I do not know what they would praise him for. The Commissioner does all he can to put inventors in the way of obtaining the protection to which they are entitled. That is the reason why the patent agents "" have him set."" Their object is to get fees from inventors. I know Mr Townsend very well, and can, of my own personal knowledge, say that he has given valuable help to inventors. I am sure that the honourable member for Lang would not desire to attack an officer for conduct of that kind.",38
321,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have not attacked any one.  thizes with those who go to him, and does not treat them in a rough off-hand manner. If there is nothing novel in their inventions, he shows them where they have failed. That is the reason the patent agents do not like him. They want him to be removed, because it is their business to draw fees from inventors.",39

He has a peculiar talent for inventing things about the Labour Party. I am sorry that he is unable to get a patent for them. I feel satisfied that if the honourable member for Lang will inquire, he will find that the only reason why patent agents attack the Commissioner is because he will not allow them to run the Patent Office so as to bring grist to their mill.",39
323,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Lang) [9.5] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Maranoa should have suggested that I have attacked any officer. I have done nothing of the kind. I do not know the Commissioner, or any one of the officers in the Patent Office, personally. But as certain complaints were brought under my notice, I felt it was my duty to mention them. I am very pleased indeed to have listened to the statements of the honourable member for Maranoa^ who appears to have been acting in the capacity of parent agent for various people, and am glad to hear his version as to the manner in which inventors whom he has introduced to the Department are treated. But we all know that members of Parliament are usually treated courteously by the officers of the several Departments. It would not pay the officers to ""do otherwise. It would not be wise for them to treat otherwise members of Parliament, who have control over the purse and the voting cf their salaries.",39
324,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It is not members of Parliament, but inventors who are treated in that way.",39
325,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am not suggesting that because members of Parliament are treated courteously by the officers of these Departments it necessarily follows that the outside public are not treated in that way. But I say that, even if officials were disposed to be abrupt in their dealings with the public, they would hesitate to mete out the same treatment to those who have the voting of their salaries, because they would feel that they might be putting a rod into pickle for their own backs. My point is that we cannot invariably gauge the official treatment of the general public by the official treatment of members of Parliament. I do not know these officers personally, I am not actuated by any personal feeling, nor do I take any responsibility for the accusations of discourtesy which have been made. Such complaints have been made by patent agents, and by persons who are not patent agents. The complaint of the latter appears to be that when they wish to deal directly with the Department, there has seemed to be a desire on the part of the officials that they should employ an agent to represent them.",39

The total vote shows a large crease upon last year's expenditure. For gance. instance, the vote for "" Office requisites, exclusive of writing-paper and envelopes,"" shows an increase of £100. Then there is an item, "" Account, record, and other books, including cost of material, printing, and binding,"" which apparently remains about the same every year, but there is an additional item "" Other printing,"" for which a vote representing an increase of no less than £-1,000 is asked. That surely requires some explanation ? We should"" know what this "" Other"" printing"" comprises. We are in the place of stewards of the public, and owe something to those whom we represent in the scrutiny of this expenditure.

340,Mr JOHNSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,To what are those arrears due? Are they the result' of the employment of an insufficient staff? Is the Department so undermanned that it cannot perform the year's work within the year?,41

Even in a small, though important, sub-Department like the Patent Office, it seems that we cannot get rid of this familiar item. In my judgment, it is high time that the system of employing temporary assistance was abolished, so far as it is possible to abolish it. It is one of the curses of our Commonwealth Departments. Honourable members are constantly being appealed to by persons who desire to secure temporary positions in the various Departments. The trouble has assumed the proportions of a gigantic evil. What do temporary assistants know about patents work ? Are these employees merely assistant clerks? "" Temporary assistance,"" ""other printing,"" "" miscellaneous,"" and "" incidental expenditure "" are all practically n.e.i. items, the aggregate expenditure in connection with which is more than £[6,000 for the year. That is a very large sum to ask Parliament to vote for the Patent Office in the absence of information as to how it is to be expended. I think that we should get more information about these items, seeing that they recur so frequently throughout the Estimates, and assume formidable proportions even in the case of the smallest Department.

A reply was sent on 30th August stating that this timber was dutiable at is. 6d. per 100 superficial feet (Item 303 (a))- A shipment of case-boards for the manufacture of 25,000 fruit cases consigned to the Producers' Union, Perth, arrived at the end of September, 1907, and entry was passed in accordance with wire received from Central Office, viz. :-Ite m 303 (a)-is . 6d. per 100 superficial feet. TheCollector, Western Australia, demanded duty under Tariff Item 303 {d) at 2s. 6d. per ioosuperficial feet, and on reference to this office it was ascertained that a mistake had occurred in the Central Office through the misreading of a Tariff item. The Producers' Union then made representations to. the Department asking to be recouped the loss sustained through the incorrect information given. Full inquiries were made, and it was ascertained that the company, immediately on receipt of the telegram, sent circulars to their customers quoting their price, including the lower rate of duty. It appeared, also, that the importers on payment of higher duty could not and did not increase the price of boxes, and upon the adjustment of accounts in connection with the shipment it was found that they made a loss on the 25,000 cases entered for home consumption of ,£72 2s. 3d. In view of all the circumstances the Minister decided to provide that amount on the Estimates to recoup the importers for the loss sustained by them. This, of course, was done by a previous Minister, but I have no doubt I should have taken precisely similar action.",45

When the Tariff was under discussion, I drew particular attention to the interpretation of a certain item; and when I stated that the Department had misinterpreted the Act, the then Minister of Trade and Customs contradicted me.

No one can have any idea of the variety and number of the questions which have to be met and dealt with by the Department of Trade and Customs. On the whole, I consider that the work is very well done indeed. It goes without saying that if there is a matter of doubt, the question of revenue is not lost sight of by the officers. I am particularly pleased that wheln a mistake is. made the Department so readily acknowA Government official too often takes up an infallible attitude, and if he makes a mistake thinks that there is all the more reason for sticking to it.
