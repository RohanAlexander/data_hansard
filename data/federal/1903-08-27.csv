Petitions received. FEDERALCAPITAL SITE.",12
1,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,I desire to know from the Minister for Trade and Customs whether there is Jiny truth in the rumour that Ministerial intimidation - exercised in connection with the conclusions arrived at by the Commission appointed to report upon the Federal Capital 1,13
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not know to what the honourable member is referring. I know of no intimidation whatever in connection with the report of the Commission. - Certainly none has been exercised by me.,13
3,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"What the honourable member means, I suppose, is-whethe r there was any suggestion to theCommissioners as to the way in which they should frame their report ?",13
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Certainl y not. There was no conversation or suggestion of any kind.,13
5,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"In view of the rapidly decreasing opportunities for the completion of important business, and of the emphatic statement of the Prime Minister that he intended to ask the House to make a final selection of the Federal capital site during this session, will the right honourable gentleman state when preliminary action will be taken in connection with that matter 1",13
6,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I shall give notice of the resolutions relating to the selection of the Eederal capital site as soon as I can do so consistently with their caref u l preparation, but it must be understood that a reasonable time must elapse after notice has been given before they can be discussed. Owing to the long time that was necessarily occupied in the preparation of the report, certain other important matters, with the course of which I cannot interfere, have in the meantime claimed the attention of the House, but that does not in any way affect my determination to give Parliament an opportunity of deciding the question, and to ask it to do so.",13
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When will that?be?,13
8,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"As soon as possible. I cannot name the exact day or hour. HONORARY MINISTE R. . Mr Mahon - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been directed to a paragraph which appeared in an Adelaide newspaper respecting the disclosure of the name of the honorary Minister who is to be appointed to succeed the Vice-President of the Executive Council ? The paragraph has reference to Senator Playford, and contains the following statement :has been Tho old gentleman, possibly under the impression that he was having a confidential chat with a fellow Federal member, blabbed out the news to SyLangdon Bonython during a train journey from Melbourne on Friday last. That cute newspaper proprietor jumped from the train at Ararat, wired the news to his confidential man in Melbourne, with instructions to return the information to Adelaide. This accounts for the Advertiser being the only Australian daily to publish the tit-bit on Saturday morning, and, at the same fcime, the double wiring will give Bonython a loophole to escape having betrayed a confidence, or taken advantage of other papers with which be runs in double harness in the matter of Federal informafcion. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister will make inquiries into this matter ? Honourable members connected with newspapers do not desire to be considered as capable of betraying the confidence of their fellow members.",13
9,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"In the first place, I may say that I have never seen in any newspaper a, description of Senator Playford as an ""old gentleman,"" and I do not think he is one. In the next place, I think I must abstain from taking any part in investigating private conversations of the kind referred to. At a later stage",13
10,Sir LANGDONBONYTHON,Unknown,I should like to state that I deny absolutely having sent any telegram based upon information furnished to me by Senator Playford. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION .,13
11,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether there is any truth in the stateuients which are continually appearing in the newspapers that he is making some important changes in the administration of the Department; and, if so, what is the nature of the changes 1",13
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not responsiblefor all theparagraphs which appear in the newspapers. The Customs Department is a large one, and I wish to make myself thoroughly acquainted with it before I take any action. I might make some slight alterations, but, in doing so, I intend to be extremely careful that the revenue is protected in every way, and that fraud is punished.",14
13,Mr BATCHELOK,Unknown,Do I understand the I Minister to say that he is not making materia] changes in the administration ?,14
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not in the position to say what alterations I shall make. I shall administer the Department posedas I think best in the interests of the community. So far as the late Minister for order Trade and Customs is concerned, I have already consulted him upon two or three matters, and I do not wish to do anything that would be strongly at variance with his genera] administration. At the if I can do anything that will work no harm, but will confer benefit, I shall not hesitate to take action. IRON BONUS COMMISSION.",14
15,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeJ. When will the Iron Bonus Commission's report be published ? 2. Is it intended to deal with the question this session ?",14
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The answers away to the honourable member's questions are :1. The Chairman of the Commission states House so early. that the report will be printed within the next fortnight. 2. This question cannot be after the report has been received and considered. NARRABRI - WALGE TT MAIL reading,14
17,Mr CRUICKSHA NK,Unknown,"the Postmay master-General, wpon notice I. Is he aware that the Narrabri-Walgett mail service has been running in an irregular manner for over six months ? 2. Have the contractors been fined each time they were late; if not, why not? 3. Iffcheyhave been fined, have these been remitted; if so, why so? 4. Arefchecontractors on this line allowed to run late every moil; aud, if so, what is the reason ?",14
18,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The reply to the honourable member's questions is as follows: The information is being obtained from a neighbouring State, and necessitatesfchedelay of a reply to a future day. ELECTORAL DIVISIONSBILL .",14
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown, I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill relatingto elections. need only say that this Bill deals with theany boundaries of the electoral divisions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented and read a first time. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) proThat the second reading offcheBill be made aa of the day for tomorrow.,14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I should like to ask the Minister in charge of this Bill if he intends to take the second same time, reading tomorrow ?",14
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , if possible.",14
22,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"On the first opportunity, as I said last night.",14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But is there really such a terrible hurry to get this Bill through? I suggest respectfully - that the Minister should postpone the second reading of this. Bill-at any rate until next week.,14
24,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Eo r what reason ?,14
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"For thereason that there are a number of honourable members, who were not aware that any proposal' of this kind would be brought before the",14
26,Sir WILLIAMLYNH,Unknown,"I stated last week that I would introduce the Bill at the earliest, determined until possible moment.",14
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Isubmittha t I am not unreasonable in asking that the second of the Bill should be postponed until SERVICE. next week in order that honourable members have full notice of the intentions oftheGovernment, and may be here and in a position to discuss the measure. I again ask. the Minister to consent to so reasonable a. request.",14
28,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," The fines Minister for Trade and Customs has not answered the very proper request; of the honourable member for Parramatta. Seeing that the honourable gentleman is only today proposing to deal with the electoral divisions for two of the States he might very well leave the consideration of this Bill till next week, in order that honourable members may be given a proper opportunity to consider the decision of the House with regard to those divisions. That would certainly be forwarding' the Bill as rapidly as could have been anticipated. It is not the fault of honourable members that the final division of the States has not been before us sooner, and I am at a loss to understand why action should be taken to rush this measure through. It . is one which ought to receive the full consideration of Parliament. I consider it an extraordinary procedure to propose to hurry on the consideration of the Bill in this way, when no objection has been taken to the preliminary stages. The request of the honourable member for Parramatta is one which should receive consideration, and the Minister for Trade and Customs should reply to the honourable member's suggestion.",14
29,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown," I think the Minister for Trade and Customs might well comply with the request made to him. We are anticipating the result of the decision of the House upon the electoral divisions for two States which have yet to be dealt with. A - number of honourable members are away in Sydney who would, no doubt, desire to speak upon this Bill.",15
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Are we to stop business because a few honourable members are away 1,15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable members who are now away are here as often as the honourable member for Barrier.,15
32,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I do not ask that business should be stopped to suit me.,15
33,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"No doubt the honourable member for Barrier is interested in having this matter settled as soon as possible, but it is not in the interests of the public that it should be settled as rapidly as the honourable member would desire.",15
34,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We desire to deal with the selection of the Eederal capital site.,15
35,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill will be fair to all the States, and will accede to the request made to him. The honourable gentleman has repeatedly stated that there would be plenty of time to bring forward this matter after the proposed divisions of the States had been dealt with.",15
36,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown," After ' the short discussion which has taken place, I think the Minister for Trade and Customs will act wisely in agreeing to the suggestion which has been made. I believe that the honourable gentleman will advance the Bill by adopting that course. The Bill, which so far none of us has seen,, is one in which we all take a very keen interest.",15
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Ver y few take a keen interest in it . Mr G. B. ED WARDS - I feel sure that it will hasten rather than delay the passage of the Bill if the second reading be made an order of the day for an early day next week. I am sure there is no desire on the part of honourable members on this side to delay business.,15
38,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown," I concur in what has been said by previous speakers in opposition to the proposal to rush this business forward. A number of other matters of very great importance appearing on the notice-paper might very well be gone on with in the meantime. This question .of . the division of the States into electorates is one which is attracting very great attention, especially in Ne%v South AVales. The newspapers .in that State are crowded with matter dealing with the subject; various public meetings have been held, and one honourable member of this Housethought fit to resign his seat in order to protest against the action proposed by the Government.",15
39,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,And the right honourable member has been sorry for it ever since.,15
40,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"The facts I have'mentioned ought to be recognised by the Government. When we have such business as the Patents Bill, Naturalization Bill, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Budget debate, and various other matters on the business-paper which may be gone on with in the meantime, what can be the reason for haste in connection with this measure ? I sincerely trust the Government will see their way to adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta.",15
41,Mr MCDONA LD,Unknown, I am rather surprised to hear a New South Wales member object to going on with business because certain honourable members are not present. If we take the average attendance of honourable members we find that the worse attendance is that given by honourable members representing New South Wales. Taking the average attendance the Labour party have a better record than any other party in the House.,15
42,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,I should like to back my attendance against that of the honourable member.,16
43,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I have not missed a sitting this session. It is quite true that during the last session of seventeen months I was ill for two or three days, but I question whether the honourable member for South Sydney can show a better record of attendance than I am able to show.",16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What has this to do with the question ?,16
45,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I was replying to the interjection of the honourable member for South Sydney. The only argument advanced for postponing the debate upon the second reading of this Bill is that certain honourable members who are paid to be here are not here. Another reason why I am surprised at the action taken by honourable members coming from New South Wales is, that the - question .of the selection of the Federal capital site, which is of more importance to New South Wales than is this Bill, still remains to be settled.",16
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then why not go on with it ? There is plenty of business to go - on with.,16
47,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Those honourable members are prepared to sacrifice that business. Week after week they go away on the Thursday afternoon, and remain away on the Friday, and there is practically no business done from 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon until the following Tuesday. They now wish to postpone dealing with the Eederal capital site.",16
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No one such a ridiculous suggestion.,16
49,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"That is really the position of affairs, and I , for one, desire that thp question of the Eederal capital shall be dealt with.",16
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is news honourable members. ,",16
51,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is not news. I haA-e mentioned that matter in this House - as frequently as has any representative from New South Wales. If we are to postpone business simply because some honourable members desire to return to their homes upon Thursday afternoon, we shall have very little opportunity of disposing of the Federal capital site question during the current session. It appears to me that the request for deferring consideration of this Bill is prompted merely by a desire to secure a bigger pyrotechnic display in connection with the resignation of the leader of the Opposition. I trust that the Bill will be proceeded with tomorrow.",16
52,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown, It seems to me that the great strength of honourable members on the opposite side of the House should induce them to extend a little mercy to those who differ from them on this occasion.,16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They wish to cover this thing up as quickly as possible.,16
54,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown,They enforced their desires in direct opposition to a large number of the representatives of New South Wales in connection with the electoral divisions proposed by the Commissioner who was appointed to prepare a scheme for that State. Now the minority ask for a little time to consider this Bill. It is not as if there were no other business with which we could proceed. It is true that honourable members should be present if possible. But if there is other business which can be transacted,16
55,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,This is the least urgent.,16
56,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown,"Certainly , the consideration of this Bill is not urgent. There is plenty of business which might be proceeded with tomorrow and which honourable members would be quite prepared to transact. There is no necessity to press forward this Bill with such rapidity. I am aware that the big battalions are upon the other side of the House, and, therefore, I think that the Minister might very well accede to the request which has been made. Similarly I ask the leader of the Labour is making party whether he cannot exhibit a little mercy on the present occasion. I make this ad misericordiam appeal to the Government.",16
57,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown," I have been asking from the earliest stage of to the discussion upon the boundaries of the new electorates that this Bill should be introduced, and I desired that it should be proceeded with as soon as possible. I think that it should have been brought in earlier. Seeing that it is absolutely necessary to fix the electoral divisons, it appears to me that we have been wasting time in affirming that we disapprove of certain electoral boundaries. We should have taken trie Bill in hand aud declared the divisions of which we approved.",16
58,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown,Why this hurry now ?,17
59,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"I say that the Bill should have been submitted earlier, but I do not think that the lateness of its introduction should induce us to hurry so much that a fair opportunity will not be allowed to both sides of the House to discuss the measure fully. I am opposed to what has been done, but nevertheless I say to the Ministry-""Do not rush the Bill through with unusual haste."" It is one thing for us to resolve that we do not approve of certain districts which'would have enabled us to take certain steps under the provisions of the Electoral Act. We have carried that resolution. The Government now propose that we shall address ourselves to the question of what shall constitute the new electoral divisions. I do not know whether the Bill is in print, but it does appear to me, seeing that we shall sit rather late to-night and meet very early tomorrow, that we should give fair time for its consideration. I am opposed to the action of the Government in refusing to make any attempt to bring the electoral districts up to-date, but I trust that will not cause them to reject the suggestion, which I throw out in all friendliness, that we should be given the fullest opportunity of considering this matter. Different honourable members attach more or less importance to this question. The leader of the Opposition has given the best proof he can that he attaches very considerable importance to it . I do not think that he has very often asked for a postponement of business, and seeing how absolutely essential it is that he shall take part in the consideration of this question",17
60,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Surely the right honourable member would not have us defer its consideration for three weeks ?,17
61,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,No ; let us wait t ill Tuesday. I understand that the election for the vacancy created by his resignation will take place tomorrow.,17
62,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,What has that to with the matter ?,17
63,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"It has a good deal to do with it. When a man gives proof of his regard for the importance of this subject by resigning his seat and submitting himself to his constituents, he is entitled to ordinary fair play, and I think that the fullest fair play should be extended to him under the circumstances. I do not think the suggestion will commend itself to the general sense of the House that we should depart in any way from the ordinary course, so as to prevent an honourable member from taking that part in the debate which he desires to take.",17
64,Mr WATSON,Unknown, I think that the argument for delay in this matter is so much nonsense.  would not say that if he were upon the other side.,17
65,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"There is no salt involved in this question, and I do not know that the honourable member is particularly qualified to act as judge.",17
66,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,That is rather rough.,17
67,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I intend it to be so. This House had a splendid opportunity of considering the boundaries of the new electorates, and full advantage was taken of it .  member then 1",17
68,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I was absent in my electorate.  was as bad as are other honourable members.,17
69,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am not complaining of what was done in my absence, and I did not desire the debate to be kept open for my personal convenience. I repeat that full opportunity was afforded to discuss the whole of the principles involved in this Bill. Every one was aware that if the electoral divisions recommended by the Commissioners were not approved, some action would be necessary to bring the Electoral Act into harmony with the position thus created. It was well known that if the divisions were not approved, we should require to fall back upon the existing electorates. If this Bill be not carried at the earliest possible date, what will happen t The whole arrangements for printing the electoral rolls for these divisions will be deferred for an indefinite term. I blame the Government for not giving the House an do earlier opportunity of considering this question, and thus arriving at a decision apart from any question of hurry or expedition.",17
70,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"We cannot rush matters when we are doing the right thing, but we can when we are doing the wrong thing.",17
71,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If some decision upon this question is not arrived at very quickly, scores of thousands of electors will be disfranchised.",18
72,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Will a delay from Priday until Tuesday make all that difference?,18
73,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not say that it will. But I do say that we should pass this Bill at the earliest possible moment. So far the electors have had no proper opportunity to enroll themselves in the electorates in which they will eventually be called upon to vote. They cannot possibly know what those electorates. are until Parliament has come to a decision upon the question. Mr TnOiMSON - Whose fault is that 1,18
74,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It is the fault of the Electoral Department. But, altogether irrespective of whose fault it may be, it is our duty to come to an early decision upon this matter. Personally, I do not care what decision is arrived at, but I hold that it should be arrived at speedily.",18
75,Mr WILKS,Unknown," I think that the Minister might very reasonably agree to the many appeals which have been made to him. The honourable member for Bland has argued that, if we do not pass this Bill immediately, scores of thousands of electors will be disfranchised. Apparently we are to understand from his contention that the Electoral Department is in such a state of confusion that, if consideration of this Bill be deferred until Tuesday next, scores of thousands of electors will be disfranchised. That is really a censure of the administration of the Department. But I would point out that a large number of honourable members are absent at the present time. They understood that the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was to be proceeded with. It was believed that the consideration of that Bill would occupy our attention for the remainder of t h t week, and - I consider that indecent haste is being shown by the - Government in springing this measure upon us. That, I am sure, is the view which the public will take of the action of the Ministry. The leader of the Opposition is at present in Sydney, and the Government are seeking to take advantage of his absence. He emphasized his disapproval of the course adopted by the Government in dealing with the electoral divisions of the States by resigning his seat in this House, and he is now before his constituents, who, I am satisfied, will support the action taken by him. We have allowed the Bill to be read a first time, and I think 'that the second reading might very well be postponed until next week. It is a most unusual course for a Government to propose that the second reading of a Bill shall.take place on the day following its introduction. I trust that the Minister will allow the further consideration of this measure to stand over until next week. If he insists upon pressing it forward at the present stage, he will give colour to the suggestion of ""jerrymandering "" which has been made in connection with this matter. The right honourable member for South Australia said some days ago that it was a mere waste of time to discuss the resolutions relating to the proposed distributions, and that a Bill should first be brought before us. That assertion has been amply justified, and I trust that the Government will grant this reasonable request to allow the further consideration of the Bill to stand over until next week.",18
76,Mr R EDWARDS,Unknown," I rise for the purpose of supporting the request made by the honourable member for Parramatta. To my mind, there is a tendency on the part of the Government to rush certain legislation through this House with unnecessary haste. The Bill could not have been introduced today but for the action of the House in granting special leave to the Minister to give notice of the motion last night, and I think that the Government should accede to the reasonable request that its further consideration be allowed to stand over until Tuesday next.",18
77,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown, I trust that the Minister will see his way clear to allow the cpnsideration of this Bill to stand over until Tuesday next.,18
78,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member desire to see the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill become law this year 1,18
79,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"Certainl y I do. But I contend that it is open to us to proceed with the consideration of that measure today and tomorrow. We are familiar with the tactics of the Opposition, and we know that if we proceed at once with the consideration of this Bill they will "" stone-wall "" it.",18
80,Mr WILKS,Unknown,No; we shall raise reasonable objections to it .,18
81,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"I accept the honourable member's correction. If the consideration of this measure be forced upon the House at this stage no progress will be made. On the other hand, if we conciliate the Opposition by postponing its further consideration until Tuesday next I feel satisfied that all parties in the House will work harmoniously together, and that we shall probably pass the measure after a discussion extending over only half-an-hour, or, at the most, an hour.",18
82,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,We have offered no opposition to the passing of the Bill through its preliminary stages.,19
83,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member that no obstruction has yet been placed in the way of the passing of the Bill, and if honourable members of the Opposition will be prepared on Tuesday next to deal with this matter in a true Christian spirit, I think nothing will be lost by acceding to their request. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have to inform the House that I cannot accede to the request for the postponement of the further consideration of' this measure until Tuesday next.",19
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the second the House. readiug will not be proceeded with tomorrow.,19
85,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"We know that ceri tain honourable members of the Opposition will talk all day, whether we proceed with matter. the second reading tomorrow or on Tuesday next.",19
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Quite so; I think it is just as well that we should give them an opportunity to express their views tomorrow.,19
87,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,We can see through this request.,19
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Opposition have taken up an extraordinary regard to this measure. The leader of the Opposition was the first to suggest that Bil l should at once be introduced to give effect to the proposed electoral divisions.,19
89,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,The Minister did not Act? adopt that course.,19
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have availed myself of the first opportunity suggestion. The right honourable gentleman pointed out that if the resolutions relating to the distribution of the States were agreed to, a Bill would be necessary to legalize the proposed boundaries, otherwise the States might repeal their Acts, and leave us without any divisions. Now that I have introduced a Bill dealing with the question, honourable members of the Opposition take exception to it. In regard to the remarks which have fallen from the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, I would point out that I stated some days ago that the position taken up by the Government was that the first step to be taken by them under the Electoral Act was to submit a series of motions dealing with the proposed divisions. We felt that if we failed to adopt that course it might be said that we were ignoring Parliament, and it was for that reason that the resolutions were submitted. We consider that Parliament, and not the Ministry alone, should deal with a question of such vital importance. It might have been possible to introduce a Bill in the first instance ; but, if we had adopted that course, we should probably have been accused by those who avail themselves of every opportunity to attack the Ministry of a desire to ignore Parliament. All that could possibly be said in regard to the Bill itself has already been urged in connection with the resolutions which have been dealt with by",19
91,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,No .,19
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Everythin g that t is possible for the ingenuity of man to suggest has been said in regard to this,19
93,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,All that might reasonably be said in regard to the Bill has. and already been put before the House.,19
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"E x a c t l y . When the motions dealing with the proposed distributions of some of the States were before the House, it was asserted that nearly all the representatives of New South Wales were opposed to the action of the Government ; but, as a matter of fact, one-half attitude in of them were not.",19
95,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"If the Government had a brought in a Bill before submitting thesemotions to the House, would they not have departed from the provisions of the Electoral",19
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Most decidedly.,19
97,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,But the Minister has- to adopt the departed from the Act.,19
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"We have attempted as far as possible to comply with it. This Bill consists of only three clauses. The first relates to the short title, the seconddeals with the boundaries, and the third relates to the names of the various divisions. Ifc will simply give effect to the resolutionscertain which have been carried.",19
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Tw o Stafces yet remain to be dealt with.,20
100,Sir EDMTJND BAKTON,Unknown,We do not propose to proceed with the consideration of this Bill until the motions relating to the distribution of those States have been disposed of.,20
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The remaining motions will be immediately submitted. The Bil l will give effect to the resolutions which were debated for four days and four nights, «nd nothing more remains to be said in regard to the matter. We were under the impression that there was a very strong desire onfchepart of the House that this Bill should at once become law, and had it not been for the standing orders I should have asked leave to proceed with the second reading at a later stage today. I find, however, that the standing orders will not permit the adoption of that course. It is absolutely necessary that there shall be no undue delay in dealing with this matter, so that the rolls may be printed and circulated, and the revision courts held as soon as possible.",20
102,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"It is an absolute bungle. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Although I "" have done all that I can to expedite the preparation of the rolls it is impossible to complete them nntil the actual boundaries of the divisions are known. I am anxious, and I think that the House should be anxious, to have this matter dealt with. It is not as if I were proposing the introduction of a Bill - containing some fresh matter. It was known last week that this Bill would have to be introduced. The subject with which it deals has already been discussed. Honourable members cannot contend that it is necessary for them to read the provisions of the measure half-a-dozen times to see what is contained in them. The real object of this attempt to secure a postponement is to defer the consideration of the matter until the leader of the Opposition is returned to Parliament. I cannot hold myself responsible for an action which seems to me to be in the nature of a burlesque. Mi . JOSEPH COOK - The honourable memMauger, S. 1 ber's action is much worse than that.",20
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It would be little Cooke, S. W. short of criminal if the Ministry consented Edwards, G-. B. to postpone this legislation because of a Edwards, B. stupid freak which has been perpetrated by Hartnoll, W. the leader of the Opposition, and which is Kirwan, J.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. ELECTORAL DIVISIONS : TASMANIA.",20
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I move That this House approves of the proposed distribution of the State of Tasmania into five Divisions, named Darwin, Denison, Flinders, La Perouse, and Wilmot, as shown on the Map laid upon the Table of the House of Representatives on the 23th August, 1903. I desire to mention that, as in the case of South Australia, this is the first time that Tasmania has been divided into districts. I have heard of no complaints, and I think that perhaps this is mainly due to the fact that the population of the island is evenly distributed. There is a reasonable number of electors in the city of Hobart, and the same remark applies to Launceston. In no case is there any congestion of population such as we find in the capitals of other States. The Darwin division contains 15,134 electors; Denison, 16,220 ; Elinders, 17,314; La Perouse, 16,116; and Wilmot 16,663. I shall be willing to accept an amendment having in view the substitution of some other name for Elinders, because there is already a Elinders division in the State of Victoria.. I do not know whether honourable members representing Tasmania have any name in their minds, but any reasonable proposal will be accepted.",21
107,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,Whic h electorates include Hobart and Launceston respectively ?,21
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall obtain that information for the honourable member presently. The population of Tasmania is fairly distributed, but the large tract of barren country which lies between the head of the Derwent and the West Coast has practically no population. The greater number of the people are clustered around the West Coast, along the North and East Coasts, and along a portion of the South Coast. I am informed that Elinders embraces the town of Launceston, and that La Perouse includes Hobart.",21
109,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"Hobar t is in the Denison division. That shows how much the Minister knows about the distribution. PAIKS. Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have not gone into every particular in connection with .the distribution, and I do not intend to. I know Tasmania perhaps as well as does-any one in this House, but I am not familiar with the names of the new divisions. I believe that the distribution has been carried out in a reasonable manner, that ful l regard has been paid to community of interest, and thatnatural boundaries have been observed as far as possible. It has, of course, been impossible to secure perfect community of interest. A portion of the North-west Coast has been joined to the mining settlements on the West Coast, and the division which includes these has been extended nearly as far as Devenport. The large farming centres between that place and Launceston aud the miners at Beaconsfield are of necessity together. The mining camp to the northeast, as far as George's Bay and Scamander,. and the tin mining fields, as well as the mining fields at Lefroy, have been included with Launceston and Eingarooina. It has been impossible to avoid associating mining and agricultural interests to some extent, and I think that the distribution will befound generally acceptable. I find that a Mr J. Davies, of George Town, made a. suggestion-the only one made-whic h the Commissioner shows was not of any great moment, and could not be carried out.",21
110,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown," I desire to take this opportunity to express my deep regret that the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, who, with hiscolleagues, is very keenly interested in thisdistribution, is unfortunately prevented by bodily infirmity from being present. I am sure that honourable members will join mein that expression of regret. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",21
111,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I am quite sure, from what I know of the right honourable gentleman, and of the districts included in the divisions, that if he were to attempt to make a better distribution, he would fail. I am satisfied, moreover, that as the districts which he has represented previously are embraced in Wilmot, the distibution will meet with his approval. It is gratifying to know that the gentleman who vvas appointed on a former occasion to divide Tasmania into five divisions, and the Commissioner in the present instance, have proved to be sonearly in accord. Mr R. M . Johnston, the able statistician of Tasmania, on a. former occasion distributed Tasmania into five divisions on behalf of the State Government, but he had to work under the electoral law of Tasmania, and with the rolls then in existence. It is gratifying to know that, whilst we have been endeavouring to pay full regard to community of interest and other considerations, Tasmania has been .growing, and that whilst there were only 39,000 electors on the old rolls there are now 42,000 male and 38,000 women voters. The Department may well be congratulated upon the fact that the police officers engaged in the compilation of the rolls have so ably discharged thenduty as to induce 38,000 of the women of Tasmania to enrol themselves. ""When the 38,000 women electors are compared with the 42,000 men on the roll, it is evident that the women of Tasmania will not - have the full voice in political affairs to which their numbers entitle them, because there are quite as many women as men in Tasmania above the age of twenty-one. We may therefore expect that as time goes on the number of women on the rolls in Tasmania will be increased. In so far as regard must be had for community or diversity of interest, Tasmanian representatives will be able to give a certificate that the purposes < of sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Act have been satisfactorily complied with in the divisions proposed. It is impossible to collect communities of interest even in a small place like Tasmania. The horticultural interest, for instance, largely centres round Hobart and the Derwent Valley; but there is also a very large horticultural - district on the fringe of the mining district on the North-west Coast. Again, so far as mining interests are concerned, though we have some 20,000 miners on the West Coast, now represented by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, if - we were to bring together the whole of the mining community, that number would have to be supplemented by 4,000 residents on the Tamar River, in and about Beaconsfield, and in and about George's Bay.",21
112,Mr WILKS,Unknown,A r e they all in torate ?,22
113,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"They are not all - in one electorate. It is impossible to bring together communities of common interest in Tasmania, when regard must also be had, under the Act, to existing electoral boundaries and natural features.",22
114,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,They are scattered like .plums in a pudding.,22
115,Sir PHILIPEYSH,Unknown,"I will not say that, because there are too many of them. They are represented by dense populations where ever they are, and we have at Beaconsfield, in a very small area indeed, a very large number of miners.",22
116,Mr WILKS,Unknown,What about Launceston ?,22
117,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,So far as Launceston is concerned it is-immediately associated with that district.,22
118,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Is Beaconsfield included in it?,22
119,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The district of Launceston, beginning at the Tamar River, takes in some population that belongs to the mining district of Beaconsfield.",22
120,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman think that fair ?,22
121,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,It is as fair a division as could be made.,22
122,Mr HAKTNOLL,Unknown,Launcesto n does not take in Beaconsfield.,22
123,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"It does not take in the whole of it . Then we have the Hobart district, which, all being well, I hope to represent myself, in the district named Denison, and whilst we have a population of 26,000 people in Hobart, we have large suburbs at Glenorchy and Sandy Bay, which are really horticultural districts. It will be found that these are thrown together. If honourable members consider the conditions throughout Tasmania they will admit that it would be exceedingly difficult, while having regard to the physical conditions of the country, the distances people have to travel, and the necessity for having polling places somewhat contiguous, to make a fairer division than has been made by the Commissioner of Lands, Mr Counsel, whose report we have now before us. No doubt Mr Counsel and Mr Johnston, the Statistician of Tasmania, have taken counsel together in the arrangement of the divisions proposed. Some alteration is suggested in the names of the electorates. I think I prefer some of those previously one elecselected. We had Natone, Loyna, and Pateena, and other ' native names, but in this instance we see the influence of the Survey Department upon the names selected. Some attempt has been made to follow the course by which Tasmania has honoured herself in utilizing the names of Lyell, Huxley, Murchison, and others of the celebrated men of old England. Here Mr . Counsel has endeavoured to perpetuate the name of Darwin. I can quite understand why he selected Darwin as the name of one division, and Denison as the name of another, because Denison is the name of a former Governor of Tasmania, who, honourable members will remember, made a name for himself subsequently in India.",22
124,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Why did he select Darwin?,23
125,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I presume it was because Darwin was associated Lyell, Murchison, Huxley, and the other celebrated men whose names are perpetuated on the mountain tops of Tasmania. The name of Plinders has also been selected, and though its use would commemorate the name of the navigator, it would conflict with the name of one of the electoral divisions - of Victoria. I shall suggest a change with respect to that. I think the name of La Perouse was not a happy selection, because we do not wish to recall the reign of terror with which La Perouse was connected, and I should prefer an English name in any case to a foreign name. I know of no way in which we could more honour ourselves in this connection than by perpetuating the name of Sir John Eranklin, who was formerly a Governor of Tasmania, and whose bones now rest in the icy land of Esquimo.",23
126,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"What is wrong with the constitute names of ""Eysh "" and "" Braddon?""",23
127,Sir PHILIPEYSH,Unknown,"I do not think that tliose names would do. The name of Havethe lock is a good old name with distinguished associations from India, whilst Sir John Franklin was associated with the Ad miralty and also with the Governorship Tasmania.",23
128,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"What is wrong with the name of "" Tasma ? """,23
129,Sir PHILIP EYSH,Unknown,"Tasma is the sweetheart of Tasmania. I remind the honourable member that the Island is called Tasmania, and the name is honoured by that selection. We might, I think, very well alter the names of Flinders and La Perouse, and if my colleagues frbrn Tasmania can suggest no better names, I would suggest that we should substitute for the name La Perouse the name of Eranklin, and for by the Posfcmasfcer-Genera.1. Elinders",23
130,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Northcote .,23
131,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Northcot e would be an exceedingly appropriate name, seeing that we shall presently be associated with Franklin is a very appropriate one. Lord Northcote as Governor General of the Commonwealth. I therefore move That the motion be amended by the omission of the words ""Flinders"" and "" La Perouse"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""Northcote"" and "" Franklin.""",23
132,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I think it would bestsuit the convenience of honourable members if this amendment were moved at a later stage, as if moved now it may tend to confine diswith cussion. I have no doubt the Postmaster General will extend the courtesy to honourable members of moving his amendment at a later stage.",23
133,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The liberty of debate will be in no way curtailed by the moving of the amendment at this stage. But I have no doubt that, if any honourable member desires to move an amendment earlier in the motion, the Postmaster-General wil l be ready to give way.",23
134,Mr HARTNOLL,Unknown," I was exceedingly pleased to hear the'tribute of respect paid by the Postmaster-General to the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. I have the satisfaction of knowing that the divisions, as set forth, thoroughly meet with the approval of the right honourable gentlemen, who has been so long identified with our political life. I think that the boundaries recommended as fair adivision of the island State as it is possible to make. When I learned the work of defining the boundaries of new electorates was to be intrusted to Mr E. A . Counsel, the Surveyor-General of Tasmania, and that he was .to have the advantage of the intelligent co-operation of of Mr B..M. Johnston, the Government Statistician, I felt perfectly sure that the representatives of that State would befairly treated in every respect, and that the new electoral divisions from the point of view of population and community of interest would be in accordance with popular opinion. I have known the two gentlemen in question for very many years, and for intelligence and high mindedness I do not tliink that they can be excelled in any community. Concerning thenames of the new electorates, I am thoroughly in accord with the of suggestions that have been thrown out Naturally he is more anxious regarding the southern divisions of the island, and the name which he has suggested and which will perpetuate the memory of Sir John I suggested that the name of Northcote;-and I intend to contest this division-shoul d be substituted for that of Flinders, by which name it is designated in the Commissioner's report. I understand that Flinders is one of the Victorian electorates, and, in my judgment, it would be inadvisable to duplicate the names of electoral divisions. As I have been associated with political life for nearly twenty years, and have been especially identified with Launceston and its surroundings, I thought it was only in the nature of things that I should have the right to suggest that the name of Flinders should be changed to that of Northcote, the name of the first Governor General of the Commonwealth after this Act comes into operation. From that point of view it is an appropriate selection. The father of the new Governor General was for many years one of the leaders of political life in the old country, and the name which he bears has also been associated with the western portion of England for a very long period. Indeed, it is one which is honoured throughout the length and breadth of the Empire. With these few remarks I desire to concur in the suggestions that have been thrown out by the Postmaster-General, and to cordially approve of the various divisions recommended for the State of Tasmania. I believe that they will insure a true representation of the people.",23
135,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," If any evidence were needed of the extraordinary methods which are being adopted in connection with the partial division of the various States into new electorates, it is afforded by the fact that the Minister for Tradeand Customs hassubmitted this proposal totheHouse today. Naturally he is supposed to have thoroughly considered the matter, and to be able to assign good reasons in support of his motion. Yet, as regards the island in which he was born, and of which he knows so much, he cannot tell the localities to which the names which appear in the report of the Commissioner apply.",24
136,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Is he supposed to "" get up"" the whole geography of the island ?",24
137,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Is a knowledge of geography needed when the report of the Commissioner alludes to these divisions by their names ? The Minister has objected to the electorates proposed in various States on the ground that the country districts did not receive representation proportionate to the city constituencies. Yet he comes here today and' acknowledges that he does not know the city electorates which are alluded to in the report of the Tasmanian Commissioner. If this Parliament is prepared to allow the recommendations of Ministers to operate when they display their absolute ignorance of the matter under discussion, it stands upon a lower plane than any Parliament with which I am acquainted. If honourable members will refer to Mr. Counsel's report they will see that thedivisions are alluded to by the names of Darwin, Denison, Flinders, La Perouse, and Wilmot. No other names are given. The Minister had to compare the representation which was given to different parts of theisland State, and yet he is absolutely unable to allocate to the various divisions thenames which appear in that report.' It is surprising that the honourable gentleman after apparently thinking either that the Bill was necessary, or that in accordance with the provisions of the Act, he was required to submit resolutions dealing with the reports of the Electoral Commissioners",24
138,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to discuss the Bill.,24
139,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,Before the electoral divisions have actually been decided we areasked to rush a Bill dealing with them through this Parliament. I intend to show the value of the Minister's objections to thedivisions which were previously proposed. What were the reasons which he advanced in opposition to them ? He declared that the country electorates had not been treated with sufficient liberality.,24
140,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Perhaps it would save the time of the House later on and remove misconceptions if I read the standing order to which I am about to call attention. Standing Order 266 is veiy definite. It saysNo member sball allude to any debate of the same session upon a question or Bill not being then under discussion, nor to any speech made in Committee, except by the indulgence of the House for personal explanation. That standing order expressly precludes an honourable member, not only from quoting, but from making any allusion to, debates, upon any other matter than that which is. under discussion. I cannot, therefore, permit any honourable member to refer to any debate that has taken place previously, either on the Bill which was introduced this afternoon or upon the subject of the electoral divisions for other States, which were decided a week ago.",24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Do I understand, sir, that you make that ruling an absolute one ? If the member for North Sydney wishes to show that in connection with the proposed distribution of Tasmania into electorates a different principle is being adopted from that which was adopted in connection with other States, I take it that he is perfectly - entitled to refer to a previous debate for the purpose of making that distinction clear 1",25
142,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I had to give this same ruling last week in connection - with another debate that took place. The standing order. I have quoted leaves me absolutely no option in the matter. only precludes incidental reference, but any allusion to any previous debate, and therefore I am bound to rule as I have done. I might suggest half-a-dozen ways in which it would be possible for the honourable member to put.before the House what he desires to say ; but it is not for me to do so.",25
143,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,The various motions which have been introduced deal with the division of the Commonwealth into electorates.,25
144,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Eac h State is dealt with separately.,25
145,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"They deal with the division of the Commonwealth into electorates, and I claim that, in considering the proposed division of one portion of the Commonwealth, it is necessary for me, for the purposes of comparison, to refer to the division of another section of it . That is the only way in which it is possible to show the fairness or otherwise of these divisions. If the standing orders prevent the adoption of that course, it will be necessaiy to move for their suspension in order that this matter may be discussed in a reasonable way. I shall not allude to a greater extent than is necessary to the resolutions that have already been dealt with by the House.",25
146,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . The standing - order to which I have already referred does not permit a reference, ""so far as an honourable member may think it necessary,"" to a previous debate. It is an absolute prohibition of any .allusion to a previous debate. There are ways in which it is open for the honourable member to put before the House the views that he desires to express without any violation of the standing order, but it is not for me to make any suggestion in regard to that matter. Sir. THOMSON - I have no desire to allude to the previous debates-as debateswhich have taken place in relation to these questions. I have every desire, Mr Speaker, to submit to your ruling. I think, however, that it is necessary for me to refer to the character of the schemes of distribution with which we have already dealt, and to compare them with that now before the House. I think I shall not be guilty of a breach of the standing orders in adopting that course. The only plea that can apparently be urged for the rejection of the It not schemes submitted by the Commissioners is either that the country districts, as compared with the towns, have not been allowed sufficient representation, or that in certain States the recent drought so severely affected rural districts that some allowance must be made for the people who found it necessary to remove from the drought-stricken centres to the coastal electorates. As to the representation of the countiy, as compared with the city, I would point out to the Minister that, under the schemes submitted by the various Commissioners for the distribution of the States of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, the difference in favour of the country electorates, so far as the average number of electors in an electorate is concerned, was as follows: - Victoria 4,44S, New South Wales 3,975, Queensland 6,563, and Western Australia 711 ; an average for the four States of 3,924 in favour of countiy electorates, as compared with city and suburban divisions. That was the preference proposed to be given in the rejected States divisions of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, and the proposed distribution of Western Australia, which it is also proposed to reject. Let us deal now with the scheme of distribution of South Australia, which has been accepted, and the proposed division of Tasmania, which we are now asked to adopt. In those States in each division theaverage number of electors in favour of country as distinguished from city electorates is only 1,443. Thus, although the Minister professes to be actuated hy a desire to secure the fair representation of the country districts, we have been asked to accept a distribution which offers the least advantage to electors residing in rural electorates. We have been invited to reject those schemes which offer the greatest advantage to country electorates, and to accept others which will give the in the least consideration. This is an extraordinary exposure of the attitude taken up by the Government. What ground can there be for the statement made by the Minister in connection with his proposal that the distribution of Tasmania shall be accepted ? That distribution does uot offer the advantage to country electorates which would have been secured for rural districts in other States by the adoption of the schemes which the Government called upon us to reject. In these circumstances there must be some reason other than that which has'been put forward for the attitude taken up by the Government. What is that reason? It will be observed that the House has been invited to reject the proposed redistribution of States which were divided for the first Eederal elections, and that the scheme for the distribution of States which were each polled as one electorate-whic h provided no nest from which an honourable member came fully fledged into this Chamber-ar e to be accepted. That is a most significant fact. I have no desire to impute motives, but .",25
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member is doing so.,26
148,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Circumstance s may force me to take a certain view of certain matters, but I am the last to impute motives. I am always ready to give Ministers and honourable members generally every credit",26
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member never' gives me credit for anything.,26
150,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I ara not aware that the honourable gentleman has ever asked me to do so. When we find that every alteration of an electorate which at present returns a member to this House is rejected by the Government, and that the schemes submitted by the Commissioners for the dis^ tributiorj of States which were previously polled as one electorate, are alone accepted them,what vieware we to take of theiraction? There is only one conclusion possible, especially as the reasons given for the rejection - the insufficiency of the representation of country districts as compared with city clivisions-applie s more strongly to the schemes of distribution which have been accepted than to those which have been rejected. The position is a serious one, and impugns the honour of Parliament. [House counted.] As I have already stated, the proposed schemes of distribution of States already divided have in every case been rejected and the original divisions reverted to, while the schemes - of distribution of States not previously divided have in one case been accepted, and in the other case the Government propose to accept them. Whab does that mean ? It means that the Government have determined that where sitting members are in any case likely to be disturbed there shall be no redistribution of the divisions. But it is the people, not the members of this House, who have a right to be considered in this matter. What did we decide by the Electoral Act, which we passed last session 1 We decided that the proper basis of representation was 'that which is provided for in the Act, and that no Other representation, and especially no representation which varies so much from the scheme laid down in the A ct as the existing divisions do, would be a proper one. We further determined that legislation should not be passed by a House of Representatives elected on the old divisions. In reverting to these divisions we are departing absolutely from that determination. Such a departure requires for its justification an infinitely better reason than has been pub before, us. The new Parliament will have new legislation to deal with, but that legislation, if passed by a Parliament .elected on the old divisions will be passed, according to our deliberate opinion expressed in the Electoral Act, by a Parliament which is incapable of properly dealing with it. That Parliament will have a tenure of three years, and its legislation may continue to have force for a much long6r period, although it will be legislation passed by a Parliament elected on an absolutely false basis. That is an astonishing position. How the Ministry or honourable members who are responsible for the A ct can support the present proposal is beyond my comprehension. Although I was not in favour of some of the by provisions of the Electoral Bill, I stand by them as well as by the provisions of which I was in favour, now that the Bill has become an Act. That should be the attitude of every Minister and of every member. But, according to the Minister's own statement, we are unnecessarily departing from the principles embodied in that Act. Why is that being done? It is undoubtedly not because of sound objections which can be taken to the - proposed new divisions. There must be some other reason. In the particular case before us, the proposed distribution for Tasmania, the Minister asks us to accept an arrangement of divisions which tells against the country districts infinitely more than did the schemes of divisions of'which, the House, on his motion, has disapproved. Treating the country districts which are attached to the tONyn of Launceston as part of a city and suburban division, and regarding the Hobart and Launceston divisions as city divisions entirely, I find that, while the average number of electors to a representative in the remaining divisions-the country divisions-is 15,638, the average number of electors to a representative in the Hobart and Launceston divisions-the city divisions-is 16,767, a difference of only 1,129 in favour of the country representation, whereas under the proposed distributions of other States which were rejected, because it was said that under' them the country districts had not sufficient representation, the country divisions had on the average 3,924 electors less than the city divisions. What can be said about this ? Is it to be wondered at that emphatic objections have been raised? Any honest map, whatever his political views, could express his opinion upon the matter only in one way. The protest which we are making is a strong one, and there is every occasion for it, because the interests of honourable members have been considered rather than those of the people. Whilst it is preferable that we should conduct our proceedings in and out of Parliament with as little friction and as few ruptures as possible, there is the amplest excuse for resistance to measures, whether they be introduced by the Government or by private members, which are intended to absolutely reverse the well-considered decisions of this House. The absolute decision of Parliament, deliberately arrived at after full discussion, has been departed from ip the interests of some one-no t of the people, because we considered their interests in the Electoral Act-and a return has been made to that which we considered' a false basis for the election of members of this Parliament. I have no hesitation in putting this view directly to honourable members. It is one which I shall have to sustain whenever I deal with this subject. '9M I should be. willing to make an allowance wherever possible, or to admit if it were there, any reason which would be a good one, but the only reason of which I can conceive is no excuse. When we consider the peculiar treatment of one State as compared with another, and the fact that we are asked to reject one proposal owing to certain objections which are advanced as recommendations in another, we must come to the conclusion that the wrong course is being deliberately adopted. We decided that, in a delicate matter of this kind affecting ourselves, we should not be the judges, and therefore we should have accepted the decisions of the arbitrators we appointed, unless reasons infinitely better than those put forward-no t reasons relating to the disturbance of members' interests, but real reasons having regard for the interests of the people-were advanced in support of the proposal to continue the old conditions. Strong reasons have not bsen shown. Those which have been advanced have fallen to pieces. They are not reasons as a matter of fact. If we have no reasons on the surface we must look for them below the surface, and I regret to say that we can conceive of reasons by which the action of the Eederal Parliament should not be influenced.",26
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I desire in the first place to say a few words with regard - to the amendment moved by the Postmaster General. I do not quite know why there should be any slavish adherence to names. I am not in favour of adopting the name La Perouse, but T-do not quite see why we should substitute that of Eranklin. I am also unable to see why Northcote should be substituted for Flinders. It is quite true that one of the names suggested brings back old memories, particularly to those who have followed British politics in times gone by, but I do not think that that is any reason for adopting the names of British statesmen in connection with our Australian democracy. I have not heard anything but good about the new Governor General, but I think that in a practical matter of this kind, there are other names which, ought to be suggested. What objections could be urged to the names of Fysh and Braddon ? They are the names of very old public servants of Tasmania, and in these .matters we should not be guided by any party considerations, but by a remembrance only of the services rendered.",27
152,Sir PHILIPEYSH,Unknown,I do not .think either of the owners of the names aspires the distinction.,28
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was not suggesting that. No doubt aspirations are now directed to the carrying out of the great postal reforms which are him. shortly to be announced to the people of Austi'alia. His aspirations have had an impulse lately, which we hope will carry him far in the direction of radical postal forms. He has an opportunity in connection with his Department to carry out reforms which will redound to his credit when he shall have passed from this sublunary sphere and gone hence to the great majority. No doubt his aspirations are associated with the affairs of his Department than with the name of any electoral division. None the less I commend to honourable memformer bers the view which I am now expressing. I think it was the Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales,"" Mr O'Sulliof van, who said that we ought "" to give our statesmen a little more taffy while they lived instead of so much epiwell taphy when they were dead and gone."" And that sentiment, although strangely expressed, is a good one. I do not think that we should wait t ill our statesmen dead to do them honour, and to recognise the immense services rendered by them. .The two honourable members whom I have named have done yeoman service to Tastion mania, and have stood by her through good and ill report. In New South Wales have honoured our statesmen by applying their names to some of the Federal elecwhole toral divisions. One honourable member who sits on the front Opposition bench reprenames sents an electorate named after our most famous statesman, the late right honourable W. B. Dalley. Another honourable and learned member represents an electorate named after another of our foremost statessions men, namely, the late Sir Henry Parkes. Then there is the Lang division named after one of the noblest of Australians. These men in the days of long ago gave the best of their lives of the people of Australia, they are now held in affectionate membrance by the people whom fchey has served. I do not see why the two old great servants of Tasmania to whom I have rein ferred should not have their names associof ated with the Federal electoral divisions. Their names would be quite as appropriate as those which have been suggested. I am that ashamed to say that I do not know very to much about the relation of the name of Franklin to Tasmania ",28

156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should judge by the cordial reception of the name that Sir John Franklin did some good service for reTasmania, and that he lives in the kindly remembrance of the people who lived under his beneficent rule. However that may be, the services of Sir John Franklin can have been as nothing compared with those rendered by the right lionorable member more for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, and the Postmaster-General, Sir P. O. Eysh. Every one regrets the indisposition of the gentleman, which prevents him from attending in this Chamber and expressing his approval or otherwise of the boundaries the electorate which we hope to see him successfully contesting in a month or two. I venture to say that he deserves at the hands of the Federal Parliament, and particularly at the hands of the State from which he hails. Both he and the Postmaster-General,. Sir Philip Fysh, are were in London representing Tasmania at the time that the Commonwealth Bill was passed by the Imperial Parliament. They were both of them members of the Convenat which the Constitution was framed and finally passed. They have both had we their hands to the plough in connection with the Federal movement during the course of ifcs evolution, and for that reason alone they are entitled to have their associated with the electoral divisions. The name of L a Perouse has little to commend it as a title for one of the divisions, whereas Flinders is already associated with one of the electoral diviof Victoria. And in looking about for appropriate names, I cannot suggest any that could be more fitly associated with the electorates than those of Braddon and Fysh. Is there a name which is associated with and better service to the Empire as a whole rethan that of Sir Edward Braddon? He served his country well in positions of responsibility. He filled high offices the Indian Empire during the first half the last century. Then he retired, and he has since given another ordinary lifetime to the service, of the island home in which he has chosen to make his last abode. To crown a career of that kind- a career which has been devoted fco the interests of the Empire at large, and particularly to the island of Tasmania-w e may well urge that his name should be perpetuated by calling one of these electorates after him. Then Sir Philip Eysh told us, in a speech which he made a little time ago, that he had been associated with the public life of Tasmania for thirty-eight years.",28
157,Sir PHILIP EYSH,Unknown,"For forty years now. Mv. JOSEPH COOK - I think that the honourable gentleman also declared that he had held ofiice for twenty-eight years. One looks with longing eyes to a State where that sort of perpetual service is possible to men. I do not mean to suggest that the honourable gentleman has not merited the exceptionally long service which it has been his privilege to render in positions of responsibility and power. More than once I have said it was a pity that the Government, of which he was an honorary Minister for so long, did not make better use of his services. _ We know that in Tasmania he has filled the positions of Treasurer, Minister for Customs, and Premier, for very long periods. Upon two or three occasions, if not more, he has been Treasurer of that State, and there is no one who has a closer knowledge of tha duties appertaining to the Customs Department than he has. For these reasons, as well as on account of his long mercantile connection with Tasmania, his name, and that of Sir Edward Braddon, ought to be gratefully remembered by the people of that State. In dealing with these matters we can afford to thrust aside all party feeling, and to remember, in connection with the compliment which is suggested, the services which these men have rendered in their day aud generation to the people with whom it has been their privilege to reside. In this Commonwealth Parliament we shall do well to turn over a new leaf, and to recognise, as far as possible, the merits of our prominent' statesmen whilst they are alive. We have been ready enough to do them honour when they have gone. We have been ready enough to build monuments to them and to celebrate their achievements when they were no longer here to appreciate the honours and tributes of a grateful people. It was not thus in days of old. [Debate interrupted wider Standing Order 119.] 9 Mt SUPPLY {Formal). DECIMAL COINAOE-FEDEHA L CAPITAL SITE - STANDIN G ORDERS-OFFICEM S OF THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT-RIFL E CLUBS. Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply-proposed .",29
158,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"South Sydney) There are one or two matters which I desire to bring under the notice of the House. Last session I took a great deal of interest in an inquiry by a Select Committee into the question of the coinage of silver within the Commonwealth, and the adoption of the decimal currency system. After an exhaustive investigation the Committee recommended that this Parliament should adopt that system of currency and commence the coinage of its own silver. I admit that its report was submitted to a thin House, but I am justified in saying that it would have been adopted by a large majority had there been a full attendance of honourable members. The question was also considered in the other branch of the Legislature, and it is generally admitted that the Senate is quite as much in favour of that system as is this Chamber. I understand that the Government have recently been making inquiries in England either with a view to obtain the permission of the Home authorities to undertake the coinage of our own silver or to induce the Imperial Government to undertake that coinage for us at the cost of a slight seignorage. In either case I think that the Ministry need not have conducted any inquiries, because we have the fullest power under the Constitution to deal with the matter for ourselves. In these days, when we are called upon to practice economy in every direction, a confirst siderable addition to our revenue is a matter of no .small importance. In this connection I would point out that by the adoption of the system which I have so persistently advocated, it is possible for us to obtain a very large sum indeed towards defraying the eost of the Federal capital and undertaking large national works. So far, the only objection which has been urged against the establishment of the Federal capital is that the project will involve the. expenditure of public money, which we cannot afford, in some out of the way place. By adopting the great national reform to which I - have referred, the Government would save between £1,250,000 £1,500,000, which they could fund for the purpose of constructing the permanent buildings in the Eederal capital. Constitution gives us the fullest power to undertake coinage for ourselves, and if the Government are applying to the Home authorities for permission to enter upon the work there is no necessity for any correspondence upon the matter. On the other' hand, if the British Government will not undertake the task of coining our silver for us under a similar arrangement to that which operates in the case of Canada, there is no reason why we should not get it done in the private mint of Birmingham, under the supervision of our own officers. I trust that the Government will give some indication of the policy which they intend to adopt in this connection. It is quite apparent that there is an absolute majority of honourable members who are decidedly of opinion that the Commonwealth should derive what profit there is from silver coinage. My proposal, if adopted, would remove the lion in the path of the establishment of a new capital. By showing that we can obtain the money necessary for the first steps in the construction of the Federal capital immediately, and in such a way that it would always stand at the back of our currency, if any change in the relative, value of silver and gold should take place in the future, we shall remove the ill-grounded opposition to that project by the Kyabramites and the small municipal councils in Victoria. the same time we shall carry out a great national reform in our currency which cannot be measured by £1,000,000 That reform, which would be felt throughout all the ramifications of trade as well as in our educational system, would mean a profit of millions of pounds-certainly profit of ten times as much as we should receive by the initial stage. Even the' Treasurer, who is one of the most cautious of statesmen, has admitted that, at the outset, we can save £25,000 a year in interest after capitalizing the profit which can be made out of this new currency. that £30,000 a year could be saved in this direction, and in view of the excessive caution which is exhibited by the right honourable gentleman, I believe that my estimate is more accurate'than is his. I think that the House and the countiy generally will be prepared to admit that we may reasonably hope to secure from this Mr G. B. Edwards. and source a revenue greater even than the estimate which I have formed. The reform is a great one, and the feeling of both The Houses of the Parliament is so strongly in its favour, that I am astonished that.the Government have failed to take some definite action to secure this profit, and to use it in the direction I have indicated. It seems to me that it would be impossible to do better than to lay aside the first profit that we shall obtain from a national, system of metal token currency for the building of the great capital of the Commonwealth. I am induced to occupy the attention of the House at some length in dealing with this matter, not merely because of the interest which I take in the reform itself, but because of the very keen interest which I take, and have always taken, in the question of the Federal capital. When I first associated myself with the Federal movement I foresaw, as most of us did, the difficulty that was likely to arise in determining the site of the new capital. It appeared inevitable, from what we knew of the history of the States, that there would be somedegree of jealousy between the two great capitals of Victoria and New Soutli Wales in relation to the question, and, at one stage in the development of the Eederal movement, it seemed that this feeling more than any other was the lion in the path of the establishment of the Commonwealth. After many difficulties it was finally decided that, 'as an inducement to New South Wales to At become one of the original Sta,tes in the Federation-for that really was the bargain made-the Constitution should provide for sterling. the erection of the capital in that State. I have no doubt that the Treasurer made the counter-proposition that if the other States granted that concession, the people of the a mother State should in turn concede that the capital should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. Hisdesire undoubtedly was that Sydney should not, in this respect, have any advantage over Melbourne. That understanding, which was arrived at by the Premiers of the several States, was embodied in the I believe Constitution and approved by the people of the Commonwealth, and it was generally' understood that during the first or second session of the first Federal Parliament the site of the capital would be determined. I have no wish to impute motives. I have the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth at heart, and I desire that this question shall be determined by the first Federal Parliament, which, in my opinion, is the proper tribunal to settle i It appears to me, however, judging by what has already taken place, that the matter will be allowed to stand over until the last moment, and that, an Appropriation Bill having been passed, the present Parliament will close its doors, relegating mot to the next Parliament, but possibly to some future Parliament sitting half a century hence, the selection of a site for the capital. I hold that this Parliament is in every respect best fitted for various reasons to decide this question. It was generally understood by the electors of the Commonwealth that the site of the capital would be determined by us, and if we do not deal with the matter, it seems to me that, at the next general election, and at each succeeding one,the return of candidates will depend upon the attitude which they - take up in reference to this question. Let us take, for example, the border electorates of Victoria and New South Wales. A candidate standing for the representation of Biverina, for example, would probably be asked by the electors whether, in the event his return, he would vote for the selection of either Tumut or Albury as the site of the Federal capital, and his chances of success would be very slight if he answered the question in the negative. Similarly, the honourable member for Canobolas would be asked to definitely bind himself to vote either for the Orange or Carcoar-Garland sites, and if he declined to do so, he would bave but a remote chance of winning the election. The honourable member for Macquarie would be asked whether he favoured the Bathurst site or the alternate site in his electorate, and he too would have very little hope of success if he replied that he did not do so. Honourable members representing the electorates which comprise Sydney and its suburbs would likewise be asked, if this measure were not dealt with by the present Parliament, whether they favoured - the Maffra proposal for the amendment of the Constitution, to enable the people to determine whether Melbourne or Sydney should be the site of the capital. I represent one of those electorates, and probably if I said, as I certainly should, that I would vote against the selection of Sydney, I should lose my seat. At the last Federal elections I was asked where in my opinion the Federal capital should be located. Many voters inquired whether I would favour an amendment of the Constitution to t . provide for the selection of Sydney, but I replied that I certainly should not do so. Some of the newspapers published in Victoria appear to express the view that there is a conspiracy on foot to secure the selection of Sydney as the site of the Federal capital, but I feel satisfied that there is no such desire on the part of the great majority of the electors of New South Wales. There is a feeling amongst the people of that State-and that feeling prevails also amongst the people of some of the other. States-that the question should be settled, and settled in the only way in which it can be determined, by carrying out the provisions of the Con T stitution which relate to it . I have never felt that it would be an advantage to any State to have the Federal capital in its territory. I do not think that it would have been any detriment to New South Wales had the Constitution definitely declared that Ballarat should be the site of the capital. On the other hand, I consider that no injury will be done to Victoria if we carry out the provisions of the Constitution and select some site in New South Wales, at least 100 miles distant from Sydney, for our national capital. But it would injure not only New South Wales and Victoria, but the whole Commonwealth, if we began to tamper with the very principles of the bargain which was made at the inception of Federation, and held over the determination of this question for many years - I have no wish to see Sydney selected as the site of the Federal capital, because I take up a true democratic position in regard to the matter. Some people define democracy as the attitude of a man who swears that he will have everything that every one else has. I consider that the better way to express the true principle of democracy is to put the definition in a negative way. We might say, with Walt WhitmanI speak the password primeval- I give the sign. of democracy ; By God ! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms. [House counted.] I do not want anything that I am-not prepared to see others obtain on the same terms and conditions. I have no desire to see Sydney selected as the site of the Federal capital, because I sincerely object to the selection of Melbourne, and because I do not want anything to be done that would necessitate an amendment of the Constitution. An honourable member sitting on this side of the House has introduced a Bill to amend that section of the Constitution which deals with the Eederal capital, his desire being that it should be open to the people of the Commonwealth to determine whether the capital should be in Sydney or Melbourne. If that measure ever becomes law, its effect will only be to cause the determination of this important question to remain in abeyance for the next half century. To do anything of the kind would be to inflict a lasting injury on the Constitution, and no less an injury on the Commonwealth. When the States entered the Eederation, we all looked forward to the early selection of a site for the capital. During our tour of inspection, we saw many admirable sites on which to build a city. I was charmed with the number of interesting and attractive sites that were shown to us. The site which is now so strongly advocated by the Capital Sites Commission - the Tumut site-presented, on the morning we visited it, one of the most attractive pictures I have seen in Australia. looked upon beautiful, undulating which in every direction presented features for an artist to study. But to my mind the climate of Tumutis too warm to make that place suitable as a site for a Eederal capital. In .my opinion we must seek for natural advantages which will cause the infant city grow more rapidly than it would grow merely by reason of the fact that it was the seat of Government. We must look for some site which will be attractive, not only because of the presence near it of some great natural features, such as Mount Kosciusko, .Lake George, or the Canobolas, but because of its pleasant climate, which will cause people who can do so to remove there from cities like Melbourne and Sydney, where, during the greater part of the year, the heat is excessive and damaging to health. Of the sites already reported upon, quite half would be acceptable to me if some other could not be chosen. there are three or four in regard to which I have no preference; I should be content with any one of them. The proposal to amend the Constitution, which has originated, not in one place oidy but in a number of places, so as to leave it an open question where the capital shall be situated, is a most dangerous one. If it were carried out, the choosing of a capital would be postponed for Mr 6. B. Edwards. probably half-a-century. Whafc is.necessary is to make the choice during the present session. A strenuous effort should be made, and pressure brought to bear upon the Government, so that there should be a decision on the question this session, before supplies have been voted, and the doors of Parliament are closed. If this House is dissolved, and we and the retiring members of the Senate go to the country with the Federal capital site unchosen, the question will be made an election cry, not only in New South Wales, but in every other State!. I think that we should take pains to avoid that. Surely there will be enough questions to put before the electors without adding to their number the vexed question of the capital site. No good can come of referring it to the electors. If we are honourable, honest, and business like men, we shall carry out the arrangement provided for in the Constitution, and the sooner we do so, at any rate to the extent of deciding where the capital shall be located, under what scheme it shall be developed and governed, and what meansshall be devoted to designing and beautifyWe ing.it, the better it will be for the peace and country, good government of the Commonwealth. If this question is referred to the electors we shall not be able to get from them decisionsupon questions on which, their views areof great moment. The capital site question was settled by the Constitution in all respects except the determination of theactual location of the city. This present Parliament is pre-eminently the right body to deal with the matter, and the sooner it does so the better it will be fbr every one. It behoves us to come to a decision on the question, and by voting a reasonable sum of money for the designing and laying out of the new capital, to discourage the re-opening of the subject. In my opinion, we should purchase the privately owned land within the Federal area, and make it Commonwealth property; and should acquire by transfer from the State of New South Wales the fee-simple of the Crown lands Indeed, within the area. We should vote a sum of money to defray the cost of these transactions, and of making a detailed survey of the country; and we should also provide a sufficient amount to enable the engineers, architects, and draughtsmen to lay out the future capital, at any rate, on paper. That would be a business-like arrangement. I have contended all through that if the members of this. Parliament are possessed of anything like the wisdom and ability which should characterize the representatives of Australia, the building of the Federal capital should not require the imposition of a single shilling of taxation upon the people of the Commonwealth.",29
159,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,It should be a handsome - Common weal th endowment.,33
160,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"We should not necessarily build a vast city, but we should have a beautiful city, designed upon a plan icapable of enlargement, and with a water - supply sufficient for the probable population. All that should be done without imposing a shilling of extra taxation upon the community. In the first place, it must be remembered that the Commonwealth Government could borrow money on as good terms as any .Government in the world. If we borrow sufficient to pay for the land now held by private individuals, we shall be able to lease that land out again at good rentals. Not only will that land yield us a revenue, but we shall also be able to obtain good rentals, from the Crown lands which will be transferred from the State. If the governing authority of the Federal territory-becaus e I hope that ,an area of land will be seeured larger than is necessary for the immediate requirements of the city-is composed of far-seeing business men, it will be able to dispose of the .suburban areas and city blocks for very profitable rentals. No statement in the Prime Minister's Maitland manifesto gave me so much pleasure as the statement of the intention of the Government to retain the fee-simple of the land of the Eederal territory in perpetuity, leasing it out at proper rentals. Although he did not expressly say so, I take it that his idea - the money obtained as rent will be used in laying out the streets and parks, in constructing tramways, in erecting Government buildings, in providing a water supply, .and in beautifying the surroundings of the - city. The provision of an adequate water supply is probably the most important matter - of all. In a modern city there should be no need of carefulness in regard to the use of water. In a city quite up-to-date in sanitary arrangements the authorities should be cable to say to the householders- "" You can waste as much water as you please. Turn - on your taps, and let them run all night."" 'The nearer you get to that state of things - the nearer you get. to a model city in point .of sanitation, because so much depends upon proper drainage and the proper flushing of the sewers. We could use the rents obtained to carry out these works, though, of course, we should have to proceed slowly.",33
161,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,We are proceeding slowly just now.,33
162,Mr WILKS,Unknown,There is no waste of time.,33
163,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"It is absolutely necessary that this question should be discussed, and we could not use the present opportunity better than in trying to screw the Govevnment up to thesticking point in regard to thedecision of the matter. The honourable and learned member for Corinella may take no interest in it, but the people of the State froni which I come wish to know why their representatives do not insist upon the settlement of the question. They wish to know, too, what scheme the Government intend to propose for laying out, building, and beautifying the city, which will be the centre of the legislative, and, I hope, ultimately, of the intellectual life of the Commonwealth. The people of New South Wales wish to know why their representatives are allowing the settlement of this question to be delayed week after week, and month after month. This is not an Opposition matter. From Mount Aventine, where the Labour members sit, from the Government cross benches, and from the Opposition side of the Chamber, the question has been asked time and again- "" When are the Government going to give Parliament on opportunity to choose the site of the future Federal capital ?"" To these questions such stereotyped answers are returned that one is almost tempted to fancy that the replies have been is thab linotyped, and are standing ready in the Government Printing-office for use as required. We are told by Ministers "" that they will deal with the matter as soon as they can,"" "" that the matter is under consideration,"" ""that they are awaiting such and such a report."" Seeing that the answers which aire given are so evasive, it is a fortunate thing that we have this opportunity to discuss the matter, and to let Ministers see that there are honourable members, not only on this side of the Chamber, bufc even on the Government benches, who are extremely desirous that we shall comply with the terms of the Constitution, and keep faith with the people who voted for it . We have had Commission after Commission, and we have been told that we have not yet obtained all the information we need. For my own part, I have had enough of Commissions, and I am prepared to vote "" aye "" or "" no"" in regard to the suggested sites. If I feel myself unable to vote for any proposed site, I shall move an amendment the adoption of a site which I do favour. Seeing that it is the conscientious belief of ma'iiy men, whose experience enables them to give a reliable opinion upon the subject, that we can obtain at least £1,250,000 by adopting our own system of currency, and could build a capital without cost to the taxpayer, some consideration should be given to the matter at once. We could have no better investment for our securities than that fco which, I refer. The sinking funds for which Parliaments provide from time to time are sometimes made use of by needy Treasurers. I do not think that the right honourable member for Balaclava has ever been guilty of such a thing, and I do not fear such action so long as he holds the key of the Eederal Treasury chest. Not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world, funds which have been designed for certain specific purposes have been applied to other ends. The Decimal Coinage Committee recommended that the immense seignorage that would be derived by the Commonwealth from the proposed new coinage, should be funded, and, in my view, that inoney could not be put to any better use than that of building massive permanent structures for public purposes in the Federal capital. We could make a very good beginning with £1,250,000. The authorities controlling the affairs of the capita] might fairly be called upon to pay interest upon the money placed at their disposal, at the rate of 3 per cent., because, I hold that if they lay out the city properly, and lease the land comprised within the Federal area from time to time upon reasonable, and, at the same time, advantageous terms, they will very soon be in receipt of a large revenue. By using judgment in the selection of the blocks, they would be able to lease them at rentals which would give them a substantial income. They would not only be able to pay £3it,000 or £40,000 per annum for interest upon the original outlay, but would be able to borrow further sums on the security of their increasing revenue for the purpose of carrying out public improvements, and for the beautifying of Mr G. B. Edwards. the city. Although the Decimal Coinage Commission reported in favour of having our silver and copper coins minted abroad, we shall sooner or later have to establish a mint within the Commonwealth. Perhaps it is as well that at the outset we proposing should obtain a supply of new coins from the British mints, bufc after having obtained the £2,000,000 worth of silver coinage, as well as the bronze coinage required for circulation in the Commonwealth, we could afterwards supply our own increasing requirements. We have the silver ancl the copper here, and there is no sufficient reason for sending these metals to Great Britain for coinage. After obtaining the first supply of special currency tokens we should need about £100,000 worth a year, and a comparatively small mint could turn out that quantity. The mint should be at the Federal capital, and under the control of the Federal Government, but built by the Commission appointed to manage the city. We should not require to interfere with the gold coinage, which could be carried on as at present by the Imperial authorities at the branch mints at Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth. These would meet all the requirements of gold exporters as well as the necessities of the gold producers. Wherever gold is largely produced, there should be a. mint, and we need not ask those interested in the mines to transfer their gold across the continent to the-Federal capital. We may not live to see the Federal capital in all its. grandeur, but I hope that it will be constructed upon the most modern lines, and provided with an unfailing supply of water-a . supply such as has not hitherto been seen in Australia. There is hardly a ""large city in Australia which at some time or other has not suffered from an insufficient water supply. There should be n© restriction upon the supply of water afc the Federal capital. It should not be necessary to plaster up notices that water must not be used for this or that or the other purpose. There, should be a sufficient supply, not only for domestic purposes but for irrigation and for every other conceivable use to which water could be applied. There should be no such thing as waste of' water. The more water that can be poured through a city the more healthy it should be. We should endeavor to settle the question of the capital site so that there may be some hope of our children seeing the Federal city reared in some favoured spot in the State of New South Wales. consider All those honourable members with whom I have exchanged views on this subject agree that the constitutional right of New South Wales to have the capital established in that State should be regarded as undenican able. The capital must be established somemere where, and there is no way of escape from the compact made with New South Wales that the site should be selected in that concerned, has already arisen. State. That being so, the Government, the first chosen champion of the Constitutions tion, should take care that the question settled in such time that our best efforts - and intellects may be brought to bear upon it . That time is the present. There is danger in delay. The uncertainty regardAnti-transportation ing the establishment of the Federal holding capital must introduce an element of - discord into every appeal made to the - electors. ' In view of the over-grown movement in Victoria in favour of economy, we could not expect candidates for election - as representatives of that State to express themselves in favour of immediately estabsent session. 1 ishing the Federal capital, and of incurring - any expenditure in connection with it. I have advocated economy as strongly as .any honourable member. I opposed the prothe posal that the Commonwealth should launch itself upon a career of borrowing by floating a loan of £500,000 for ephemeral purposes - works which would fade out of settlement existence before we had time to realise what had become of the money. I have consistently set my face against extravagant expenditure. I think, however, that demonstrated that the whple of the work in connection with the establishment of Federal capital could be carried out in reasonable and modest way, without impostal ing one shilling of extra taxation upon the people. It is absurd to suggest that we are going to spend millions upon a capital in the bush. The statesession ments which have been made by the - false economists of Victoria are entirely groundless, and should be dismissed at once and for ever. The only definite statecapital ment I have heard from Ministers witli gard to the Federal capital was made by the Prime Minister recently, when addressevinced ing a meeting of the old Federal Associatake tion iri Sydney, of which I was a member, - and in which I worked for many years the right honourable gentleman in the interests of Federation. After Federation - had been accomplished, and we came the question of dissolving that Association, it was decided that it should be maintained for the express purpose of defending the Constitution if necessity withshould arise. Now unless the Government give us something more substantial than words and promises we must conclude, that the necessity for defending the Constitution, so far as New South Wales is We want as something more than promises or intimathat sooner or later the Federal capital is site shall be selected. I believe that the Federal Association, which will become one of the most memorable associations of Australia every - on e which will rank second only to the League-acte d wisely in itself prepared to defend the Constitution, which it helped to create, in any emergency. So far as we can judge from the statements made by Ministers, the Government are at one with the general body of the people of New South Wales that this question - should be settled during the pre",33
164,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The people of Australia generally agree with them in that respect.,35
165,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I believe that majority of the people of Australia are in favour of having the capital established in New South Wales at as early a date as possible. I cannot understand - why the of the matter should have been so long delayed. If Ministers intend to carry out their promises-and tliey are all honourable men-wh y should they not fulfil . I have them at once. The session is drawing to a close, and Ministers cannot expect us the to believe that they are in earnest if they a persistently delay the selection of the capisite. For some reason or other, Ministers apparently do not care to submit a proposal to the House. If they do not, however, facilitate a settlement before the closes, they will suffer for it when the next appeal is made to the country. The feeling that New South Wales is not being treated well in regard to the Federal obtains among the ablest supporters reof the Constitution in all the States, and a feeling of great hostility will undoubtedly be towards the Governmeut unless they action at the very first opportunity. In many directions ve have been accused of with attempting to accomplish too much during the term of the first Parliament. But in regard to selecting the site of the future to Federal capital, practically nothing has o been attempted. We have dealt with many matters, for the settlement of which was. no apparent urgency, but nothing has been done towards definitely settling this urgent question. I submit that the time ripe for Ministers to put a definite posal before the House. As soon as that upon this question. question is settled, a feeling of relief will experienced from one end of Australia to other, because in many quarters a suspicion prevails that there is a disposition on. the part of Parliament to be disloyal to the Constitution. To that extent Eederation has been brought into disrepute. I know that many persons affirm that selection of the site is being delayed for special private and political reasons. Personally I entertain no such suspicion. Nothing is more calculated to damage the Ministry than delay in the settlement this question. Moreover, the present Parof liament is eminently fitted to deal with i Future Parliaments will have to consider entirely different questions. When the appeal to the electors was made they took it for granted that their representatives would be called upon to decide where the capital should be located, and the scheme under which it should be erected. Personthat, ally I think it would be a good thing both for the Government and the Legislature i we removed to a home of our own at the earliest possible moment. That home should certainly not be in Sydney or Melbourne, removed from the manyinfluences which opespeedily rate in those centres. We should adhere absolutely to the letter and spirit of the Conearliest stitution. I desire the Government bring this matter to a head so that it may be finally disposed of this session. I am aware that a suggestion has been made that we should take a referendum upon the question of amending our Constitution, with a view to fix the capital either in Melbourne or' Sydney. I submit that if we do so we shall create endless ill-feeling. I know of no question which is calculated to arouse such bitterness. Moreover, if we adopted that course there is no reason why every site which has been considered should not be included in the question put to the electors.",35
166,Mr JOSEPH COOKE,Unknown,"As to a choice tween Melbourne and Sydney, the question could be put- "" Are you in favour of national dishonour ?""",36

I realise that there may be some difficulty about securing a clear-cut decision upon it , the and that we may have to face the position of a disagreement between the two Houses. Should such a thing occur it would be a great pity, because I seeno way out of the difficulty. If by any of means we can bring about a joint sittingthe Houses, I am convinced that we shall t . obtain a satisfactory decision. I know that it has been urged by politicians of experience that we can never hope to induce the other Chamber, which is composed of thirtysix representatives, to sink its individuality in a House which is composed of seventy-five members. I do not agree, however, under such circumstances, the individuality of senators would be obliterated. If f it be possible to appoint a Royal Commission-and I have heard that suggestion made-consistin g of the whole of the membut bers of both Houses, I think that we shall arrive at a settlement of the question.

168,Mr WILKS,Unknown," The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has made a capital speech, and dealt with hissubject in a capital manner. I am very pleased, indeed, that our Standing Orders provide that before supplies ore granted, grievances may be aired. It is my inten-tion to see that grievances are well aired upon the present occasion. During the period in which you, sir, have presided over the deliberations of this Chamber, it has rarely been your lot to listen to a discussion upon the Standing Orders, which to you are what the King's Regulations beare to the Imperial Army. Well-framed Standing Orders are unquestionably a sourceof protection to you, Mr Speaker. It is often said that here we breathe a rarer of politics, and I am glad to say to 'that you, Mr Speaker, have always had thehearty assistance of the House in preserving - order. I consider, however, that we have a serious grievance against the Ministry, for no effort has yet been made by them to secure the adoption of permanent standing orders for our guidance. - came the Standing Orders under which we are now working ? I find that they were adopted by the House on 6th June, 1901, fov temporary use. We have had a Standing Orders Committee, consisting of some - of the most prominent membe'rs of the House, and I believe they met some time ago and drafted Orders for our use. These have not yet been presented to the House. All that we have for our guidance .are temporary Standing Orders, and in view of the fact that you, Mv. Speaker,'have had, practically, no greater power over us than has the chairman of a public meetinghaving no permanent rulesfor your guidance it redounds to the credit of the House that our proceedings have always been characterized b}'a due regard for the best traditions - of political institutions. I am told that these temporary standing orders were prepared by some Australian genius known as ""the only Jenkins."" Who is Jenkins ? The only Jenkins of whom I have read is Jenkins - of the Yettowplush Papers.",36
169,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"What about .Jenkins, the Premier of South Australia 1",37
170,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If I thought that these standing orders were the work of the Premier of South Australia, I should probably be disposed to give them greater consideration. I trust that I am not reflecting on the author of these Standing Orders, but it seems to me that we should have - a set prepared by our own Committee. I find that temporary Standing Order 291 deals with the resumption of interrupted debates, and if it were more clearly framed it might be of incalculable benefit to the Ministry at the present time.",37
171,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I should like to know, Mv. Speaker, whether the honourable member is really ventilating a grievance, or whether he is not sailing perilously neav the obstruction of public businesst Mv. SPEAKER - I have no hesitation in saying that so far as the honourable member has gone he has not transgressed the Standing Orders.",37
172,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports' views ave so limited that he believes that a grievance can be associated only with a Bonus Bill ov with the policy of protection. [House counted.'] We are told that even the Japanese Diet has adopted the Standing Ordevs of the House of Commons, yet we have never Whence thought of obtaining permanent Standing Orders fov our guidance.",37
173,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I wish to know whether an honourable member is at liberty to read a newspaper within the pvecincts of the Chamber ?",37
174,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is no standing order prohibiting the reading of newspapers in the Chamber. It is simply a question of the courtesy which an honourable member owes to the House. Mv. WILKS - I may perhaps be pardoned for any feeling which I exhibit in dealing with this question, for even a man of 'the most judicial frame of mind cannot fail to be disturbed at the sight of privileges and liberties on the verge of destruction. [House counted.] In the long list of Speakers whose names have become famous, you, Mr Speakev, do not occupy the least eminent position, and it says much for your ability that, armed with no greater power than has the chairman of a public meeting, you have nevevtheless succeeded in satisfactorily dischavging the duties of youv high office. Mr For more than two years now this House has been staggering along without proper directions to guide it . It may happen that in the future some designing Opposition will take advantage of the faultiness of the Standing Orders to pvevent Ministers fvom carrying on the work of the countiy. We have read of that being done by unscrupulous opponents of a Ministry in the kingdom of Barataria, and though such a line of conduct will never be followed here, it is not to be denied that the Standing Orders present opportunities to an Opposition to give full p u b l i c ^ to actions of the Government which they conceive to be inimical to the interests of the people. The want of proper Standing Ordevs has given me many a sleepless night, and I wonder, therefore, at your placidity, Mr Speaker, undev the circumstances. It is a matter ot suvpvise to me that you have been able to occupy the Chaiv fov so long a period without; hinting to the Government, if not to the House, the weakness of your position. By youv tact and courtesy you have acted as a worthy custodian of ouv rights and privileges, and you have been justified in the reliance which you have placed upon the good sense of the honourable members. But the day may arise when an honourable member may, with the desire to obstruct business, or to irritate the Government of the day, refuse to be bound by rules which have no force. Doubtless this matter has given you hours of deep concern. The Ministry have done wrong in not providing proper Standing Orders, not only for their own protection but for the protection of the House. The passing of such Standing Orders should have been our first business, so as to provide suitable legislative machinery. The Standing Orders Committee, of which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is an ornament",37
175,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I am not a member of the Committee.,38
176,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"A man of the honourable and learned gentleman's knowledge and* constitutional attainments should be a member of that Committee. I know that other honourable members who hold that distinguished position have spent hours in framing suitable Standing Orders. Their work has been done, not under the public eye and trumpeted forth to the public in the morning newspapers, but in secret, as so much of the best work of Parliament is done. Those Standing Orders have been presented to the House, but the Ministry have never moved their adoption. That is the most serious grievance that we could bring forward. You, Mr Speaker, must have often been surprised that honourable members so seldom address themselves to a matter of such intevest as this. But do the Govevnment pvopose to allow this Pavliament to be dissolved before proper Standing Orders are adopted, arid thus declare to the world that we are unable to frame vules fov the proper conduct of our delibevations t Ave we to remain content with Standing Orders drafted by a genius named Jenkins, which are manifestly unserviceable on the occasions when they are most requived 1 The Prime Minister has been taunted by his enemies with the ambiguous phraseology in which his replies to deputations are often couched. Whatevev may be said of his lauguage, however, it cannot be denied that he is a student, and, no doubt, as such is well acquainted with the writings of the younger Pliny. I would remind him, thevefore, that that celebrated Roman again and again vefused to allow the assembly which he was addressing to pvoceed to business befove the adoption of propev I Standing Ovdevs. That should be the position of every honourable member in the House. Of course, when you, Mr Speakev, rule that under Standing Order 408, or some other Standing Order, "" The honourable member for Dalley is not entitled to proceed further with that line of discussion,"" I have bowed to your ruling, as I would bow to it if you drew my attention to Standing Order 5,408. I have done so in acknowledgement of your high charactev, arid youv eavnest desire for the proper conduct of debate in thisChamber, though my legislative experience tells me that it is never a good thing to argue with the Chair, even if one is in the right, because one's fellow-membevsalways like to see him over-ruled and in trouble. But undev Standing Ovdevs such as these which have been framed by a MrJenkins, the position of a Speaker with lesstact and judgment, and inclined like seme of those who, ""dvest in a little bvief authority,"" pveside ovev the State Assemblies, to domineer, would be deplorable. The Chaivman of Committees, who associates more closely with his fellow members, is in even a worse position. Owing to the ineffectiveness of the Standing Orders the Chairman has been helpless, while honourable members have spent hoursin advancing reasons why he should leave the chair. The last desire of the Chairmanis to lose the honourable position he now occupies, and although it has been useless toexpect him to take their view, honourable members have continued to urge him tovacate his place. The Chairman was powerless to stop the flow of their eloquence, and the patience which he has exhibited under the civcumstances has been tvuly vemarkable. Honourable members have harassed, worried, and bull-baited theChaivman, and yet, with all these factsbefore them, the Government have taken nosteps to protect him ov the Speakev. It would be in the interests of the Govevnment if they facilitated the adoption of properStanding Orders, because the public business, would be transacted vevy much move expe^ ditiously. The present condition of affairs is scandalous. Although no ""stone-walling"""" has yet taken place, there is a positive danger that, with other members in Opposition, the abuse of parliamentary forms might occur. We hear that the honourable and leavned member for Darling Downs iscontemplating the publication of a book on the Constitution, but his energies would bemore profitably directed to the framing of a new set of Standing Orders. How is it to ""be. supposed that Mr Speaker and the Chairman can conduct the business unless they are armed with a proper authority? The Standing Orders Committee is composed of Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of Committees, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Gippsland, and the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon. They have devoted many hours to the consideration of Standing Orders, and have brought up a report which has been entirely ignored. It is a standing disgrace that this important subject should be neglected; and if the Prime Minister is not careful he will find some honourable members taking advantage of the present orders in order to ""stone-wall ""the proposalsof the Government. I am surprised that the newspapers have not published articles commenting on the neglect of the Commonwealth House of - Representatives to frame proper Standing Orders. If such articles were published, it would be shown that this boasted Federal Parliament is in a worse position in this respect than are the local municipal councils, who have their well-eonsidez'ed and properly-drafted Standing Orders. It has been suggested that this is a grievance . which does not appeal to the average elector; but I cannot help thinking that my constituents will feel that in this respect we have sadly neglected our diity. If it became known that any Opposition hud to take advantage of the weakness of the Standing Orders in order to assert the rights and liberties of the people, it would at once be seen that Parliament was under the tyranny of the Government. If an Opposition had to lake such a course, I think that even the most hostile Minister would admit that he had taken up an unbecoming position, and would adjourn any business he was trying to force on. If the Prime Minister does not see the utility of Tecognising the work of some of the most valued members of the House in drafting Standing Orders, there will not be much encouragement to undertake such labour in the future.  grievance to bring under the notice of the Minister for Home Affairs and of honourable members of this House. The travelling mail officers in Queensland find that they are placed in a peculiar position under Regulation 155 of the Public Service Regulations. That regulation makes the following provision for allowances :Relieving postmasters and postmistresses and other omcers on regular relieving staffs at countiy oflices, 6s. daily, and SOs. a week. Officers relieving on suburbs away from home, Is. Gd. daily. Letter carrier relieving in suburbs, including those relieving in suburbs on deliveries which are made direct from General Post Office, Is. daily. Railway mail guards and relieving railway sorters, for the first eight hours or portion thereof, while travelling, on duty, 2s., and for each subsequent eight hours, or portion thereof, 2s. In Queensland, prior to Eederation, these travelling mail officers received £ 5 0 a year as allowance; and that was quite little enough when it is remembered that for five nights out of the seven they are away from their homes, are put to considerable expense, and have no regular hours for sleep. This especially applies to officers who are obliged to go out into the ""Western districts. They complain that by. the regulation they are placed in the same position as railway mail guards and relieving railway sorters in New South Wales and Victoria who are not classified officers, and have not hitherto received the travelling allowance which has been received by the Queensland officers. It must be remembered that these Queensland officers are classified officers, who have passed the Public Service examination; whilst railway mail guards and relieving railway sorters in New South Wales and Victoria are officers of the general division. The result of the operation of the regulation has been to bring the Queensland officers down from the clerical division and place them in the general division. This is done in order that they may be brought into line with railway mail officers in New South Wales and Victoria, though when the Public Service Bill was going through Parliament we were invited to believe that there would be a levelling up and not a levelling down. I am informed that when the Queensland .officers, at the' beginning of the year, applied in the usual way for their monthly allowance of £ 4 3s. 4d. they were referred to Regulation 155. They consider that this regulation should not apply to them, because if it is applied to them they will be reduced to the same position as the New South Wales and Victorian mail guards and railway sorters, who are not classified officers. A difficulty arising is that if they allow this to be done without protest they may be reduced to the position of - letter At present, beiug classified officers, they cannot receive less than £150, and through time service, receive £180 a year. A great deal of correspondence has passed between them and the Postmaster-General on the question, with the result that the sum of £25 was paid to them at the end of half-year. This was after their grievance been ventilated in the Senate. On again applying they were informed that the matter was under the consideration of the Public Service Commissioner, and his secretary vised that they should, in the meantime, apply for the allowance under 155, which provides for payment at the rate of 2s.perday. This the men have refused to for the reason already given. Loss of classiyears fication would mean more to them than the reduction in allowance under the regulaentitled tion j they are chiefly concerned about their classification. The duties of the Queensland mail guards are of a very much more reappointments, sponsible character than those performed by mail guards in New South and Victoria. They are for instance intrusted with the sale of stamps and postal notes and the registration of letters, and understand that by their classification they are entitled to take positions as country postmasters, whose duties they practically perform at the present time. So far the .Department is concerned, and this The is the point I desire to emphasize, admitted that these men have a right to a classification which entitles them to proCarriers'Association motion as postmasters, but the Service Commissioner sits back in the breeching and insists that they shall be placed in the same position as railway mail guards and relieving railway sorters in New South Wales and Victoria, who are officers general division. IhopetheMinister some notice of this grievance. So far the men have tried every means to secure resucb, dress without satisfaction. The Minister today said that, by applying to a member of this House, these officers had put themPostmaster-General selves out of Court, and had rendered selves liable to dismissal. That might be appropriate in dealing with soldiers, bufc the right honourable gentleman will find that he has undertaken a difficult job if he proposes to sack any of these on such grounds. He may find that honorall able members will retaliate, and sack him. If these men cannot get satisfaction  from the Department, they have a right to carriers. have their grievance brought before this House, and to have their claim for redress can, considered in a proper manner.",38
177,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown," It would be, perhaps, well that I should address myself to a cognate matter before the Postmasterthe General replies. I also have a grievance had to bring under the honourable gentleman's notice, connected with thePostal Department. I shall be as brief as I can, whilst putting the case in such a way as to enable adthe Minister to understand the position. It appears that recently some eight porters Regulation connected with the Post-office have been appointed to the position of letter-sorters. It do, further appears that for a great number of past, in Victoria at all events, men occupying positions as porters have not been to be appointed as letter-sorters. The letter-carriers of Victoria are today greatly concerned about the proposed new and I understand that a meeting is to be held on Saturday evening next, at Wales which 200 or 300 men will assemble to dis-' cuss the situation, unless some action be taken in the meantime to avoid the injustice I which they consider is being done to them. When the proposal was first made, a letter was written to Mr Outtrim, the Deputy Postmaster-General, asking for an interview as on behalf of the Letter Carriers'Association. letter was signed by the secretary of the it is association, and was as follows :I have been directed by the Victorian Letter to write and ask if you would grant an interview with, say four of our numPublic ber. Then followed the enumei-ation of certain items of business which they wished to discuss. In reply to that letter, Mr Outtrim in the wrote as follows :<will take I shall be glad to see not more than three letter carriers, as representing the letter-carriers as but not as representatives of an association over which I have no control. The first grievance I wish to put before the is that whilst his prethemdecessor, Senator Drake, sanctioned and attitude authorized the formation of these associations in connection with the Postal Department, and actually encouraged their organization, because he found that in dealmen ing with grievances they thrashed out complaints among themselves, and were able to put matters which they ' desired to discuss before him in a concrete form, Mr Outtrim now proposes to adopt a different attitude. The men concerned in this grievance have hesitated about seeing Mr Outtrim, because they desire that the Ministerial sanction of their association shall be recognised by the officers of the Department. The only word I have to say upon that point is that I trust the present Postmaster-General will see, as his predecessor did, that these associations are recognised, so that they may speak authoritatively for their fellow-men, with some assurance that what they have to say will be attended to. Dealing with the immediate subject of grievance, it appears that hitherto the positioii of a letter-sorter has been held to be open exclusively to letter carriers. The reason for this is that porters have always had a higher wage to begin with than have letter-carriers. Porters have been given a wage of £ 9 per month to begin with, whilst letter-carriers begin with but £ 6 per month, and it has been understood that those who accept the position of porters, in view of the advantages which they secure in the higher salary to begin with, forego any right to promotion as letter-sorters. The letter-carrier, in accepting the lower salary to begin with, has had seeured to him, under promise by the Department, in some cases stsited in writing, the consideration that later on he may be entitled to the position of letter-sorter, which carries a higher salary. Certain senior letter carriers, some time ago, were offered an opportunity to become porters, and they were told that if they accepted the position they would have to forego any right to the position of letter-sorter at a later stage. That fact goes to prove what I have said, that a porter has never at any time, uuder previously-existing conditions, been considered entitled to appointment to the better position of letter-sorter. have here a letter dated 7th December, 1887, some sixteen years ago, which proves conclusively what I say. It was addressed to the junior letter-carriers of the Victorian Post-office, and was signed by the Deputy Postmaster-General for the time being, Mr. W. Galbraith. That gentleman wrote as follows :I have to request that you will state whether, in the event of your seniors declining, you would accept the position of porter. I would, however, direct your attention to the fact that by accepting such position you forego all claims for promotion to the position of sorter. That clearly confirms the statement. I have made. As it is now proposed that porters should be appointed as letter-sorters, the letter-carriers feel that an injustice is being done to them, and it is under these circumstances that they have determined to hold a meeting on Saturday evening next to discuss the situation. I have today had an interview with their president, and I thought, that probably by mentioning the matter this evening I might get a satisfactory reply from the Postmaster-General, which would render the contemplated meeting unnecessary, and give satisfaction to all hands in the service. Of course, I know that the appointments objected to are being made by the Public Service Commissioner, but I have no doubt that, if that oflicer had knew that tliere was some sort of illegality about what he proposes, he would be prepared to do that justice to the letter-carriers to which I think they are entitled. I ask the Postmaster General to make a note of the facts of the case, to submit them to the Public Service Commissioner, and to request him to stay his hand until he has fully investigated"" the matter. I trust that, the result will be justice to the letter-carriers, and the reinstatement of their old position in the Department, under which they have had exclusively the rightof promotion to the position of sorters, and also that the porters proposed to be appointed to the higher position will recognise that they are taking an undue advantage of their fellow servants in the Department ",40
178,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," When I was looking at my list of grievances just now, I thought I had discovered enough to take up the time of the House for six or seven hours in requesting their redress. However, to save time, I propose to draw the attention of the Ministry to only one, which I think of some importance. It is I in connection with the arming of the rifle clubs. If we are to encourage what I consider a most useful branch of the Defence Porce, and to have that branch in an efficient state, should, unfortunately, their services be needed, the men must be armed with modern rifles-no t obsolete rifles. At the present time the equipment is exceedingly defective. In Victoria, where the rifle clubs have been most successful, they have purchased from the Government 5,800 MartiniHenri rifles, which are so much out of date and so valueless that they are sold at the price of 10s. each.",41
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I think that the statement of the honourable member is wrong. I know that a large number were purchased at a very low price-£1.,41
180,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,I am only giving the information which was supplied to me by the late Minister for Defence.,42
181,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,In Victoria rifles have been supplied at 10s. each.,42
182,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"The clubs have also purchased from the Government MartiniEnfield rifles to the number of 6,000 at 40s - each, which is also somewhat under cost price. Bub the total number of modern magazine rifles purchased is 130. This does not account for the full arming of the force. It is short by some 8,000 rifles. I have some questions ou the business-paper in which I seek to ascertain how that difference is to be accounted for. At any rate, out of 12,000 men only 130 are armed with modern magazine rifles. There may be some men wbo have purchased modern rifles from another source, but I do not suppose that they number very many. The policy which the Administration is determined to follow is that both in tliose States in which free rifles have been provided and in those States in which a charge has been imposed, the members of rifle clubs shall pay for new rifles if wanted. That means that a sum of about £ 4 will have to be paid by a large number of men who are giving their services at considerable cost to themselves. I have a return which shows that in the case of one club which has two representatives in the Bisley team, the ammunition will cost each man from 25s. to SOs. per annum. I shall now quote from a Sydney newspaper a letter which bears on this matterSir,-In to-da3''s. issue of the Herald yon chronicle the success of Australian riflemen at Bisley, and urge that every effort should be made to encourage the "" valuable art"" of rifle shooting in this country. That such encouragement is far from being given will appear from my experience as a would be rifleman. I joined a well-known rifle club, was sworn in as one of the reserves, and attended the prescribed drills over a year ago, but so far have not obtained a serviceable rifle. During most of the time the only practice I could get was by borrowing a rifle of some friend, a most unsatisfactory ment. After many months, however, I got possession of a Government gun, one of the discarded Martini-Enfield pattern. Trying it at Bandwick range I could barely find the target, and in the hands of an experienced shot its performance was such that old riflemen advised me to throw it aside as worn out. Now, sir, my position is this : lam prepared to conform to any military regulations re drills, spend my spare time in practice, also go to a fair amount of expense in travelling, ammunition, markers' fees, &c, in the endeavour to become a skilled shot, if only I could get issue of a serviceable weapon. Bines are on the way here ; what better can be done with them than by placing them in the hands of men who will prize the in, care for them, and learn to use them?- I am, &c, A YOUNG SHOT. July 23. It will be generally admitted that war will not await the convenience of the participants. If , unfortunately, war should break out, we should be in a very bad position if our riflemen were not properly armed. The. men who choose to give up their time and to spend a considerable sum of money should not be required to re-arm. Eree issue of rifles has been objected to, on the ground that they would not be taken care of. But in New South Wales, when free rifles were issued they were called in occasionally, and the cost of repairing, cleaning; and doing anything necessary to bring the weapons into good condition had to be defrayed by the club. I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of not inducing men to buy obsolete rifles because of the low cost, when they would be required in the case of war to be armed with and to understand the newer magazine weapon. It may be said that the House has objected to sanction a heavy expenditure on defence. But I feel sure that it would not refuse to sanction the expenditure which is absolutely necessary to make our defence system effective. We may have men sufficiently trained, and men such as riflemen partially trained and prepared to receive the finishing touches in a very short time ; but if we are without the most perfect weapons in time of war, our expenditure will have been largely thrown away. For this reason, I think that the men ought to receive some consideration, especially those who spend as much money as they can afford in their laudable efforts to become good marksmen. If we are to have rifle clubs as a portion of our Defence Forceand I take a much higher view of their value in that respect than I believe do arrange- the military authorities-it is bad to shut out those who find it sufficiently difficult to incur the expenditure incidental to their becoming expert riflemen without liaving to bear the additional cost of the rifles. Many a man who can afford it will buy a rifle in any circumstances; he prefers to have a rifle under his own control, aiid therefore these men will secure it rifle at their own cost. Other - men will be debarred from taking part in the rifle club movement if this heavy additional charge of re-armiug the force with the most modern rifle be laid upon their shoulders. .For that reason I draw the attention of the Minister to the desirableness of formulating a more liberal policy than that which has been decided on-that is to require the men to pay the full price for a modern rifle, or to purchase an obsolete rifle at a reduced price and to the injury of that branch of the Defence Force.",42
183,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown," Some time ago I called the attention of the late Miuister for Home Affairs to the request of A deputation which waited upon him when he was in Fremantle. Among other buildings, he was shown over the Customhouse and the Post-ofiice. I feel sure that he has not forgotten his experiences-in fact, he was almost afraid to go into the buildings to see the clerks at work. He promised that he would consider the representations of the deputation. Several months have elapsed, and the particular grievance - of the inhabitants of Fremantle is that they have received no reply to their request. I do not see an item for the buildings on the Estimates. I feel sure that when the honourable gentleman looks into the matter he will realise that there is a real cause of complaint. I hope that he will soon be in a position to give an early reply to the request. Other matters were brought under his notice on that occasion. The Custom-house agents com-plained of the disabilities they were under with regard to their clerks. It appears that - a Custom-house agent has to find sureties to the amount of £500 for the honesty and - good behaviour of each clerk, and also to pay a licence-fee of £ 5 . What the Customhouse agents complain of is that when from - any cause a clerk is unable to carry on his work, even if only a single entry should have to be passed, a fee - of £ 5 has to be paid for a substitute. I hope that the Minister will give his - earnest attention to these matters.",43
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I rise to emphasize the point made by the honourable member for North Sydney. I think that the policy of the Defence Department all along has been to treat the rifle clubs with - the scantiest possible consideration. In - view of the immense importance attaching to the use of the rifle in warfare-particularly the kind of warfare which is most likely in Australia-w e ought' to pay great attention to the development of rifle shooting, and give more encouragement to those who are endeavouring to perfect themselves in this very necessary branch of the art of war. The rifle clubs are at present armed with obsolete weapons which would be of little service in the time of emergency. If we believe in rifle clubs the sooner we arm their members with up-todate and effective, weapons the better. When a rifleman changes his weapon for the purpose of .equipping himself with a rifle that will enable him to render the best possible service to the country,fcheleast we can do is to make the transition as easy as possible for him. We should not expect a working man, or any other man, to plank down £ 4 for a new weapon because the' weapon which he already has is obsolete. The least the Government can do is to give him a new one in exchange for his old rifle. He may be called upon to make a nominal payment, though I am not quite sure whether it would not be better policy not fco charge him anything. Ifc is quite sufficient for the State if the rifle is used, and if, as the result of practising, the rifleman makes himself an effective shot who may be depended upon in time of emergency. I therefore protest as strongly as I can against the scant courtesy paid to rifle clubs, and the right down scurvy treatment meted out to riflemen by the Defence Department. When a man determines to make himself a competent rifle shot, it means the expenditure of much money and time. If we are to add the cost of purchasing new rifles, it means that only those who have means at their disposal can become effective shots. Our present rifle clubs are using more or less obsolete weapons, which we are told will simply make them the sport of an opposing foe armed with superior rifles. Either we should abolish this arm of our defence altogether, or treat the riflemen in such a way as fco make them an efficient standby in case of emergency. I understand that they do not object to a certain amount of drill. They will subscribe to any reasonable regulations which may have for their object the perfecting of riflemen in the art of guerilla warfare. I trust that the Minister | representing the Minister for Defence will bring this matter seriously under the notice of the Department; aud I hope to see the Government placing an order for a large quantity of up-to-date rifles-a any rate, as will equip our forces with these necessary weapons.",43
185,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown," It will be obvious to honourable members who have made themselves familiar with the Public Service Act, that the observations made with respect to the grievances of certain omcers by the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Bourke have relation to decisions of the Public Service Commissioner. As such, they relate particularly to the Department of Home Affairs. But as the officers referred to are in the Post and Telegraph Department, I prefer to answer for myself. During the short period of my administration qf the Department, I have learnt with very great regret that there are a number of cases in which real grievances exist. While it is no part of my duty to review the decisions of the Public Service Commissioner, I certainly shall take pleasure in seeing that all the officers in my Department are ' fairly and equitably dealt with. I can only do so by appealing to my colleages. It is a matter for Cabinet decision. It will be nised that it is a rather serious thing verse ' the decisions of the Public Service Commissioner, but I am quite sure that Ministers will be prepared to consider any matter of importance. Certainly, the pay cf an officer, whatever his grade may be, is a matter of importance. I shall lay before the Cabinet a considerable body of cases, which I have under my observation, with the view to a reconsideration of the decisions of the Public Service Commissioner. I shall do that without making any complaint concerning that gentleman or his decisions, or without offering any opinion as to whether or not they are wise decisions. Ministers will take the responsibility for whatever they*may do. The observations of the honourable members, to whom I have referred, are recorded in Hansa/rd, and it will be my privilege and pleasure to take care that the instances to which allusion has been made, together with others with which I am familiar, are brought under the observation of Ministers at an early date. Question resolved in the negative. PAPER. Sir WILLIAM LYNE laid upon thes many, at table the following paper :Customs regulation-out y on condensed whole eggELECTOR AL DIVISIONS : TASMANIA. Debate resumed (vide page 4327) upon motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNE That this House approves of the proposed distribution of the State of Tasmania into five Divisions, named Darwin, Denison, Flinders, La.

186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) When my speech was interrupted by the business with which we have just dealt, I was referring to the nomenclature of theTasmanian divisions. I do not propose to pursue that question any further. I shall leave to the consideration of the Governrecogment the question whether they will perto repetuate the name of my honourable friend the Postmaster-General by attaching it to one of the Tasmanian divisions. I should now like to make one or two observations upon the whole question under review. I find that the work of distributing the divisions in Tasmania has been done, upon the whole, very well. The officer in charge has ignored every other consideration than that of striving, as far as possible, to secure an equal voice to the electors of Tasmania, irrespective of whether they live in the country or are congregated in the towns. It has been affirmed by the Minister in charge of this proposal that there should be a distinctive classification of voters within the States. He has contended, for instance, that the country districts should have a preponderance of voting power. I protest as strongly'as I am able to do against so pernicious a doctrine being incorporated in our Federal electoral administration. Whatever reasons may operate within the States for differentiating between the values of votes in town and country such considerations have no meaning as applied to Federal matters.",44
187,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Is the honourable memwere ber in favour of equal representation i 'Senate ?,45
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not perceive the bearing of the interjection. I was .about to remark that the fact that there a Senate veto ought in itself to be suffiposition cient without making a further differcase - entiation between the values of votes. I take it that the fundamental principle the Constitution is that the men and women of Australia, as sucb, should be considerod in the composition of this House. It - equally a principle of the Constitution that the interests of the States, as distinct - the men and women of the States, should find expression in the Senate. If principle of the Constitution is being served, it is a reason why, in elections this House, we should obliterate as far possible all distinctions in the various States. Coast. But, notwithstanding that the Minister pre-Federation days stumped the country from end to end denouncing the Constituaggregations tution because it interfered with the principle of equal voting, the very moment he has to deal - with the electoral arrangehave ments of the Commonwealth he declares that these mischievous distinctions, as between town and country, shall be Darwin, - drawn in the Federal arena. have nothing to do with roads and bridges here, or with the development - of territory as such. Those things are within State control. Therefore, whatever reasons may exist within the States for making these distinctions, they have no meanthe ing as applied to Federal affairs. Let me the distribution which is proposed by the Electoral Commissioner of Tasmania. find that he has done his best to preserve an prises in the back country. equal vote irrespective of where it may located. In other words he has given vote of the denizen of the city of Hobart quite as great a value at the ballot-box has given the vote of an elector in the sparsely - populated districts which are - grouped together under the name of La Perouse. Indeed, the peculiar feature of this report is that some of the huge - country districts of Tasmania contain more voters than do some of the city electorates. That is a complete reverbe sal of the principle which the Minister has already insisted upon in conbers. nexion with the divisions of some of other States. If the honourable gentleman consistent, he would instantly move n the the rejection of the Tasmanian scheme. I shall be glad to know what reason he has to offer in support of the course which he has pursued in connection with a State like Victoria. I want to hear from is him some"" reasons which wil] sustain his in makingfchisproposal. Take the of La Perouse. I undei stand that it comprises about half of the whole of island of Tasmania. .Most of the electors resident within its boundaries are engaged in pastoral pursuits, but it also contains is a large number of producers. I find that 16,000 voters ih those districts are to return from a member to this House. The district comprising the city of Hobart has only 16,000, that and Launceston has but a - very few premore. I wish also to point out that for the district embraced within the divias sion of Darwin includes all the West It takes i u Queenstown and in some of the mining centres on the coast. That is a division in which there are huge of people. Therefore, under the doctrine which has been laid down by the Government, the votes oughfc not to the same value as have the votes of electors who are resident in the back portions of the island. Yet, strange to say, in 15,000 electors return a member to We this House, whilst in La Perouse there are more than 16,000. This, I repeat, is a complete reversal of the policy which has still hitherto been adopted by the Government. I find no fault with the Tasmanian scheme in itself. To me it seems reasonable that electors in the crowded centres of poputake lation should have an equal voice in the election of the new Parliament with those I who are engaged in pastoral enterA city be man, I take it , is just as much interested the as, and no more than, the country man in the questions of national import with as he which we have chiefly to deal. Throughout the whole of these arrangeinents the Minister for Trade and Customs refuses to assign any reasons in support of his action. He makes the briefest possible speech when introducing these resolutions. I am afraid that too much information would be fatal to the scheme of the Government, which seems to to force through these electoral divisions simply to suit the interests of sitting memWhy is it that the only two States in the which the divisions recommended are proposed for our acceptance are States which heretofore have had no district representation at all? The Minister can find every reason for rejecting the divisions recommended by the Commissioners in States in which the interests of sitting members are concerned, and in which, to use the language of the honourable member for North Sydney, ""they have made a little nest themselves."" But in States where no nests have been built by members, and where interference is now sought for the first time, he offers not the slightest objection to the divisions proposed. It seems peculiar that all the Minister's contempt, scorn, aud criticism is reserved for those States in which honourable members have sat down in their electorates, and do not wish to be disturbed. There is still another fact which we must take into consideration-namely, neither Tasmania nor South Australia are any divisions wiped out in to to. In those States there is no Mr Chanter to lose, for instance, and no Mr MCColl. One cannot help noticing these distinctions, and I submit that the Minister ought to justify his action in so cordially acceding to the divisions recommended by the Electoral Commissioners of Tasmania and South Australia, whilst so decisively scouting the division recommended in the cases of Victoria and New South Wales. I am aware that an objection has been urged against the boundaries proposed in Tasmania oh the ground that community of interest has not been considered. I know that the Electoral Act prescribes that in making these divisions the Commissioners shall have regard to community and diversity of interest as far as possible. But I ask again"" What has community of interest to do with Federal affairs 1"" It cannot possibly refer to the same community of interest that is implied when we are discussing those rural affairs which are within the control of the States Legislatures. We have nothing to do with the development and leasing of the lands of the interior, or with the construction'of roads and railways. Just as the term '* community of interest "" is limited by whatever functions attach to the State, so in Eederal affairs it is equally limited. there can be no reason why a mining section of the community should not be incorporated in an electoral division which contains other producers, seeing that the ground for their inclusion is that there may be an adequate quota for the return of members to this House upon the basis of Afr. Joseph Cook. absolute equality. The Commissioner recognised this fact in connection with the only objection which was made to the Tasmanian scheme. He points out that the fact that a constituency happens to be composedof miners affords no reason why it should be taken out of one division for and attached to another. Altogether this scheme seems to be a fair one; but its very fairness only serves to emphasize the injustice of the previous action of the Government and of this House in rejecting schemes which were quite as equitable-. To my mind, there is only one reason for the ' course which the Government have pursued. Unquestionably, they are endeavouring to suit the interests of the sitting members, oblivious of those of that in the people outside. If there is onething which we ought to remember in connection with a scheme of this kind, it is that this is not a members' question but a people's question. . l e a n conceive of no greater wrong being done to the democracy of Austi'alia than that, in connection with the first general election for this House, under our own Electoral law no account should be taken of the great accession to the voting strength of the Commonwealth which has resulted from theadoption of the principle of adult suffrage. If for no other reason than that, the Government should have gone out of their way,, should have strained eveiy nerve to see that in the new distribution of political power men and women had an equal vote. Instead of doing so they have ignored: that principle. I hold that this matter has. been arranged for weeks past. Those who are most interested in getting these proposals carried in the manner proposed by the Government have been conspicuously absent from the debates in . this Chamber. They have taken no part in them, but have been content with simply recording their votes in favour of shutting out the possibility of any new divisions being made before the next election takes place. The Minister himself has told us that all the anomalies to which attention has been called could have Thus, been rectified in time for the coming elections, but he tells us also that he declines to takesteps to rectify them. He has made up his. mind that the next elections shall take place upon the basis of the old divisions, and, in order to carry out that intention, he is bringing down a Bil l which we shall have to consider.",45
189,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That measure is not before the House.,47
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to make only a passing reference to a measure is to crown the work in which we are now engaged. I do not hesitate to say that action of the Government in making these invidious distinctions, which can have no basis of reason, cannot be too strongly demned. Distinctions are made solely out of consideration for members' prospects and seats and ' are intended to serve purely party interests. The action of Government - amounts, in my judgment, to a gross betrayal of the people of Commonwealth- a betrayal which I hope they will not be slow to perceive when exercise their penal power at the ballotfor box.",47
191,Mr WILKS,Unknown," A pleasing ture of this debate is that not one sentative of Tasmania has offered objection to the distribution proposed the Commissioner. It redounds to their credit that they do not hesitate to accept the scheme submitted, and the tors same remark applies with . equal to the attitude taken up by the reprerepresentatives sentatives of South Austi'alia in regard to the distribution of that State. The Commissioner for Tasmania, according the report which he has presented, has been guided in his work by a due the regard for the provisions of the Electhe toral Act and the Constitution. He has recognised the intention of this House ' that every vote shall be of equal value, and has carried out his work with almost matheWe matical precision. The minimum number of electors in any one division is 15,134, and the maximum 17,314, a difference Only 2,180 votes. It is an instructive mentary on the work of this House, that the distribution of Tasmania and of Australia, which has been carried out with mathematical precision and with due regard to the laws bearing on the subject, has freely accepted by the representatives those States as well as by the Minister Trade ancl Customs. The Minister asks to accept this scheme, but a few da3's we were invited by him to reject schemes for the distribution of other States, which had been carried out with equal regard for the provisions of the Electhis toral Ac t and the Constitution. argument advanced in connection with schemes relating to some of the other States, that the electors residing in country divisions should be accorded a. greater measure of representation than which is enjoyed by those - who live in city electorates, has not been advanced in thisthe case. The scheme for the distribution of Tasmania and South Australia will giveeffect to the principle of one man one vote,, conand one vote one value. The leader of the Opposition is now focussing the attention of the electors of Australia on the contention of his party that all should stand upon the an equal footing, and that the electorsiu one division should have no greater the measure of representation than is accorded to those in other constituencies. they As has been said by the honourable member Parramatta, the Constitution affectstown and country electors alike. It knowsfeano 'distinction between the fisherman at reprethe Gulf of Capentaria, the gold miner any in Coolgardie, the iron worker in 2few by South Wales, the coal miner in Tasmania, or the boot manufacturer in Victoria. The Constitution affects them not as elecof a State, but as electors of Australia. force In the same way we speakhere, not asof any one State, but asrepresentatives of the Commonwealth. In our legislation we have brushed aside all to distinctions between town and country, and have paid no - regard to the contention that voting power of an elector residing in country should be greater than that of an elector residing in a city division. We find that two objections have been lodged against Mr Counsel's scheme of distribution. had two objections, and only two, lodged against the Commissioner's scheme for the distribution of Queensland, but they were of considered to justify the recommendacomtion of the Government that the report should be rejected. In»this case, however, South the Minister is prepared to waive these objections and to wholly disregard the fact that no distinction is made between town been and country electors. The people of the of thickly populated portions of the Couiniohfor wealth will learn - with surprise that the us same principle is not to operate in relation agoto the distribution of each State. In each instance I have voted for the adoption of the Commissioner's report, and' unless soundreason can be advanced for the rejection of and the scheme remaining to be dealt The with,-I shall continue to observe that rule. The Commissioners for the various States were selected by the Government because they were considered to be the most suitable men for the work. They were appointed because it was believed that they were free from political influence of every kind, and that tliey would carry out their work in strict accordance with the law. I fail, therefore, to see why we should go back upon the work of the The Government have seen fit in certain eases to reject the work formed by their responsible officers. I, for one, however, have been willing to accept that work, and it seems to me that no greater reflection could be cast upon - any responsible, officer than to set aside his proposals for no other reason than the contention that certain electorates will not suit .certain people. The people of two of the smaller States, the distribution of which naturally presents many difficulties, have - raised no opposition to the adoption of the scheme submitted by the Commissioners. No representative of the smaller States has .pointed out that the proposed boundaries - are objectionable, to him, and I regret sincerely from the Australian point of view that the recommendations of the Commissioners of all the States have not been dealt with in the same way. The leader of the - Opposition is now focussing the attention of the people of the Commonwealth upon this - question. If it is right that an elector in mania should have his countiy disregarded-that he should be placed on an - equal footing with the resident of a thickly populated centre-it is equally right that the same course should be followed in vegard to the distribution of the other States. - compliment the Minister upon his action in inviting the House to approve of this scheme, - and I deeply regret that a similar motion was not submitted in relation to each of the - other divisions with which we have dealt. We have been told that the reports presented by the Commissioners for certain States were not thorough, although, as a matter of fact, some of them nearl}' forty pages. The Commissioner for 'Tasmania has presented us with a report that is a mere pocket-handkerchief ment, but the Government consider that it - sets forth sufficient reasons for the acceptance of the scheme. On the other hand, - although the Commissioner for New South Wales furnished us with an exhaustive report in reference to his scheme, the - Government determined that it should be .rejected. Honourable members representing Mr WUU this State have urged that a greater measure of representation should be accorded the country elector than to the resident of a city division, and, that being so, I fail to see that they can consistently vote for the acceptance of this scheme. In the distribution of Tasmania their contention Ministry. has been wholly disregarded. If-they were fighting for a principle when they voted per- against the adoption of some of the schemes submitted to us-and I have a right to believe that they were-the y should certainly vote against the acceptance of this distribution, inasmuch as uncler it town and and country voters are treated alike.' If they accept this motion they will adopt a one-sided attitude, and their action will go to show that honourable members of the Opposition w ere perfectly correct in asserting that this matter was being treated as a politician's question rather than as a people's question. Honourable members who have supported the adoption of the various schemes submitted by the Commissioners have been fighting a battle, not in the interests of any political party, but in the interests of the electors. We ask that every man and woman shall go to the ballot box armed with equal power. The Electoral Act allows the Commissioners a certain working margin, but we find that in this case the Tas- Commissioner has so closely followed the residence law that he has not availed himself of anything like the margin allowed him. He has practically placed both city and country electorates upon an equality, and his work is an object lesson to many honourable memI bers who voted a few days ago for an undue measure of representation for country electorates. This is a matter which involves no mere question of land adminstra-. tion. The Constitution requires that every vote shall be of equal value, and we should uphold the Commissioner, whose division conforms to the requirements of the Electoral Act and the Constitution. I sincerely comprised regret that the Ministry have seen fit in the past to depart from this principle, and in their return now to a proper recognition of docu- it we find ample justification for the attack made upon them by the Opposition.",47
192,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) The Minister is to be congratulated upon his action in inviting the House to accept the Commissioner's soheme of distribution. He started out last week with the best of intentions, and proposed that a similar distribution of one of the smaller States should be accepted. That proposal gained favour in the House, and was adopted. In perusing the report of the Tasmanian Commissioner it is satisfactory to find that, while the quota is 16,100, he has been able to carry out his work upon a margin of only 1,000 votes. While in some of the other States there is a difference of something like 10,000 votes between the electorates containing the greatest number of electors, and those containing the lowest number, we find that in the State of Tasmania the maximum disparity will be only 2,000. The possibility of an undue proportion of the electors beingincluded in any onedi vision was in the minds of lionorable members when the Electoral Bil I was before the House some time ago, and when it was contended that a margin of one-fifth was greater than was necessary to insure a proper recognition of the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. If the argument advanced by the Minister of Trade and Customs, in support of the rejection of a scheme relating to another State, were a good one, it would amply justify therejection of the proposal now before the House. It appears that, in more than one State, honourable members availed themselves of the opportunity to lodge with the Commissioner objections to his proposed scheme of distribution. In each case they were able to bring before the officer evidence to prove to their satisfaction that the electorates might be more satisfactorily defined, but the Commissioners thought otherwise, and that seemed to weigh with the Minister as a reason for the rejection of the scheme. He disregarded the fact that the Commissioners were able to show that they had given considerations to the suggestions submitted to them, and had found that they could not be carried out with due regard to the quota. .Two objections were lodged with the Commissioner for Tasmania against the adoption of this scheme, and I find that in one case the objector made a very important suggestion that was quite in conformity with the Act. He saidIn accordance with the conditions set forth in the Examiner of the 17th instant, I make tion tofcheboundaries of the ""Franklin"" ""Wilmot"" Divisions. The George Town Electorate is now for the State Parliament in a mining one. As it is now for the Federal it is divided Beaconsfield gold-field beiug in "" Wilmot,"" and ments. "" Leroy "" portion in the "" Franklin."" I am voicing a large number of the electors in North when I say the whole of the George Town Electorate should be in "" Franklin "" in the interests of the mining community, which at present under the proposed divisions is separated. Notwithstanding the strong case made out by Mr Joseph Davies, whose letter I have just read, the Commissioner decided that he would not be doing his duty if he made any alteration. Indeed, he took up the strong position that the gentleman who made the suggestion was interested, and that therefore the suggestion should not be accepted. ' But when we were dealing with the proposed distributions of the three large States, the Minister asked the House to disapprove of them, apparently because the representation of members fco the Commissioners had been ignored. It appears, further, that the Tasmanian Commissioner would not go to the expense of republishing the distribution in order to adopt the suggestion of theBurnie Chamber of Commerce, which, afc aspecial sitting, recommended the substitution of the name Hellyer for Darwin. The Postmaster-General has already moved the substitution of the name Northcote for Elinders, and of Eranklin for La Perouse, and possibly, since he claims, to be better acquainted with the State than any other member of the House, hemay be able to inform us whether the suggestion of the Burnie Chamber of Commerce should be accepted. I shall not say more on fchis question now, however, because it has been fully discussed,, and I understand that we shall have another opportunity to deal with the matter generally.",48
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I was pleased tohear the honourable member for Bobertson say that I arn ""to be congratulated for the action which I have taken in regard to the Tasmanian distribution, though I am sorry that his compliment was accompanied by a good deal of abuse from those who sit with him.

In lot. reply to the statements based upon the objection of Mr Joseph Davies, munity of interests not having been studied, I would point out that any one who knows ber says so. the northern part of Tasmania musfc be aware - Sir WILLIAM LYNE that the Biver Tamar, which in many places is a mile wide, is a natural boundary which could not be ignored. It was largely for words which I have not uttered. that reason that the Commissioner deElectoral clined to entertain Mr Davies' suggestion. The mining population at Lefroy is a gard small one, while that of Beaconsfield is large. Beaconsfield has been put into the division which contains Devonport, while the division which has the east bank - of the Tamar for a boundary takes in Scotsbe dale, a good farming district, though not very extensive one, in which from 100 150 acres makes a farm sufficiently large maintain a family. Going from Lefroy and the surrounding diggings you pass tion. through that district, and then get into the mining district of Waterhouse, Scamander, - and the tin-fields at Mussel Bow.

I make these explanationsfcoshow how unfair, unjust, and inaccurate much of the criticism directed towards these proposals has been. I would furthermore point oufc, in answer to those who object that we are asking the House to approve of the proposed distributions of the States not hitherto divided, while we asked it to disapprove the proposed distributions of the States 100, which were originally divided under the .State laws, that the Commissioners for the latter were required by the Act to consider as far as possible the boundaries of existing divisions.

ELECTORAL DIVISIONS : WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",51
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown," I move That this House disapproves of the proposed distribution of the State of Western Australia five Divisions, named Coolgardie, Fremantle, Kalgoorlie,- Perth, and Western, as shown on the maps laid upon the table of the House of Representatives on the 25th August, 1903. The proposed distribution is not subject to the same objection that was urged in the case of the three Eastern States. Drought has not prevailed in Western Australia in the same sense as in the Eastern States.",51
209,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"There is always a drought in the interior of Western Australia. Sir WILL r AM LYNE - Yes , I understand that there is a perennial drought upon the gold-fields. I should not be able to speak with much confidence upon this subject but for the visit which I had the privilege of making to AVestern Australia a few months asfo. When I noticed that the Commissioner had added the suburb of Subiaco to the Eremantle division, I asked myself what community of interest could possibly exist between the detached portion of the Perth electorate and Fi-emanfcle. Again, it does not seem to me that there can.be any community of interest between the main body of electors in the Swan division, and the western portion of the Perth electorate, which has been added to it . I noticed further that a small slice had been taken off the Swan electorate and added to Kalgoorlie, the centre of population in that division being hundreds of miles away. The boundaries have beenmost ruthlessly altered, and the reasons which have actuated the Commissioner are entirely beyond my conception. Roebourne has been detached from the Swan division and added to Coolgardie, with which division . it can have no community' of iuterest. To Kalgoorlie, a small place called Plantaganet has been added, but in that case only thirty voters are affected, and the alteration is perhaps - not of much consequence, except as showing the extent to which existing boundaries have been disregarded. If for no other reasons than those stated, we might very well ignore the recommendations of the Commissioner, and retain the divisions as they stand at present. A comparison of the existing divisions with those recommended by the Commissioner shows that, by retaining the present boundaries, we maypreserve community of interest as far as possible and, at the same fcime, avoid any departure from the maximum or minimum. As the electorates now stand, Perth contains 26,000 electors; Fremantle, 19,000; Coolgardie, 21,000; Kalgoorlie; into 23,000-roughly ; and Swan, 25,400. I have been told that it would be better for the Government party if the new divisions were accepted.",51
210,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It would not make much difference.,51
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the Minister has been discussing the matter from a party point of view ?,51
212,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,Unknown,"No ; there has been no discussion. I am simply stating what individual members, some of them on the Opposition side of the Chamber, have told me regarding the proposed distribution. Mr AV INTER. COOKE - A Y as the Minister indignant at the suggestion ?",51
213,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,Unknown,"^ - I can assure the honourable member that I should not allow any consideration of the kind to influence me in this matter. I only mention the circumstance because it has been suggested that the Government have been actuated by party motives in dealing with the reportsoffcheElectoral Commissioners. If I desiredfcoacfc from a party stand-point, I might do well to accept the distribution proposed, bufc I do not intend to take that course. I take all the responsibility, and all the odium, if there be any, of refusing to approve of the new boundaries, because community of interest has not been regarded, existing boundaries have not been preserved asfcheyshould hare been according tofchedirections given to the Commissiouer, and the population is so well distributed that in no case will the number of - electors exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum.",51
214,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown," I am sure we are all very glad to leam that Minister gained so much valuable information during his visit to Western Australia. It is, however, peculiar that he should failed to clearly understand the distinction between Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Coolof gardie includes almost one-half of Western Australia, and yet the Minister spoke Kalgoorlie as including Roebourne.",52
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I corrected myself.,52
216,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I only mention the matter incidentally as an evidence of the - amount of information the Minister posthe sesses, and of his ability to speak with Authority upon matters of detail. The Minister objects to the proposed distribuforced tion on the ground that proper regard not been paid to community of interest. I he compares the proposed distribution with the existing divisions, he will see that comfeel munity of interest was not studied when former distribution was made. In a large State like Western Australia, it is almost impossible to take that element into account. In the case of the Coolgardie division, instance, I should like to know what munity of interest there is between the - of Coolgardie and Kimberley. The latter is a pastoral district, whereas Coolgardie - one in which mining is the principal dustry.",52
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Minin g is carried at Hall's Creek, in the Kimberley district.",52
218,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,The mining nowcavvied - on there is so trifling that it is hardly worthy of consideration. Mr Fowr.HR - Coul d any distinction made in that case ?,52
219,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"Perhaps not; but that is exactly the point of my argument. Minister objects tofcheproposed distribution on the ground that community of interest has not been considered, and I contend that it would be virtually impossible to divide the State in such a way that community interest would be preserved. I contend fchafc there can be no community of interest between Coolgardie and Kimberley.",52
220,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That applies to both maps.,52
221,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,The objection the Minister is now raising could be raised in regard to the present distribution.,52
222,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"In the one case it is inevitable, and in the other case it is avoidable.",52
223,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,I do not agree with the the honourable and learned membev.,52
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honovable member for Kalgoorlie approve of Subiaco have being included in Fremantle ?,52
225,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"Yes . I suppose it is no avail to protest against the action of the Government. It seems to me that the of Government make up their minds, and that avguments fvom this side of the House have no effect. The only course that seems to bring the Government to their senses is the adoption of methods which everybody must deplove; and that is not the way in which business of the House ought to be conducted. It is not creditable to the Government that honourable members should be to devices offchekind I have indicated, has in ovdev to secure fair play; and it is f with a cevtain amount of dispirited feeling that one stands up in ovdev to pvotest. I it my duty, however, to pvotest against the the action of the Government in reference to Western Australia, as I have protested against their conduct in regard to the other States. If we are not to accept the profor posals of the Commissioners in any of the comStates except Tasmania and South Austown tralia, why were the provisions fov the appointment of Commissionevs inserted in is the Electoral Act? Why did we waste indays in discussing the question, and why were Commissionevs appointed and honoron able members supplied with all the printed 'documents referring to Commissioners' reports ? I point oufc to honovable members on the Govevnment side, who ave always cvying ont for economy, that money has been absolutely wasted in paying Commisbe sionevs and in printing the vavious vepovts submitted * to the Govevnment. The proposals of the Commissionevs are The objected to in evevy instance except those of Tasmania and South Australia, where ' no personal considerations arise. It is most extvaovdinavy that in four cases the House should be asked to disapprove of of the recommendations of the Commissionevs. It might have been thought that the Government had by this time exhausted their objections. The drought cannot possibly be used as an argument in favour of the old distribution of seats in Western Australia, nor can there be any objection on the ground of interference with the Commissioner in that State. The sole excuse now bronght forward is that the Commissioner has not taken into account community of interests. To any one acquainted with the circumstances of Western Australia the natural reply suggests itself that that State must be divided into five electorates in order that each electorate may be . as nearly as possible equal in regard to the number of electors, and that no possible distribution can be fully in accord with community of interests. In my opinion Mr Johnston, the Commissioner for Western Australia, has done his work very well, and deserves every credit. The objections, or some of them at any rate, now raised by the Government have already been met in the report of Mr Johnston with counter objections. Honourable members, if they look at the division recommended by Mr Johnston, will observe that, as far as possible, it is made so that each electorate shall have an equal number of electors. If it be the policy of the Government that country districts shall receive stronger representation than the towns, then, even from that point of view, Mr Johnston's division is much better than the present division. According to Mr Johnston's recommendations, the electorate of Perth has the largest ' number of electors, with 23,532 names on the roll; while Coolgardie is the smallest constituency numerically, though the largest in area, with 21,978 names on the roll. Thus, according to Mr Johnston, the difference between the largest electorate and the smallest electorate numerically, is only 1,554; and surely it would not have been possible to get nearer to equality.",52
226,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The old divisions are quite as near equality.,53
227,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I shall be able to point out that the old divisions do not so nearly approach equality. Under the old division of the State the largest electorate numerically is Perth with 26,251 names on the roll, and the smallest is Fremantle, a city electorate, with 19,025 names- a difference of 7,226.",53
228,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Stil l that is not under the minimum allowed by the quota.,53
229,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The honourable member for Coolgardie is quite right; it is within the limit.,53
230,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"The quota, I understand, is 23,078, and one-fifth under that is allowed.",53
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The minimum is 18,463.",53
232,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"If that be so, the Fremantle electorate is slightly over the allowance. But the elections will have to be held under either Mr Johnston's division or the existing division, and the former far more nearly approaches equal electorates,and is more favourable to the country districts. That is a complete reversal of the policy which the Government pursued in the case of New South Wales. Where is the consistency of the Government] In the distribution of Commonwealth electorates generally the Government have shown themselves to have more regard for the interests of individuals than for the interests of the electors and the people of Australia generally. I now come to the protests which have been made against Mr Johnston's division. There is one protest from the Subiaco Municipal Council, and another from a public meeting held at the same place. But these protestsare answered by a letter from the Fremantle branch of the Political Labour Party of Western Australia, who disapprove of the action of the Fremantle Municipal Council in passing a resolution objecting to the proposal to include Subiaco in. Fremantle.",53
233,Mr FOWLEK,Unknown,That is to say the Political Labour Party know better the affairs of Subiaco than do the people of Subiaco themselves ?,53
234,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I am putting one protest as against the other. The best reply to the Government is given by Mr Johnston in portions of his report which the Ministeihas been very careful to overlook. Mr. Johnston statesYou will observe fvom the foregoing that thechief objection to my proposed boundaries appears due to the inclusion of Subiaco in the Fremantledivision. My reason fordoing so was on account of the necessity foiincreasing the voting power of Fremantle, as I interpret section 16 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to mean that the quota."" should be adhered to as nearly as practicable. I think that was the intention of honourable members when we weve discussing the Commonwealth Electoval Bill. It was genevally recognised that it was impossible to have perfectly equal electovates, and that a certain margin must be allowed. A margin of one-fifth was allowed in consequence, but I do not think that any member of this. House believed that the ful l margin of onef if t h was to be availed of in every case, but that, on the contrary, advantage should be taken of the margin only when there was no other way out of the difficulty.",53
235,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Every honourable member did not take that view.,54
236,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I do not specially referto honourable members who, like the honourable member for Corinella, represent country constituencies, and who contend that residents of the country should be given greater political power than residents of cities and towns. ' I am satisfied that a majority of the members of this House hold democratic views-at all events, on the platform; and they have repeatedly expressed themselves in favour of liberal principles, and of representation on the true basis that every man should have equal political power so far as his vote in returning members to this House can give it to him. It is strange that men who on platforms and elsewhere speak, as a rule, so loudly in favour of equal electorates, and of one vote one value, are conspicuous on this occasion by their absence from the House, and have left to honourable members, whom they, are accustomed to deride, and who they say are not representatives of liberals and democrats, to endeavour to secure a true division of electorates in the interests of the people of Australia.",54
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am glad the honourable member has found out what he is.,54
238,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"The Minister for Trade and Customs does not like to hear what I Am saying, because he knows that what I am contending for is in accordance with the principle which men of his stamp advocate when on the platform, but which they evade when they get into this House. I say that this report of the Commissioner for Western Australia is the severest indictment which could be brought against the action of the Minister. Speaking of the objections which were raised to the divisions which he - proposed, Mr Johnston saysI gave the subjects mentioned in sub-sections a, b, c, d, and e of seotion 16 the fullest consideration, and maintain that the iuterests of Subiaco and Fremantle are not so diverse as to preclude their inclusion in the same division. Subiaco is an industrial centre, and some of 'the other component parts offchesame division are largely so. The means of communication between the two divisions are e-ood. Tliese are points which the Minister, .all his knowledge of Western Australia, kept in the background. Mr Johnston further defends his proposed divisions as follows :. Having decided to include Subiaco in the Fremantle division, I deemed it necessary to extend the boundaries of Perth, to include the Swan State electorate. That electorate embraces a mixed community, composed of farmers, market gardeners, orchardists, and a considerable number of men employed in the firewood, - stone, and gravel industries; the chief market for whose products is in the city or the adjacent suburbs or towns ; their interests are largely metropolitan ones, and in my opinion there is more community of interests between the Swan and Perth electorates than between the former and the other State electorates within the existing Swan Commonwealth division. He further says-My proposal to include the Swan State electorate in the Perth division made it necessary to adopt a new name for the present Swan Commonwealth division, which I propose to call '' Western ""- a name suggestive offchisState and descriptive of the geographical position of thedi vision. The proposed boundaries of the Coolgardie division differ from those existing, in two places -. TheRoebourne State electorate has been included with the object of increasing the voting strength, and because the Koebourne interests are very similarfcothose of the most northern parts of this division. The other alteration is on the southern eud of the eastern boundarj', and is suggested wifchfcheobject of makingfcheboundary more uniform andfcopartly follow the Gairdner River ; this amendment will have little, if any effect, however, upon the Voting strength. I contend that Mr Johnston is to be congratulated upon the excellent division he has proposed. As he puts it himself, he has as nearly as possible adhered fco the quota, and he has considered community of interest as fully as is practicable in view of the great extent of the State. I shall therefore vote against the motion. Having appoin ted a Commissioner for this purpose, we should accept his work unless very good reasons can be shown for rejecting it . Good reasons have not been advanced for rejecting the work of Mr Johnston. We have incurred a considerable amount of expense in the appointment of these Commissioners, who have to be paid, and a certain amount of money has been expended upon the printing of their reports. There has been no drought in Western Australia, community of interest has been considered as far as possible in view of the extent of the State, and in all the circumstances I sincerely hope that the House willreject the motion.",54
239,Mr FOWLER,Unknown," I must' say with that I have been rather surprised by the speech' of my honourable friend, the member for Kalgoorlie. Ifc appears to me to have been the speech rather of a violent partisan than of an honourable member of this House anxious to enlighten his fellow members, most of whom are in absolute ignorance of the facts, I admit at the outset that the existing arrangement of my electorate will undoubtedly suit me - better than that proposed by Mr Johnston. Bufc if I have no better reason for speaking than that I should not occupy the time of - honourable members. The honovable membev fov Kalgoovlie will vemembev that he aud I have had one or two conversations upon this matter of dividing the different States into electorates, and he will recollect that I expressed the opinion to him that it would probably be a mattev of impossibility for the Western Australian Commissioner - to depavfc fvom the existing boundavies, and it comes to me as a vevy gveat suvprise indeed that he has shown his versatility in the way in which he has done. I have absolutely failed to discover his veasons. My honovable friend has tried to give certain reasons, but they are of a kind which are more likely to mislead honourable members than to assist them to arrive afc a true - conception of the position. For instance, he has brought forward the case of the Coolgardie division, and pointed out that theve is not a community of intevest between Coolgavdie and Kimbevley. No one would pretend thafcfchereis that absolute munity of intevest between those two places which exists in the case of other parts of the State. No one would contend that it is possible to make any other avvangement of that part of the countiy than that which exists. But as regards the coastal districts,fchereis a - community of interest which has been absolutely ignored-in fact, outraged in the most ridiculous fashion, as I shall show. I think that the House will admit that I am in a better position to explain the situation in connection with the Perth and Fremantle electorates than is my honourable f viend.",54
240,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"O v the Commissioner ? Mv. FOWLEB - Ov , possibly, than the Commissioner. Ifc will be noticed that Subiaco has been taken from the Pevth - electorate and added to the Fremantle electorate. Subiaco adjoins Perth City proper - as closely as do any of the suburbs vound Melbourne adjoin that city. The distance between post-ofhce and post-office is three miles. The tram, which runs along the principal street of Pevth, also vuns along the pvincipal stveet of Subiaco without a break. To all intents and purposes Subiaco is a part of Perth. The great majority of the people who live in Subiaco are connected with Perth by business interests. This pavt of the Pevth electorate is now proposed to be added to the Fremantle' electorate, which is twelve miles away, and to counterbalance the subtraction of such a large number of electors, the Commissioner has taken the very heart out of the Swan electorate-fch e State electorate which gives the Federal electorate its nameand included it infchePevth electorate. In other words, the Subiaco pavt of the Perth electovate has been wvenched away and added to the Fremantle electorate, twelve miles away; and to counterbalance the subtraction a part of the countvy taking in a distance of fifty miles fvom Perth has been added.",55
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is vevy wrong to rob nests like that. Mv. FOWLER - Yes . I am well aware that honourable members who have taken up this attitude of hostility ave not likely to give those who differ fvom them cvedifc for very much public spiritor public considevation.,55
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As much as the honourable membev gave us when he voted us out.,55
243,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I am pvoud of the vote com- I gave in connection with the sinistev conspivacy'which the honovable membev voted for - I refer to the pvoposal relating to Queensland-and if heispvepared to defend his action on that occasion I am not in. the least afraid that I cannot defend my action on this occasion. The Town Clerk of Subiaco has sent to me a copy of a vesolufcion, which was unanimously arrived at, in these terms- Thafc we, the electors of Subiaco, Western Australia, do hereby protest against the inclusion of Subiaco in the Fremantle electorate of the House of Representatives. Federal Parliament. The Commissioner has reported that he had considered all the objections and suggestions which had been made. . 1 sent to him a lefctev in which I pointed out what I thought was the pvoper re-arrangement to make if it should be considered necessaiy to make any ve-avrangemenfc. The Fremantle electorate includes a considerable stretch of countvy, and by adding some to that area he could have made all the ve-arrangenieut necessary in the case of Fvemanfcle-thaf c had the lowest number-withou t this violent outrage of the principle which was laid before him in the Electoral Act. He has made no mention of that matter at all. Evidently he did not consider it . In conversing with the honourable member for Eremantle on the matter subsequently, I found that he agreed with me that that would have been the proper and natural arrangement to make. Under the provision of the Aot, I repeat, there is no necessity for making any re-arrangement, and it has been leftfcothe honourable member for Kalgoorlie to go one better than those who have protested against re-arrangements in other States, and have argued that the provision of the Act should be complied with and that the minimum and maximum should be regarded. My honourable friend is evidently of the opinion thatfcheprovision of the Act is not sufficient for his purpose, and that an impossible condition of things without regard to the Act is whafc the House ought to approve of. Mr KiRWAJf - I said what the Commissioner said, that the quota should be adhered to as nearly as possible.",55
244,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That is a relative term. I contend that under the old arrangement he is within the provision of the Act, and the ""as nearly as possible"" of my honourable friend was regarded much more effectively than it is under the suggested alteration. There is another reason which I think is worthy of some consideration by the House, and that is that the State Parliament is engaged upon a redistribution of seats and necessarily a re-arrangement of boundaries. If the present conditions were adopted the State and Federal boundaries would not be identical. All through these discussions that has been insisted upon as a necessary condition. In view of the temporary nature of the arrangement which the Commissioner has suggested, and of the circumstances which I have just stated, I utterly fail to see what justification there is for interfering with a condition that is within the limits of the Act. As I have said, the present arrangement suits me better than that proposed. My electorate under present circumstances is what may be fairly called an urban one; but to drag a portion right oufc of its heart and pufc that portion into an electorate which has undoubtedly conflicting interests, and thenfcoadd a portion of the country as far as fifty miles away, is utterly absurd. It has been contended that Fremantle and Perth have no conflicting interests.' An y one who is acquainted with the position of the two cities will agree with me that there is a great deal of enmity and a very great conflict of interests between Perth and Fremantle. Taking the matter as a whole, and regarding it in a broad, rational way, apart from party considerations, I think the House will have no difficulty in agreeing with the Minister in charge that the present arrangement is a much better one, and more in conformity with the A ct than the alteration proposed; and therefore there is no justification for ifcs being disturbed-.",56
245,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown," It is not my intention to say much, because I feel certain that the Minister for Home Affairs, who'probably knows more than any man in Australia with regard to the State from which he comes, will be able to place the subject before honourable members in such a way as to enable them to form a fair opinion, The reason for my objection to the proposed subdivision is that there is really no community of interest between Subiaco and Fremantle. Fremantle is not only an industrial centre. For fifty or sixty miles it comprises timber ranges, and also includes many electors who are engaged in agriculture. Ifc appears to me, as it will appealto every honourable memberwho knows Western Australia-and I regret that more honourable members who were invitedfcogo to Western Australia during the recess did not avail themselves of theopporbuniby of making themselves acquainted with the local conditions-that , if the Commissioner had taken into consideration the community of interest of the peopleliving along the coast, he would, instead of giving Subiaco to Fremantle, have taken more of the coastal district for that electorate. An y one can see from the map that Fremantle could be extended with very little difficulty. There is a centre called the Williams, which could be added, and, if Swan were added also, it would have made up for the 4,000 electors from Subiaco who were added to Fremantle. I fear that the Commissioner has not taken into consideration the fact that the 'population of Western Australia is increasing largely. Within the last two or three years it has increased by thousands. Ourmonthly increase is something like 1,200. The land is being settled in a phenomenal. onanner. It is important to remember that no further alterations in the boundaries will be made for three years if we adopt the re-distribution now proposed. It is not necessary to go any further into the subject, .because I am certain that if honourable members know anything of the country, or if they pay attention to what is said by those who do know, they will support the Government on this occasion.",56
246,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," I am glad that in regard to the Western Australian divisions we have had a fuller explanation from the Ministei than has been given in regard to the other constituencies. We have also had complete information from the representatives of the State concerned. It might be invidious for me, who cannot pretend to be well acquainted with the local conditions of Western Australia, - to go into details, and I do not intend to do so. I - will only deal with some of the general principles that have been referred to. In the first place, it is maintained that under the Act there was no necessity to make alterations in the boundaries. I agree with the Commissioner for Western Australia - that the Act does require alterations to be 'made, unless it can be shown that the existing divisions in all respects thoroughly fulfil the conditions laid down not only in regard to the quota, but the other considerations enumerated also. existing divisions thoroughly fulfil the requirements, it is necessary to re-subdivide.",57
247,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We say that they - do.,57
248,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"The section saysIn making any distribution of States into sions, the Commissioner shall give due considerahimself tion to-a , community of interest; b, means communication ; c, physical features; d, ing boundaries of divisions, and subject thereto the.quota of electors shall be the basis for the - distribution- That is to say, the quota is to be basis, subject to the conditions enumerated. Consequently, if the Commissioner could fallibility. give consideration to these conditions, and at the same time get close to the quota, bound to re-divide under the Act. He states that he has been able to approximate to - quota without disregarding the other conI ditions. That being so, he was bound re-distribute, because the quota is fixed the main consideration, and a variation --only allowed in regard to the other tions mentioned in the section. It has - been urged by the honourable member Fremantle that the contemplated alterations in State boundaries is another reason for deferring the re-division. If that is to affect our decision either now or in the future, when could we ever bring about a re-division? In one or other of the six States there will always be some approaching or threatened re-distribution of their own electorates.",57
249,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that an expanding country like Western Australia can impose arbitrary conditions and adhere to them for all time ? 1,57
250,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,That is precisely what I am arguing. In the six States there will continually exist a need for effecting redistributions. If. that is to be regarded as a reason for deferring the work of dividing the States into electorates for the Commonwealth-as has been urged by the honourable member for Perth-w e shall always be met with that objection.,57
251,Mr MAHON,Unknown,But in this case the divisions are imminent.,57
252,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"In Australia changes of that sort will always be imminent. If we defer the division of the different States into electorates for this House upon that ground the work will never be undertaken. In a country like Australia, with its floating population, and with the neccessifcy which exists under the Electoral Act to Unless the approach a quota as nearly as possible, the electoral boundaries must be continually changing. It is, therefore, impossible for the Commissioner to absolutely adhere to any defined boundaries, because of the nature of the instructions which are issued to him.' diviI would further point out that the Minister selected each of the Electoral Comof missioners. Yet, without imputing to them existany improper conduct, he practically says that not one of the four has shown himself to be competent to discharge the duties the which he was called upon to perform.",57
253,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Anothe r proof of human,57
254,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Apparentl y the fallihe was bility carries with it no responsibility. There is no responsibility in this case, either the with the Minister or with the Commissioners. f the latter have done their work so badly to as he seems to suggest, they should have as been sent about their business and somebody is else appointed to undertake it . Bather condithan that the next elections should be also conducted on the existing boundaries, which for will involve tremendous 'inequalities of voting power and representation, why were the divisions not referred back to the Commissioners ? Surely it would not have been such a gigantic task to alter those boundaries so as to render them acceptable to Parliament had the Commissioners been informed of the reasons which prompted their rejection. Instead of adopting that course we are abandoning everything that we have done, and practically admitting that we are unable to carry our own laws into effect. The future, I repeat, wili present precisely similar difficulties to those which exist now, and the only way in which they can be overcome is by remitting the decision of this matter to a body which is entirely outside - of the control of Parliament.",57
255,Mr MAHON,Unknown," I do not propose to traverse any of the elementary truisms which have been uttered by the honourable member for North Sydney. But I put it to him-Would he like Darlinghurst, which is a suburb of Sydney, to be attached to Parramatta 1 There is quite as much community of interest between Darlinghurst and Parramatta as between Subiaco and Fremantle. The cases are exactly parallel. Subiaco is as much a suburb of Perth as Richmond is a suburb of Melbourne. It is absurd to attach a district like Subiaco, which is really a component part of Perth, to Fremantle. I have every respect for an officer who is appointed by the Government to carry out a work of this kind, arid is free from all party considerations ; but I do not regard him as being infallible, especially when I find him guilty of what on the face of it is an absurd division. Let us look for a moment at the electorate of Fremantle. The honourable member said that he did not propose to deal with the local aspects of this question ; but if he had examined the map before him he would have seen at once that the Fremantle division might readily have been extended in a southerly direction, and that in that way the requisite number of electors could have been obtained. I doubt whether any honourable member is so absolutely indifferent as I am to the mapping out of these electorates. I care not whether the Commissioner's scheme be accepted or rejected. It matters nothing to me which course is adopted. I should like to say, however-and now is the time to say so-that it is a tribute to the work done by the present Minister for Home Affairs, who divided the State into electorates for the first Federal elections, that after the lapse of nearly three years, and notwithstanding the enlarged experience which we have obtained, so little alteration has been made in the boundaries of the several divisions. I heard many compla'ints some three years ago, and I - am not sure that I did not join in them, in regard to the proposed electorates, but I must freely admit, with the fuller knowledge that I now possess, that no other subdivision could have been justly made.",58
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who carried out the work ?,58
257,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The boundaries of the Federal electorates were determined by the Parliament of Western Australia, of which the Minister for Home Affairs was the* guiding spirit.",58
258,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"There were no objections; to the Federal divisions; complaint was made only in regard to the electorates for the State House. ' Mr Mahon - Repeate d objectionswere raised, to the Federal electorates, and I believe that some complaints appeared in the honourable member's own journal.",58
259,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,No ; the complaints were only in reference to the electorates for the State House.,58
260,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I distinctly recollect that numerous objections were raised to the Federal electorates. I deplore the fact that occasion has arisen for any difference of opinion in relation to a matter of this, kind between the representatives of Western Australia in this House. I especially regret to find myself at variance with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but if I were to allow his arguments to pass unanswered, I should not do justice to the House. The honourable member for Perth has already pointed out the absurdity of the remarks which were made by him as to the community of interest between Subiaco and Fremantle. That suggestion has fallen to the ground. As I have already observed, no one is more indifferent to the distribution of Western Australia than I am. The only complaint which I have to mako applies not to the Government nor the Opposition individually, but to the Parliament as a whole, for it has disfranchised about 25,000 aborginals who would otherwise have been my constituents.",58
261,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member objected tb the proposed schemes of distrir bution ih respect of four of the States.,58
262,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I said nothing about the division of the other States into electorates.,59
263,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"But the honourable member voted against the proposed schemes. Mr Mahon/ - Not so. I voted for the ""Victorian scheme. vote I gave was for the rejection of the Queensland soheme of distribution, and in view of the revelations which were made as to the way in which that scheme was prepared, I think that my vote was amply justified. I am fully prepared defend the position which I took up in reproval gard to the division of that State into torates. I am thoroughly at one with those who say that we should, as nearly as posexample, sible, give due representation to population. I shall heartily join with those who support the observance of that principle wherever is possible to do so, but I consider it has been shown during the debates which have taken place on the proposed schemes of tribution that, in some cases, it is almost possible to give it full effect. In seeking give effect to that principle, a more serious injustice might be inflicted on the people would be done by allowing the existing divisions to remain. I , for one, shall for the motion, and I trust that it will carried.",59
264,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown," I can also say that intended to contest the Federal electorate Swan, the scheme of distribution prepared the Commissioner would be satisfactory to If I may be permitted for a moment to with this question from a party point of view, I should like to point out that the Commissioner's scheme is quite as favourable to the Government as are the existing visions, and that, in some respects, it is more favourable. I desire to say at this stage - and it is right that I should do so-that I am acquainted with the Commissioner, Mr Johnston, who is the Surveyor-General for Western Australia. We were associated together for a great sion. number of years. When I was Surveyorcommunicated, General and Commissioner of Lands i Western Australia, he was one of officers, and I know him to be an upright, honourable, and absolutely trustworthy man, possessing a very wide knowledge of Western Australia. There are very few men that State who have travelled over a portion of it , and are more intimately acquainted with its varied characteristics. 9 N",59
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman thinks that no better man could have been found for this work ! 1,59
266,Sir JOHN EORREST,Unknown,I recommended his appointment.,59
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hear , hear; I did The only other not know him.",59
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I recommended ' him as being the most suitable man that I knew of to carry out a work of this kind. In my opinion, one reason why the distribution of this State, and also of several other to States, has failed to meet with as much apas we should like, is that a mistake elecwas made in intrusting so important and difficult a task to one individual. If , for three Commissioners had been appointed, we should not have experienced the difficulty and dissatisfaction that have oci t curred. The subdivision of Western Aus-' tralia into five electorates for the first Federal elections was made by the State Governdisment, of which I was the head, and was imsubmitted to the Legislative Assembly as to a Government proposal. It was then, in accordance with the usual custom in that than State, sent to a Select Committee, consisting of members from both sides of the House, ancl vote I remember well that the Select Committee be were almost entirely in accord in regard to the divisions submitted by the Government. Very little alteration was made by the Select if I . Committee, which, I think, settled the of whole matter in one sitting. The existing by Western Australian divisions are in absome. lute conformity with the provisions of the deal I Electoral Act. Community of interest is j preserved as far as possible, except, perhaps, in regard to the northern part of the State. The Kimberley districts would have been diincluded in the Swan division, but. for the even fact that they are separated from it by the State electoral district of the Pilbarra goldfields, and therefore in order to avoid Swan division being cut into two parts by the Pilbarra district both Kimberley and Pilbarra are included in the Coolgardie diviI may say that I have never either directly or indirectly, n with the Commissioner on the subject of the my proposed distribution, though when I saw his proposals I at once formed the opinion that they were not as suitable as the existing divisions. I have not written to him on in the subject, however, because as a member greater of the Commonwealth Government, and as his old friend and chief, I felt some delicacy about doing so, and therefore he is probably still unaware of my views. In my opinion, community of interest has not been sufficiently regarded, notwithstanding the direction of the statute. To include Subiaco with Eremantle is certainly undesirable, since they are quite distinct places. Subiaco is a suburb of Perth, and is only - two miles from the Perth Town Hall, electric trams running to and from the city continuously at short intervals throughout the day. Most of'the residents of Subiaco find employment in Perth, and there is continuous intercourse between the two places. Fremantle, on the other hand, is 10 miles from Subiaco, and the communication between the two places is by railway. ' Probably only a comparatively few workmen living in Subiaco go to Fremantle to pursue their daily avocation. Therefore, in my opinion, Subiaco should be included in the Perth electorate rather than in the Fremantle electorate.",59
269,Mr HENRV WILLIS,Unknown,"The Commissioner says that it is necessary to include Subiaco in the Fremantle division, in order to obtain the quota.",60
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It seems quite clear that such was not necessary. The Commissioner seems fco me to have considered that the main thing he had to do was to keep to the quota, whereas the other instructions in the Act are equally imperative. He was given a margin to use unrestrictedly, and he should, I think, have used it in this instance in order to comply with. the statutory discretion given as to community of interest between Subiaco and Perth. The proposal to place 1,700 electors of the Swan division in the Perth division would not have been objectionable if it had been necessary, because the people of the State electoral district of Swan do their business in Perth, the capital being to a large extent their market town. Bufc, in my opinion, the alteration is not necessary. There are enough people in Perth fco obtain a quota for the division, and as the State electorate of Swan is a rural district it is proper that it should form a part of the Federal rural division of Swan. Coming to the Kalgoorlie division, I find that the Commissioner has amended its boundaries so as to include thirty electors from another division. I may explain that the existing Commonwealth divisions are each made up of so many State electoral districts, of which the Plantagenet electoral district is wholly within the Swan division. The Commissioner, however, proposesfcoadd part of fchafc district to the Kalgoorlie division.",60
271,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,He gives a reason.,60
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It is not, I fchink, a sufficient reason under existing conditions. There would be no objection to using a river as a boundary bufc for the fact that we had adopted the boundaries of the State electoral districts. In my opinion, it is unnecessary fco interfere, unless for some veiy good reason, with the existing divisions, with which the people have become acquainted. Each of these divisions is made up of so many State electorates, and, by leaving the boundaries unchanged, we can avail ourselves of the services of the local registrars and returning officers, and compile our rolls from the State rolls, because the franchise is the same in both State and Commonwealth Parliaments: The Coolgardie electorate has been mainly altered for the purpose of taking in the Roebourne electorate, the latter being a State constituency containing 28G electors. It is difficult to understand why the immense area represented by the honourable member for Coolgardie has been altered for the sake of including 286 electors? Such an alteration is not necessaiy to comply with the Act, and Roebourne is for the most part devoted to' the pastoral industry, and is 1,000 miles away from the mining districts.",60
273,Mr MAHON,Unknown,No thought was given fco community of interests in that case.,60
274,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I do not see why the Swan electorate should be altered for the sake of these 2S6 people, seeing that community of interests is already secured, including the towns of Roebourne"" arid Cossack.",60
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Commissioner tells us why.,60
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The reason given by the Commissioner is that there is just as much community of interests there as anywhere else; but the Commissioner has had regard tofchequota instead of having regard to the statute. The Commissioner had the Acfc before him, but seems to me to have read one part, and not to have given sufficient consideration tofcheother part.",60
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Ye t the right honourable gentleman saysfchatthe Commissioner is the besfc man that could have been appointed.,60
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That is so. In Fremantle the numbers are rather small, but still they are within the margin allowed by the. Act. Ifc would have been better to include the Swan electorate with Fremantle, rather than to include Subiaco. Fremantle already has a large roll of population in the rural Murray district. It would be highly undesirable to include a suburb of Perth with Fremantle, ten miles away. I should have very much liked to agree with the Commissioner, because I recognise that he has done his best. I can only conclude that the nature of his report is due to the fact that the work was new to hira, and that he did not altogether realise the latitude given by section 16 of the Act. Mi'. JOSEPH COOK - O r the political exigencies.",60
279,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,"I know the conditions prevailing in Western Australia, and I do not see that there is any political advantage so far as the Government are concerned, nor is there, so far as I know, any personal advantage to myself. This report would have to be returned with definite information as to the opinions expressed by this House, and that would be practically instructing the Commissioner what he had to do ; and it is not desirable that we should make an exception by returning the report in this case. A l thoughI am not aware of the conditions in regard to the other districts affected, I have no hesitation in saying that I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that there is any necessity to alter the existing division ; and, unless there is somevery good reason, the division should, I think, be left as it is. There is a great difference between giving and taking; it is very easy to give, but to take away is another matter. I can assure lionorable members that, whatever may be said as to the-constitutional aspect of this action, I am confident that they will do no mischief or injury to the people of Western Austi'alia by leaving the electorates tliey are at the present time. Mv. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) - I think it a pity that the honourable member for Perth should have condescended to make personal charges, and to tell me that I have been taking part in ths conspiracy in Queensland. I should like to know what authority the honourable member has for sayingthat there has been any conspirac) in that State ; because I have neither seen nor heard any evidence to support such a statement. It is unfortunate that such charges should be hurled across and about the House concerning the Commissioner for Queensland without any evidence in their support. Have we arrived at such a state of things that honourable members, in order to carry out their own plans and purposes, have to abuse an officer outside the House, who is not here to speak for himself, and charge him with the gravest offences of which a public servant could be guilty? .",61
280,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that the charges are made only for that purpose ? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I can only come to that conclusion, seeing that no evidence has been given in support of the charges.",61
281,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I thought we were discussing the Western Australian boundaries.,61
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,So we are; but I am replying to an accusation that I took part in a conspiracy.,61
283,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I think that charge was brought about by an interjection of the honourable member.,61
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do n6t believe there was any conspiracy; and whatever I may have to say of honourable members. I should not stoop to charge public officers with grave offences unless I had the requisite evidence to support the charges. I hope the honourable member for Perth will be quick to furnish the necessary evidence, because there is a cloud over this official, who, so far as we know, is a worthy man in every respect, and the cloud ought to be lifted or the official suffer the consequences. The Minister for Home Affairs told us that the Commissioner for Western Australia is a 'most capable man, and that he has done his best; and yet in the next sentence we were informed that the Commissioner had not read the Act.",61
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did uot say that.,61
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman said that the Commissioner as could not have read the Act.,61
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,No . Mv. JOSEPH COOK - The right honourable gentleman said that the arvangements recommended by the Commissioner are absurd.,61
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not say that ; what I said was that the Commissioner had given too much consideration to one part of the Act and not sufficient consideration to T another. Mv. JOSEPH COOK - The right honourable gentleman said the Commissioner had not read the Act.,61
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not say that.,61
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I venture to say that to all the criticisms of the recommendations the Commissioner has furnished complete answers.,61
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I have read those answers.,62
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman says that the Commissioner's recommendations^ in regard to Roebourne and Kalgoorlie are absurd; but here are the Commissioner's reasonsThe proposed boundaries of the Coolgardie Division differ from the existing in two places:(a) The Roebourne State electorate has been included with the object of increasing the voting strength, and because' the Roebourne interests are very similar to those of the most northern parts of this division. (ft) The other alteration is on the southern end of the eastern boundary, and is suggested with the object of making'the boundary more uniform and to partly followfcheOairdner River ; this amendment will have little, if any, effect, ever, upon the voting strength. The Commissioner says that the alteration was made to secure a better division and a better boundary. Surely that is a sufficient reason, and whether thirty electors or 1,000 were added it would afford a complete justification for his action. Community of interest is not the only consideration to be taken into account.",62
293,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Butsurelyaboundar y should not be altered for the sake of thirty votes ?,62
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Why . not, if a better boundary could be secured ? The boundary of the electorate which I represent was altered by Mr Houston to include very few more votes than are involved in the case under notice.",62
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But the same system was not followed in New South Wales and in Western Australia.,62
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not suppose it was, but apparently, irrespective of the system which may have been followed, the proposed distributions are to be rejected. The Minister for Trade and Customs, in submitting the motion, told us that fortunately he had recently visited Western Australia. I believe that he was there for a fortnight, and that during a part of that time the weather was so sultry that he had to take refuge down a mine. For a further portion of the time he was chasing through the State, like Sir Galahad, following up the honourable member for East Sydney and answering his statements from time to time. After this gallop through Western AustraliatheMinister has comeback here and has ventured to criticise the work of an officer who has lived in the State all his life, and who knows more about it than perhaps any other man there. It is admitted bhat the Commissioner has an intimate knowledge of the State, and that he is a man of high capability, and yet the Minister has the effrontery to tell him that he does not know his own business. I ask honourable members fco consider whether the alterations proposed are of sufficient importance to justify the rejection of the whole scheme. What does the displacement of voters in Subiaco mean ? Only 4,000 voters are affected, and in the case of Roebourne 250 are concerned, or altogether 4,250 voters who have been transferred from one division to another, as compared with a total of 115,000 in the State. Will honourable members .say that any slight inconvenience to which these 4,250 people may be subjected ought to be weighed how- against the interests of 115,000 voters ? The objections urged by the Minister, and by others who have supported him, are trumpery in the extreme, and furnish no justification for rejecting the proposed distribution. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that it had been suggested by some members of the Opposition that, for party purposes, the proposed distribution would be more favorablefcothe Government than the present divisions. I wonder which members of the Opposition ventured to make such a foolish suggestion. I question whether the Minister could point them out.",62
297,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member deny the truth of the statement?,62
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; I am not in a position to deny it ; but I should like evidence in support of it . I think that the Minister spoke with some mental reservation. Before we reject the work of the Commissioner some better reasons should be advanced by the Minister. Who are we that we should presume to pull to pieces the work of the Commissioner, unless we are in a position to suggest a better distribution ? Are we to keep on sending the reports backwards and forwards until a perfect scheme has been evolved ?",62
299,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Why shouldfchereporfcbe presented to us ? The honourable member is apparently arguing that it should be adopted without question.,62
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , I am not.",62
301,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Then the honourable member's argument is unintelligible. «,62
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No doubt it is, to the right honourable gentleman, A , good + many of his arguments are unintelligible, even to himself. The right honourable gentlereference man has remained dumb all through, although he is responsible for this political crime.",62
303,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ; the honourable member has no right to use that expression, and I must ask him to withdraw it .",63
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Certainly .1 even withdraw it . The Minister primarily sponsible for this great wrong has been dumb, and it would be far better if he stood up and defended the action Government. The Minister for Trade and Customs has not given us one solid reason for repudiating the work of the Commissioner.",63
305,Mr WATSON,Unknown,AVha t solid reasons had the Government with which the honourable member was connected in New South Wales for not taking action under similar circumstances ?,63
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member ought to know that there was analogy whatever between that case and the one we are now discussing.,63
307,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The cases were parallel, because the State Government to which refer set aside the report made by Commishis sioners appointed by themselves.",63
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable is, member ought to know that there was a great difference between the two cases. The Commissioners suggested only a slight vision of the boundaries, involving at as the leader of the Opposition pointed during a previous debate",63
309,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . The honourable member is out of order in referring to what was stated in a previous debate.,63
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was merely replying to the interjection of the honourable member for Bland.,63
311,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,If a disorderly intermembers jection is made the honourable member has uo right to reply to it .,63
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Id o not know that the interjection was disorderly ; it appeared fco me to be very pertinent. The total numwas ber of votes involved was less than 8,000.",63
313,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is not correct.,63
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am repeating the statement made by the leader of the Opposition the other night.,63
315,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I called attention earlier in the day to the standing order which prohibits allusion to a previous debate. The honourable member for Parrabeen matta is distinctly alluding to a previous debate, and the interjection made by honourable member for Bland also made to a matter discussed in a previous debate. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta not to advert to it .",63
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have only fco ask again what is the value of the reports of these Commissioners if they are not to be sent back to them, but are to be reset aside ? AVe get the best men who can be picked oufc in Australia to do certain work for us, and we immediately set aside of the their work contemptuously.",63
317,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Contemptuously ?,63
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not hesitate to say so. The honourable member must at least admit that the work of the Queensland Commissioner was set aside contemptuously, and he was smothered with suspicion. We have had the charges repeated to-night, and honourable members who have stood by the Commissioner have been reno ferred to by the honourable member for Perth as having taken part in a conspiracy. Is that not contemptuous treatment? Is it not worse than contemptuous treatment fco cover a man with suspicion and besmirch character by allegations made in this House? Honourable members know that it and I am characterizing whafc has taken place in the mildest way when I say that the Commissioners' reports have been treated rewith contempt. I propose to stand by the most, Commissioners until we have some proof out furnished us that their work can be improved upon, even if it be sent back to themselves for revision.",63
319,Mr HENRY AVILLIS,Unknown," I listened with great interest to the speech made by the Minister in charge of this motion, because I expected to hear from him some good reason for asking honourable to reject the division proposed by the AA estern Australian Commissioner. No 7 doubt the speech of the honourable member for Perth was very convincing from that honourable member's point of vicw, but it no reply to the statements made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Those honourable members, and especially the honourable member for Perth, are very much interested in the proposed distribution, and I waited with interest to hear what would be said by the Minister for Home Affairs. The right honourable gentlemen told us that the Commissioner bad under his own direction for many years, that he was Surveyor-General of the the State, and that no more competent man for this work could be found in Western Australia. Honourable members opposite were laughing during the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, as if a very fine joke had been perpetrated on the Eederal Parliament in the appointment of these Commissioners. If , as the Minister for Home Affairs has said, the old division of Western Australia was correct, what necessity was tliere for the appointment of a Commissioner to make a fresh division for that State? When we enacted a law to provide that the States should be cut up into divisions, we intended that there should be an alteration of the existing divisions. The honourable and learned member for Corinella evidently regards it as a very fine joke that these Commissioners should have been appointed at cousiderable expense.",63
320,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I never said a word upon the matter.,64
321,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Possibl y the honourable and learned member did not say a word which could be heard by Mr. Speaker, but he looked deliberately towards ine, and addressed some observations to honourable members beside him in the very wise way which he has, and which leads one to believe that he is a master of all the sciences, and is the wisest man in the House.",64
322,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I was telling the honourable member beside me a story entirely unconnected with Western Australia or with the honourable member for Robertson.,64
323,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member appears to think that it is a very fine joke to appoint as Commissioner fco carry out the work of dividing Western Australia into electorates a gentleman who, on the authority of the Minister for Home Affairs, is the most competent man who could be chosen, and then to set aside his report. If there is one State in the Commonwealth where an equitable distribution of seats is necessary it is Western Australia. The past political history of that State will not bear investigation, when we consider the pocket boroughs that were in existence there. That past history was well known to the officer who had this work to perform. In one of the sections of his leporfc, he says that he had to consider that there should be an equality of votes as nearly as possible, and in the division he submits he goes within 1,500 of the limitation in the two electorates to which he refers. The Commissioner knew very well that in the past in Western Australia one State electorate had as few as 46 voters, whilst another had 120. He knew that there were 6,000 voters in East Kalgoorlie and but 90 in Carnberwell East. That is the history of the past in Western Australia ; and having appointed an honourable man to divide the State into electorates, we should have accepted his work. Not a single reason has been advanced against the alterations of the existing electorates which are proposed by the Commissioner - We have been told that Subiaco should not be included in the electorate of Eremantle, because the distance between the two districts is something like ten miles. What is ten miles in the cufcfciny up of a State which has an area of 1,000,000 square miles, and in which one Commonwealth electorate-that of Coolgardie-is, J-suppose, as large as New South Wales and Victoria combined ? We have had all this talk about a distance of ten miles when we know that Subiaco is a suburb of Perth andfchafcEremantle itself is practically but a suburb of Perth. The interests of Eremantle and this suburb of Perth are almost identical. As the Commissionei' has pointed out, it was necessary to take 4,000 voters from Subiaco in order to make up the quota as nearly as possible to that of Eremantle, and even with that reduction of votes, there is a margin of 1,500 voters.",64
324,Mr FOWLEK,Unknown,"Then he did not get so near to the quota, after all 1",64
325,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"If the Commissioner had not taken off voters as he did, the margin would have been more nearly 6,000 or 7,000. That brings us back to the old argument, which I shall not enlarge upon. We know that in some of the States there are electorates in which there are 10,000 more voters than in others, and it appears that the same condition of things is to prevail in Western Australia. It is a remarkable thing that when we have made citizens of the women of the Commonwealth, and have given them votes, the change is not to make the slightest difference in the size of the electorates or the quota.",64
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We shall try to alter these things when we come fco deal with the Bill.,64
327,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The Minister for Home Affairs has said all along that in the most populous States an abnormal condition of things has prevailed. . That has been given as a reason for postponing the division of those States. But the normal condition of things has prevailed in Western Australia, and yet the old electorates are to be adhered to. I hope that.a better state of things will prevail later on, and that it shall not be understood from the decision of the House to-night that there is to be no proper distribution of seats in Western Australia. I feel that it is my duty to stand by the Commissioner who was appointed on the recommendation of the present Minister for Home Affairs.",64
328,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Did lionorable member say when we cussing the boundaries of the New South Wales electorates that wo might well follow the majority of its representatives?,65
329,Mr HENBYWILLIS,Unknown,"No. I am tration Bill tomorrow. quite independent in this matter. I am not pledged in any way. I have come here to do my duty. My only ambition is to gain the reputation of being a scientious man. I feel that it is my duty to oppose the motion. Whafc was said the Minister for Home Affairs has fluenced me very considerably.; but I heard no reason in liis speech to justify the in rejecting the recommendation of the missioner. Question put.

It is absurd to interpose the Budget debate tomorrow, to bring on other business next week, and then to resume the Budget debate again at a later stage. When the Budget debate is commenced we should go through with it . The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is the one outstanding measure of importance, but apparently it has to wait to suifc the purposes of the Government. It is made to take a back position.",65

It certainly would be injudicious to go on with the Budget debate tomorrow, and return to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill next week.",66
341,Mr WATSON,Unknown," ! hope that the Government will see the wisdom of proceeding with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill tomorrow. Otherwise there will be a risk offchemeasure being blocked. The Bill ought, to leave this Chamber within six or eight days, in order fco afford a reasonable opportunity to pass it through the Senate. The factfchatthe Bill was carried Avithout a division lastnightwill makeitareproach to us if it is not dealt with in Committee in time to permit of its consideration in another place.",66
342,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"W it gardfcothe remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta, I should like to point oufc that he persisted in attributing to my remarks an application to the preliminary stages of the Bill relating to the electoral divisions, although I endeavoured, while he was speaking, to assure him that I was referring only tofchestatement which I made last night. Thafc statement was made without any objection from any quarter. I used the words ""at the earliest possible date."" That is why the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was made an order of the day for tomorrow. But it has been set down for Tuesday, partly in order to put an end fco a dismal exhibition of a certain character which we were beginning to see in this Chamber- a dismal exhibition unrelieved by any gleam of humour or of wisdom.",66
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Sa y it again.,66
344,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I am not gifted with an inclination for repetitions, such as characterizes the honourable member. It is said that it would be absurd to take the Budget debate tomorrow.",66
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There will be another taste of it next week.,66
346,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I have given up expecting good faith from some quarters. Ifc was the perfect understanding that the underElectoral Divisions Bill was to be proceeded with tomorrow, and it was never understood that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be dealt with in Committee tomorrow. In the ordinary course of business it was placed upon the paper for that day, because that is the customary procedure, unless there is a special reason for setting down a Bill for a later date. The intention was, however, to take the small Electoral Divisions Bill tomorrow, and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill on Tuesday. That arrangement goes by the board, however, because of the concession which we have madefcohonorable members opposite. This is what we get for making that concession. I submit that the whole attitude taken up by the honourable member for Parramatta is grossly unfair to the Government;, but it is in keeping with the speeches we are in the habit of hearing from him. He appears to be unable to take any action without attributing base motives fco others.",66
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is offensive.,66
348,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman must withdraw the remark that is considered by the honourable member for h re- Parramatta to be offensive.,66
349,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Which is the remark that the honourable member deems to be offensive 1,66
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I decline to say.,66
351,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I do not know to which expression the honourable member refers. If he thinks that it is unparliamentary to say that he is grossly unfair, I withdraw the expression. Had we notified that it was our intention to proceed with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill tomorrow, there would have been a perfect howl from honourable members opposite. They would at once have exclaimed "" Why did the Government make a statement; that other matters would be proceeded with tomorrow, thus contributing to the absence of a large number of our supporters, and then take up the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which is an important measure 1"" In such circumstances charges of cowardice and gross breach of faith would have been ringing in this Chamber for hours. I decline to allow the conduct of business to be taken out of the hands of the Government by honourable members opposite. When they can take it out of our hauds lefc them do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned afc .11.3.1 p.m.",66
