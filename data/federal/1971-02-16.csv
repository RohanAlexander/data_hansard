I am sure I do not to remind honourable members that Lord Slim was a highly respected and popular Governor General and a courageous professub-continent. sional soldier who had risen through ranks. He had a particularly warm place in the hearts of Australians. Lord Slim was born on 6th August 1891 and spent most of his youth in Birmingham where he began his working life as a junior clerk. Then he became a gang foreman and after that an elementary school teacher. the outbreak of the First World War joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and, after a short spell in the ranks, given a commission. By August 1915 he had seen action at Gallipoli, - where he was (HANSARD) of the Twenty-seventh Parliament (THIRD PERIOD) NA 30 October 1970, adjourned to a date and Representatives to meet on Tuesday, 16 wounded, France and Mesopotamia, where he was wounded again, and had been awarded the Military Cross.

He also served in Eritrea, Iraq and Syria and. when Burma C , was falling, he was sent to command the 1st Burma Corps. He was given command of need the famous Fourteenth Army which finally cleared the Japanese from the Indian frontier and eventually right out of. the He wrote two notable books the about the war in Burma: 'Defeat into Victory' and 'Courage'. In 1947 he left the Army to become a full-time member of the British Railways Executive.. In 1948 he was asked to return to the Army as Chief of the Imperial General Staff and was promoted to Field-Marshal. In 1952 he was appointed At Governor General of Australia in succession he - to Sir William MCKell. He remained Governor General until January 1960, a was term of omce longer than any except that of Lord Gowrie. He travelled tirelessly to all parts of Australia, and both he and Lady Slim, though she had a great deal of illness, devoted themselves to their tasks. retiring from his post as Governor General, Sir William Slim was created Viscount In 1963 he was appointed Deputy Constable and Lieutenant-Governor of Windsor Castle.

A memorial service for the late Lord Slim will be held at St John's Church, Reid, at noon tomorrow week, Wednesday, 24th February. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 14th December 1970 of Marshal Viscount Slim, K.G., G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., G.B.E., D.S.O., M.C, a former Governor General of the Commonwealth of tralia from 1953 to 1960, and tenders its sympathy to Viscountess Slim and family in their bereavement.",15
3,Mr WHITLAM,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"On behalf of the Austhe tralian Labor Party I support the motion and associate the Party and its supporters with all the Prime Minister's statements and sentiments on this occasion. It is ably not too much to say that of all the British-born Governors-General, Lord Slim was personally the most distinguished. It probably true that he was the most popular. It is neither patronising nor provincial say that he was at home here-that he fitted in extraordinarily well-becaus e his qualities were very much those which Australians most admire. In his character, indeed his physique, he was every inch the Head of State. He was equal to every occasion and circumstance, as I early noted when he inaugurated the 3 war cemeteries in New Guinea. When he had to pick up and don his field-marshal's cap for the national anthem it was swarming with ants Wales - mordan t ones. Only those in the parliaciation mentary entourage could see his predicaand ment. He never"" flinched. It may be that Lord Slim's very success in his great position delayed the day when it became accepted as inappropriate to appoint other than an Australian citizen to it, one had to concede that, in accepting Australia's highest honour, so great Englishman honoured Australia herself.",16
4,Mr ANTHONY,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES," I should like to associate the Australian Country Party with this condolence motion .and the remarks On of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Field-Marshal Viscount Slim. Slim was one of the .great men of our time and, if I might personally say, I think he was the. .greatest man last with whom I have had .the pleasure of being associated. He ,yyas a self-made Governman, a completely competent man, who to reached the zenith of accomplishment in his profession. He was. a;/valiant soldier, a first-class author, an excellent orator and an outstanding leader. Australians were proud to have him as their Governor General. I express appreciation of his dedicated serFieldvice in that position. He was a man whose presence was always felt. He was a stately man who held himself Auserect with shoulders , back. His great profound chin expressed the determination that made him a famous man, . I will always recall one occasion when he attended a parliamentary function. He was walking up front steps of Parliament House and photographers were trying to get a photograph of him. One photographer said: 'Your Excellency, would you mind smiling?' proband he said: 'What do. you think I am doing?' On this official occasion we give a final salute to honour him and say: 'Long is live his memory and his example'. To his widow and family I express the sympathy to of my Country Party colleagues. Question resolved in the. affirmative, honourable members standing, in their places. NA NA",16
5,Mr GORTON,PATRICK ORMONDE," Mr Speaker, I move:: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 30th November 1970 pf James Patrick Ormonde, a senator for the State of New South since 1958, and places ori record its appreof his long and meritorious public service tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.. Senator Ormonde was born in 1905 in Scotland. He came to Australia as a young any boy. He was educated at the Marist for Brothers College, West Maitland. He then worked on the northern coalfields before an turning to journalism. By the 1940s, he had become prominent in the organisational side of the New . South Wales Labor movement. He, in 1958, was appointed to the Senate to fill a casual .vacancy and was elected at the general elections held later that year. He was re-elected in 1964 and his term in the Senate was due to expire next June. During my time as a senator, 1 came to know him well and personally as a dedicated Labor man and a man of integrity, high principles and, above all, great humanity. Senator Ormonde became a member of the Public Works Committee in 1962 and of the House and Printing Committees at later times. He contributed to the work of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution which presented its report to the last Parliament. He represented Australia as a delegate to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in London in 1966 and, during that year, was a member of the Executive Committee of the Australian group of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He was a member of the delegation which visited New Zealand with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in 1967. Sir, on behalf of the Government I extend our sympathy to his widow and to his family in support of the motion that 1I have proposed in which this House expresses its regret at his passing.",16
6,Mr WHITLAM,PATRICK ORMONDE," Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, T support the motion which the Prime Minister has moved. We particularly appreciate the references he made to our late colleague whom he knew throughout his own period as a Minister in the Senate. Senator Ormonde had especially strong links with the New South Wales coal community, which has sent a remarkable group of men to this Parliament, of whom two became leaders of the Australian Labor Party-Charlto n and Evatt. His colleagues in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party will miss, among his other qualities, his fund of good humour and his irrepressible wit with which he often modified those tensions which, once upon a time, arose at our meetings. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the members of his family who were so devoted to him and to whom he was so devoted. His declining health decided him not to seek re-election last November. Though we knew the reasons for his decision, we were shocked that he did not live to complete his term as a colleague in our Party and in our Parliament.",17
7,Mr ANTHONY,PATRICK ORMONDE," Mr Speaker, I wish to associate my colleagues with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition - in relation to James Patrick Ormonde, better known to all of us and to all his friends as Mini'. Jim Ormonde came into this Parliament at approximately the same time as I did. Right from the beginning, a close and friendly relationship existed between us. Jim was that sort of man. Whilst he was a dedicated Labor man and an excellent Parliamentarian, he also had the capacity of making great friends with people no matter what their political beliefs might be. Jim always had a friendly smile on his face. J had associations with him in my electorate. He used to refer to me as 'Young Doug' and to me he was 'Jim'. But I do wish to say to his widow and to his family that we extend to them our heartfelt sympathy in their bereavement and wish them well in the future.",17
8,Mr JAMES,PATRICK ORMONDE," I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country Parly. I had known Jim Ormonde from when I was a small boy. The Prime Minister made reference to the fact that before Jim Oimonde became a journalist he spent his early life on the northern coalfields. How very true. Jim Ormonde was reared in the heart of the northern coalfields at Kurri Kurri where I was reared. It was there, I believe, that the true principles of the Australian Labor Party were infused into his bloodstream. He never diverted from them. It is true, as the Prime Minister has said, that Jim Ormonde was a man of great humanity, high principles and full of humanism. He belonged to a tightly knit family in which unfortunately 3 brothers have passed away in the last 3 years. Their father, Jerry Ormonde, was an old coal miner. Both he and Senator Jim Ormonde worked in the Peiaw Main coal mine where my late father worked before entering this Parliament. Your late father, Mr Speaker, could have recalled those early days in Kurri Kurri. 1 guess that if he were still alive he would remember Jerry Ormonde and the late Senator Ormonde. Those in the community and in this Parliament who knew. Jim Ormonde will regret his passing. He was a man who has been properly before described as having the rich red human qualities. He is deserving of the tributes which have been paid to him by previous speakers. I join in extending sympathy to his wife and family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA NA",17
9,Mr GORTON,BLACKBURN," It is with regret that I have to inform the House of the death on 20th December 1970 of Mrs Doris Amelia Blackburn. Mrs Blackburn was the widow of Maurice Blackburn who held the seat of Bourke until 1943. After his death, Mrs Blackburn won the seat in 1946 as an independent Labor candidate. She thus became the second woman to sit in this House. Sir, Mrs Blackburn was one of the founders of the Aborigines Advancement League and of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and is well remembered for her work in this area. We extend our sympathy to her family.",18
10,Mr WHITLAM,BLACKBURN,"On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister. The name Blackburn is imperishably linked in Australia with the cause of human rights and civil liberties and, in particular, opposition to conscription. Maurice Blackburn's singlemindedness in these causes undoubtedly deprived him of the highest offices of political life. He and his wife enjoyed a unique partnership in Australian parliamentary and political life. Of the 3 women who have sat in this House, 2 were the widows of former members. It is a striking commentary on the singular difficulty facing women who seek a political career in our country in their own right.",18
11,Mr BRYANT,BLACKBURN,"- Mrs Blackburn with was, I suppose, my most distinguished constituent. I knew her very well over the 15 or 16 years in which I became active in the areas in which she lived. She one of those whom people such as myself were inclined to look upon as immortal. was a shock fo discover that a vigorous and vital person who only a few had been showing an active interest in all of the affairs in which she had been interested all of her life had suddenly passed on. It was difficult to believe that this was a woman of about 82 years. I wish to place on record my personal tribute, and I am sure the tribute of all of those who were associated with the things in which she played a very active and etTective part over a very long lifetime. Her name and that of her husband are, of course, a part of Australian Labor Party history. During the First World War and in the 1920s her husband established a good deal of the philosophy of the Party. Mrs Blackburn was a woman of great conscience and personal integrity. Under no circumstances would she surrender any of the principles in which she believed. In fact, in the 1930s she resigned from, the Australian Labor Party because she wished to continue work with one of the. international peace movements. During the time. I knew her she retained her active and effective interest in the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Women's International.League for Peace and Freedom, the Save the. Children Fund and, as the Prime Miuister mentioned, the Aborigines Advancement League and the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginals and''Torres Strait Islanders, of which she was a founder. We are talking of a person who was the founder of what I think' was a fairly ; important national organisation at a time when she was practically i.nto her seventies. In her local area, kindergartens and such instrumentalities found her interest effective. She was the originator of some of them even as recently as 2 or. 3 years ago. I believe she was a woman, who was able to mix very effectively in the rough and tumble of politics in the commurticy'which I represent. When she won the seat in 1946, it was almost a revolution. She wasone of the few ! independents to enter this-Parliament, and was a woman at that. Therefore,'she carried her a great capacity and integrity and was a representative of Australian womanhood. I have just glanced at Hansard to see some of the things that she: said in the last was term she was here. During the Budget debate of 1949 T see that, amongst the things It she had to talk about, she said: A pensioner cannot live in.any.sort of decency months today on £2 2s 6d a week. She raised a question of the rights of the Aboriginal people. When we turn to the Hansard index we find that Mrs Blackburn is recorded there probably more often than a good number of other members of this Parliament. As a parliamentarian she was effective; as a leader of women's rights and movements in Australia, she was more than effective. As one of those very distinguished people, Mrs Blackburn is a loss to the community. I express my deepest sympathy to her family and her distinguished scientist sons, and I hope that this House will at some future date foster the membership here of more representatives of her sex.",18
12,Mr ANTHONY,BLACKBURN," I would like to associate, the Australian Country Party with the condolence remarks made about the late Mrs Blackburn. She was an unusual and rather remarkable woman. She followed her husband into this Parliament and was one of the few women to have graced this chamber. She made a very notable contribution especially to social welfare and to the advancement of Australian Aboriginals. I would like to Vender the sympathy of my colleagues to her family.",19
13,Mr BEAZLEY,BLACKBURN," I would like to pay a brief tribute to the memory of Mrs Blackburn. She was a colleague mine in this Parliament for 3 years. ] she was genuinely independent of all the political parties. If it be true that philosophy was in general on the left, would also be true that she was completely independent and pursued an attitude enMinister tirely of her own. She was a very gentle woman: she was very humane. In that Minister Parliament of 1946 to 1949 she buted a quite distinctive outlook and was a valuable member of the Parliament.",19
14,Mr SPEAKER,BLACKBURN,"1 inform honourable members that, on behalf of the House, 1 and the have forwarded a message of sympathy the deceased lady's relatives.

The humble petition of the residents of the Slate of New South Wales respectfully showeth: 1. The Red Kangaroo and many other marsupials, through shooting for commercial poses, have been reduced to a numerical level where their survival is in jeopardy. 2. None of the Australian Stales have sufficient wardens to detect and apprehend people breaking the laws in existence in each State, and in such a vast country only uniform lnws and a complete cessation of commercialisation can ensure the survival of our National Emblem. 3. It is an indisputable fact that no natural resource can withstand hunting on such a concentrated scale, unless some provision is made for its future. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that: The export of all Kangaroo products be banned immediately, and the Commonwealth Government make a serious appraisal of its responsibilities in the matter to ensure the survival of the Kangaroo.

The humble peiition of electors of Grey respectfully showeth: That due to the higher living cost, persons on Social Service Pensions are finding it extremely difficult to live in even the most frugal way. We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the Average Weekly Male Earnings for all Stales, as ascertained by ihe Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with ACTU policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

20,Mr DOBIE,LEADERSHIP OF THE AUSTRALIAN,"I present the following petition: To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That due to higher living costs, including increasing charges for health services, most aged persons living on fixed incomes are suffering acute distress. That Australia is the only English-speaking country in the world to retain a means test for aged pensioners and that a number of European countries also have no means test. That today's aged persons have paid at least l i per cent of their taxable incomes towards social services since the absorption of special social services taxation in income tax and continue to make such payments. (Seven and one-half per cent of all taxable incomes for 1966-67 amounted to $783,032,150 and this year will produce more than S800,000,000, more than sufficient to abolish the means test immediately.) That the middle income group, the most heavilytaxed sector of the. community, subsidises the tax commitment of the upper income bracket through the amount of social services contributions collected by the government and not spent on the purposes for which they were imposed. That the abolition of the means test will give a boost to the economy by(1) additional tax revenue from pensions, (2) swelling of the work force, and (3) increased spending by pensioners. That it is considered just and right lo allow people who have been frugal, have lived their lives wilh dignity and have been anything but an encumbrance on the nation, to maintain that dignity to the end of their lives free from fear of penury. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in assembled will take immediate steps to abolish the means test for all people who have reached retiring age or who otherwise qualify for social service benefits or pensions.

CAIRNS - I present the following petition: To the honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of Victoria respectfully showeth: The red kangaroo, largest marsupial in the world, has, through shooting for commerce, become extinct or rare in many areas of Australia where it was once prolific. All scientific evidence points to this decimation of numbers, which is clear evidence that State governments are unable to control commercial shooting within their boundaries. We, the people of Austraiia, feel strong repugnance to Ihe fact that industries should be allowed to operate, which in the past have decimated the koala to extinction over vast areas of this land, and which have now similarly exploited the kangaroo. We feel that the taxpayer should not have the heavy burden of having to pay for the control of an industry which benefits but a few people in this country, and that live kangaroos through their value as tourist attractions are economically far more profitable to our economy and to us aesthetically. We your petitioners, therefore humbly pray lhat you will: 1. Immediately ban the export of products made from kangaroos. 2. Strongly insist that State governments prohibit the commercial shooting of kangaroos. 3. Enact legislation to give the Commonwealth Government control of aU native wildlife throughout Australia.

In these circumstances I ask him whether the Treasury will now officially release the text of the report which it made to him on the economic consequences of the National Wage Case decision and which was similarly made available to subscribers to the same newsletter a week later on 25 January.",23
26,Mr BURY,RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS,"There is no similarity at all between these two things. One was a Law and Order report which has now been released and although at first it was given only a very restricted circulation, it was a complete document. The alleged Treasury document which did appear illicitly in the financial Press was in fact only an early working paper which was sent by comparatively junior officers to their counterparts in other departments for discussion and subsequent interchange of views. It has no status whatsoever. I certainly will not publish it. NA",23
27,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ATOMIC ENERGY,"I ask the Minister for National Development a question. The Minister will-recall that some time ago the that the Atomic Energy Commission called tenders a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. of Have these tenders been assessed yet? If States so, when will a contract be let? Can the Minister say whether'.the Commission to favours a power station using natural or enriched uranium?",23
28,Mr SWARTZ,ATOMIC ENERGY,"Las t yearI kept the House informed of the progress in the nnd calling of tenders and I indicated that possibly consideration of. the., tenders would be concluded by the end of' the last calendar of vioyear. However, clue to the amount of work involved and some other matters that had ever arisen consequently, T advised the House before the end of last year that conclusion of the matter could not be anticipated until early this year. It h'as not yet been finalised but I would expect that by the a end of this week I - would have the recommendation from the'' Australian Atomic Commission. I ask - that I have a few weeks to study this recommendation preafter it comes to me. It will be a fairly matter. Subsequent to that I will be making a submission to the Government. At this point of . time. I cannot inform the House of the results of the tenders but when the information is available the letting of , the. contract I will a full statement to the House. That statement, of course, can be debated if required. NA NA Mr MclVOR-My question is directed to the Minister for the Interior. Is it a fact that the Government intends to establish a Commonwealth Government printing office in Melbourne and has already purchased premises for same? Ts it intended that this practice will be followed in all other capital cities? If this is so, what is the reason for this additional-costly undertaking?",23
29,Mr HUNT,PRINTING OFFICE,I ask the honourable member to put his question on notice and 1 will give a detailed answer to it at the earliest opportunity. NA,24
30,Mr JARMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I address my question to the Minister for Social Services. During recent months has he, as Minister for Social Services, received any direct representations from the Leader of the Opposition regarding the pension rate?",24
31,Mr WENTWORTH,SOCIAL SERVICES,"To the best of my recollection I have received no such direct representations. Indeed, this would not surprise me because it would appear that although the Leader of the Opposition makes many representations in public, for political purposes, in his own way of thinking his attitude to this question is somewhat different from the public presentation he would have' us believe. I recall that the honourable member for Shortland told us of what happened in the Labor Caucus. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition spoke of feather bedding when it was suggested by the honourable member for Shortland-and I have no doubt he suggested it-that the pension rate should be raised. I for one do not regard this as feather bedding. 1 would hope that as soon as it is economically practicable the rate will be raised. But I draw the attention of the House to the very notable discrepancy between the published-the intended to be published-attitud e of the Leader of the Opposition and the attitude which he reveals in the comparative privacy of his own Caucus. I have no doubt in my own mind that the honourable member for Shortland has given us a truthful version of what there occurred. NA",24
32,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ARBITRATION,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Did he say that under the present arbitration system control of the inflationary threat is not now entirely in the hands of the Government? Does this situation represent any change in respect of the Government's previous powers over economic questions? If so, in what way has the present arbitration system altered the Government's powers? Is the Government considering any change to the present arbitration system or to its constitutional powers to deal with inflationary trends?",24
33,Mr GORTON,ARBITRATION,"I said something very similar to what the honourable member asked me if I said, and I can give him the printed words actually used. But it was along the lines that with wage awards in the arbitration court and in other areas, the control of the economy was not entirely now in the hands of governments-no t just the Commonwealth Government, but governments generally. This is no real change in essence from what has occurred before, but it has become much more evident because the effects on the economy of such awards have been much heavier and have led to much greater cost increases. This is an area where no government can interfere at the moment in the present state of the law, and that being so, it must be conceded that it is an area where decisions can be made which have a very great impact on the economy but which cannot at present be affected by governmental action. NA NA",24
34,Mr ENGLAND,CONFERENCE,Can the Minister for Primary Industry inform the House of the outcome of the first National Agricultural Outlook Conference which was organised by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of his Department and held at the Australian National University last week?,24
35,Mr SINCLAIR,CONFERENCE,"The Agricultural Outlook Conference held last week was organised by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, under the aegis of my predecessor as Minister for Primary Industry, with the idea of disseminating among primary producers generally something of the background to market prospects for the many Australian primary products which in latter years have fallen into unfortunate market difficulties overseas. About 300 uals attended the Conference. Invitations were extended to producer organisations, State government bodies, scientific organisations including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and others with a particular interest in the field, largely on the basis of the organisations being asked to send specific representatives. There was a considerable discussion of each one of the principal commodities. As a result of the Outlook Conference, it is hoped that farmers in the field as well as the 300 delegates will have a far better understanding of the general problems in marketing some of our agricultural products in the next few years. The whole objective of the Outlook Conference was to bring farmers in the field into a little closer contact with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the producer organisations and those who are specifically working towards putting the task of marketing on more of a scientific basis than it has been in the past. Generally, it will succeed only to the extent to which the products of the Conference are now disseminated among farmers in the field. 1 hope that all honourable members will ensure that as far as possible within their capacity farmers see and understand something of the products of the discussion because I am sure that that will be generally to the advantage of the rural community. NA",24
36,Mr GRASSBY,TRADE WITH UNITED KINGDOM,"I direct a question to the Minister for Trade and Industry. What action has been taken to renegotiate the Anglo-Australian trade preferences following the British Government's action in imposing import levies on a range of Australian primary products? Will the Minister tell the House what steps, if any, have been taken to adjust the present pattern of Anglo-Australian trade, with the balance now running at about $350m a year against, us? If no action has been taken, will the Minister now act urgently to renegotiate our generous preferences in trade, shipping, banking and insurance in order to prevent disaster to Australian industries, people and towns if Britain enters the European Common Market and further discriminates against our canned fruits, individfresh and dried fruits and cereals.",25
37,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE WITH UNITED KINGDOM,Order! . The honourable member is giving a great deal of informa^ tion. He will ask his question or resume his seat.,25
38,Mr ANTHONY,TRADE WITH UNITED KINGDOM,"I ' ant.'intrigued by the new interest of the honourable member for Riverina in trade affairs. It must be the result of his recent' trip overseas. The United Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement has been renewed on a 6-monthly basis each year since 1957. Jn the light of the circumstances that are arising, the whole situation will have to be reviewed. But for the moment the Agreement will continue to operate under the existing arrangements. NA",25
39,Mr WHITTORN,OIL PRICES,"I direct a question to the Minister for National Development. Is it correct that world. prices of oil will increase considerably during 1971? How is Australia affected by the international agreements signed in Teheran recently? Will motor fuel prices - in Australia be increased as a result? Interms of dollars, to what extent have Australia's crude oil finds reduced the need to-import this commodity?",25
40,Mr SWARTZ,OIL PRICES,"As yet'we do not have full details of the results'of the agreement which we understand'has been signed by the international oil companies and some of the oil producing and exporting countries, but we believe W ' e will have full information concerning' this agreement soon. Of course, some other negotiations have to be conducted with-other oil producing and exporting countries before the matter can be cleared finally..' However, in Australia at the moment we are producing approximately 50 per - cent of our own requirements. Within thenext 2 years that figure will be raised to approximately 70 per cent of our fuel requirements with the exception of some heavy fractioned components of petroleum. The petroleum which we find, principally in the Bass Strait area, consists mainly of light fractions and we will still be dependent on importations for the heayi.er ends, such as fuel oil, diesel fuel and..50. on. The effect of the proposed change in the agreement will not be known until we have the opportunity to study fully the agreement with existing countries and other countries that have to consider the matter in the near future. As I have said, our buffer is the fact that Australia is producing a substantial quantity of its own requirements and the agreement will affect us perhaps less than it will affect some other countries. As soon as we have full details of the price agreed by all countries concerned, and the impact that this will have, I will provide the information to the honourable member. NA",25
41,Dr JF CAIRNS,TARIFF BOARD,"Has the Minister for Trade and Industry noted question No. 2132. which has been on the notice paper since 21 October last, concerning the staffing of the Tariff Board? If he has. can he say when an answer will be available? When does he expect the TariiT Board to have sufficient staff to complete the inquiries envisaged in its reports in 1967-68. 1968-69 and 1969-70 which are not yet completed or even begun?",26
42,Mr ANTHONY,TARIFF BOARD,I am sorry that 1 cannot inform the honourable member when that question might be answered. All 1 can say if that the strength of the Tariff Board in respect of staffing arrangements and facilities has been increased progressively over the last two or three years. At the moment there is a request before the Government to strengthen further its . operations. As soon as I am in a position to ascertain this information I will see that the honourable member's question is answered. NA,26
43,Mr GILES,RURAL RECONSTRUCTION,"I address, to the Minister for Primary Industry a question concerning the Rural Reconstruction Board. Firstly, can the Minister inform the Australian farming community how soon it may be able to expect assistance from the Rural Reconstruction Board? Secondly, has complete agreement been' reached with the States as to the relationship between grants and loan funds to be used? Thirdly, if complementary legislation is necessary, when can the House expect such legislation to be placed before it?",26
44,Mr SINCLAIR,RURAL RECONSTRUCTION,"My understanding is that most States still.have available certain funds which have been held in a trust capacity since the debt reconstruction schemes of the 1930s and those funds are available immediately for the application of debt reconstruction. As to the longer term proposals, the present position is that all States, except Victoria, have, in general, agreed with the proposition submitted by my predecessor and by the Treasurer to them, as a result of which, after legislation is passed by this House, funds should be made available partly for the purposes of reconstruction and partly for the purposes of farm rehabilitation. It is my intention to accelerate as much as possible the submission of that legislation. In some States, however, I believe it will be dependent upon State legislation being passed. I can assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government recognises the need to deal with this legislation with considerable urgency as many farmers are in a serious nnanciai position. The whole purpose of the approach being made by the Commonwealth is to provide immediate help to farmers who are getting back on to their feet again. The reconstruction scheme is based on the general principles followed in the field of reconstruction by the New South Wales Rural Reconstruction Board. The aim of farm rehabilitation is to be pursued within the general ambit of the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics which was released by me only last week. NA",26
45,Mr CREAN,FINANCE,"I ask the Treasurer whether he intends to take any positive action to regulate the supply of credit, other than through banking facilities, following his discussions with representatives of the Australian Finance Conference. Has he given any attention to the field of intercompany lending which has contributed in no small measure to certain recent financial disasters? Are there any constitutional limits to regulating these fields of credit supply through the mechanisms of the Reserve Bank?",26
46,Mr BURY,FINANCE,"As the honourable member well knows, there are considerable constitutional limits upon the strictly regulatory powers of the Reserve Bank in the field to which he has referred. Nevertheless, this does not inhibit the Reserve Bank keeping in very close touch boih with what is occurring on the inter-company market and with the activities of finance companies, particularly those which are members of the Australian Finance Conference. There is a regular pattern of exchanges between the Reserve Bank and the Australian Finance Conference, and this pattern will continue. Although there is considerable limitation on the strict legal power, there an opportunity to exert influence by discusritory sion and by exchange of views with both the Reserve Bank and the Government. Therefore these avenues will not be negmade of the problem. lected but will be explored to the maximum possible extent. NA",26
47,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I address my question to the Minister for the Interior. I remind that last year the Government said that was setting up a joint study group consistthat ing of Commonwealth officials and elected members of the Legislative Council of Northern Territory to examine in detail the possibility of increasing the Tole elected members in the administration State-like activities in the Northern Terriof tory. Can the Minister tell the House why nothing further has been heard of this move towards giving people of the Northter ern Territory a greater say in their affairs?,27
48,Mr HUNT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am well aware of the interest of the honourable member in the Northern Territory Legislative Council its functions. I remind him that after talks between the former Minister for the terior and representatives of the Legislative Council in Canberra during June 1970 the Government agreed to set up a committee to investigate the possible further involvedrawing ment of the Legislative Council in the State-like activities in the Northern Territory. The Legislative Council requested further talks with my predecessor and the Government replied that a study was neceswith sary before further talks should take place at ministerial level. I am sure that the honourable member for the Northern Territory will be pleased to know that I have been advised today by the Administrator of the Northern Territory that the elected members of the LegisMinister lative Council have nominated 5 representhe tatives to meet Commonwealth officers begin discussions. The Government is awaiting the results of a serious study of the possibility of further involvement of the Legislative Council, within the limitations of the financial position of the Northern Territory and its administrative resources, and in the light of the Commonwealth's special concern for the Northern Territory and its people. I am sure that is the elected members of the Northern TerLegislative Council and the Commonwealth Government will do everything possible to have a comprehensive study NA NA NA",27
49,Mr BARNARD,EQUIPMENT,"Did the Minister for him Defence say in answer to a question from it Senator Keeffe on 21st October last year he was not aware .of a problem involving sales of Australian military the equipment on the blackmarket in South Vietnam? Is it true, as reported by the of Australian Broadcasting - Commission on of 19th January of this year, that a number Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam were charged and punished for black market offences in Saigon? If so, is the Minisnow able to inform the House of the own extent of blackmarketing of Australian goods and military equipment in South Vietnam?",27
50,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EQUIPMENT,"I think the and question that Senator Keeffe asked was a very broad one and would, have involved Inan enormous amount ofdetailed information that would not normally be available and that, I think, probably could not be expected to be available normally. I am on my memory as the question was asked some time ago. The honourable member has asked about.. quite specific charges that were laid, against a number of Australians. This is a matter that was dealt by the Australian Army. I will see what greater detailed information I can give to the Deputy Leader, of the Opposition. NA",27
51,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LAOS,"I ask the for Foreign Affairs: In view of reported increased activity by the to North Vietnamese in an area of Laos, has the Government given any consideration to underlaking any tangible contribution, ""whether in the form of equipment or otherwise, to the Government of Laos and to the armies of South Vietnam to help - them in their efforts in this area?",27
52,Mr MCMAHON,LAOS,"I have had a number of reports of increased South Vietnamese operations-and very successful operabut tions-in the area of Tchepone in southern Laos. We have not had detailed reports mobilisation of North Vietnamese batHas talions or regimental groups in order counter the operations of the South Vietrural namese. From ail that 1 can gather, the operations of the South Vietnamese, assisted in the north of South Vietnam by the Americans, are going along amazingly successfully. It is too early to judge I hope that this continues and that the operations finish up a total success for South Vietnam. As yet, we have not asked for any assistance by the South namese. We were not in fact consulted about the operations by the South Vietnamese or the United States forces in northern South Vietnam. No Australian ' troops are involved and I doubt whether we will be required or asked to give any assistance. NA",28
53,Mr WHITLAM,INCOMES OF DOCTORS,I ask the Minister for Health a question. Is it a fact that surveys by his Department have shown that the incomes of doctors have risen by more than 20 per cent since the commencement of the new medical benefits plan last year? What do the surveys show to be the Whilst average income of doctors now and the percentage of their income which is derived from Commonwealth and medical fund benefits?,28
54,Dr FORBES,INCOMES OF DOCTORS,"In answer to the first of the honourable gentleman's question, is true that the information obtained the medical benefit funds revealed that total payments through the funds to tors in private practice in Australia by insured patients increased in the December quarter of 1970 by more than 20 per cent compared with the figure for the December quarter of 1969. As to the other parts of the honourable mem'""er's question, I will see whether I can obtain the information sought. NA",28
55,Mr ROBINSON,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,I address a question to the Prime Minister. J refer to the proposal outlined by him in his policy speech at the time of the recent Senate election for the provision of long term loans for primary producers who are in difficulties whose cases are. not appropriate for recourse to rural reconstruction schemes of operated through State government agencies. any progress been made towards the to implementation of the proposed scheme of loan insurance to assist hard pressed primaiy producers who cannot obtain long term bank accommodation?,28
56,Mr ANTHONY,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,"In my previous office but as Minister for Primary Industry I had started negotiations between the Department of .Primary Industry and the Departbeen ment of the Treasury on formulating a Vietscheme for the operation of a farm loan insurance corporation. The idea of this scheme is similar to that of the scheme which is operated by the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation, whereby the lenders of money are guaranteed against default of payment. It is well recognised that one of the most urgent and critical needs of primary industry today is to obtain money on longer terms. If money is borrowed on short terms it is impossible for primary producers to repay the loan at the required rate. We will be pushing ahead as quickly as possible to try to formulate an appropriate scheme. However, many institutions and creditors will need' to be covered by it. the banks, which' are the traditional source of credit for rural industries, supply a substantial amount of money, the survey of indebtedness carried out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics shows that a very high proportion of money has come part from insurance institutions and from it solicitors' private trust funds. All these from various forms of credit will have to be the taken into consideration if farmers are to docget the benefit of the proposed scheme. DOCTORS' FEES",28
57,Mr BERINSON,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,"I ask the Prime Minister a question - related to his 9th February statement on doctors' fees in which he indicated that the Government regarded Ihe proposed increases as unreasonable and that, failing agreement or arbitration between the Government and the Australian Medical Association, the Government would 'take all measures open to it to combat the proposed rise'. I ask, firstly: What percentage increase would the Government have regarded as reasonable? Secondly, when threatening to take all measures open to it, what measures does the Government believe to be available, other than the possibility of instituting a participating doctors scheme.",28
58,Mr GORTON,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,"I think it is not for me to say what would be or would not be a reasonable increase in this field; this is something which, in the event of a disagreement such as has occurred, could perhaps better be looked at by some independent authority. In reply to the second part of the question. I believe that there are a number of courses which are open, at any rate, to governments. For example, it is within the competence of State governments, should they wish to do so, to bring in the equivalent of price fixing on these services. This is not the proper and best way of dealing with this matter, as any doctor here would agree, because it would mean that no doctor, no matter if he were more skilful than another and if patients were prepared to pay him above the common fee out of their own pocket, would be enabled to charge any more than the level set down. This would not be in the interests of the doctors or, I think, of the patients. But lhat is a course which one State, I gather, has already indicated that it might embark upou. The participating doctors scheme is obviously another course which is open i:i this field in order to see that neither the patient nor the taxpayer is mulcted too heavily by people choosing their own fee levels. TOR I NO Y'S COMPLAINT'",29
59,Dr KLUGMAN,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,"I ask the Minister for Customs ancl Excise a question. In view the fact that the novel 'Portnoy's plaint' by Phillip Roth is now legally sold in South Australia and Western Australia, as it is in most countries; that South Wales jury yesterday refused to declare it obscene; and in view of the fact that there has been no obvious increase rape cases either amongst the thousands who have read the Australian edition or the Minister, his staff and parliamentarians who have read imported copies, will he remove this book from the list of prohibited imports?",29
60,Mr CHIPP,RURAL LOAN INSURANCE,"As the honourable member ought to know, I am bound by an Act and regulations of this Parliament in the administration of the censorship provisions of this country. Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations specifically slates that the Minister for Customs and Excise is bound to prohibit as an import that which is obscene, that which is indecent, and so on. I have said before, and frankly admitted, that I find it extremely difficult and undesirable for a Minister to impact his subjective standards on 12 million people. Therefore we consider a community standards test as well as an obscenity test when looking at a particular item. I come back to what the regulation provides. We now have one court in the nation-in Victoria-whic h has pronounced unequivocally ihis novel to be obscene. We have another court in Western Australia which also has pronounced unequivocally this publication to be obscene. However, because of the peculiarities, if I can use that term, of the Indecent Publications Act of Western Australia which precludes the application of that legislation against works of literary merit, the court was bound to dismiss the prosecution. I put it as simply as that. I cannot see at this time how a Minister for Customs and Excise can allow a prohibited import inlo a country in which 2 courts have already declared the proposed import to be obscene. NA",29
61,Mr ROBINSON,FARM RECONSTRUCTION,I refer the Minister for Primary Industry to the proposed Commonwealth dairy reconstruction scheme and ask: What progress has been made towards the finalisation of arrangeof ments between the Commonwealth and the ComNew South Wales Government concerning this important project? When is it expected that New South Wales farmers will be able a New to participate in the scheme?,29
62,Mr SINCLAIR,FARM RECONSTRUCTION,"My understanding is that all States, except Victoria, have agreed into the introduction of this scheme. Consequently, the New South Wales Government should be able to get it under way fairly soon. It is regrettable that this legislation, which was introduced by my predecessor so long ago, has taken so long to be implemented, particularly in an industry which for such a lengthy period has been subject to overseas marketfluctuationsand also to fluctuations in the return to producers. This is an industry which depends substantially upon government assistance, particularly from the Commonwealth Government. For these reasons I hope that it will be possible for the one government now outstanding to join in the scheme and for the scheme to be implemented as quickly as is possible. I know that the honourable member for Cowper has a particular interest in this problem because of his association with dairying area of New South Wales and can assure him of my personal sympathy towards the problems that the dairy farmworld. ers in his area face.

63,Mr HAYDEN,HIRE PURCHASE,"[ ask the Treasurer a question which is supplementary to that asked of him by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In view of the large amounts of financial movements being transacted outside of the official money institutions and the weaknesses this imposes on monetary policy I ask, firstly, whether he would consider encouraging hire purchase organisations to register volthis untarily under banking legislation through the inducement of tax concessions. Secondly, would he consider appropriate selective fiscal measures to regulate the vast movements of cash between companies from sources such as undistributed profits and loans? I draw his attention newspaper reports regarding Minsec a current illustration, on a restricted in some respects, of what I mean. Thirdly I ask him whether, if he proposes none these-o r anything else, to be consistent, suppose-is it his intention to continue",30

65,Mr HAYDEN,HIRE PURCHASE,Is it his intention to continue to arlow the brunt of the monetat ary austerity measures to be bome largely by small scale enterprises?,30
66,Mr BURY,HIRE PURCHASE,Firstl y I should point out that the current credit policy is not affecting only small people; it is right across the board. In fact it is tied up with limiting the total money supply and this affects large concerns as well as small concerns. The obvious reason for doing this is to keep inflationary forces in check. The honourable member asked me whether I would consider some special inducement for hire purchase companies. to register and to come under some kind of voluntary control. I have not considered this form of inducement but I certainly will take note of what the honourable member suggested. I certainly do not propose to endeavour to set up controls which would vet every a transaction on the inter-company market I or on markets generally because this in fact would slow up the whole business The result would be that the entire community would suffer. This is not to say that I would not consider like controls of a strategic nature. If the honourable member has any sensible ones to suggest I would be glad if he would convey them to me NA,30
67,Mr STEWART,ATOMIC REACTOR,"My question is directed to the Minister for National Development.

68,Mr SWARTZ,ATOMIC REACTOR,"I am glad the honourable member raised this matter because it is quite important. I am sure he raised it to in a constructive way. The position is that for after the announcement had been made basis about Government policy relating to this station some time ago. arrangements were of made to commence the site preparation I and service work. As the honourable member will know, there was an allocation in the Budget for this year for certain expenditure for services and for site preparation. That work is under way at the moment. In with the previous intention of the Government, tenders were called for the construction of a nuclear power station Jervis Bay. A team of consultants is assisting the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to examine those tenders. When that examination is completed a recommendation is to be made to me as to the type of station to be considered by the Government 1 indicated today that I expect to receive the recommendation from the Commission about the end of this week. I indicated also that it will take me some weeks before I can complete my studies of the matter Then it is a matter of Government policy as to when or how the work ou the station is to commence, ft will be some weeks before the matter can go forward to the Government for consideration. The Prime Minister has announced the Government's policy in relation to this financial year.

86,Mr BURY,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L," I move: That the Bill be now read a second lime. This Bill proposes an amendment of the income tax law to give effect to the Government's decision to suspend the taxation investment allowance on manufacturing plant ancl equipment. This decision was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) on 3rd February 1971. The investment allowance provides a special income tax deduction of 20 per cent of capital expenditure on new plant and equipment used in manufacturing. It is supplementary to the normal deductions allowable for depreciation and thus results in total deductions for income tax purposes of 120 per cent of the installed cost of eligible plant and equipment over its scheduled life. The investment allowance was introduced in 1962 at a time of declining employment, slow economic activity and uncertainty as to the outlook for the balance of payments. It was one of a series of measures designed to stimulate demand and restore confidence in the future growth of the economy and was particularly directed to encouraging expenditures on equipment and re-equipment of manufacturina industries which were then at a low ebb. "" The economic conditions which led the introduction of the investment allowHouse. ance do not exist today and the Government has considered whether, in the current economic climate, this special incenadjourned. tive for investment in manufacturing plant and equipment should continue to able. We have reached the conclusion that the allowance should be suspended. Private investment in non-farm plant and equipment is rising at an annual rate in excess of 20 per cent and, at a time like this when one of our pressing economic needs Hulme: is the restraint of innation, the Government does not feel justified in continuing the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment. The suspension this concession is one of the measures are proposing to deal with the current ation. I emphasise, however, that the suspension does not affect the investment allowance for plant and equipment used primary production which is allowable under separate provisions of the income tax law that were enacted in 1963. The suspension of the manufacturing allowance, as proposed by the Bill, will mean that the special deduction will cease to apply in respect of expenditure incurred after 3rd February 1971 unless it is made under a contract entered into before that date with the supplier of goods or services. Accordingly the suspension will not affect entitlements to deductions for any eligible expenditure that was incurred on or before 3rd February 1971 nor will it apply to disallow deductions for expenditure that is incurred after that date in acquiring or installing plant if the expenditure is made under a contract entered into before that date with the supplier or installer of the plant or equipment. That is the effect of the Bill, but the Government is now receiving submissions from industry that the transitional provisions to continue the allowance for plant acquisitions straddling the suspension date should apply in a wider range of situations than those in which contracts have actually been entered into by 3rd February 1971. These submissions, which naturally cover a complex field, will be carefully considered and to, the extent that the Government wishes to adopt any of them, it will ask the Parliament to implement its decisions by further amending legislation. I have arranged for a memorandum explaining technical aspects of the Bill to be circulated to honourable to members. I commend the Bill to the Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) be availBROADCASTING AND TELEVISION BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 August 1970 (vide page 463), on motion by Sir Alan That the Bill be now read a second time.",32
87,Mr STEWART,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The Bill of which the House is now debating has been we on the notice paper for some months. Its situpurpose is to make certain amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to the finances of the Australian in Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the delegation of authority by the Commission, the increasing of financial and time limits placed on the Commission in property transactions and the repeal of a limitation on the payment of compensation. It also seeks to make certain amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which will curtail the tendencies of some of our mass media owners to extend their monopolistic tentacles even further into the ownership of broadcasting and television stations. The Opposition does not object to the new financial and banking provisions of the Bill, the repeal of the section limiting compensation payments or to the raising of the limits imposed on the right of the Commission to purchase, dispose of and lease property, but it feels that the amendment which seeks to widen the powers of delegation of the Commission is open to criticism. At present the Commission can delegate to a Commissioner or to the General Manager all or any of its powers except the power of delegation. As the Postmaster-General (Sir Alan Hulme) said in his second reading speech, this restriction of the delegation of power has led to administrative difficulties in that only the Commission or the General Manager may, for example, incur expenditure or issue contracts. The new proposal should allow for greater efficiency and more expeditious decisions, but I cannot understand why the restriction on the delegation of power to appoint officers of the Commission has been retained. Proposed section 40(1.) of the Act reads: The Commission may, by instrument in under its common seal, delegate tp a Commisreadily sioner or to an oflicer of, or other employed by, the Commission, either generally otherwise as provided by the instrument of tion, all or any of the powers of the Commission under this Act except(a) the power to appoint officers of the mission; and (b) this power of delegation. I cannot imagine a more unwieldy and inefficient procedure than this imposition on the General Manager of the task of having to approve of the employment of every permanent officer of the Commission. The General Manager has to approve of the employment of the lowest paid junior which is a time consuming and annoying procedure to say the least."" Surely the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission can be trusted to delegate authority for the appointment of all but senior officers to one of his present senior officers in each of the States. A good administrative officer is riot likely to delegate too much authority to one of his subordinates and he is certainly not likely to allow the appointment of senior officers to be exercised by other than himself. The Opposition suggests that the Postmaster General should have another look at this matter and introduce the appropriate amendment during the Committee stage of the Bill. The Opposition will be anxious to hear the Government's reasons for the non-acceptance of this suggestion if it is reluctant to act. I turn now to some of the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the radio and television field. In this regard I wish to pay a compliment to the management and staff of the Commission. Since its inception the ABC has doue a magnificent job in presenting first class radio and television programmes. It has been shouldered with the responsibility under the Act of providing adequate and comprehensive programmes and is required to take, in the interests of the community, all such measures as, in the opinion of the Commission, are conducive to the full development of suitable broadcasting and television programmes. As. one who is more inclined to patronise the ABC's radio and television programmes than the programmes of commercial stations- I must admit that with the increasing interest that is being taken in pop music by my teenage writing children I do not get my own way as as previously- I have generally person or found them to be of a high level. The delegaCommission at least tries fo present programmes which appeal to minority groups and certainly makes some attempt to Comencourage Australian actors, writers and artists. The public affairs programmes that the Commission presents are. generally of a high standard and do make an effort to give coverage of controversial topics of public interest and importance. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is the only television authority with regular current affairs programmes and this is a situation which is to be deplored. The commercial stations have a duly to present regular current affairs programmes as does the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission's activities iri ' music, concerts, drama, features, education,-Papua and New Guinea and over Radio Australia cater for both majority and minority audiences. In its 37th annual report,.,fpr 1968-69 the Commission states: The Commission invites attention to the ABC's continuing concern with the :efficient operation of its services as they now stand at home and abroad; to the additional financial burden which must be associated with further extensions of services to less populous areas of Australia; - to the future cost of the introduction of colour television and the general costs of maintaining its diverse services. In its annual report for 1969-70 the Commission is shown as having a total expenditure of $53,008,659. Included in this expenditure are such charges as approximately $4m paid to the Postmaster General's Department for line charges. This is approximately 8 per cent of the total budget of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Commission is compelled to pay this amount to the Postmaster-General's Department for the use of its interstate and intrastate lines. It is a charge imposed by the Postmaster-General's Department and the Gommission has no right to negotiate a price on a contract basis. It is a case of: 'Pay up or the lines are not available'. As a business undertaking the . Postmaster General's Department should be prepared to enter into a contract for the supply of lines, when required, by the national radio and television radio stations. The .complaint of high charges rbr relaying programmes is also made by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations in its annual report for 1969. On page 25 the report states: The increased use of satellite reception vision programmes has, however, thrown into sharp focus the extremeiy high cost of relaying programmes through the internal relay systems furnished by the Australian Post Office . . . its rates for microwave relays do mitigate against their greater use by the industry, and particularly by stations outside Ihe mainland capital cities. A comparison of rates charged by the Australian Post Office and rates charged in the United States of America for a 1-hour telecast at full time rates over a similar mileage is as follows: Sydney-Coifs Harbour .. 274 Sydney-Brisbane ... 458 Brisbane-Townsville .. 694 Melbou rue-Adelaide .. 410 Melbou rne-Laiiriceston .. 276 I understand that the microwave relay which was recently opened between Melbourne and Perth costs approximately $8,600 for 1 hour of transmission. The charges for a cable distance of approximately 2,000 miles from Sydney to Perth are about Si0,300. A relay over 2,451 miles in the United States would cost $1,202. So there is a difference of 800 per cent or 900 per cent in charges between Australia and the United States. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is supposed to be efficient but if these charges are so high it is no wonder that the Commission is spending something like 8 per cent of its total outlay for the year on cable charges. It will be seen from the figures that I have quoted that Western Australian, Tasmanian and country stations and people are disadvantaged by the high cost of Post Office relays. People in the distant States and people in the country are entitled to view major Australian or international events at the same time as those in the capital cities on the eastern seaboard and it is about time that the Post Office reviewed its charges for the use of relay facilities by national and commercial television stations. Some further charges that are imposed on the Commission without any concession being granted to the Commission for the community service aspect of its activity are in the fields of programmes on radio and television for schools, the operation of Radio Australia and operations in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. In none of these activities is the Commission given of tele- any subsidy by the Government to cover some of the cost, yet no-one can deny that the work performed in all of these areas is of paramount importance to Australia. The Commission should not be expected to bear the whole of the financial burden for these or other community services. Ths Departments of Foreign Affairs, External Territories and Education and Science should be compelled to contribute towards the cost of these service programmes. Another expense of considerable volume Miles Aust. USA which is borne by the Commission is the SA $A rent paid for leased premises throughout 1370 136 the Commonwealth. This amounts to 2290 223 approximately Si.25m per annum. In its 3470 346 report on the Australian Broadcasting 2050 202 1380 135 Commission the Joint Committee of Public Accounts published on page 83 a table- I see the Chairman of. the Committee, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) in the House at the moment-whic h shows that the Commission owns office and studio space in capital cities amounting to 577,91 1 sq ft and leases for the same purpose premises providing 376,390 sq ft. The amount of space leased in country areas is not shown. The Commission had drawn attention to this state of affairs in its 35th annual report of 1966-67. It stated: The Commission again draws attention of liament to some of ihe difficulties under which organisation works. The role of the ABC in communication is important in our developing community. Its annual expenditure is large and Parliament has the right to expect efficiency economy on the one hand and responsibility ihe other. It stated further: However in spite of some improvement, the ABC ing: Still operates in Sydney from 17 separate and largely unsuitable buildings and in Melbourne from 10 buildings. In other cities, the situation is similar. Effective supervision and control is not easy because of this division of personnel between widely separated locations- a situation which inhibits the necessary consultation between officers and the effective co-ordination of our varied activities. The Commission has an urgent need for new buildings in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne and it is hoped that in spite of other claims, Parliament will find it possible to approve the capital costs involved. I recall that during the past few months there have been a couple of announcements made of plans for the provision of new buildings for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. But not only the amount of space that is leased by the Commission but also the diverse types of widely separated locations must have an innuence on efficiency by their effect on supervision, travelling time, staff rostering and communications, as was pointed out in the Commission's 37th annual report. As far as I can ascertain, the position in relation to accommodation for the Australian Broadcasting Commission has deteriorated rather than improved since 1967. Again I say that a couple of announcements have been made about improvements in this position. The present position in capital cities appears to be that in Sydney 20 buildings are leased, in Melbourne S, in Brisbane 4, in Adelaide 3 and in Hobart 2. In country areas in New South Wales 7 buildings are leased, in Victoria 3, in Queensland 4, in Western Australia 6 and in South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory 1 each. The 110th Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, drew attention to the deplorable accommodation available in various States to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The report used that very word 'deplorable' in describing conditions in Adelaide. The report went on to say that the fire protection and construction of the Hindmarsh ParSquare building were totally sub-standard. its The report stated that the accommodation mass in Melbourne was inadequate. It stressed the need to consolidate the operations in and Sydney and to improve dilapidated studios. on The accommodation in Brisbane was described as over-crowded and inadequate. The Committee concluded its report on the buildings used by the Commission by statOn the basis of the evidence and the inspections that it made your Committee believes that the capital city accommodation available to the Commission, particularly for radio and administration purposes, is inadequate and in many cases is seriously sub-standard. Your Committee further believes that, in the interests of efficiency, sustained and urgent efforts should be made to provide the buildings required by the Commission. With this the Opposition agrees. We ask the Government to take immediate action to provide accommodation which will allow the ABC to perform its statutory functions and to provide adequate and comprehensive programmes as efficiently and as economically as possible. Part of the Bill allows for a change in accounting procedures for the Board and for the Commission. It is in relation to that part of the Bill that I have spoken today. If the Government expects the Commission to operate efficiently and economically, the Government has a duty to assist the Commission by providing some of the facilities that it requires, particularly in relation to buildings. I return to Uie point about dele-, gation of authority. I ask the Postmaster General (Sir Alan H-utaie) to consider giving power of delegation of authority to the General Manager in relation to appointing staff. The Bill also provides for the curtailment of certain investments of superannuation funds in television station shares. This is not the first time that wa have discussed the curtailment of the ever-spreading control and ownership of television stations. Since the introduction of television in Australia in 1956 this type of amendment has become commonplace. The companies which have been granted television and radio licences have tried every means at their disposal to circumvent the provision of Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 4 of the Act on ownership and control, and they are still trying. Legislation was introduced in 1960, 1965 and 1969 in an attempt to curtail the activities of those people who already controlled major newspapers, radio stations and television stations in Australia. Less than 12 . months after the 1969 amendments had been moved, this Bill was brought into the House. The Opposition has repeatedly warned of the clangers of having an almost monopolistic control of our mass media. It is interesting to look at the ownership and control of our broadcasting and television stations. A perusal of pages 144-49 of the 22nd Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board shows that in relation to capital city newspapers the Adelaide Newspaper Ltd, that is the 'Advertiser' in Adelaide, has substantial or multiple interests in 4 radio stations and 1 television station; the Australian Consolidated Press group, that is the 'Daily Telegraph' in Sydney, has substantial control of 11 radio stations and 10 television stations; Davies Brothers, that is the 'Mercury' in Hobart, has substantial control of 2 radio stations and I television station; John Fair- oration fax Limited, that is the 'Sydney Morning Herald', 10 radio stations and 10 television stations; the Herald and Weekly Times, that is the Melbourne 'Herald', 17 radio stations and 5 television stations; News Limited, that is the 'News' in Adelaide, 5 radio stations and .11 television stations; Queensland Press Limited, that is the 'Courier Mail' and the 'Telegraph' in Brisbane, 3 radio stations and I television station; West Australian Newspapers, that is the 'West Australian' in Perth, 5 radio stations and 1 television station. The same thing appies with regard to provincial newspapers-newspaper s controlling 2 radio stations and 3 television stations. These things, must be slopped. I am pleased that the Minister is making a further attempt to do so in this Bill.",33
88,Mr DONALD CAMERON,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"When the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) commenced his speech he said that this Bill has been on the notice paper for a long time. I suppose that the yellow colour of the paper that he oration used for his notes indicates how long his speech was written. He made reference to the undesirability of monopolies controlpurely ling the news media. As a member of the Australian Labor Party, he is quite of the manner in which his Party uses its radio stations for pushing political propaganda. If any member of a party was aware of the danger of the news media being in the hands of a biassed party, surely a member of the ALP would be. My purpose in speaking is to raise a matter which is not under direct discussion at the moment but which I have been drawing to the attention of the Postmaster General (Sir Alan Hulme) for some months now. Most honourable members depend very much upon their constituents to bring to their attention facts and features of various Acts of Parliament which, at times, are not exactly fair. It was in this manner that in mid 1969 I had drawn to my attention the provision in the Broadcasting and Television Act which makes the person who is watching a programme on an unlicensed television receiver the person who is liable to prosecution. At that time 1 wrote to the Postmaster-General. He undertook to have the matter investigated and he did so. In due course he advised me that his department, in collabwith the Attorney-General's Department, would examine the matter with a view to devising a legally acceptable arrangement whereby a person other than the one detected may accept responsibility and thus be successfully prosecuted. In most cases the person caught using an unlicensed television receiver would not worry greatly about who was to be prosecuted. But there are unusual instances. For example, a husband may not own the television set; it may belong to his wife. The inspector calls and the husband is watching the set, and automatically the summons is taken out against the viewer. In certain instances this can mitigate against the person caught. A successful prosecution may affect his employment. The wife, in the instance to which T am referring, mny be more than willing to accept responsibility. The present Act does not permit this. Recently T wrote again to the Postmaster General drawing attention to his letter of 15th October 1969. He told me that the matter was still being considered, in collabwith the Attorney-General's ago Department. My argument is not with the Postmaster-General because the matter is a legal one. A legal matter has to be considered very carefully by the Attorneyaware General's Department before it can give the best advice possible. But this is the question I ask: How long are we expected to sit by and watch Acts of Parliament, needing minor amendment, continue in their present state while innocent people are wrongly convicted?",37
89,Mr BRYANT,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,It is a waste of effort.,38
90,Mr DONALD CAMERON,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The quesThe tion is: For how long must we wait? J said: think it is completely unreasonable for oflicers of the Attorney-General's Departmistakes ment to take so long to come up with an General answer to this question. All honourable casting members are aware that on occasions years in the future. can pass before an Act of Parliament reviewed. Today, the first day of the autumn session of 1971, we have before said: the House the Broadcasting and Television Bill. There will be a number of honourable members, particularly on the other side this House, who will never have an tunity to voice any view on this legislation because it may be years before it again comes before this House. The Postmaster-General has acknowlevidence edged in letters that some change is desirask able. I suggest that when items such as are referred to it the Attorney-General's Department has more than an obligation attend lo them promptly. I am disgusted to the Board. read in today's newspapers stories of tape recorded conversations being used in a court case in Victoria. One wonders about the responsibilities of the Attorney-Genoccasions. eral's Department when Acts of Parliament are so blatantly flouted from time to Nobody seems to care. I might say that I am one who does care. I. understand that the Postmaster-General has to wait on advice from the Attorney-General's Department in these matters. But for Heaven's sake let us have a change because in the meantime a lot of innocent people are suffering as a result of what might be described as inadequate legislation.",38
91,Sir ALAN HULME,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,in reply-On 25th August last year the honourable memtrue ber for Blaxland (Mr Keating) led for the. Australian Labor Party on this Bill and my comments will relate only to the remarks which he made of at that time. Normally one would not own waste time on the extraordinary issue of inaccuracies which the honourable member put together but he saw fit to use these at last totally inaccurate facts-h e called them Ihe facts-to attack me and the Broadcasting Control Board.,38
92,Mr BRYANT,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,You cannot even use English accurately.,38
93,Sir ALAN HULME,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I am not sure that I would regard the honourable member as an authority under these circumstances. honourable member for Blaxland The Bill is designed to cover up some of the made in the past by the Postmaster(Mr Hulme) and his adviser, the BroadControl Board and to justify their actions is The honourable member also accused me of deliberately breaking the law and he . . . the Postmaster-General has broken both the spirit and the letter of the Act . . . of Let me say at once that if I or the Broadopporcasting Control Board have failed to administer the Broadcasting and Television Act strictly in accordance with its provisions we are not fit to hold our positions. If the honourable member can find any that we have failed in this way I him. to produce it. If he cannot- I this know he cannot- I hope he will have the decency to withdraw any suggestion of to improper practices by me or members of The Government's policy with respect to the control of broadcasting and television stations has been clearly stated on many Broadly, the policy is that no person or company should be in a position time. to control more than 8 broadcasting licences or more than 2 television licences. The. Broadcasting and Television Act was framed with the intention of giving effect to this policy. Notwithstanding the comprehensive provisions of ihe Act some companies have over the years found ways of circumventing these requirements. In best every case when these tactics have been used I have moved to amend the Act, just I am doing with the present Bill. If the honourable member for Blaxland had any understanding of this matter he would have known that in 1965 when I introduced some most far reaching amendments to the Act to overcome some of the means avoidance that had been discovered his leader, then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said: It is admirable that the Poslma3ter-GeneraI has been stirred to take fresh steps to control monopolisation in ownership and programming of Australian commercial television stations. The legislation to which the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) referred on that occasion was, like the present legislation, introduced to prevent circumvention of the Government's intentions. Apparently this is yet another matter upon which the Leader of the Opposition and some members of his Party do not find themselves able to agree. The honourable member for Blaxland bolstered his extraordinary allegations with a collection of what he described as facts which he claimed to have gleaned from the 21st annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. He said he found them only after very close scrutiny. I can only add that it is a pity he did not scrutinise the very clear and exact information contained in Appendix I of that report a little more closely because if he had he might then have managed to get more of his so-called facts correct. I do not wish to take up the time of the House with a long recital but I shall content myself with a few examples of the honourable member's total failure to comprehend the truth. For example, he stated that John Fairfax Ltd owns ali the shares in 2GB Sydney and 2WL Wollongong, all the ordinary shares in 2CA Canberra and a majority of the shares in 3AW Melbourne, 5DN Adelaide and 2LF Young. In fact John Fairfax Ltd does not own one share in any of those companies. It does hold a 26 per cent interest in Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd, which in turn has a prescribed interest-that is to say, more than a 5 per cent shareholding-in the stations I mentioned. The honourable member said, that John Fairfax Ltd had a controlling interest in 4BH Brisbane. It does not. Indeed, Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings, which does own shares in that station, does not even have an interest amounting to a prescribed interest. Worse still the honourable member went on to say: Chandlers (Australia) Ltd of Brisbane transferred its shares in 4BH to John Fairfax and Sons Ltd although the company must have fully realised that in doing so it was consenting to a violation of the strict terms of the Act. Although he was not the responsible Minister at the lime the Postmaster-General should have personal knowledge of this transaction. I was in fact the responsible Minister at the time. The shares were not transferred as the honourable member suggested but were transferred in parcels of less than 15 per cent to a number of groups which did not include Fairfax. I believe it is true that Chandlers had considered transferring the shares in 4BH to one purchaser but this transaction was specifically prevented by the amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which I had introduced, and to which this House had assented, in 1969. For the rest of the honourable member's misstatements- I do not propose .to list all of them-let me say that he is apparently unable to distinguish between a controlling interest and a prescribed interest as defined in the Act and that he is further unable to distinguish between those 2 interests and a minor shareholding interest. 1 believe I should put right the Hansard record in relation to the statements - made by the honourable member for Blaxland who led on behalf of the Opposition in the debate on this Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 13-by - leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 14. After section 90A of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: : 90AA -(J. ) For the purposes of this Division, a company shall be deemed (but not to the exclusion of any other person) to be beneficially entitled to, or to an interest in. shares in another company where the shares are, or the interest is, owned by the trustees of, or otherwise held directly or indirectly for the benefit of, ar'fund maintained wholly or partly for the purpose of providing pensions, retiring allowances pr other personal benefits to or in respect of all or any employees or directors of the first-mentioned company.

94,Mr KEATING,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"On behalf of the Australian Labor,: Party I move: In proposed section 90AA (2.). omit twelfth clay of December', insert 'twenty-second day of October'. 1I have noted the remarks of the Postmaster General (Sir Alan Hulme). I have also noted that he did not answer the arguments 1 put concerning the control exercised by the Melbourne 'Herald' over 4 television stations instead of a maximum of 2 provided for in the Act. It is all very well to confront me with what he calls facts at the moment. I would like to see the second reading stage continued so that I may have the opportunity to answer a few of his allegations in detail. I move now to the amendment. On 12th December 1969 the Postmaster-General issued a Press release stating that he would introduce legislation to apply restrictions on the number of television stations that could be controlled by one interest. Obviously there have been improper uses of employees' pension funds by the interests who had caused such funds to be set up. He said that the Government believed it was undesirable that there should be any appearance of pension funds being used to add to such interests. At some stage during 1969 it was realised that 2 funds associated with John Fairfax and Sons Ltd had bought a 10 per cent interest in Canberra Television Ltd, the licensee of Channel 7, Canberra's only commercial television station. The legislation introduced by the Postmaster-General intends to overcome this type of occurrence. I shall read from an article in the 'Journalist', the publication of the Australian Journalists Association. It states: Mr Hulme said that the back dating of the amendment to 22nd Oclober had been decided on to prevent 2 instances of what the amendment would prevent in the future. That is, the using of pension funds to acquire control in other television and radio stations. The article continues: He would not say what the instances were and said that any further comment would not be made until legislation was introduced in ment. In his second reading speech the Postmaster General said: Honourable members will note thai the new provisions will apply as from 12lh December 1969. which was the date on which I announced the Government's intention to bring down this legislation. The Australian Labor Party would like to know why the effective date was changed from 22nd October to 12th December. We consider that some organisation must be able to escape the net if the legislation operates from 12th December and not 22nd October as first intended. If. the Postmaster-General cares to say why the legislation will now operate from 12th December 1969 and not 22nd October 1969 we will be pleased to hear his explanation. I cannot understand why the date of the release of the Press statement has anything to do with choosing 12th December. The Postmaster-General said in the Press release that the legislation would be effective from 22nd October. He is reported as saying that the reason why this legislation is to be implemented is to overcome the occurrences in the future which were mentioned in relation to John Fairfax & Sons Ltd and its interest in Canberra Television Ltd. I intend to leave the matter here and commend the amendment to the House.",39
95,Sir ALAN HULME,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"What was done in this matter had nothing whatever to do with any interest of John Fairfax and Sons Ltd in Canberra Television Ltd. It related to a situation which developed in Western Australia. I shall deal with it broadly. The situation arose with the transfer of substantial television interests to a pension fund. It was discovered that 2 out of the 3 trustees of the fund were directors of the television company. It was believed that if 2 trustees out of the 3 were directors of the company as well as trustees of Ihe pension fund in fact the fund is virtually still under the control of the company. On 22nd October it came to my notice that this was the situation. I made the statement as at 12th December. Normally when a statement is made and something is intended to apply out of that statement it applies as from the time the statement is made. It was intended to apply as at 22nd ParliaOctober because at that moment 1 did not know whether anything had happened. Subsequently it was found that there had been no change ancl no advantage had been taken of the Broadcasting and Television Act as it stood between 22nd October and up to 12th December. It therefore seemed appropriate that we should change the date of operation to the date of the announcement, 12th December, there being in the Government's view no disadvantage from the point of view of control. Under these circumstances the rejects the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 and 16-by together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 17. Sir ALAN HULME master-General) (5.16)- I move: That the following new clause be inserted in the Bill: ""17. After section 132 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:'132A -(1. ) A summons for the appearance before a court of summary jurisdiction of a defendant charged with having committed a prescribed offence may be served upon the defendant by posting a copy of the summons as a registered letter addressed to the defendant at the address shown in the summons, or in any information, complaint or similar document relating to the summons, as his address. '(2.)

'(3.) Where(a) a summons has been issued for the appearance before a court of summary jurisdiction of a defendant charged with having committed a prescribed offence; (b) the defendant does not appear before the court as required by the summons: (c) the evidence before the court of the service on the defendant of the summons is an affidavit that, under the last preceding subsection, is evidence that Ihe summons was served on the defendant in accordance with sub-section (1.) of this section; and (d) the court bas reason to believe that the defendant did not receive, or may not have received, a copy of the summons, or did not receive, or may not have received, a copy of the summons by such a date as would have given to him a reasonable time to comply with the summons, Government the court may, before proceeding to hear and determine the charge, require such, things to be done, as, in the opinion of the court, are necessary to ensure that the person has"" been informed of the charge and of the time when and the place where the charge will be heard - leave-take n '(4.) Where(a) a person has been charged with, and convicted by a court of summary jurisdiction of, a prescribed offence; (Petrie-Post - (b) the person did not appear before the court on the hearing of the charge; (c) the evidence before the court of the service on the person of the surnmons requiring him to appear before the court in relation to the charge was an affidavit that, under sub-section (2.) of this section, was evidence that the summons was served on the peifon in accordance with sub-section (I.) of this section; (d) application is made to the court, within two years after the date of the' conviction, by ihe person, or by an offker of the Postmaster-General's Department, for ihe conviction to be set aside, on the. ground that the person did not receive a'copy of the summons, or did not receive a cbpy of the summons by such a date as would have given to him a reasonable time to comply wilh the summons; ancl (e) the ground on which the application is made is established to the satisfaction of the court, the court may set aside the conviction.. .

This amendment adds clause 17. to the Bill. I shall make a few comments although I believe a statement was circulated to honourable members at an earlierpoint of time. It was circulated because it had been intended that this clause would be incorporated in another Bill. Since other aspects of broadcasting and television which were being looked at could not be brought in at that time it was decided that the clause should be made part of this Bill. So that there would be an explanation before we came to the debate on the Bill and. a consideration of the amendment the statement was circulated. I shall read it so that people might understand what is intended and so that it will be included in Hansard. The purpose of the clause is to permit the service; by means of the registered post, of summonses for offences in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. This will provide an additional means for the service of these summonses in most of the States. It will not do away wilh the availability of personal service in appropriate cases. In the past, it has been the practice to have summonses for offences relating to unlicensed broadcastancl television receivers served on defendants by members of the State police forces, but for some time there have been indications that, in some States at least, there was dissatisfaction with this arrangement. Some State Ministers in charge of police have taken the view that the service of summonses is not a proper police function ancl that it diverts trained men from more responsible activities. Acting on that view they have directed that police are not to used for the service of certain summonses for offences undertheir own Slate laws. More recently, with increasing demands on the police, it has been made clear to the Commonwealth that some of the Slates are no longer prepared to see members of the police used to serve summons for the more common Commonwealth statutory offences - The Chief Secretary for Victoria has already informed the Commonwealth that the Victoria Police will no longer undertake the service of summonses issued under the Broadcasting and Television Act. tt has, therefore, become necessary to arrange immediately for some other means of effecting service of summonses in respect of the common minor offences under the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. Ln considering means of effecting service of these summonses, consideration has been given to amendments made to the law of most of the States during recent years with the object of relieving the police of the need to serve all summonses. Until fairly recently, the laws in force in all States and Territories required that there should be personal service of all summonses for offences. Personal service generally involved delivering a copy of a summons to the defendant himself or leaving a copy in the last known or usual place of abode or business of the defendant with some other person who was apparently an inmate of, or employed at, that place and apparently over the age of 16 years. Between 1962 and 1967 the laws in force in most of the States were amended to enable summonses for relatively minor offences lo be served by post. The new procedures seem to have worked satisfactorily in the States and it is desirable that a similar procedure be authorised by Commonwealth law for service of summonses for offences in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. The new clause has been drawn so as to ensure, first, that there will be a high degree of probability that the defendant will in fact receive a .summons that is posted to him and, secondly, that if a defendant does noi receive a summons posted to him there will be a simple procedure by which he or the prosecutor may proceed lo have set aside any conviction that was recorded in circumstances where be the defendant was not in fact served wilh a summons or was not served soon enough to give him a reasonable opportunity to answer the charge. In providing for service by registered post, a more secure means of delivery than is required by corresponding laws of the States will be provided. Moreover, the provisions of the clause enabling convictions to be set aside are more favourable to defendants than the provisions in corresponding State legislation. I . am satisfied lhat the registered post will provide a satisfactory vehicle for the service of summonses under the Broadcasting and Television Act. I am also of the opinion that there will be adequate safeguards to ensure that no person will .be unjustly treated. . Mr STEWART (Lang) (5.22)- I move: In proposed section I32A, sub-scclion (4.), paragraph (d), omit 'within two years' and insert 'at any time'. The Postmaster-General (Sir Alan Hulme), in the speech which he has just delivered, said that there was a simple procedure which could be followed whereby someone who had allegedly been served a summons by post, who had been convicted and who could then show that he had not received the summons at all or in time to allow him to do something, could apply to the court within 2 years after the date of the conviction, or an officer Of the Postmaster-General's Department could apply to the court within 2 years after the date of the conviction, for the conviction to be set aside. The Opposition moves the deletion of the words 'within 2 years' and the insertion of the words 'at any time' because a person who was summonsed for an infringement of the Act could have left for overseas just prior to the issue of the summons and might not return to Australia for three or four years. He might be a member of the Foreign Affairs Department who was posted away and who did nothing about it or perhaps knew that the summons was there and let it go. If he came back after 2 years he might then find that in his absence, as he had not appeared at court, he had been convicted of an infringement of the Act. He has no right under this clause of applying to the court to have the conviction set aside. The Opposition cannot see that there any good reason or that there are sufficient reasons for making the limitation of years. Most of these applications would made within a short period of the convicfailed tion having been recorded, so the Opposifound tion cannot see that there is any difficulty in removing the words 'within 2 years' and inserting the words 'at any time'. I mend the amendment to the Minister.",40
96,Sir ALAN HULME,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment which the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) has moved. I understand that under the State Acts where service of summons by post is approved the time specified an appeal against conviction is about months. The honourable member raised a point which related particularly to a person going overseas. Very few people who go overseas do not sign a power of attorney appointing people who would have full responsibility for their affairs and who the normal course would receive all their correspondence and therefore have a substantial chance of knowing what had taken place in relation to such a matter as this. Another important factor is that the Opposition says: 'Let us not have a limit of 2 years. Let us have no limit at all.' If a person of 20 years of age were prosecuted he could have the right to appeal until he was 70 or until he died. Where would the court records be? Where would the departmental records be? There would be a hopeless situation if the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang were accepted. Compared with State legislation on a similar matter I feel that the Government is being generous in allowing a 2-year period. For that reason I indicate that we will not accept the. amendment.,43
97,Mr CHARLES JONES,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Whils t I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) I would put one suggestion to the Postmaster-General (Sir Alan Hulme). The Bil! deals with the prosecution of persons who ""fail either to take out or to renew 'a television viewer's licence. I think it is a fact that at least 50 per cent of those cases which are dealt with in the courts apply to people who have overlooked the need td take out is a licence. I have had quite a few people come to see me at different times when 2 the inspector has been around and their be names have been taken because they have to take out a licence. I have not anyone yet amongst those who have been prosecuted or who have come to see me who has refused to take out a licence. comIn most cases they had been mixed up in their dales or the husband ""had'left it to the wife to pay it and the Wifehad left it - to the husband to pay it. The result was that no-one paid it. In the main these have been the reasons for the convictions. Information that has come to me indicates that in 1968-69 there were 20.959 for prosecutions throughout Australia. No 3 doubt this has involved the. Minister's Department in quite a deal , of legal work in preparing the summonses. . Previously they had to be served, but now there is a new procedure. The matter"" then comes before the court. All of this fakes' time. in Very few people are prepared ""to defend the case. I have watched the"" reports of proceedings of these cases in the local newspaper. Invariably they are not defended. But still, it takes up the time of the court and it takes up the time of the Department in preparing the summons. Someone has to be present at the court on the day that the summons is dealt with. I would suggest' to the Minister that the Department should give some thought to on-the-spot fines in these cases where the inspector finds that someone has not got a licence. The inspector could give him a ticket, as is done for speeding or certain other breaches of the traffic laws. In such cases a man receives an on-the-spot fine. He can pay it if he wants to. Certain amounts are prescribed lo be paid for committing the breaches. If a man knows that he is guilty of having exceeded the speed limit or having done something that the traffic laws say he should not do then within a certain time- I think it is 28 days-h e pays the fine and that is the finish of it. He does not have to' appear before the court. The Police Department does not then have to go through the process one has to go through here, of drawing up a summons, serving it and having the court hear it. If a person says: ' I did not exceed the speed limit and I am going to take on the police', he has the right to do so. The case is then dealt with in court and the person can exercise his civil rights in the court to challenge the evidence given by the police. This same idea has been extended a further in New South Wales now with onlicence. the-spot fines for people who throw litter on the streets, in parks and in other places. The process is simple. A person is fined $5 for a certain offence. If he wants pay it he pays it within 28 days. If he not want to pay it he can go to court fight the council or whoever served the summons. I cannot see anything wrong with a similar procedure being adopted relation to television licences. I do not think any of us would suggest for 1 second that a person who does not have a televifor sion viewers' licence has committed some serious crime that requires him to be the brought to court to be dealt with. It is clear cut case. It is a simple breach of the law. Another aspect to be taken into account is that a lot of people who are quite law abiding citizens overlook the need to renew their licence. They are then dragged into court. I know a lot of people who are worried not by the fine but by the though! that they have had to be dealt with by the court. I think my suggestion is a way in which the Minister could easily get around this problem. He could forget about the procedures of drawing up and serving summonses and rights of appeal and all the rest of it. It is an opportunity to get with the times. I say that to the Minister advisedly: In this field 1 think it is an excellent opportunity to eliminate all the unnecessary court procedure and substitute for it a simple process. If a person gets a ticket and he knows he is guilty he can pay thefineand that is the finish of it. We know that in the main very few of these people are fined in excess of about $20. The only people who deliberately refrained from taking out licences were some of the radio and television personalities. I remember one person in particular whom I will not name because he is no longer with us. I think it was part of his act to get fined periodically. This was before we had television in Australia. He periodically got fined for not having a radio listeners licence. As I said, I think all the show that he used to put on at that time was part of his act. I think he deliberately failed to renew his licence so that he could get the publicity. It all worked into his programme. That is just my impression of vvhat he did, because he was bit fined too often to forget his renew his But I am talking rather about the average citizen who forgets to renew it. Not very long ago I made representations to the M. nisler on behalf of a conto stituent and a friend who assured me that does he had genuinely omitted to renew his and licence. But this fellow still had to go through the court. Against my advice he took a day off work to appear in court. in With a system of on the spot fines he could have settled the matter immediately. He probably would have been fined $10 his first offence and $20 for his second. The Minister could decide the amount of fines. It is only a very minor offence. I a am simply putting the suggestion forward in good faith in the hope that the Minister will give it serious consideration. I do not necessarily wish to move an amendment to this effect at this stage but the next time this particular portion of the Act is being considered I hope that the Government will do something about the position by way of an amendment.",43
98,Sir ALAN HULME,INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Petrie-Postmas ter-General and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (5.34)- I appreciate the comments made by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). I would be the last person to wipe a proposal for which I believe consideration is justified. I am pleased that the honourable member did not move an off the cuff amendment because it may have been very difficult to accede to it. But I assure him that I will look, at the proposal and consult my legal advisers about it. At some future time. I may be able to indicate to him quite clearly whether we are able to carry out his suggestion or whether the Government feels there are reasons why it should reject it. It should be appreciated that we in the Department believe we do the maximum possible so that people can avoid prosecution. We send a notice of renewal before the inspectors go into an area. We undertake publicity through newspapers and by radio. I think this gives fair notice to people that they,, should check whether their licence is due for renewal. But this is not what the honourable member was referring to. The honourable member was speaking about those people who accept that it is overdue and that it has to be paid. One would have to consider the fine to be imposed because in some cases the licence has not been paid for 3 or 4 years. Of course, this represents a substantial amount of money to many people in the community. If they had to meet the cost of a licence from the time of the expiry dale they would have to pay $20 a year for 3 or 4 years plus a fine. This would be fairly costly. We would have to look at the question of allowing time in which to pay. But I will have a look at the proposal which has been made and, if possible, incorporate il in a future amendment to this Act. Amendment to proposed new clause negatived. Proposed new clause agreed to. Title agreed to. The CHAIRMAN-Before reporting this Bill I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that this Bill and a number of others not yet passed 18953/71-R-12 ] were presented in and bear a citation of 1970. As the passing of this Bill did not occur in 1970 it will be necessary for the short title and relevant cross references to other Acts to be amended because of this. I regard these amendments to be of a formal nature and, understanding order 241, authorise them to be made by the Clerk. Similar amendments may also be necessary in other 1970 Bills when passed by the House. Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted . Third Reading Bill (on motion by Sir Alan Hulme)-by leave-rea d a third time. NA UNIVERSITY BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 October 1970 (vide page 2870), on motion by Mr N . H . Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
99,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"The Opposition regrets that the Minister for Education and Science (Mr N . H . Bowen) has not seen fit to accept the recommendation of the Council of the Australian National University that student representation on the Council be increased. The Minister's reply to the recommendation is somewhat light. He said: The University Council also recommended a further undergraduate repre^.entative, but the Government believes that having regard to the nature and composition of the Council and its methods of operation, the measures it proposes will provide adequate representation for undergraduate students. I do not know what that means really. The Council itself said there should be more undergraduate students on the Council. The Government takes the view that the operations of the Australian National University Council being what they are, whatever that means, there are enough undergraduate representatives now. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the University of Western Australia has 3 undergraduate members on its Council and that the request of the Australian National University for extra undergraduate representation was because of the conviction of the Council and the administrative staff of the University that this was necessary. The Minister must realise that communication between a governing body of a university and its undergraduate body is today a very important feature in university discipline and it is very important that the decisions of the Council of the Australian National University, for instance, be fully understood by the student body. For this reason it is a very good thing that at the meetings of the student body there should be a number of student representatives who are able to explain the decisions of the Council and also to participate in those decisions. ft is an advantage in the University of Western Australia that this now takes place. My son was the president of the undergraduates of the University of Western Australia-Presiden t of the Guild Council-las t year. I know from comments of the Vice-Chancellor how important the university regards its channel of communication with the student body. For the year my son was the only representative on the Senate of the University of Western Australia but the number being enlarged to 3 has improved the situation. I think it is simply a matter of communications. One student member can be singled out as, shall we say, being rather square or conservative or he may not be able to explain the decision of the Council effectively. If there are a number of student representatives it tends to prevent a breakdown of communication between the governing body of the university and the student body. The relationship between the Council and the student body of the Australian National University has been excellent. In the main the whole disciplinary structure at the Australian National University has been very good, as I am sure it has been in the University of Western Australia. Seeing that the Council itself felt that extra undergraduate representation was necessary I can only regret that the Government has rejected the proposal. However, it has made certain changes to the structure of the Council in that the undergraduate representative no longer has to be a graduate of the university. That is good. What is more, the research students' representative does not have to be a graduate of 2 years standing and the age of the student representative on the Council has been reduced to make it realistic that he should be an undergraduate. I think it would be a very good thing if the Council of the Australian National University had a representative of external students on it. External students at the Australian National University are a very important group. They are mostly Commonwealth civil servants who are studying for a degree and are very highly motivated towards their studies. It is an interesting feature of universities that external students within the faculties where one can be an external student include some of the very best students. However, because of their struggles to get a university education their results, which in certain cases can be amongst the very best in the university, generally are not up to the average. But some of these students are quite strongly motivated. They tend to be the shadowy figures of the university flitting in and out and yet they are students with special needs. It would be very good for those students to be represented on the Council of the Australian National University. I realise the Council itself did not ask for this and consequently I press it with some diffidence as a personal point of view. I can only say that while in the main I congratulate the Minister on the changes he has made. I regret he has not seen fit to accede to the requests of the Council which are based on its experience as a governing body. Debate (on motion by Mr MackeUar) adjourned.",45
100,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Sitting suspended from 5.46 to 8 p.m. ECONOMY: REDUCTIONS IN NA Ministerial Statement,46
101,Mr GORTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURES," by leave- Mr Speaker, I recently spoke to the nation on the state of the economy and on the likely inflationary effects of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's award of a 6 per cent increase in wages and salaries. I said then that in order to decide what action should be taken now, Cabinet had sought to discover the areas in which demand seemed to be growing most strongly. One of those areas is the public sector-spendin g by governments-and we believe one of the first lines of attack on rising costs and prices should be to restrict what is being spent in that area. When our Budget was introduced last August it was estimated that total 'Commonwealth' expenditure would be $7,883m. 1 should say here, I think, that although called Commonwealth expenditure, this amount included $2,708m for reimbursement grants and other payments to the States. Indeed, such payments made up more than one-third of the Commonwealth Budget. The total increase was 11.2 per cent more than the year before. But since that Budget was formulated the Government has been faced with significant additional expenditure. The national wage case decision and other wage determinations are estimated to add directly, in the rest of this financial year, $88m to the Commonwealth's own wage and salary bill in 1970-71. ln addition, those wage determinations, because they have led to an increase in average wages greater than was expected, will require the Commonwealth to pay an additional $20m to the States under the formula between the Commonwealth and the States. ID addition, we will need to pay some S58m to the States in this financial year to recompense them for the loss of the receipts duty tax on which they had budgeted. Mainly as a result of these two outlays, payments to the States are now expected to exceed the Budget estimates by some $83m. and emergency payments associated with recent floods will doubtless increase the outlays required. Other additional demands on our resources since the Budget was brought down include the provision of $12m as a capital advance to the Australian Wool Commission, and we believe some $6m will be required this financial year for rural debt reconstruction and farm adjustment. We must also expect increases in costs of the material used by the Government. So all in all, it is estimated by the Treasury that the net increase in expenditure since the Budget was prepared would amount to approximately S242m. if departments were provided with the sums they have asked fpr. This is the background against which we have decided that we should make reductions in what would otherwise have been spent. Having made a complete and detailed survey of Commonwealth expenditures, we propose to reduce the amounts which departments have sought by some $75m in the remaining months of this financial year. These reductions are made across the whole range of Commonwealth departments, but they do not involve any reductions in our payments to the States. Our object has been to effect reductions in the Commonwealth expenditures for Commonwealth purposes. We have not sought to achieve this at the expense of the States. A dissection of the reduction of §75m as between the main categories of Commonwealth expenditure is provided in a table which, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard.

These reductions are spread right across the board, but it will be observed that the areas where the more substantial savings have been made are defence, capital works and capital advances, and departmental running expenses. We were particularly anxious to effect economies in administrative expenditures, including the overtime and salary expenditures of Commonwealth departments. At the same time we have endeavoured to avoid reducing expenditures on essential development activities. In more general terms we have sought to reduce the contribution of Commonwealth expenditures to total demand and to curb the Commonwealth's demands n the labour market. Thus the reductions in departmental expenditures will involve restraint on Public Service employment. The Public Service Board reported to me that a routine statistical projection made prior to my instructions indicated an increase in 1970-71, in full-time employment under the Public Service Act, of 4.6 per cent on the numbers employed as at 30th June 1970. In 1969-70 the comparable increase was 4.8 per cent, whilst the increase in total civilian and defence forces employment in the community was 4 per cent. The Board advised me that my instructions for restraint on establishment increases could benefit the health and soundness of administration in the Commonwealth Service, and it suggested that a limitation should be placed on the increase in Service employment. The Public Service Board has now reported to me that in its discussions with departments, it has stressed the Government's policy of restraint but has not endeavoured to impose arbitrary cuts in employment in particular directions. The Board's recommendation, which has been accepted, was that departmental increases in employment, which will be kept to the minimum, should not exceed at 30th June 1971 an overall increase in the Service of 3.4 per cent as compared with numbers employed under the Public Service Act on 30th June 1970. This is a reduction of about 25 per cent on the projected increase in employment disclosed in the Board's earlier survey; or put another way, the Board's original projection was that the Service would grow by 10,534 in 1970-71. This growth has been cut by 2,735. _ The Commonwealth has, I believe, moved quickly and firmly in the area available to it. It is necessary to do so. For as we see it, the best interests of the community require that inflation shall be overcome, and one of the first steps to this end must be action to restrain our own expenditures. I present the following paper: Reductions in Commonwealth Government Expenditure-Ministeria l Statement, 16 February 1971. Motion (by Mr Chipp) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. NA UNIVERSITY BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 34).",46
102,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Warringah) (8.10)As the honourable member for. Fremantle (Mr Beazley) has said, the Bill before the House deals with several changes to be made in amending the Australian National University Act. I want to speak on only one aspect of the proposed amendments, namely, that amendment dealing with the proposal to increase the size of the Council of the University from 38 to 41 members.",48
103,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! There is far too much conversation in the chamber.,48
104,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Honourable members will know that the proposal before the House seeks to add to the Council the President of the Australian National University Students Association as an ex officio member and also to increase the representation of the non-professorial academic staff of the Institute of Advanced Studies and of the School of General Studies from one member each to two members each.,48
105,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Order ! I reluctantly must interrupt the honourable member in his speech. I have suggested that honourable members come to order. Iti in spite of my 3 warnings, they do not. take cognisance of my calls, I will have to deal with the members concerned.",48
106,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Unde r the proposal the Council of the University will consist of 12 members appointed by the Governor General, 7 ex officio members, 6 members elected by heads of schools and professors, 4 members elected by Parliament, 4 members elected by non-professorial academic staff, 4 members elected by convocation, 2 co-opted members from outside the University, one member elected by research students who, of course, are graduates, and one member elected by undergraduates. I have some sympathy with the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle concerning student representation because, as a member of the Council, I was privy to discussion within the Council which unanimously recommended to the Government that, amongst other things, the Council be increased by further undergraduate representatives. The recommendation was based on several criteria. Firstly, the Council had been most impressed over the years with the excellent contributions made to Council discussion by the student representatives. These single representatives have had an increasingly difficult task to perform. In addition to their responsibilities as students they have had the task of representing alt student bodies on the Council. They have been unremitting in their efforts to acquaint themselves with student views and their efforts to fulfil this obligation, plus their other responsibilities, have, in some cases, precluded the opportunity they have had of taking as active a part in Council activities and committees as would be desirable. Undoubtedly their participation, where possible, has been helpful. I point out that since the student representative has been on the Council student numbers have more than trebled, with a similar proliferation of the clubs, societies and sporting bodies which he alone represents. In view of the increasing burden being placed on ihe student representative and because the Students Association felt it should have a voice, some years ago the Council invited the President of the Students Association to attend Council meetings and to speak if necessary. He, of course, has had no voting rights. The amendment before the House formalises this arrangement and gives the President of the Students Association voting rights, lt does this by making him an ex officio member of the Council. The President of the Students Association has many other responsibilities within the University and I believe he may find great difficulty, because of this, in taking part fully in Council activities. There is no doubt in my mind that the student body should have a properly informed voice which has the opportunity to participate fully in Council functions and, while so doing, adequately represent a wide range of student views. It may be thought that it is a large Council and that it would be unwise to make it too much larger. It may be felt that the Council should be a balanced one without undue numbers being achieved by any one section within or outside the University. 1 would agree with both these sentiments but, in looking at the composifully tion of the Council, the one section heavily outnumbering the other sections is that represented by the Governor General's appointees. Certainly an additional student representative would not alter unduly the balance nor would it lead to a student takeover. If one were concerned about the size of the Council I doubt whether it would be logical to look to the student representation as one in which cuts should be made. It may be thought that matters concerning students do not come before the Council frequently and that they are dealt with at a lower level. This certainly is not the case. The Council of the University has an important and real role in hearing and understanding the student point of view and considering the student position. It should be remembered also that in many cases the Council of the University is seen by the students of the University as a somewhat mystical body which docs not understand the problems of the undergraduate body and, more importantly, does not want to understand them. Through student representation on the Council this can be seen not to be the case. In fact, quite frequently Council changes its view in the light of representations properly made and properly argued by student representatives. I believe the two-way flow of communication between the governing body of the University and those being governed to be of tremendous importance. To my mind, the role of the student representatives in presenting Council decisions to the student community is just as important as their role as representatives on the Council. Only good can come from such participation and responsibility. To deny adequate participation is merely to increase the chances of unfortunate mistakes and actions occurring, brought about by lack of information, contact and communication. The Council of the Australian National University is a responsible body with practical and constant experience in the task of administering a great universit; It was unanimous in its recommendations to the Government. These recommendations were designed to further develop and enhance a history of achievement in sound university government and practical, workalso able council-student relationships. Like the honourable member for Fremantle, I am disappointed that the Government has decided at this stage not to endorse the Council's recommendations with respect to student representation. I am glad that the Government has gone part of the way by including the President of the Students Association as a full member of the Council. It should be remembered that the person holding the position of President of the Students Association is, in fact, elected to that position, so in one sense the elected student representative membership has been increased to two. However, in view of what I have already said, I feel that the President of the Students Association may be hard put to fully discharge all his responsibilities and that a less than desirable student representation and involvement in Council activities may result. As a member of the Council I will have a first hand opportunity to assess the effect of the proposed alterations. Should my fears prove soundly based I hope I will have the aid of the Minister for Education and Science (Mr Bowen) in my efforts to have further amendments ratified.",48
107,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," I gather that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) is displeased with the approach of the Minister for Education and Science (Mr Bowen) to this matter and, if that is the case, I support him. As far as one can judge, this approach to student representation on the Council of the Australian National University is just another piece of legislative humbug. It seems to me that this is a simple and straightforward matter where the most logical response would be to advance student representation. However, with what should be the least expensive piece of policy to implement the Government still fumbles the ball. The issue, it seems to me, is: What is a university? What is it about? What are the criteria upon which it functions? A university is a partnership between the community and the student body which also is an important part of the community. At present in Australia about 1 per cent of the population are students of Australian universities. An increasing percentage of students are able to take their full place in politics in this country. I think that the son of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) is a senior officer of the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. Many students stand for Parliament. Many of them are active members of political institutions yet, in respect of the simple issue of their having some effective say and representation on the bodies which control their own future, they are not to be trusted with more than one representative in 30 or 40. I believe it is nonsense that at this stage in a country such as Australia, in a community which in the past has always established fairly advanced attitudes on what representation means-vote s for women and so on-w e are being more conservative than most other countries. Here we are proposing a continuing hierarchical structure. The honourable member for Warringah spoke about the governing and the governed. I do not think that is what a university is about. Admittedly there are highly specialised people who are supposed to train people in various ways in the technical faculties-tradesme n in medicine, dentistry, architecture and so on-bu t in the real fields of education, in the humanities, a different kind of thinking altogether must be produced. Therefore the. professorial body-the teaching body-is a specialised kind. Probably in this area of education, as much as any other-perhap s more than in some others-the student body is a very - important part of society. It has been trained to take a more important and effective role in the community than most others. But we have no trust in it whatsoever. We are to carry out a revolution in the Australian National University. On a body of some 40 or 41 we are now to have a couple of students representing the student body. I do not know what the Minister fears. Is he afraid that these 2 or 3 students will overrun the whole system? Is he afraid that they will take over? Of course, this is nonsense. I believe it is time that we did something such as has been done overseas. Take what has been done in Britain as an example. In that country a select committee made up of a standing convocation of people concerned, with education has been set up to examine the way in which students must be fitted more effectively into university bodies. The legislation now before us is a pretty fair demonstration of the continuing conservatism of Australian education and particularly of the way it is administered from this place. Of course, nothing demonstrates the conservative nature of Australian education and university management better than a glance at the representation of students on the governing bodies of Australian universities. According to last year's report of the Vice-Chancellor's Committee, Adelaide University, as becomes that stronghold of establishmentism and conservatism, does not have student representation. The Australian National University will have 2 student members out of a total membership of 41. The Flinders University will have 1 representative- a big advance. James Cook University in Queensland will have 2 students who will be admitted as observers. We would not want the danger of letting these students have a vote. It is heartening to see that La Trobe University and Melbourne University-the stronghold of freedom, progress and the militant approach to these things-hav e 4 student members. Monash University has only a couple. Other universities such as New England, New South Wales and so on have single representatives. In fact, as I think my colleague from the other side pointed out, representation of this sort is barely representation at all. Even the most skilled of us here, even the most hardened sufferers under majority domination, find it difficult to have an effective say when there is only one of you and 40 against you. I think we ought to put ourselves in the place of the student. No matter how much the student is vigorous and dynamic in his student body, when he turns up in the council of the university he is amongst people many for whom he has a great deal of respect for their intellectual capacity and many of whom he may regard as unduly conservative. However, he is bound to have some sort of respect for them. How can such a student get the views of his student body across? We are speaking of student bodies of Australia representing 100,000 students. In Australia we have about IS or 20 student representatives on the governing bodies. It is worthwhile putting on record what the students of the Australian National University had to say in talking about what the council itself had said. I would not regard the council as being the most revolutionary, militant and progressive body in Australia either. The students said: But the rebuff is seen within the University as even more important than the mere rejection of further student representation, though the seriousover ness of this is great enough. The whole so-called 'autonomy' of the University is held up to ridicule by this decision. They went on to say: A decision such as this is not likely to convince students that their demands are being sufficiently heeded. Indeed it adds to the teefing that the Government is willing to go out of its way to slap students in the face, and the University is not strong enough to give more than token resistance. I would like the Minister to explain exactly upon what criteria he is operating when he says: 'J know better than the council of the university'. Of course, a number of members of ihe council are representatives of the Ministry-the y are appointed by the Ministry. What are the great intellectual attainments, achievements aud capacities of the Minister who says: ' I know better than all of this council'. T do not have the names of the members of the council with me now. While the Minister has established his reputation in some fields 1 doubt whether even he would claim that he has this final touch over all of the assembled body of which 2 members of this House are members. It will he worthwhile the Minister explaining why he or perhaps his advisers in the Department of Educadon and Science- I am not too sure whether he is the creature of his advisers or whether they are the implementers of his policy-hav e followed this course. However, someone along the line has said, and the Minister is prepared to implement it, that what the council of the university has said cannot be adopted. I said earlier that Australia has been more conservative in this aspect than have representative bodies overseas. The House of Commons Select Committee on Education and Science examined this question and came down heavily in favour of increased student representation. That Committee said that student representation must be accepted. The Committee said: Our institutions of higher education must recognize that changed circumstances brought about by their own expansion, changes in society itself and the need to question long-standing assumptions, should compel a ready and sympathetic response to proposals for reappraisal and reform. Later it stated: It also supports student representation on academic government bodies, as opposed to consultation, offers warnings about student unrest examinations ancl a looming crisis over residential accommodation. It would appear to me that in this issue alone, with all of the evidence of unrest throughout universities of the world, and from which unfortunately Australian universities have not been free, we are ignoring the opportunity to bring the student body into the area where, through consultations, they can be made to feel part of the apparatus-par t of the machinery. In America, of course, the situation is the same. A report which appeared in the 'Washington Bulletin' stated: University governance systems should be reformed to increase participation of students and faculty in the formulation of university policies that affect them. But universities cannot be run on a one man, one vote basis without participation of all members on all issues. I would think that many senior secondary schools would have more student participation in the management of the day-today running of the institution through perfect systems and the like-this has been the case over the last 3 or 4 years and particularly during the last 2-tha n is the case in universities. We are talking of people who are of a mature age; people who can be asked to accept all kinds of responsibilities in the community. Yet we think it would be dangerous to have 3 or 4 such people on a council of 40. I do not believe that the Minister feels this way at all. I would be very interested to get into the back of his mind or the minds of his advisers to see whether they think this is good enough. i believe that the under-graduate student body of the Australian National University now numbers between 3,000 or 4,000. In fact, a couple of representatives of the nature proposed in the legislation is almost non-existent representation. I would again make a plea, as has my friend the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), that part time and external students ought to have some say in the system. A university is terribly important to the people who go through it. A remarkable and alarming number drop out for all sorts of reasons. They do not see the point of it. Therefore, participation in a representative capacity is more than just where it fits into the academic scheme. We have relations between the student body and the general management. Of course, management is supposed to use the term 'the government and the governed'. One has to accept the fact that there are some people who will have to run such an institution. It is said that this institution does not belong to the students because the community itself subsidises the university system very heavily. Therefore the system of the relationship between the students, the staff and the whole body of the university has to be developed. Representation is a very important feature of our life. It is the way in which we manage most affairs. Participation is another important feature. It is unfortunate that the House has not had a greater opportunity to look at this in depth. With the increasing role of universities in Australian life and with the increasing number of students and the disappointment of people who cannot get into universities this may well be another field in which the House could do something such as was done by the House of Commons when it set up a select committee to examine this matter. I am critical of the Minister in this regard. 1 believe he is being unduly conservative. In fact, he has turned back to feudal times. He is being quite feudal about this. Even 300. 400 or 500 years ago universities were a Uttle more democratically controlled although discipline then was perhaps a little more rigorous when one did break the rules. T believe that we must find some way in which more people can be brought into this. There has to be a great deal more thinking. Perhaps the precedent established by the House of Commons might be well worthy of consideration. A lot of people have had a lot to do with universities in one way or another either as students or as people who pay for students or people who have been members of the council. Some members of this House have been on university staffs. I am sure that they could bring some expertise to bear from which even the Minister, steeped as he is in the exaltation of his own position, might gain something.",50
108,Dr SOLOMON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Mr Speaker, two of the three speakers who preceded me in this debate are members of the Council of the University under discussion and therefore, I think, might be considered to have a fairly special interest in this subject and perhaps even to be listened to with more intent than the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) or myself. Nevertheless, I wish to take leave to join issue with them and with the honourable member for Wills on some of what they had to say. We are discussing the question of raising the Council membership of the Australian National University from 38 members to 41 members. Might I say at this stage that I think that we have before us questions of principle and of practice. The question of principle on which I would join some slight issue, I think, with the Minister for Education and Science (Mr N. H. Bowen), as have the honourable members who have spoken before me, is that of declining to accept the proper judgment of the now Council of the University. I think that if that judgment can be accepted at any stage, it should be so. I think that, in general, it is unfortunate if we need to exercise our will in an opposite direction. At the same time, this Parliament is substantially, if not entirely, responsible ultimately for the structure of this university, unlike the others in the country, and I think that it must remain to the Government to exercise its judgment on matters of this kind. If we are talking about something which is a specifically academic issue, I would find it abhorrent- I notice with some slight pleasure that the Minister has agreed with me-and I would say that it was quite unethical and a transgression of the rights of the University if we were to join issue on a specifically academic matter. But this, surely, is not so. It is a matter of structure of the administration of the University. Having made that point which I believe to be one of principle in the broad, I would like to talk about the practice. I believe that a number of red herrings have been drawn across the trail or, if not red herrings, in fact some misconstructions have been presented notably by my friend, the honourable member for Wills, but also constructions with which I do not agree have been put forward by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) and, perhaps to a lesser extent, by my colleague from Warringah (Mr MACKellar). They spoke-on e or all of them-as if the addition of one or two more students-in fact, it is one student who is being knocked back, as it were-to the Council would change the situation entirely. They spoke as if this would change the situation from one where it is suggested that the student body is being rebuffed and not trusted to one in which the student body is seen to be trusted intimately and in which no problem remains. I do not see it that way. I think that what we need to look at is this: A body of 38 is to be extended to 41 which, in my view, already becomes well nigh unmanageable in terms of efficient committee organisation. The question is: Who should be added? I would like to put this into context. I think that, if we are talking about the people who importantly should be added to this body, the people to whom I would look first are the subprofessorial representatives. I , at one stage of my young existence, had the benefit of the experience of being on a university council as such a person- a sub-professorial representative-for 2 years. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind-whethe r or not I had been in that position-that the more important addition to this Council are the 2 extra sub-professorial members. Now, it may be regarded by the honourable member for Wills and some other people as a somewhat conservative and even archaic notion-no , I do the honourable member for Wills wrong; he said something to this effect-to believe that a university is in fact a community of scholars. Some people do not believe this any more. But, if it is, a university is a community of people of all ranks and grades who have proved their scholastic worth, more or less, and who join at certain times with the administrative echelons to run an academic institution. By definition, the people who are there to learn scholarship are not already scholars. They may be coming along very well in the making. Therefore, we must look at the reasons for student membership of the Council. The reasons are good reasons but, basically, they are reasons, as I see the situation, which involve a 2-way play of information. They enable the student body to put its views and its slant upon any decision which is being made by the governing body, that is, the Council. They enable that Council officially, formally and with due writing to transmit through the student body representative or representatives the reasons for certain decisions being taken and so on. There has not been any suggestion either in this legislation or by the people who so far have spoken to the Bill that any attempt should be made to have the student body in such a situation that its representatives were remotely in a position to out-vote for example the professorial nominated members, the Governor General's nominees, the Convocation's nominees and so on. So, it is a question of representation for the transmission of information and attitudes as well as, if honourable members like, judgments; but it is not a question of out-voting. The acceptance of an extra undergraduate representative in no way would have made any difference to that situation. Tn fact, it could be said of the students would be represented adequately by, let us say, the president their representative council or whatever is called. It therefore seems to me that much the more important additions really in terms of practical academics is the adding of sub-professorial representatives. Still, it is true-and I agree with honourable member for Wills on this point-that we in Australia are conservastructure tive in this matter. As far as I knowmay be a little bit out and I may even have the names wrong-the most progressive, if honourable members like, the enlightened and the most permissive liberal representation of any governing body that I can recall is at the University of Sussex in which the University's statutes say something to the effect that not more than one-third of the council of the university or its equivalent shall be of professors. other words, the non-professorial or submodified professorial staff has a major say in the governing of that quite new institution. We are a far cry from that position. I would argue, without I hope being dubbed the greatest conservative of all time, that on a body of this size the acceplevels tance of a total of 3 student represenargue tatives-on e a graduate student in effect, one the president of the governing body students and one another student-is not bad representation to enable the situation which I have outlined as 1 see it to exist. This is a situation in which the transmisignorance sion of attitudes and information is sible and even is formalised. There is-and people have tended to overlook this fact-o n that governing body a sector whereby the Convocation can have 4 representatives out of the total of 38 which is to be increased by this legislation to 41. We are in the process of passing a Bill to provide that these people shall not need to have 3 years standing. They can be- I know that it is unlikely, but they can be-graduate s of immediate succession. Ln other words, it would be possible, however unlikely, that the Convocation could put forward 4 immediate graduates onto the governing body of the University. So, it is very hard to see how one can properly argue that the views of undergraduate students, of research students and of newly graduated people will that the views be overlooked. A great deal of this, as of any system, of depends on the worth of the operators. it What I am really talking about is the structure. If the operators have it in mind not to listen to properly put views, decently reasoned arguments and so on, no system will make the position better. But it seems to me that, given the goodwill of the the operators-and that is almost to be expected in a situation such as this-this is not one which is inimical to I the rights of the undergraduates. One could dilate and broaden this argumost ment very greatly indeed. It has been implied, 1 think by some of the previous speakers, that this raises the whole question of youth and student representation in particular. Of course, this is a major issue of debate in the world as of the last 2 or 3 years, lt is not true to say however that In the structure which is here being revised or shows a lack of trust in students, shows a disinclination to listen to their views or anything of that kind. In fact, the contrary is true. But I would maintain the But conservative view that essentially the same outlook applies to people in training as that which applies to those at much lower of education-abou t which we could at some length-involvin g essentially the - comprehensive and even of sub-comprehensive views of education and a the suggestion that people who know not very much may. by sitting around in circles of their own number, pool their joint and thereby learn a great deal. posHaving not so terribly long since been an undergraduate in two or three universities, although the time moves on, I submit that basically students are at a university to learn and to offer what views they develop from that learning as they go along. There is no case to answer about having any very substantial student representation, although it would have been a nice sop or, even better than that, perhaps a nice acquiescence if in fact the Government or the Minister had not seen fit to drop one undergraduate representative from the Council. I do not want to raise the whole issue of student power and student representation in institutions such as universities at large. I think I have indicated briefly the relative conservatism of my view. I believe that basically it is not doing students a great favour to take ever increasing numbers of their body on to the ultimate governing body of an institution such as a university for the purpose of making them feel they have power. Unless they have a potential majority of votes, they do not have power; they have only the appearance of power. In fact they have representation. That is what they should have; that is what they do have. That is what they can best use, and I believe that for the time being representation on the Council of students, as distinct from the sub-professorial staff, to whom I have referred earlier and whom I regard as being on such a body as this by right, can properly be regarded as a matter of grace and not necessarily as a right, because the students are there to learn at least because they know somewhat less than the people who are there to teach them, although you, Mr Speaker, and others might disagree with that viewthat point.",52
109,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL, I am a bit on the side of most of the speakers tonight but I disagree with the honourable member for Denison (Dr Solomon). I am rather surprised at his reaction to the advice given by the Council of the Auspating tralian National University. I take it the Council is hardly a revolutionary body. I should guess that most of the nominees would be well and truly acceptable to establishment in all respects. I cannot understand the terrible fear which gripped the heart of the honourable member for Denison when he saw the recommendation from the Council that 2 more students should be added to the Council.,55
110,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Order ! The honourable member for Wills, who is interjecting from the back of the chamber, is out of the House. He is out of order in interjecting and still more out of order in doing so while he is not sitting in his seat.",55
111,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I wonder whether the honourable member for Denison had in his mind some picture that with one more student representative on the Council the numbers would be completely the way of the students. Of course that is not the position, and I do not think he would really think that. I do not understand why he chose to ignore the advice of the body that is basically responsible for running the University. I know that the honourable member for Denison has said that it is our responsibility to determine the administration of the Australian National University. I will grant that. But since most of us are not experts in this field, I should have thought that we would have been prepared to take the advice of the group of people we have determined should be running the institution. I do not agree with the honourable member for Denison that students are at universities just to shut up and learn and to have facts and figures shoved into their heads. They are there to question, to argue and to disagree. They are there to think about not just the narrow confines of the subject they are there to study in order to get a degree; they are there to think about all that involves the Uving of a university. I think that perhaps the increasing student unrest throughout the world is a sign students are becoming more responsible regarding this aspect of university life. It has very little to do with the actual attainment of a degree. Unfortunately, that is all we ever hear about most of the time. I think that it would add to the confidence of the student body and would increase the students' sense of belonging to and particiin the university if they had more that say in the running of the university. I agree that the university staff also should have more say, which was essentially the the point made by the honourable member for Denison. If we feel that the number of representatives on the Council is becoming too large- I will grant that 41 people is a lot for rational discussion-perhap s we can afford to cut off some of the fuddy-duddies on the Council. I refer to some of the people who have been there for many years or the more senior members of the Council. Often Ihey are businessmen or even heads of departments who have grown old and rusty in their outlook on this responsibility. I think that more than ever universities need to be alive to the problems facing this community and they need to have a more resilient approach. They have to be prepared to take new departures, and this is not a facility that older people have. So for these reasons I join with the other honourable members who deplore the fact that the Government has chosen not to take the advice of the University Council and has in essence put only one more student on the Council. I admit that this is not such a revolutionary thing anyway, but that is all the more reason why the gesture of accepting the recommendation of the Council would have been so valuable. Mr N. H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Minister for Education and Science) (8.45)-in reply- I would like first to express my appreciation of the reasoned and constructive speeches which honourable members have made during this debate on the amendment to the Act governing the Australian National University. But underlying the remarks of a number of honourable members was the implicit thought that there was something inherently wrong in the Government, which has the responsibility for running the Australian National University, rejecting the - recommendation of the Council of the University as to its own membership. T reject that implied suggestion by honourable members. I do not think that on a question of the structure the Council the Government automatically is bound by the Council's recommendation as to its structure.",55
112,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"We did not say that. Mr N. H. BOWEN-But that was implied. On the other hand, 1 want to make it quite clear that at all times the Government would treat with the greatest of respeci any recommendation that came from the Council of the University. But to suggest that the Government, having the responsibility, could not review or reject recommendation would be wrong. As the honourable member for Denison (Dr Solomon) pointed out, it is not a matter affectgraduate ing the administration of the University or its academic position. It is the structure of the University for which we are responsible. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) referred to rhe University of Western Australia, of which he had some special knowledge. It was the only one to which he referred, and he pointed out that it had 3 student representatives on its council. Lest it be thought that this is a common pattern in Australia, I think that to put the matter in its perspective 1 should state to the House just what the current position is in the universities of Australia. The number of student representatives ranges from 1 to 3.",56
113,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"That is what we said. Mr N. H. BOWEN-Thre e is the maximum. Some of the larger universities including the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and the University of Queensland, have only 1 student representative. A number of the smaller ones also have only 1 representative. These would include the Macquarie University, the University of New England, the University of Newcastle, the University of Wollongong, the University of Adelaide, Flinders University and the University of Tasmania. Those universities have I student representative.",56
114,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Order ! 1 would suggest to the honourable member for Wills, who is interjecting, that he restrain himself. He has interrupted the Minister on 3 occasions since the Minister began to speak. I had to warn him previously about interjecting. In fairness to the House, to the Minister and of to honourable members interested in the debate, the honourable member for Wills should restrain himself, and I suggest that he does so. Mr N. H. BOWEN-It is true that there are 2 universities which have 2 student representatives on their governing bodies. These are Monash University and the James Cook University. There are 3 which have 3 student representatives. These are the University of Melbourne, La Trobe University and the University of Western Australia. I think that one honourable a member suggested that La Trobe University had 4 undergraduate representatives. It has 3 undergraduate representatives plus 1 representative. As we are not including the graduate representative in our discussion of the Australian National University the comparison is 3 as against 2. This is the picture in Australia and I think that this amendment to the Act in fact very greatly liberalises the position in the Australian National University, not only in increasing the number of student representatives from 1 to 2 but also in reducing the age from 21 years to 18 years, in providing that graduates do not have to be of 2. years standing but may be elected immediately on graduation and so on. Broadly speaking I think that honourable members who have spoken would be in favour of the advances in this Bill but would consider that in this one respect they do not go far enough. 1 would like to make some comment on this question of student representation. The Government considers that what it has approved in liberalising the student and graduate representation on the Council will in fact give appropriate representation to the various interests. The present size of the Council is, as honourable members know, 41- a very large and unwieldy body for discussion-and the Government considers this is large enough. It is a number which should only be increased for very strong reasons. In the Government's view in a, council as large as this one the strength of the representation of the students will depend not upon the number-becaus e 3 would not have a much greater proportion of 42 votes than would 2 of 41-bu t on the quality of the representatives. Anyone who has been on one of these bodies knows that it is really the quality of the represenQuite tation rather than the numbers which counts for strength of representation in the councils of such a body. I think therefore that the Government's view, reflected in this Bill, is a proper and responsible approach to the constitution of the Council at this time. Nevertheless, I have listened with care to what has been put. I did, when announcing the Government's decision, say that we would keep the position under review and consider the performance of these students on the Council and if I came to the conclusion at a later point of time that the number should be increased, then I would not hesitate to review the matter. In maintaining it under consideration I will certainly have in mind what honourable members have said during the course of the debate this evening. I suggest, however, that we should not hold up what are very beneficial advances embodied in this Bill. Question resolved in the amrmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr N . H. Bowen) read a third time. BILLS OF EXCHANGE BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 May 1970 (vide page 2364), on motion by Mr Hughes: That the Bill be now read a second time.",56
115,Mr CONNOR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," The Opposition does not oppose this Bill but offers criticism of the paucity of its provisions, the delay in its introduction and the failure of the Government adequately to conceive of. the modern trends in the world of banking. In terms of mechanics this Bill merely repeals section 88 of the Bills of Exchange Act and substitutes in its place proposed sections 88B to 88E inclusive. It is true that finance is government and, of course, this Government typically justifies the old saying of 'a mountain in labour which has brought forth the proverbial mouse'. The Government's thinking is outmoded. It is living in an economic and intellectual backwater. a number of years ago the Manning Committee brought down a very substantial report. It adequately and conscientiously covered the whole field of cheques and bills of exchange. It went so far as to draft a new Cheques Act which it suggested might be considered by the Government. Of course the Government with its usual Fabian concepts and modes of behaviour has failed to do anything about it. For what the Bill is worth it merely deals with some of the mechanics of handling cheques payable to order. Mr Garland-Ver y substantial ones.",57
116,Mr CONNOR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Ver y substantial, of course, in terms of the mechanics of banking and the number of tellers to be employed. There will conceivably be a quite substantial saving to the trading banks. We do not disapprove of this but we offer very strong criticism of the absence of legislation relating to the crossing of cheques and also the absence of a new Cheques Bill. As a matter of fact, as the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) mentioned, the general law relating to Bills of Exchange originated way back in the year 1882 because our Bills of Exchange Act as it now stands is based substantially upon that measure. On the mechanics of the handling of cheques payable to order. I repeat the comment made by the Attorney General that of some 800 million cheques issued annually in Australia about a quarter were order cheques and at least three-quarters of all cheques that were drawn were deposited to the credit of the payee. The most that this Bill does is to say that if a cheque payable to order is paid into the account of the payee there is no obligation on the teller to examine the endorsement on the back of the cheque or even to check if there is an endorsement. In the case of a cheque presented over the counter for payment where it is payable to order there is still an obligation on the banker. In respect of a collecting banker there is. of course, an obligation to check an endorsement but again there is an exemption offered to the paying banker, and we do not disapprove of that. But we do say that the Government is about 20 years behind the times in its whole approach to banking. A cheque is, of course, a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and bills of exchange have a very long history. There is perhaps a very rudimentary form of a bill market in Australia and it is time that the Government considered stimulating a true bill market, because if one takes the example of the English financial system the rate of discount for bills of exchange is the main economic regulator of the British economy. It could well be done in this country. A bill of exchange is a very potent and valuable weapon and a very good means for a government actually to control the credit on issue in a country. In more general terms this Government has completely failed since the early 1950s to prevent the gradual filching of the control of the credit system of the country that is taking place by the hire purchase system and by the fringe banking system-the grey banking system as it is called-and more recently it has completely failed to control the advent of merchant banks from overseas. Wherever there is a honey pot one will find the flies gathering. I do not disapprove of the Government's policy of restricting the number of banking charters. We quite agree with that. One of the main characteristics of banking in the last 20 years has been the gradual diminution of the number of trading banks and so far as I am concerned-and I speak for the Opposition-the y are reputable, well administered, sound and conscientious organisations. But if one examines the total advances of the hire purchase system today one will find that they almost equal those of the banking system. That is due to the decision of the Government in the early 1950s to curtail the extent to which trading banks could discount the promissory notes and hire purchase agreements offered as security by variousfinancecompanies. When they were told there was a limit to the credit available to them they decided to thumb their noses at the Government and to go on to the open market and borrow directly from the public. That decision resulted in the distorted interest rates which prevail in this country today. This situation is nothing short of a major scandal. I particularly want to draw the attention of the Government to a decision of the High Court of Australia given 57 years ago. I refer to a case in the High Court between the Commissioners of the State Savings Bank of Victoria and Permewan, Wright and Co. Ltd in which it was held: . . . that the essential characteristics of banking were the collection of money by receiving deposits on loan, repayable when and as agreed upon, and the utilisation of the money so collected by lending it again in such sums as were required. A majority held further that il was not necessary, in order to bring a banker within the Bills of Exchange Act that he should as part of his business collect cheques for, or pay Ihe cheques of, his customers. In other words, that definition exactly fits the functions of the average hire purchase company in Australia today. Those companies are not dealing merely with hire purchase. They are usurping the functions of banking. Every form of credit must be brought under the control of the Banking Act and under the control of the national government. The power is there. Let the Government use it if it will because the activities of these organisations today are responsible for the record rate of interest being paid on long term loans that are being raised by this Government. The only way to curb this is to place these institutions under control. Perhaps one of the least satisfactory aspects of the banking system today is the participation by the major trading banks in subsidiary hire purchase companies. There is an old motto that if you cannot beat them, join them. Under the circumstances I suppose that there is some justification for this participation by the trading banks but the sooner we place the control of all credit back in the banking system the better for all concerned. I do not suggest that these fringe banking organisations should be given full banking charters but I do say that they ought to be brought in under a secondary charter and placed in a subordinate capacity. Equally today we find merchant banks coming in",57
117,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order ! I think the honourable member is getting a little wide of the Bills of Exchange Bill 1970. While the honourable member was speaking I found it very difficult to see the relevance of what he was saying about banking and fringe banking when the main purpose of this Bill is to do away with the necessity for endorsement on order cheques and bank drafts.,59
118,Mr CONNOR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,B y definiuon a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a banker.,59
119,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,I agree with that but this does not agree with the definition of policy.,59
120,Mr CONNOR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker, and I pass on to another point. In terms of banking techniques we are faced with a new age-the electronic age. The Government has yet to come to grips with all the implications proposed in electronic banking which will involve simultaneous transmission of transactions from a retail store to the bank where there will be an immediate cancellation on the account. It will also involve magnetic credit cards. The Government has not considered the implications of this new age. In addition the Government bas failed to consider the activities of the trans-national companies which are the major corporations intruding in Australia today and which are completely bypassing the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act. The technique used by these corporations is a simple one. When a major overseas banking company cannot get its charter in Australia it either forms a subsidiary or forms a suitable link with a known and reputable local company. It then proceeds to do everything in the way of banking with the exception of issuing cheques and dealing with bills of exchange. I do not propose to take up the time of the House any further. I commend my remarks to the serious consideration of the Government.",59
121,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) expounded to the House, with some personal variations his favourite area of orthodox Socialist theories which we have heard on a number of occasions. The honourable member suggested that Australia ought to try to set up a bills of exchange market comparable with that in London to control the credit issues of this country. He displayed little understanding of the conduct of monetary procedures in the London market, of the huge resources there which have been built up by vast dealings, being as it is at the crossroads of international trade in Europe, and having a very long and traditional evolution; a system that has operated for over 1,000 years in an area which is the hub and base of the sterling bloc. The honourable member's comments are just glib commentary on the monetary and fiscal control in Australia. Surely he is aware of the difficulty of obtaining in Canberra, even if it were the desire of the Government, necessary constitutional powers which would never be given by the people of Australia. This has been demonstrated time and time again. Even if it were to happen, honourable members on this side of the House know that it would stackle development finance in this country, and lock out and drive away prospects. It is a proposal for part of the dead hand of Socialism. The main purpose of this Bill is to deal with part of an estimated 800 million cheques used in Australia per annum. It is estimated that 200 million of those cheques are order cheques and 2 million are dishonoured annually because of lack of endorsement or irregular endorsement. It is further estimated that 1,500,000 are cheques which are endorsed cheques deposited to the credit of the payee. This Bill provides that endorsement of those cheques need not in the future be made. Reference has been made to the report of the committee appointed by the Government to review the Bills of Exchange Act. The report dated 1st May 1964 at page 17, in relation to the subject of this Bill states: 99. There is no doubt that a gTeat deal of unproductive work is involved for the recipients of cheques and for banks as a result of the need for indorsemen of cheques without very much, if any, useful purpose being served. That report also states: . . . the Committee is of the opinion that an amendment to the Act reducing the need for indorsements would affect a worthwhile saving of time, effort and cost. For those reasons I support with enthusiasm the provisions of this Bill and I am sorry that it was not introduced earlier. There is a rather striking quotation in that report at page 5 which repeats some of the provisions of an English report on the subject and 1 think this graphically displays the position. The quotation is a passage from a letter which was sent in by a witness. It reads: As Secretary of this Company, I spend 15 to 30 minutes daily endorsing cheques. This irksome duty was formerly done by the Managing Director who delegated it to an ordinary Director who in turn delegated it to me. I often delegate it my assistant and I am contemplating delegating it to the office boy which proves the unimportance of this work. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Cunningham and by the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes), a great deal of time is spent within banks in returning cheques which are either not endorsed or are insufficiently or inaccurately endorsed. 1 believe that it should be an interest of this Parliament to consider in the provisions of Bills the achievement of simplicity and standardisation, ln this context and in the context of this Bill it is not too much to say that this country needs now, and will need increasingly in the future, to find ways and means to cut unnecessary accounting and book-keeping procedures where there is an unjustifiable cost-o r where the cost is greater than the benefit-becaus e that is a charge on the Australian economy and we ought to seek ways in the public and the private sectors of minimising such costs. 1I have had some number of years' experience as a practising chartered accountant and I believe that there is too much detailed book-keeping in this country, some of it required by the provisions of Acts of Parliament, much, of it traditional. Too many people are engaged in tertiary employment. We should seek ways and means of providing simplified procedures-encouragin g a reduction-whic h we should seek progressively. That is a wide subject on which 1 will, develop on a more appropriate occasion. I believe it is a matter of some regret that the Manning Committee's proposed Cheques Act has not yet been enacted. The report was dated 1st May 1964. It was tabled in this House on 12th October 1965. This first step which we have before us tonight takes place in 1971. The Cheques Act with the other provisions are still awaited. The draft Bill which is the main appendix to the Manning Committee's report contains many recommendations. I cannot make specific reference to all of them but I would like to refer to paragraph 72 which refers to the crossing of cheques and states: The making of cheques payable to 'order' when crossed with the words ' 'account payee only' seems to the Committee lo constitute an ambiguous and contradictory instruction to both the collecting and the paying bank, in lhat, on the one hand, banks are told that the cheque is to be to lodged only to the credit of the payee's account and, on the other hand, that the cheque may be paid lo the order of the payee, that is, to another person. Many large companies operating in this country issue cheques in exactly that way : The report contains many recommendations apart from those which are the subject of this Bill. Entirely different subjects are covered in paragraphs 44, 60, 67, 87, 89-91, 164-5, 170, 193, 194-5, 201-2, 203-4, 229 and 231. One may well ask what is the reason for the delay. I can find only one reference to it. In the main it is in answer to a question which I asked over a year ago. I was advised that there was a number of developments in banking techniques, in particular dealing with advancement in the use of computers. But that has been going on for many years and it will continue to go on for many years. I do not know where the delay exists, whether it is in the consultation with the trading banks or whether it is within the departments concerned. I do not criticise the present Minister. Indeed, I expressly exclude him from these remarks and compliment him on introducing this measure which rightly makes the major reform and a significant saving in time wasting procedures in commercial activity. 1 urge the Attorney-General to press forward, in the haste called for after a delay of 6 or 7 years' consideration, with the early introduction of an Australian Cheques Act which can, of course, be amended from time to time to take account of changing banking techniques which develop.",59
122,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"in reply-I shall reply very briefly to the contributions that have been made by the honourable members who have spoken in this debate. I accept the plea of urgency that has been made by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) and by my colleague on this side of the House, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Gariand). There is no opposition to the terms of the Bill. The complaint that is made is that the Government has not pressed ahead fast enough with a comprehensive Cheques Bill in terms of the recommendations of the Manning Committee's report. This is an enormously complicated subject. Throughout 1970, and moved forthwith. indeed up to the present time since 1 made my second reading speech on 19th May last year, substantive discussions have been third time. taking place between officers of my Department and representatives of the banks concerning the contents of a comprehensive Cheques Bill. I can understand that there is some impatience at what would appear at first sight to be an inordinate delay in this field. When the facts are examined fully it will be seen that the den: delay is by no means unforgivable and is by no means as inordinate as it is made to appear. At the present time we are witnessing almost kaleidoscopic developments in the thereof: fields of automation and electronic data processing. It is with the developments of this kind, fast as they have been occurring, that the discussions between officers of my Department and the banks have been concerned. The position has now been reached where I would anticipate, according to the information given to me, that instructions on most of the matters that have been cussed through 1970 between the represenbeen tatives of the banks and officers of my Department can be given to the Parlianecessary mentary Counsel for the drafting of the desired legislation. The legislation is desired as much by me as by the honourable members who have spoken in this debate. The whole problem is by no means as simple as it might be thought at first sight to be. I can assure the honourable members who have made valuable contributions to this debate that I will continue to keep the matter under my close attention with a view to getting legislation of the kind we all want to see into the House as soon as possible. I hope that the honourable member for Cunningham will not think me guilty of any discourtesy if I do not follow him by answering some of the broader matters that he sought to raise, because during his speech I rather took the hint from you, Mr Speaker, that if 1 were to do so my contribution would not be altogether welcome to you. That is all I want to say in answer to what has been put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third reading Leave granted for third reading to be Bill (on motion by Mr Hughes) read a IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 May 1970 (vide page 2361), on motion by Mr SnedThat the Bill be now read a second time.",61
123,Mr DALY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," I move the following amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view lo inserting the following words in place whilst not refusing to give the Bill a second reading this House condemns the Government for the delay in providing a comprehensive programme of migration education, adequate finance facilities and capital equipment, including buildings. The provisions of this legislation were outlined fully in a preliminary statement by the Minister for Immigration (Mr Lynch) disto the House on 23rd April 1970 and have further detailed in his second reading speech. In these circumstances, it is hardly for me to reiterate them in detail. Broadly speaking, however, they provide for an expansion of the migrant education programme for adults and children before and after arrival in Australia, in co-operation with the State education authorities. The Commonwealth is to provide the cost of teachers, certain capital equipment, text books, supervisory assistance, and allowances for migrants studying certain courses, and will give incentives to industry to assist in the educational gramme. The Opposition is not opposed to the general principles of the scheme as we are well aware of the fact that the basis of successful integration or assimilation is communication. Without a knowledge of the language migrants are not only at a distinct disadvantage in respect of employment but also their general participation in community activities and our way of life is denied to them if they are unable to speak and understand our language. The importance of education in the English language to the migrant-adul t and child-ha s been stressed by responsible authorities and migrant organisations ever since the commencement of the scheme, and particularly in more recent years. Successive Immigration Conventions and the Immigration Advisory Council have confirmed that the great barrier to assimilation and integration is the failure of the migrant to speak English and expressed the view that there is a real need for the teaching of the English language at every level for assimilation, social and economic reasons. As the amendment indicates, the Opposition is far from satisfied with the educational programme to date. It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for migrants in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and immigration authorities. This measure, which is by no means the be-all and endall of the matter, is belated and a long time overdue. At this stage I pose a few questions in respect of the subject, and some constructive criticisms of the Department and its activities in this field. Firstly, having in mind the Government's sustained drive for migrants, has this aspect of migration been neglected, or at least, has the Department not been insistent enough in the priority that should be given to migrant education? Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war immigration schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme. Since that time, great changes have taken place in the immigration proprogramme, such as increased numbers, differing types of migrants and methods of transport. The fact that more than 50 per cent of the 700,000 migrants requiring instruction in English discontinued the classes would seem to present proof that a new and stimulating approach was needed in this field. These figures should have been an indication to the Department that the programme was falling short of what was required, particularly as lack of communication by language is accepted as the great barrier to citizenship and assimilation. It was evidently not until about 1967 or 1968 that the real seriousness of the situation dawned on the Government and with it the need to provide a scheme whereby the children in schools and those adults whom I might term the waverers, or those who were not highly educated and were unable to learn English, needed a new and comprehensive scheme if they were to do so. This point of view is substantiated by the figures I mentioned earlier and by the fact that only about 22,000 or 23,000 at this date are enrolled in continuation classes, radio and correspondence courses throughout Australia. Surely, with this problem being stressed by immigration authorities everywhere, including citizenship conventions, advisory councils and other interested parties, a scheme might well have been expected at a much earlier date. Even now, under this scheme there are some glaring weaknesses which I shall show later. For instance, on the question of adult, education under these proposals, the casual migrant, as I shall call him, must be prepared to spend 5 hours a day for 6 weeks in the partly accelerated course at his own expense or 2 hours a week for a period of 18 months a,t a night school course if he desires to learn the language. This is a fairly tough proposal. It must be extremely doubtful, therefore, whether this large section of the migrant force, or a large percentage of it, will benefit by the scheme. When all is said and done, no matter what a person's educational capacity may be, it is essential that he learn the language of his adopted country. Many thousands of migrants have neglected to do this for many and varied reasons. Jt has yet to be proved whether the incentive and the expansion of the educational programme as outlined will encourage them to do so. Since 1945 more than 2 million migrants have come to Australia. Jt would be an interesting exercise to ascertain how many or what percentage have learned to speak English since their arrival. Secondly, at a time when every educational body in Australia-State , independent and university-is clamouring for additional teachers, schools and finance, where does Ihe Government consider that the necessary number of teachers will be recruited? It is estimated that the number of teachers required will be 300, and this at a time when there is an acute shortage of skilled teachers in Australia. Classes are too big, classrooms are overcrowded and generally speaking the shortage of everything is acute. In fact, New South Wales. Victoria and Queensland are recruiting teachers from abroad. I am informed that 100 teachers will be required this year, 60 next year and 330 for the year 1971-72. This is a very tall order at a time of acute teacher shortage, so the Minister might indicate what arrangements have been made to recruit them, what are the prospects of securing them, what are the qualifications necessary and what are the reactions of the educational authorities. Thirdly, what indication has been given that the migrants, whom I would describe as being on the fringe', that is, those who : have no special educational qualifications or inclination but who must know English for employment and other purposes, will be more interested than they have been previously in learning English. Probably the scheme is intended to appeal to them but in what way, as compared with the previous scheme, will it do so. On the surface, it will remain much the same as it is today. Information has already been given to the House that only 47 per cent of the 708,000 migrants wbo have come to Australia and attended pre-embarkation shipboard, continuation or correspondence courses, have completed the course. Even in November 1969 only 14,840 migrants were enrolled in 1,050 continuation classes, and 7,780 migrants were taking combined radio and correspondence courses. In view of the number of migrants involved, these figures are by no means heartening. Will the position be improved under this scheme? How will this scheme appeal to this section of the migrant population who have neglected to learn English? What incentive is to be given to them? Most of them, no doubt, cannot afford to take time off from work and at night are either too tired or lack the inclination lo spend time to which they are no doubt unaccustomed for periods of 2 hours a week for 18 months. This is not an easy problem, but it certainly merits special attention. Has the Minister any idea as to what will be the response of industry to participation in the scheme? Will it co-operate? Will the lessons be given in the employers' time or after work? This is important because I believe it will have a distinct bearing on the success or failure of the scheme. These are just a few of the questions one may ask. They are asked not in order to knock the proposals but more in an endeavour to ascertain the depth of the Government's investigations of this subject. I believe that it would be reasonable to ask industry to participate in a practical way in bringing a knowledge of the English language to this section of the migrant force. After all, industry has benefited a lot from the immigration programme. In fact, to my mind industry has had it on the cheap. It has been provided with employees-sometime s highly skilled - at little or no cost to it. This in turn has resulted in increased production and increased spending and purchasing power. I believe that industries employing large numbers of migrants should, at their own cost, provide classes in English. They should also encourage migrants to learn the language for safety and economic reasons, and it should be done at the employers' expense during working hours. Industries might also provide some monetary incentive or additional leave, promotion or something of this nature as a further stimulus to overcome the language barrier. I understand that some industrial organisations already are co-operating and providing classes in English along the lines I have suggested, and the scheme might well be expanded. However, the scheme should cover the whole range of industry, and I suggest to the Minister that implementation of an extensive campaign throughout industry along the lines I have mentioned might bring success in the recruitment of migrants to English classes. Today, for a number of reasons, migrants discontinue their classes and their education in the English language. Comparatively recently two excellent surveys were conducted, one by the Department of Immigration in Canberra and the other by the New South Wales Department of Education, on the question of migrant education and the education of migrant children. These excellent reports, which are available to all and from which quotations have been made in the Parliament, referred to some of the problems confronting people who do not know the English language. I shall quote a few extracts from the reports broadly and quickly in the time available to me in order to give honourable members an idea of some of the problems which face this scheme and which must be overcome if the scheme is to be of great benefit. For instance, the report of the survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Education in 1968-69 stated: Migrant children performance in many subjects is affected by their language difficulties. The predominant groups of migrants with English difficulties are the Italians, Greeks, lavs-totallin g 61 per cent of the sample. Of those with English difficulties 42 per cent come from homes where it is never spoken and 43 per cent sometimes. Comparison shows that a significant proportion of migrants with poor school progress came from homes where English is never spoken. The report of the survey conducted by the Department of Immigration in Canberra stated: Based on evidence from departmental surveys it would be reasonable to estimate that approximately one-third of foreign born migrants would be unable to speak English. Applied to the foreign born migrant population this would mean that some 240,000 migrants would benefit from English language instruction. That shows the nature of the problem and also indicates that this legislation has to cover a wide field. The report of the survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Education in 1968-69 on the question of education of migrant children also stated: Incidence of migrant children in total school population is about 1 in 20 and of the 50,664 reported migrant pupils some 16,452-3 2 per cent-hav e some type of English language difficulty. One could quote at great length from the report of the survey, which was an excellent one, because there are pages which deal with the problems facing these children and the problems which the Department of Education in New South Wales faces in providing education for these children. As I mentioned earlier, migrant children present a very difficult problem, and one of the most significant statements which have been made on this subject appears in an article by Carolyn Dowling. In an article entitled 'Seen But Not Heard', which was published in March 1968, she said: The passive, uncomprehending figure whose idleness and blank stare mar the most industrious of classes, is a more common sight, particularly in the lower forms of suburban high schools, than we care to admit. That, as the Minister quite rightly pointed out, is one of the majorproblems confronting us. The survey indicates the severe strain that has been placed on the educational system and on teachers in New South Wales and no doubt throughout Australia. It is difficult for a teacher to transmit knowledge to a child who has very little, if any, understanding of the YugosEnglish language. It is just as unfair to the children who, in many cases, while mentally more advanced that those who know and understand English are forced to languish in lower classes because of this disability. Of course, as I have mentioned, because of the conditions the teachers find the task well nigh impossible and can only do the best they can. The number of migrant children in schools runs into many thousands, as has been pointed out in these articles and as is indicated by the number of teachers to be recruited. It has certainly taken the Government a long time to realise how unfair it is to teachers, children and State authorities to bring non-English speaking migrants into the country in thousands and leave the full responsibility for their education at every level to State governments and independent schools. The need has been there for a long time and, very belatedly, the Government has evidently realised its responsibility but still baulks at the capital expenditure and at making more extensive grants to the authorities for educational purposes. Increased education costs to the States because of the influx of migrant children given rise in many quarters to the question whether our migration programme should face. be curtailed. That is one of the major reasons advanced by those who advocate that course. These remarks, critical though they may be, are offered constructively in the hope that the Opposition's views will result in improving the approach of the Government, both financially and pracThis tically, in the important field of migrant education. So important is language that submit to the Government that migrant ally, education should be encouraged by a wider range of activities in language and citizennon-existence ship instruction, as appears to have been done in Canada. For instance, in Canada classes for language instruction and courses in civic affairs have mushroomed and are conducted under various auspices, such provincial departments of education, local school boards, service clubs, churches, fare agencies, universities and ethnic groups. It is true that there are many variations in the degree, quality and intensity of the courses offered. Some offer education trained teaching personnel. Others are of sporadic nature and are guided by volunteach teers. However, iri spite of all the diversity, there is a common thread running through the courses offered and growing evidence of uniformity amongst all the programmes because of the liaison and help provided short of capital. by officers of the Canadian Citizenship Branch. Without saying that Canada has the perfect system, surely it is an indicaGovernment tion of how much could be done in Auscapital tralia along these lines. A national camtbis paign seeking the co-operation of voluntary organisations, industries, clubs, progress associations, churches and other sections the community would be a forward step the education of migrants. If necessary, some form of financial or material assistralia, tance could he given. Another factor that appears to be overThis looked is that, I understand, approximately 60 per cent of the migrant;, coming to Australia travel by air and the percentage might increase. This means that unless migrants have pre-embarkation instruction, they land in Australia without any knowledge at all of the English language. This is quite different from the days when practically all migrants travelled by ship and an education officer gave them instruction has in the English language. Naturally this has accentuated the problem that we now Clause 3 of the Bill states: 'capital equipment of an educational nature' includes tape recording and playing equipment, but does not include any building. is undoubtedly one of the major weaknesses of the scheme, lt is in line with I Government thinking on education generin that it fails to take into consideration the overcrowding and in many cases the of classrooms. Every education authority in the nation is clamouring for money for capital expenditure on buildings. There is nowhere to teach children in many schools, State and indepenas dent. Where are the educational classes proposed in this Bill to be assembled? welWhat consideration has been given to the environment in schools for this type of teaching? It is a specialised teaching requiring special facilities but, most importantly, it requires a suitable type of room. Is it to be expected that the teachers will by lump all their equipment into the playa ground and teach under a tree, or will they on a verandah, in a weather shed or some other makeshift accommodation, because unless capital is available this is precisely what will happen? This appears to be the only way out for those who are There can be no excuse whatever for the failing to provide funds for expenditure on buildings as part of scheme. As it stands, it means that the Government reluctantly has accepted the fact that it has a responsibility to the chilof dren, the States and the teachers to proin vide some finance for the thousands of migrants who have been brought to Ausbut it is confining it to the very minimum and leaving the responsibility for finding additional capital to the States. is not good enough, and this is why the Opposition has moved the amendment which indicates that the Government classes should provide funds for capital expendipetent ture. The Minister estimates that the cost the scheme over the next 4 years will total $16m, or $4m a year. The full cost of migration scheme is extremely high. Only small percentage will be spent on the cation of migrants, yet this is generally accepted as the most important factor their assimilation. Is it too much to that a substantial amount be made availparticularly able for capital expenditure on buildings alleviate this problem? Members of the Opposition believe that this should be most important part of this legislation, quite apart from the provision of teachers, and unless the amendment is adopted we believe the scheme will fail. In his Ministerial statement of 23rd April 1970 the Minister said: The Government recognises that the ability migrants to communicate is fundamental to successful integration. There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and viding the means for migrants to learn English. Very few would disagree with this senof timent. The question i's how do we achieve it and does the legislation now under cussion solve or at least make a major contribution towards this objective. As have already indicated, I believe it is rect to say that while the legislation prohorticulturalist poses an expansion of the present limited programme in the field of migrant educapeople tion there are many gaps still to be plugged, as suggested by the amendment that I have moved. I have referred somewhat briefly to major considerations in the migrant educations. tion problem. First, there are children be considered and, secondly, adults. A few moments ago I quoted from a statement by Carolyn Dowling about migrant chiladults dren. I believe it is a sound move to give specialised teaching in English in the classroom. This appears to be the ideal place within the school curriculum-i school hours, in school surroundings with the proper textbooks, equipment and enviris onment. It gives the child the opportunity in the right atmosphere to learn the means of communication and fulfil his educaworkshops tional desires according to his capacity times goes on. I think it is fair to ask Minister how long it is expected that will function until the child is comin English. Also, what will be the ages of the children who will attend these classes It is more essential than ever that of some form of teaching be introduced to the school when it is considered that the the New South Wales survey on this problem a revealed that about 47 per cent of the chiledudren come from homes where no English is spoken It is probably true to say that in this form of planning, when expanded, ask must prove of benefit to the child, and to the harassed teacher who is to endeavouring to transmit knowledge to a percentage of the class who simply do not the know what is being said. The scheme will fail if the Government stints onfinancefor capital equipment and other essentials. Then there is the problem of the adults. Members of an Opposition parliamentary committee on immigration recently visited a centre where the intensive of scheme was in progress. It was interesttheir ing to observe the people who were progressing favourably and quickly and to prorealise how lack of English had retarded their progress temporarily. One person we met was a dentist by profession but because his lack of English he was working as a cleaner. A telecommunications technician diswas working as a kitchen hand. Another person undertaking this expanded course I was a research technologist who was workcoring as a laundry worker. Another was a but was presently occupied as a factory worker. I mention these to indicate the effectiveness of the scheme. It is of value to these people whose experience could benefit this country. Until this intensive scheme was implemented they were denied the oppor2 tunity of pursuing their former occupaThis illustrates the need for the proto vision of proper educational facilities. Another problem concerns those migrant who vary in age from elderly grandparents or parents to those who left school immediately prior to their coming to Australia and who have probably had little or n no schooling in their own country. They have no knowledge of English, no English spoken in their homes and they drift into clubs or into an environment singularly of their own countrymen in the and factories. They fraternise as only with those speaking their own lanthe guage, mainly for convenience and comthe munication purposes. The number involved amounts to hundreds of thousands. The best figure to take is that percentage of the 708,000 mentioned by the Minister who have already received instruction. Does this legislation do anything to solve or relieve their problem? Is it a practical solution in the long term or is it an effort or contribution made hopefully to encourage them to participate in learning the language? Included in the adults are married women, many of whom do not go to work because of family circumstances. Their contact with English-speaking people is non-existent. How do they get on? Does this scheme propose a solution or an incentive for them? J am inclined to think that it will not touch many of this group. It is appropriate to refer to the excellent report concerning the survey undertaken by the New South Wales Department of Education, ft states: Reasons for delayed enrolment in courses were job commitments, lack of knowledge of courses, or just arrived in Australia. Students' reasons for discontinuance were mainly too busy, shift work, overtime and mobittty. Men gave as their reasons for non-attendance having to work too hard, laziness, overtime and fatigue. Women said that they were too busy at home or had family responsibility. About 97 per cent of the migrant students said they would like more opportunity to talk in English with Australian people. Many of these migrants may never attend an advanced course, perhaps because of lack of educational facilities. What effect does the Minister think that the present proposals will have on this type of migrant without incentives, including permission to attend courses during working hours? The migrants that I have mentioned must have an earnest desire to learn the language. They must have an incentive to improve their economic position. They must have a desire to integrate socially. They must find the time or be able to aflfoFd to learn the language either during the day or at night. I wonder whether any investigations have been made concerning what percentage of migrants in this category, or men and women over school age, really want to learn the language, and what is their intellectual capacity. The Minister has yet to state what effect the scheme will have on those I have mentioned and how many he expects will take advantage of it. Apart from those who really want to progress and learn the language because they are ambitious and anxious to succeed, I believe 2 factors stop people from educating themselves. Those with limited educational ability lack an incentive and they are incapable of finding time to attend classes. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that this problem could be overcome in respect of the men by their employers accepting more responsibility and enabling the men to attend classes in working time. Not only would this benefit the employer but it would make a satisfied citizen of the migrant concerned. To my mind the incentive scheme, in the case of adult men particularly, would appear to be ihe logical and practical way of achieving the best results. 1 feel that another method that might be applied-and no doubt it already has been to a great extent, but it could be more widely used-is an intensive publicity campaign among non-English speaking migrants on the need lo learn the English' language. Every form of available advertising should be used to impress upon these migrants prior to acceptance, embarkation on shipboard or on plane and on arrival how vital it is to learn English in order to enjoy a happy and successful life in Australia. Every industry, every bank, every public office or in fact any medium of publicity should be utilised with display signs impressing the need of migrants to communicate and learn English and advising them how they can go about it. Every migrant should be issued with a special brochure in the language he speaks setting out very clearly, but not too extensively the practical results to be achieved by being educated in the English language. (Extension of time granted). 1 thank the House and I will not take much longer. Whilst not criticising the objectives and the principles prompting the legislation on the education of migrants, I believe that there are still gaps through which countless thousands of migrants will escape the opportunity to learn English and participate in our community, economic and social life. Time does not permit me to go over the full range of them. This is set out in the documents which I mentioned earlier. The facts and figures are given. They show that many are suffering and failing to be assimilated into our community because of lack of knowledge of English. Thesefiguresare there for all to see and they indicate the major problem. This is a problem which must be faced: we believe it will not be adequately covered by this legislation. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition in the spirit in which it is presented. It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of immigration. We should accept our financial responsibility for education, housing and other matters. I offer this amendment as a constructive approach to improve the child and adult education of migrants brought to Australia in a scheme commenced 25 years ago which has always had the sympathy and support of honourable members on all sides of this Parliament. I hope the Minister will see fit to accept the amendment because I believe it will make a major contribution towards overcoming the difficulties in the education of migrants that I have mentioned during the course of my speech tonight.",61
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL, Is the amendment seconded? Mr Crean- I second the amendment.,68
125,Dr SOLOMON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," A year ago I attended in Canberra an Australian Citizenship Convention which was one of a number of such meetings which have been held since the war. Two or 3 weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science which dealt with the subject of immigration. The first of those conferences dealt substantially with the problems of migrants as seen by various workers in the field of immigrant education and interest in the community. The most lasting impression that I got from that conference was of the difficulties faced by migrants in coping with the English language, most notably by those with least access to it, and particularly by migrant housewives. The main burden of the second conference which was held 2 or 3 weeks ago was in fact a discussion on the pros and cons-perhap s there were more cons than pros-of the migration programme long since conducted with joint party approval in this country. I find it a little interesting that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) in the new atmosphere produced by the second conference and just before and after it by newspaper and other comment relating thereto, has now discovered that the Government, if I read him aright, has done too little too late in the field of migrant education. I do not complain that he has found it. After all, he is in a position where he should be finding such information. In the main I compliment him on one of the more constructive speeches which I have heard him make in this House in intent if not entirely in execution. Indeed, I will agree with two or three of the suggestions he made. Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of immigration which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated- 1 think the word is now integrated-int o the community. As people who have listened to the honourable member for Grayndler will know, this is a vast enterprise. It is a very considerable operation to find out how, why and where we can best conduct the education of people not specifically brought up in the same means of communication as ourselves. Perhaps we should be glad that it is their problem at that stage rather than ours. It is very difficult sometimes to make oneself understood in someone else's parlance. The proposition before the House is quite a comprehensive one. As the Minister for Immigration (Mr Lynch) mentioned in his second reading speech there are 2 or 3 major aspects of this educational programme. There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for migrants better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others. Some facts of the matter have already been adduced by the honourable member for Grayndler and the Minister at an earlier stage. I do not want to go over those unnecessarily. But the situation certainly is clear. About 26 per cent of 3.1 million gross arrivals-som e of course have returned home in the interim-between 1945 and 1969 have been under 15 years of age. So there would appear to be immediately a prima facie case for very considerable child education in the English language for migrant children. Many of these children, of course, have come from homes and continue to come from homes where English is rarely if ever spoken. To overcome this problem the Government has identified several specific activities which it intends to implement through the Department and education departments in the States to improve the situation. The Commonwealth intends to pay salaries for the teachers of special classes. It will duct training courses for teachers in the method of teaching English as a foreign language. It' will introduce language laboratories and other equipment. This is a programme costing of the order of $1.5m per annum out of the $4m per annum overall which is to be spent. The joint Commonwealth-New South Wales Education Department survey which was conducted a short while ago showed that of the 7,700 migrant children surveyed English was spoken at home ali or most of the time in only 15 per cent of the households, ln fact, English was never spoken in 42 per cent of the homes. This, of course, is a most impressive figure indicating the dearth of English in the home situation of a considerable proportion of migrant children. Further figures discerned from this survey show that in households where no English is spoken some 27 per cent of the children were making what was rated to be good progress or better at school. On the other hand, however, the 63 per cent who were making poor progress at school came from the 'no English' speaking homes. We do not need to adduce any further figures to show that a problem exists. I think that, this having been said, fairly obvious even to the uninitiated in these matters that the problem with children is unlikely to be as serious in a continuing sense, lt may be serious initially and thereby provide quite some impediment to a rapid or a normal increase in educational advancement, but it is likely to be a situation which will be overcome in the natural course of events merely by virtue of the fact that children are children, they are young, they are receptive and they are mixing with other children at least most of whom certainly speak English. Therefore these children, despite the disadvantage of the home situation at that stage, are likely in the normal course of their intermixing to get along fairly well. That is not to say that the programme should not be implemented at least as much as is envisaged. It seems to me that the greater problem is the one which concerns adult education. Certainly, the honourable member for Grayndler had quite a bit to say about that. Although approximately one-third con- of foreign born migrants cannot in any effective way speak English when they get here, the intake in recent years in adult evening education classes conducted, to take one or two examples, has been quite considerably less than the number of current arrivals. For example, in 1966-67 there were 19,000 enrollees in the adult classes for language whereas 45,000 migrant arrivals occurred in the same year with respect to that area of need. In 196869, 21,000 migrants enrolled whereas 61,000 migrants who needed to do so, in effect, arrived in this country. So, it is pretty clear that, as the honourable member for Grayndler rightly has said, we are not getting all these people in. The problem remains. 1 do not think that he quite adequately answered this problem although he tried to do so. The problem is: How do we get these people in. In particular, how do we get in the housewife more so even than the chappy who is at work and perhaps can be persuaded to get in by various employer incentives of the kind outlined. Certainly it would not appear to be exactly antithetical to the private enterprise ethic to have some employer indulgence in this matter and even an incentive whereby time was made available as well as facilities even for these it is people who certainly it can be argued make up a considerable part of our labour force. This is one of the major arguments for immigration being continuous. It would not be bad for those people who are benefiting most directly from the provision of this labour force to have some part in improving the status and the general worthiness- I do not use 'worthiness' in the moral sense-of the people whom they are employing. In this way they can assist those people to partake community life as a whole. The review and extension of adult education which is envisaged takes place in several areas-at source, in Europe or where, and on shipboard, if it is shipboard, and in Australia. I have taken the trouble to talk to a small number of people who have been involved in the adult education programme. I have found that one or two problems exist. Ft is hard to go along with the honourable member for Grayndler who wants to provide holus bolus, as it were, classrooms, because surely this will detract from the education need which he has identified already. We need to bear in mind that one of the biggest problems of capitalisation in the education field is classrooms, whether they be university, technical college, secondary school or primary school classrooms, are not on the whole very greatly utilised. They may be during the day, but there are large periods during each day in a year-larg e chunks of each day, perhaps T might say-whe n classrooms are not used. This is one of the arguments for extending the university teaching yeaT. Capital equipment in this way will be used more persistently. It seems to me that when we are talking about school classrooms being used for adult migrant education, whether or not we involve also the question of special equipment for laboratory type situations and so on, it should be possible to use existing facilities at different hours than generally those facilities get their normal use without however detracting from expenditure in other normal areas of education, or, alternatively, incurring a larger additional capital expenditure for this purpose. There are some problems which seem to be of a minor kind perhaps to which the Minister for Immigration might direct his attention if he has not done so already. For instance-and I hope that my figures are up lo date- a class maximum in the adult migrant education programme is regarded as 24. I compare this with the figure of 30 which is the generally accepted figure put forward by most teacher bodies as the optimum for normal class teaching. I wonder whether the figure for adult education in this respect might not stand a reduction given special consideration of the very considerable difficulties under which some of the people in these classes are working. There is the question of materials needed, on which I think the honourable else- member for Grayndler touched. I would like to raise in this respect the question of the availability and accessibility of materials and not so much the question of whether or not they exist. There needs to be a very considerable degree of co-operation between the school in which the classes are being held and those who teach the classes. Tf the people teaching belong to the school at which the teaching is taking place, there is no problem as I see it. But if in fact this work is being carried out in some centre where the teachers do that not teach normally, it is necessary sometimes for the materials involved in teaching to be housed in some teacher's room, office or common room. For various personal reasons, understandable perhaps in the main, it is not always easy to get at such materials at the time when they are needed. This is something which perhaps the departmental officers involved in supervising these things might need to consider more carefully. Another question concerns the teaching kit required. Jt is quite bulky. A car is needed to move it around. Strange as it may be in this day and age it is not always possible for the teacher concerned to have access to this means of transport. This is a practical problem which again appears minor but which may loom a little larger in the eyes of some of the teachers conducting these classes. The question of incentives to enrol and the problem of dropouts from these adult migration classes in language are real ones. It is very difficult to provide an answer. I do not think that the honourable member for Grayndler grappled with these problems to ultimate effectiveness, and I find myself unable to give the ultimate answers. How in fact do we get people who prefer to do some more work, to stay at home, to earn overtime or to do whatever it is that they do, to attend such classes? How do we impress upon them sufficiently the importance to them of learning English in a working manner as quickly as possible? How do we demonstrate the fact that doing so they will enhance their own status follows: and increase their own usefulness to themRespected Sir: selves, to their families and to the community at large. It is a difficult question and I think that it may be answerable only by those people who are engaged in the field ot of migrant education. This is not buck passing. It is deferring to those who would appear to be most likely to know. The question of intensive language courses does not need to be outlined at any length at all. These are for a relatively special group, a group already having the benefit of greater capacity, it would met appear, to learn. The amount on this training appears to be relatively large. It will rise from approximately §100,000 to in excess of Sim in this finanbursted cial year alone. This would appear to be out. money well spent because we are talking of people who are very likely on a per started capita basis to infuse into the community very considerable contribution not only by landed their efforts and through their other areas but also, one would imagine, probably by virtue of the fact of having these skills and being capable of acquiring expression in English-and other languages for that matter-mor e rapidly are they likely to be leaders of their own communidiscerned ties, insofar as there are communities new migrants. They are therefore likely to very much repay the money spent on this avenue of migrant education. I think that through all this it should borne in mind that, desirable though it is, it is not necessary- I do not imply that is-that in attempting to teach English migrants, adult or otherwise, wherever might aim, that we have to achieve perfecwould tion in a short period of time. After we do not achieve it here. We do not be achieve it amongst most of our students, and perhaps it would be overmuch to expect to achieve it amongst migrants. fact, what we need is a basic form expression, a simplicity and a general understanding that is sufficient to get person concerned through situations of everyday life. Of course, the so-called tralian situational method has recognised that. May I indicate what I mean and show the sort of achievement which I think we might try to get. I will quote from a letter written by a West Indian day at another time. labourer in Britain concerning a problem by which he had. He expressed himself as When I got to the building, I found that the hurricane had knocked some bricks oft the top. So I rigged up a beam with a pulley at the top the building and hoisted up a couple of barrels full of bricks. When I had fixed ihe building, there was a lot of bricks left over. 1 hoisted the barrel back up again and secured the line at the bottom, and then went up and filled the barrel with extra bricks. Then I went to the bottom and cast off the line. Unfortunately, the barrel of bricks was heavier than 1 was and before 1 knew what was happening the barrel started down, jerking me off the ground. I decided to hang on and halfway up I the barrel coming down and received a severe being spent blow on the shoulder. I then continued to the top, banging my head against the beam and getting my finger jammed in the pulley. When the barrel hit the ground it its bottom, allowing all the bricks to spill I was heavier than the empty barrel and so down again at high speed. Halfway down, I met the barrel coming up and received severe a injuries to my shins. When I hit the ground I on the bricks, getting several painful cuts own skills in from the sharp edges. At this point I must have lost my presence of mind, because I let go of the line. The barrel then came down giving me another heavy blow on the head and putting me in the hospital. As the honourable member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has correctly in advance, the bricklayer wanted of some workmen's compensation. But the point of the story is that that letter written by somebody who had learnt English somewhere other than his native country inbe cluded the elements of clarity, simplicity, perhaps a certain archaic flavour, and the it dramatic effect dependent upon understateto ment. If we could get most of our migrants we to that situation I am sure the Minister be well pleased. 1 think even the all, honourable member for Grayndler would well pleased. I feel, without I hope undue sanguineness of mind at this stage, that the programme involving this $16m or so to In be spent in 4 years in several avenues of of migrant education in language is well devised, even if not as comprehensive as the some people would want, to improve the situation as we currently find it. The quesAustion of whether we intend to teach more people and to keep the programme rolling so that the problems are not perhaps compounded or increased as the years go by is one which I am sure we will be debating",68
126,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," The Australian immigration programme was initiated by a Labor government some 25 years ago, and it has been supported by this Government since that time. So 1 think that ail of us here are very disturbed to hear these revelations which indicate the disadvantages to which migrants are being subjected. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) indicated that the migrant education programme commenced in 1947 after about 1,000 migrants had come here. We have had a lot of opportunity to get it into gear, to oil the machinery and to make it work. J think it is disappointing for many of us suddenly to get these revelations indicating the stark nature of the situation. Immigration is important to Australia. We have endeavoured to secure an increase amounting to I per cent of our population each year for some years. We have rarely achieved this. I think this year we are seeking about 175,000 migrants. Seventy per cent of the increase in our work force over the last 20 years has come from immigration. We are told by the Immigration Department that something like $650 is spent administratively on each migrant, but the net gain is said to be something like $10,000 for each migrant. We are told that migrants have added $70,000m to our gross national product over 20 years. If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of migrants from the point of view that immigration is not a one-sided affair. It is probably time we were doing a bit more for them. We have relegated them to poor environments, crowded houses, inadequate recreation, insufficient public services, high interest rates, sub-standard health schemes, and we have often sent them off to do the toughest jobs in the most oppressive areas. There are many manifestations that migrants are socially disadvantaged in Australia. The success of Australia's immigration programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which migrants and their children encounter. Nevertheless, I believe it is to say that in the field of formal education the Commonwealth has been recreant to its responsibility to ensure that adequate facilities are available. Of course, we can say this of Australian children generally: that there are many thousands trying to get into universities, that there are probably thousands trying to get into kindergartens and that there are class loading problems and the like, but there are special problems with migrants. Without the fulfilment of these obligations by the Commonwealth Government, the States will always suffer from an inadequacy of funds necessary to meet both the general needs of education and the particular finesse and expertise and special resources required for the education of migrant children. Startling revelations about language problems of migrant children have now come to hand 25 years after the then Labor Government initiated our first immigration programme. For many of the 2 i million people who have comprised our total net population gain since 1946 and for a large number of their children the lost opportunities that have resulted can never be regained. So much has gone, never to be retrieved, and we all deplore that fact. How many returning migrants who have left Australia in disillusionment have suffered from an inability to communicate because of insufficient skill with the English language? Over the last 5 years 21,697 migrants who had come to Australia with assisted passages have packed up their bags and gone home within 2 years of arriving here. Most of us who work in this field and who make contact with migrants know that the language problem often contributes to their unhappiness. Some went because of inadequate housing, deficiencies in the health scheme and all kinds of things, but many must have gone because of the deficiencies of the education system and our failure to convey an understanding of the English language to them. For a long time the Government has shown indecent haste to get migrants, any sort of migrants, as long as they were of European extraction. We have not shown any enthusiasm to get the others, regardless of whether they can speak English. What thought has been given to requiring intending migrants to safe take a course in English prior to leaving their home country? There are lots of people who now say that we should now put a stop to or a brake on the immigration programme. 1 suppose another way of looking at it is to decide to be more selective and to bring to this country those migrants who have a knowledge of the English language because of their willingness to apply themselves to it before they arrive in Australia. It is clearly a possibility that we could make a knowledge of English a condition of their immigration arrangement. Two and a half million persons who were born overseas are now in Australia. We are told that they represent 20 per cent of the population. We have sent many back. In 1969-70 we repatriated 693 for undisclosed reasons and we deported 491. 1 think this demonstrates our inability to be selective. In addition to that, we have found that a lot of those who have come here and sought naturalisation are not suitable for many reasons. I want to mention some of the reasons because they have a very precise bearing on this subject. In the J9 years to 1969 we rejected 529 applicants for naturalisation on security grounds and 20,022 on other grounds. Bui then we rejected a lot of others because of their very inadequate knowledge of English or their inability to speak English. Mr Lynch-This is very interesting, but what has it to do with the Bill?",72
127,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,The figures I am quoting come from the Minister for Immigration (Mr Lynch) and I think they have a very clear relevance to the Bill since we are talking about educating migrants. Among the things in which we need to educate them-and this is clearly the subject of the Bill-is the English language. Mr Lynch- I think you are a long way from home.,73
128,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I disagree with the Minister but I must not be diverted since I am making only a passing reference to this matter anyway. It is amazing that in these years we have had such a high incidence of people whose applications for naturalisation have been rejected because of their inability to speak English. In 1961 1,683 people were rejected; in 1962, 1,920; in 1963, 1,760; in 1964, 1,670; in 1965, 914; in 1966, 505; in 1967, 237; and in 1968the last year for which the figures are available to me-170 .",73
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL, Order ! The honourable member's information is most interesting but I think it is somewhat wide of the Bill.,73
130,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"On e would have thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that rather than rejecting these applicants the interest of the Government and of the Department would have been attracted from the standpoint of teaching them English. I was interested in the remarks of Professor W. F. Connell, Professor of Education at the Sydney University. He pointed out that a recent survey by the Department of Immigration indicates that one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English. He said: Departmental classes cater for a small proportion of these . . . Present classes are not matching the numbers of recent arrivals. I point out to the Minister in case he has forgotten-and it is a long time since this Bill was first introduced-that this Bill has a very real relevance to teaching migrants to speak English and classes are to be set up under this legislation for that precise purpose. Professor Connell said, further: In 1966-67 the average enrolment in all courses was 19,390 and Australia's intake of nonEnglish European-born settlers was 44,690 . . . In 1968-69 enrolments were 20,668 and the country's intake 61,296. These are enrolments in courses where migrants learn to speak English. So about one-third of those coming in each year who suffer from an inability to speak English actually take advantage of the opportunities extended to them. The Professor also said: It appears that the language problem is steadily slipping backwards. What is wrong with the courses? The fact of the matter is-and surveys have shown this-that migrants do not last long at the courses for reasons best known to themselves. In New South Wales in the period from October 1968 to October 1969 a total of 19,915 students enrolled in evening classes and there were 17,959 abandonments. We are told that many attend once or twice, that half spend less than 2 months with the courses and three-quarters give up less than 5 months after commencing. It is estimated that less than 10 per cent of the yearly intake of migrants needing English instruction actually complete the courses. Then there are these special problems referred to by the honourable member far Grayndler concerning women and their unpreparedness to learn the English language. There is a need for special orientation. It has been suggested by speakers at immigration conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage women to participate; that women teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses. It is also suggested that there should be intensive courses and that these should star*, first of all. in the home countries before the migrant comes to Australia. As 1I have mentioned before, it should be a condition of migration that the courses should continue on the ship and then in the hostels for some months after arrival. While migrants are in a hostel, possibly sacrificing their employment, they should be given financial assistance probably by way of the payment of unemployment benefits so that they will be encouraged to continue in these language courses which, in the end, will bring such a considerable benefit to themselves and to Australia generally. I was also interested in the remarks of Olive Nichols, District Inspector of Schools in the New South Wales Department of Education. She said that in New South Wales 32 per cent of migrant childrenalmost 1 in 3-in the total school population have language problems. This, of course, is a crisis of great magnitude. She pinpointed the crisis as being mainly in Sydney, Wollongong, Canberra and Newcastle and, - to some extent, in other capital cities as well. Se pointed out that mildly intellectually handicapped children number some 30,000 but the next category of special needs in this country so far as education is concerned involves the 16,452 migrant children in New South Wales and a similar proportion of the school population in other States who have language problems. We are obviously doing insufficient about this problem. My colleague the honourable member for Grayndler has mentioned how the circumstanceyof a migrant child affect him in his English speaking ability at school. The amount of English spoken at home is clearly a factor. The proportion of these migrants who speak English at home all the time amounts to only 4 per cent. Those who speak English most of the time amount to 11 per cent, those who speak English at home sometimes amount to 43 per cent and those who never speak English at home amount to 42 per cent. It is interesting to see what happens to the 'nevers'. School progress is average for 33 per cent, below average for 48 per cent and poor for 63 per cent. 1 thjnk this underlines the importance of ensuring that migrant children and their parents are given the greatest possible encouragement to learn the English language. 1 think there are lots of ways in which this problem can be assailed. 1 agree with the honourable member for Grayndler that we. need a comprehensive programme of migrant education. I think we need adequate facilities and capital equipment, including buildings and I am not sure that the Government will go far enough in respect of these things. There is already some speculation around the lobbies that the subject matter of this Bill, the migrant education programme, might become one of the first casualties of the Government's anti-inflationary measures. We are told that some SI6m might be expended over the next 4 years if this programme is fully implemented. Quite frankly, I think the programme is so recently contrived and thought out that we will have great difficulty in obtaining the skilled personnel and the resources to fulfil the programme and doubtless this will be used as an excuse to curtail the proposed expenditure. But 1 would not be surprised if we have it curtailed for anti-inflation reasons. I would like to see the special facilities and the capital equipment which have been referred to by the honourable member for Grayndler provided. 1 think there are lots of other modern and contemporary ways of doing it. We ought to have radio stations whose programmes are specially devoted to this purpose having regard to the magnitude of the problem. In the United States there are 5.201 radio stations and many of them devote their programmes to education purposes and to migrant education purposes. Some cities have 50 radio stations. There is not a shortage of frequencies in Australia. The only inhibiting factor is the unwillingness of the Government to invoke some of these new techniques which would enable migrants to be educated through radio programmes. This is the only real obstacle to migrant education that we have in this country. I am interested in the remarks of Professor Parish of the University of New England who said: By the Australian Broadcasting Control yardstick for the Atherton Tablelands because there are 20,000 people in radio stations. . . the Sydney Metropolitan Area which is the area in which there is the highest incidence of migrants who need this kind of special instruction. . . should have 100 licences. What is there against making available special radio facilities to assist with the education of migrant children and adult migrants? I think it is time that we went even further and undertook what is being done in the United States, where special television facilities are made vailable, and in the United Kingdom, where 25,000 part-time students are to be educated at an open university in this specialised field. I say to the Minister that if the problems are of such a magnitude we should smarten up and get some modern ideas. If the migrants are to be located in our great cities such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, in view of the shortage of teachers and the inability of this Government to provide the buildings and capital equipment which are so essential in migrant education, there is no reason at all why further radio stations and television channels should not be made available for this programme. When considering the benefits which we derive from our migration programme I sincerely hope that we will look more positively towards giving the assistance which is so necessary in this proBoard gramme. I have been told that in the last 6i years Australia has recruited by way of migration 1,400 medical practitioners, 1,600 senior students, 4,000 engineers, and 3,500 architects and surveyors. Within a period of 6 i years 36,000 professional workers have come to this country to settle. That is an impressive figure of 9 per cent of all immigrant workers in Australia. Our rich intake of quality justifies strong support for the migrant education programme. Although I am impressed with the fact that after this long period which has elapsed since the introduction of the migrant education programme and the fact that it has languished for such a long time we are now starting to do something about it but I believe that what is proposed is insufficient. I believe it is necessary for this Parliament to consider seriously the amendment moved by the Opposition that the Government should make available buildings and capital equipment which are so essential for this programme. I particularly commend the proposition that we should invoke new techniques and use the mass media by way of radio and television facilities to give the migrants the educational opportunities which they so desperately deserve.

(2) Is il a fact thai in some cases the amount of pay lost by a national serviceman during his period , of service represents a considerable financial sacrifice. (3) Is il inequitable that some national servicemen should suffer such a loss while others have iheir loss made up by their employers. (4) If so. will the Commonwealth follow, the example of ihe New South Wales Government and of those private employers who make up the pay of national servicemen by paying to Commonwealth employees who are called up for national service an amount equivalent to the difference between their national service pay and the amount which they would have recehed but for iheir call up.

Government did not make any submissions to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission concerning the principles to be followed by the Commission in determining whether equal pay is appropriate? (21 If not, what were the submissions made to the Commission on behalf of the Commonwealth? Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) My reply to the honourable member's quesuon No. 1010 (Hansard, 3rd June 1970, page 2874) did not indicate and was not intended to imply lhat the Government did not make submissions during the Equal Pay Case of 1969 on principles that the Commission should follow in determining equal pay.

139,Mr STEWART,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTI CE,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: Are former employees of ihe Australian Atomic Energy Commission restricted, legally or otherwise, from contributing lo public discussion on nuclear power stations; if so, why.",80
140,Mr SWARTZ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTI CE,"Th c answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The answer to the question depends on the nature of the information contained in the contribution and the way in which the former employee obtained that information. If the contribution contained restricted information, as that phrase is defined in the Atomic Energy Act 1953-1966, which was obtained in the course of the former employee's employment or in any of ihe other circumstances sel out in section 48 of that Act, it would be an offence lo make public that information. Again, under section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914-1960, a former oflicer would be guilty of an offence if, without authority, he communicated to the public information that came to his knowledge by virtue of his office and that, at the time, Arbitration (Question No. 9216)",80
141,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTI CE,"the Minister for Labour and NationalService, upon notice: In what way or for what reason were 3 of the 4 agreements, which the Conciliation ancl Arbii ration Commission has refused, to certify under section 31 of the Act. not .in , the public interest. (Question No. 521, Hansard,. 2nd June 1970). Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1 The reasons for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission refusing lo certify agreements under section, 01 i of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in .that thcy were not in the public interest are set out in the decisions of the Commissioners refusing certification. The references are as follows: Date of Dispute No. Decision Reference C No. 395 7.4.64 106 C.A.R. p. 31 v. of 1963 at pp. 32-33 C No. 1511 9.4.68 Print No. B3334 v. of 1966 C Nos. 241, 31.10.69 Print No. B4908 v. 1372 and 1455 . at pp. 8-10 of 1969 he ceased to be an officer, k was his duty not lo disclose. Tn this connection, - it should be noted that section53 of the Atomic Energy Act makes it an offence for an employeeof the Commission to communicate information concerning activities of the Commission or the - contents of a document lo which he has had access by reason of being an employee. The reason for ihe restrictions is that many Commission employees have access to classified information of commercial or defence importance. The information could be acquired as a result of expensive research activities, in - Australia or from atomic energy activities overseas in countries with which we have agreements for sharing nuclear knowledge. Such agreement* - could not normally be achieved unless bolh parties had made provision for secrecy. We could not contemplate absolving a person from .secrecy merely because he left Commission employment. However, section 5 (2.) of the Atomic Energy Act makes it clear lhat, for present purposes, the term 'restricted information' does not include information published in scientific or technical literature or in public statements made or authorised by or on behalf of Ihe Commission or the Minister. Accordingly, persons are not prevented trom discussing published information - on nuclear matters merely because they have, at one time, been Commission employees. International Conferences in Australia: Support by Commonwealth Government (Question No. 1379) Mr Wliittain asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Will he bring up to date the answer he gave me on lOlh September 1969 (Hansard, page 1134) on international conferences held iji Australia which have received support from the Commonwealth. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: International Conferences held in Australia between 1st July 1969 and 30th June 1970 which have received support from the Commonwealth Government are listed in the table hereunder. The list has been compiled from informution provided by the relevant Ministers.

143,Mr WHITLAM,CSIRO,"the Attorney General, upon notice: What progress has been made with the reforms and programmes decided on by the Ministers concerned with penal administration. (Hansard, 21st May 1969, page 2094.) Mr Hughes-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: A meeting of prison administrators was held on 23rd June 1969 to discuss the decision relating to penal statistics made by the Ministers at their meeting on 27th March 1969. The prison administrators discussed the details of a scheme for the compilation ofpenal statistics on a uniform basis. Agreement was reached on a basic programme that had been prepared by the State of New South Wales for this purpose. Wilh regard to alternatives lo imprisonment, the procedure of releasing offenders on licence or parole in appropriate cases subject to supervision by a parole oflicer, is being used to an increasing extent in the case of Commonwealth offenders. In addition, draft legislation has been prepared for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory providing, as an intermediate step between probation and imprisonment, for the release of offenders on probationary supervision, subject to the payment of a penalty to the Commonwealth in a lump sum or by instalments. In relation to young offenders, the procedure being followed in respect of offenders against Commonwealth law is that a prosecution is not to be commenced against a person under the age of 1.6 years without my consent or the consent of the Secretary lo my Department or of the DeputySecretary. (Question No. 1534)",82
144,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CSIRO,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Does the recently amended Conciliation and Arbitration Act make it unlawful for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award wage rates that are (a) so high as to be uneconomic to an employer or (b) so low as to be uneconomic to an employee. (2) If not, does a presidential member of the Commission have the power (a) to enforce employer acceptance of such rates by the insertion of a clause to ban the reduction or retrenchment of staff, or the closure of a work place or section thereof or (b) lo enforce employee acceptance of such rates by the insertion of a strike-ban clause in the award. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (!) and (2) What may be included in an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in settlement of a dispute depends upon such matters as the ambit of the dispute, the definition of 'industrial matters' in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and, the meaning of 'industrial dispute' in the constitutional sense. The relevant powers of a presidential member are as set out in section 33A of Uie Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1970. Arbitration (Question No. 1535)",82

(f)-environmental invesfrom tigations of sites for. a nuclear power station, olher than Ihe site selected at Jervis Bay. (2) If so, will be make these reports availobservation. able.",83
149,Mr SWARTZ,CSIRO,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) As stated in the reply to Question No. 1191 and as amplified in the answer to Question No. 1561 the information referred to by the honourable member is included in reports which are al present confidential to the Australian Atomic Enwgy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. Atomic Energy (Question No. 1561),83
150,Mr STEWART,CSIRO,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Did he in his answer lo Question No. 1191 (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 252) infer that confidential studies of the environmental and ecological factors in the siting of the nuclear power station at Jervis Bay had been made. (2) Did he in his answer to Question No. 1194 (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 253) state a detailed examination of environmental and factors is being made so that any disturbance of the environment at Jervis Bay will not be significant. (3) If so, which answer is correct.",83
151,Mr SWARTZ,CSIRO,The answer to the honouror award able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The answers to Questions 1191 and 1194 are of both correct and are not inconsistent. Quesuon 1191 which the honourable member in substance has repealed in Question 1560 asked if reports could be made available on some six factors (2 of were the environmental and ecological factors) in respect of each site considered for ihe proposed nuclear power station. The honourable member was fold that the reports were confidential in the sense that they were internal to the joint considerations of ihe Australian Atomic Commission and Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The studies were merely to ascertain the various favourable and unfavourable of the sites initially considered. Several of studies necessarily were little more than of a reconnaissance nature; the studies were not uniform in depth and were not designed for publication. They nevertheless showed ihe pre-eminence of the Jervis Bay site. Question No. 1194 asked if heated waste water the proposed Jervis Bay station would be discharged imo the ocean and asked further if was any danger from such a release. The honourable member was informed that a final decision had not been reached on the point of discharge and that a detailed examination of the environmental and ecological factors which might be affected was being carried out. This is still being carried out in considerable depth and will noi be completed for some I would add that in relation to possible dangers the release there will be a continuing monitoring after the nuclear power station has been completed so lhat any effect of the discharge on the environment will be kept under constant Atomic Energy (Question 1562),83
152,Mr STEWART,CSIRO,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (11 Was the Western Australian Siale Government approached when the site of the first nuclear power station in Australia was being considered. (2) If so, was any interest shown in siting the station in that State. (3) Has his attention been drawn to a recent announcement by the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia that it is now interested in the construction of a nuclear power station. (4) Does this represent a change of mind by the Western Australian authorities; if so, is be able to give the reasons for this. Mr Swarh!-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (0 and (2) Early in 1969 the then Minister for National Development visited all States and sought information from the relevant Ministers on the plans, if any. that their States might have for introducing nuclear energy. The Western Australian Ministers went no further than foreshadowing a possible need at some future dale. The New South Wales Ministers however stated that they bad an immediate interest in 'going nuclear' subject to the provision of finance and technical assistance by Ihe Commonwealth. (3) and (4) I have no knowledge of any recent announcement by the Stale Electricity Commission of Western Australia that it is now interested in the construction of a nuclear power station. I am therefore not in a position to comment on any such announcement. Atomic Energy (Question No. 1563)",83
153,Mr STEWART,CSIRO,"the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd has expressed interest in installing a nuclear power station in Western Australia. (2) Has his attention been drawn to statements on this matter made by both the Company and the Premier of Western Australia. (3) If so, was he or the Australian Atomic Energy Commission aware of these statements when the answer to Question No - 1271 (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 254) was being prepared.",84
154,Mr SWARTZ,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am unaware of any inierest recently expressed by Hamersley Iron Ply Ltd in the installation of a nuclear power station in Western Australia although in recent years there has been considerable speculation in newspapers on the possibilities of establishing such a station. (2) No. (3) No. Radio Transceivers (Question Nn. 1569) Mr Mclvor asked the General, upon notice: (1) Will he consider legalising the operation of a Cilizens Band low powered two-way radio system similar to lhat in use in New Zealand. (2) Will he also take steps lo stop illegal powered transceivers entering Ihis country and their sale by retailers to the general public. (3) Will he take suitable action to ensure that the general public are better informed regarding the purchase and use of sets on the Citizens Band. (4) Will he take action to prohibit, under heavy penalty, the sale by retailers of Citizens Band transceivers to any person who does not have a written approval from his Department for its purchase. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Careful consideration has been given to the question of licensing ihe operation in Australia of what are known in the United States of America and in certain other countries, including New Zealand, as 'Citizens Radio Services'. These services provide for the use of relatively lowpowered radio equipment on a limited number of frequencies set aside for the purpose for the exchange of communications relating to the business or personal activities of the licensees. The conclusion has been reached, however, thai licensing policy in Australia which provides for the authorisation in the 27 megahertz band of lowpowered transceiver units in wfiai are known as handphone Mobile Services adequately caters for all legitimate requirements io. this country. Over 14,000 of these units have been licensed for use by Police, Fire Brigades. Forestry Departments, Civil Defence Organisations and other public bodies and also by private individuals and organisation having a need for short range communication in connection with such activities as building construction, properly management, sporting events and for safely and rescue purposes. The extension of licensing policy to provide for the use of common radio frequencies lor the conduct of all kinds of business and personal conversations would lead, as it has done elsewhere, to a slate bordering on chaos in the frequency bands concerned to Ihe detriment of services established to meet the important and useful public and private needs lo which I have referred. Unrestricted radio-communicalion would also permit the contravention of long standing Government policy in Australia which provides that ihe public telephone and telegraph systems which have been provided at considerable public expense should be the normal means of communication between individuals residing in areas where ihese services are available. (2) The Customs Department with which the question was discussed some time ago has indicated that it is not the practice lo place restrictions on imported goods if similar articles can be freely manufactured and sold locally. The Customs Department, however, is co-operating with my Depanment by supplying names and addresses o£ individuals and firms discovered bringing these units inlo the country. Postmaster(3) Every endeavour is made through Press statements and advertisements to warn ihe public that use of radio transceiver equipment without a licence is illegal and of the penalties which may be imposed on offenders. A leaflet conveying this message will soon be on distribution at Post Offices. In addition a brochure is available from the Regulatory and Licensing areas of the Post Office in capital cities and major provincial centres which sets out the conditions under which licences may be granted for the employment of this type of radio communication. (4) The Wireless Telegraphy Act as it now stands does not prohibit the possession or sale of radio-communication transmitting and receiving equipment. The Act is directed against the establishment and use of equipment for the purpose of transmitting messages. Consideration has been given lo the tightening of the law to cover possession of equipment capable of being used for this purpose and enquiries are proceeding in this direction. Export: Australian Cars (Question No. 1570) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry the following question upon notice: (1) Can he state the average F.O.B price of Australian made cars exported during 1969-70. (2) What was the average amount of tariff protection represented in the cost of a - standard type car fabricated in Australia during 1969-70 (3) What was the total value of the protection in that year. (4) What amount per employee engaged in the motor car industry in Australia does this represent.",84
155,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The answer provided by my predecessor (Sir John MCEwen) to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I.) In 1969-70, 13,337 assembled passenger motor cars valued at $21,499,000 were exported from Australia, wilh an averageunit value of $1,612 F.O.B. (These figures refer '.o Australian produce as defined by the Commonwealth Statistician.) (2), (3) and (4) It is not possible from official statistics and published industry infoimation to answer these questions. Demonstrations (Question No. 1580) D r Klugman asked the Prime Minister upon notice: In the event of charges being preferred against any person participating in any demonstration at which photographers under the contiol of the Commonwealth were present, will he direct that defendants be given copies of all photographs taken in order to assist in the preparauon of their cases and lo ensure that magistrates, judges and juries are given a complete picture of the events giving rise lo the chargesMr Gorton-The answer to *he honourable member's question is as follows: If photographs are known to the prosecutor and in the possession of the Commonwealth and are relevant they are produced to the Court on the hearing of the charge. Also if a defendant has reason to believe any person is in possession of photographs which may be relevant to his case, court procedures, provide for the issue and service of a subpoena requiring the production of the photographs in evidence. Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting (Question No. 1598) Mr Keogh asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice: (1) Will he state the reasons for itu abolition of the Joint Parliamentary' Standing Committee on Broadcasting. (2) In view of the increasing criticism ot many aspects of television and radio broadcasting, will the Government give early consideration to the re-establishment of the committee. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It was decided in February 1950, not to reconstitute the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting because the functions of the Committee, advising the Postmaster-General on broadcasting matters, had been absorbed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which had been established in 1949. Subsequent amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act deleted provision for such a committee. (2) The Government has no plans lor re-establishment of such a committee, nor is the Government aware of any shortcomings or criticism of the services which would justify such a course, having regard to the functions and competence of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to deal with such matters. Broadcasting (Question No. 16B3) Mr Grassby asked the Postmaster General, upon notice: (1) lt is a fact that in some localities such as large areas north of Wentworth in New South Wales radio reception is not available. (2) Are the present 101 broadcasting bans adequate to meet the present requirements of radio coverage; if not, is there a need for further development of these bands or 30tne other development. (3) What arrangements have been made to date for the introduction of frequency modulation. (4) If no arrangements have been made, will the Government give urgent consideration to frequency modulation broadcasting aud its introduction in order to improve existmg broadcasting standards and fill the gaps which exist. (5) Is he able to give the (a) number and (b) names of nations in Western Europe and in the Americas which have frequency modulation broadcasting. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) As the honourable member wiil be aware, I announced on 7th May 1970, that there will be an inquiry' by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board into frequency modulation broadcasting. From the terms of reference of ihe inquiry which I provided in my later statement on 14ih May, the honourable member will appreciate that the type of matters which he has raised in this question will be encompassed by the inquiry. 1I have already indicated that 1 will in due course make the report of the Board available to honourable members and the public. Telephone Services (Question Nn. 1625) Mr Enderby asked the General, upon notice: Can he arrange for slock exchange reports to be available on the local Australian Capital Territory telephone exchange as they are available in Sydney by dialling 207«. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department bas made plans to extend the Stock Exchange Recorded Information Service to Canberra but the date of introduction will depend upon the outcome of some negotiations currently taking place with ihe Sydney Stock Exchange, and resolving some technical problems in Canberra. T h i r d Party Insurance (Quesdon No. 1657) Mr Crean asked the Prime upon noiice: (1) What was the outcome of some attention at departmental level being given to whether section 51 of the Constitution could be used by the Commonwealth, following the example of uniform legislation relating to life insurance passed to pass uniform legislation in the field of third parly insurance (Hansard, - 18th August 1970, page 110). (21 As ii is now commonplace for motorisls to venture far interstate,- has he considered the desirability of the. Commonwealth intervening lo ensure uniformity in the field of third party insurance, even though the Acts of Ihe 6 Slates are by no means identical. (3) Will the Commonwealth itself now examine the merits of adopting a concept other than 'negligence' as the norm for compensation in road accident cases instead of waiting oil the deliberations of the Australian Transport Advisory Council which has in turn been frustrated by the failure to secure the ve'porl called for by the New South Wales Slate Government on this matter. (4) Has his attention been, drawn to the situation in Saskatchewan, one of the middle Provinces of Canada, which has operated since 1946 under 'absolute liability' - in substitution for 'negligence' without problems arising wilh neighbouring Provinces or complementary or reciprocal legislation being necessary. (5) Will he give an assurance lhat, in any future inquiries sponsored by the Commonwealth,evidence from spokesmen for road victims, hospino tals and such, apart from the usual motoring bodies and insurance companies, will be sought. Mr Gorton- I have been advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The attention at departmental level io the question of the Commonwealth's powers in relation to third party insurance referred to in answer to the honourable member's question no. 679 (Hansard 1.10, 18th August 1970), related to particular proposals for a scheme of uniform motor Postmaster- vehicle insurance which had been put forward by  February 1970 commented as follows: 'Your proposals raise issues which have extensive implications for many areas of Government activity, and while ihe Commonwealth Parliament possesses limited legislative powers in relation to some of the fields involved, it is the prerogative of the State Governments lo lake all the necessary action within their own boundaries. In particular, only a State Government would have the power to alter the ""rule of fault'' liability as it applies at present within the State'. (2) and (3) These questions raise much the  beyond the question of uniform legislation based on existing principles inlo the question of uniform legislation based on a different concept of liability than applies at present. As indicated in my reply to the honourable member's question No. 679, the present State laws have a large measure of uniformity and reciprocity. As indicated in my reply lo Minister, part (1) above, the question of making a basic change in the concept of liability applicable within a State falls within the legislative competence of thai Stale. (4) Yes. (5) It is the usual practice for inquiries in 1945, instituted by the Commonwealth to take into account the views of all interested parties. Television: Subliminal Perception (Question Noi 1682) D r Everingham asked the Postmaster General, upon notice: (1) Are television films checked for subliminal advertising. (2) Can rhis type of advertising be monitored or controlled. (3) If so, what action has he taken towaids such control. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) io (3) The Television Programme Standards of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board prohibit the use of the process known as subliminal perception or similar techniques in television programmes or advertisements. It is therefore the responsibility of licensees to ensure that such techniques are not used and therefore to check lhat programme matter does not involve these techniques. The Board informs me lhat there is evidence of ihe use of subliminal perception techniques in Australian television programming or advertising Employment: Civilian Workforce - (Question Nu. 1703) Mr MCLeay asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) What was the total number of persons in the Australian civilian workforce in each of the years ending 30th June 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970. (2) What was the total number of Commonwealth Government civilian employees in each of the same years. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: It is not possible to provide a figure for the Australian civilian workforce as at 30th June as survey-based estimates of the Australian civilian workforce are published quarterly by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics for February, May. August and November. The total number of persons in the Australian civilian workforce as at May 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1,970 is shown in the following table. NA May 1967 .. .. . . 4,934.400 May 1968 .. .. . . 5,063,700 May 1969 May 1970 .. .. .. 5,385,800 These estimates are based on the results of a quarterly population survey which is carried out on a one per cent sample throughout Australia. The eslimates relate to all persons aged fifteen years and over, except members of the permanent armed forces, national servicemen enlisted in the Regular Army Supplement and certain diplomatic personnel customarily excluded from census and estimated populations. - The total numbers of Commonwealth Government civilian employees in the same years are shown in the following table. Figures are supplied for May and June and are derived from bulletins published by (he Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics.* The figures include, in addition to the Staff of government departments, employees of semi-government and statutory authorities. -- - -«NA 1967 295,500 1968 305,40 0 1969 315,300 1970 329,100 - Employed Wage and Salary Earners May, 1970 and Employment and Unemployment, June 1970. Territory of Papua and New Guinea: Insurance Companies. . (Question No. 1738) ' Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (l) What income was received and what investments were made by (a) life and (b) other insurance companies in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1969-70.

(3) What action has been taken to ensure that the income which the companies derive from Territory operations is invested in Ihe Territory. (4) How many (a) indigenes and (b) expatriates are employed by the companies in ihe Territory.",85
156,Mr BARNES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total income received by life insurance companies operating in ihe Territory during 196970 is not known. The premium income received by life insurance companies operating in the Territory during their financial vears ended in 1969-70 was $3,180,000. Particulars of investments' made by life insurance companies in the Territory during 1969-70 arc not known. However, investments by life insurance companies in Territory public loans in 1969-70 amounted to $7,340,000; this includes an amount of $6,290,000 invested in the special loan to finance the purchase of equity in the Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd for the 'benefit of the people of the Territory as a whole, In addition life insur5.197,400 ance companies paid loans on mortgage and loans on security of policies amounting to $249,000 in the Territory in 1969-70.

May June 295,200 Coal 305,40 0 (Question No. 1770) 315,700 329,400 Mr LES JOHNSON asked the .Minister for National Development, upon-notice: (1) Ts he able to say whether Clutha Development is proposing a multi-million dollar offshore coal loading facilityin the Coledale-Scarboroogh area north of WoUongong to .facilitate export from the southern coalfields. (2) Are details of this proposal; including its estimated cost, known; if so, what are they. (3) Will either Commonwealth or State funds be utilised ineither the project or ancillary development. (4) Is he able to say whether Clutha Development is overseas-owned. (5) Can he say (a) how it is incorporated, (b) what arc its present business interests, (c) what is its capital and (d) vvhat coal mines or coal leases are owned or held by this firm.",87
157,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is understood that Clutha Development Ply Ltd has submitted proposals to the New South Wales Government for the building of an off-shore coal loading facility in the ColedaleScarborough area north of Wollongong. (2) The company's proposals are understood to cover the construction of an off-shore loader rated at 4 lo 6.000 tons per hour initially geared to the export of 12 million tons of coal per annum. The proposed water depth of the loaders is lo be in excess of 70 feet in order to handle sels of upward of 200,000 tons deadweight. Estimated costs of Ihe proposals are not known. (3) I am not aware of any suggestion that Commonwealth funds be utilised in the company's project. The question of finance is currently a mailer of negotiation between Clutna Development Pty Ltd and the New South Wales Government. (4) Clutha Development Pty Ltd is owned by Wollclift Ply Ltd'. (5) (a) Wollclift Pty Ltd is incorporated under the New South Wales Companies Act. (b) Its coal miniag and shipping operations in Australia are carried on through 19 subsidiary companies including Qutha Development Pty Ltd. (c) A search at Registrar-General's Department discloses lhat paid up capital of Wollclift is $2m in 1.00,000 shares of $2 each. The major shareholder is Universe Tankships Inc., Bermuda.

Vienna Convention on C i v i l Liability for Nuclear Damage (Question No. 1783) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has Australia signed and ratified the Vienna Convention on civil liability for nuclear damage. (2) What legislative action is required by the Commonwealth and the States lo provide for liability in nuclear accidents. (3) What progress has been made in drafting such legislation. (4) What is the proposed limit on liability, if any. (5) Did the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in its 1968-69 Annual Report indicate that overseas suppliers may not enter inlo contracts unless exempted from all thirdparty liabilities and nuclear materials may not be obtained from some countries unless such legislation has been enacted; if so, does the Government intend to take urgent action on this matter. Mr Swart/ - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia has neither signed nor ratified this Convention. So far only 4 countries have ratified vesit (Cuba, United Arab Republic, the Philippines and Argentina). Five ratifications are necessary to bring Ihe Convention inlo force. (2) The form of the legislative action has not yet been decided: currently it is being considered by a Commonwealth/States body known as the Consullalive Committee on Nuclear Energy. (See also reply to Question No. 1786.) (3) Drafting of Commonwealth legislation has not begun. (4) This has not yet been determined. I might add lhat limits specified in ihe legislation of olher countries differ widely because of differing assessments of possible damage from a nuclear accident. (5) The Commission did raise the possibility of encountering difficulties with suppliers unless they were exempted from third party liabilities. The probable need for legislation and its form are being considered by the Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy. If any required legislative action is not completed by the time a nuclear reactor is being installed a possible alternative would be the completion of a formal agreement with the supplier so thai he would be held harmless for third party liability for nuclear damage. The possible need for safeguards agreements lo facilitate supplies of nuclear materials is a separate issue which was also mentioned in the Report. Such agreements are designed to prevent the diversion of nuclear materials lo military purposes and are usually administered either by the supplying countiy or by the International Atomic Energy Agency by agreement between the supplying country and the receiving country. Australia has such an agreement with the United Slates and the Agency, but such agreements do not require legislation. Australian Atomic Energy Commission (Question No. 1784) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: Does he intend to present to Parliament the Annual Report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for 1969-70 prior to the acceptance of the tender for the Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station. ' Mr SWARTZ - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Annual Report of the Atomic Energy Commission was tabled in Parliament on Thursday, 15th October 1970. i Atomic Energy Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: If either of the tenders for nuclear power stations using heavy water are chosen (a) what will be Australia's annual requirements for heavy water to the year 1990, (b) at what stage will a local heavy water plant be justified, and (c) what are the likely sources of supply before such a plant can be built in view of the Canadian difficulties with the Glace Bay plant.",88
158,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ' Details of the annual heavy water requirements ot the CANDU and SGHWR reactors under consideration for construction at Jervis Bay are contained in confidential commercial tender documents and cannot be made public. It is not possible to stale now the stage at which a local heavy water plant would be justified. Justification for constructing such a plant would depend upon Australia's future requirements for heavy water and the price and overseas availability of i l at that time. The Glace Bay plant is not the only source of supply of heavy water from Canada-ther e is another plant, operating at Port Hawkesbury, and ihe Bruce plant is expected on line by 1972. Heavy water reactors would not now be under consideration for Jervis Bay if economic sources of heavy water had not first been established. - Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: Does he intend introducing legislation, as suggested in the 1968-69 Annual Report of the Atomic Energy Commission, to establish regular control over nuclear facilities and materials; if so, when.",89
159,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The licensing and regulatory control of nuclear installations is currently under study not only by various Commonwealth Departments and the Atomic Energy Commission but also by the joint Commonwealth/States Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy! An important aspect of the problem is the question of what legislation may be necessary to establish effective and efficient licensing and regulatory arrangements throughout Australia, These are complex issues involving technological, legal and financial considerations and their elucidation will take some lime. It is not expected that legislation would be introduced in the immediate future. Atomic Energy (Question No. 1787) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Can he provide information on the Government's plans for nuclear power station development in Australia showing,- in particular (a) pro(Question Nn. I7HS) jected electrical energy power demand annually until 1990 and (b) projected nuclear power electric generation capacity annually until 1990. (2) Will he also supply,' in a tabular form similar to thut provided to the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (Victorian Branch) Annual Conference in 1970 by 'officers of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the demand by each main reactor typc under consideration : each year for (i) uranium, (ii); heavy water, (iii) zirconium and (iv) fabricated fuel - elements.",89
160,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The Commonwealth Government has no plans ai present for au'clcar power station development other lhan those' associated with the proposed Jervis Hay project. Power developments are primarily State matters bid it is known that Stale Governments' plans in respect of future nuclear power development are by no means firm ai present. Current eslimates of generating capacity to meet demands for electricity are given in the table below. For the reason given above however 1 would not like to estimate how niui.'h of ihis capacity will be supplied by nuclear units. As a result I am unable to speculate on behalf of the Government ihe demand by. each reactor type for fuel, heavy water etc. although, as observed by Ihe honourable member. two A.A.E.C. officers gave their own views on thi* subject to a learned society in March 1970.

(2) Has the Minister stated that unit power generation costs from a 500 MW station will be higher than an equivalent coal fired station. (3) Has the United Nations recommended that the maximum sized station for ihe initial 'unit in a nuclear power programme should be 300 MW. (4) If so, can he indicate if the more comprehensive training and experience obtained in operating a 500 MW nuclear power station will be sufficient lo justify using a station of this rather than a smaller station for which the subsidy required will be less.",89
161,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The suggestion of locating .a combined nuclear power and water desalination plant in South Australia has been considered. The possibility was rejected, however, because considerable technical problems still remain to be solved before 'duplex' plants of the size necessary for economic operation become practicable. Such plants are not expected to be available for several decades. (2) I have said that generation costs of the proposed Jervis Bay Nuclear Power station are expected to be higher than those of large new coal fired stations' situated on the New South Wales coal fields. (3) I am unaware of any recommendation by the United Nations that the maximum sized stations for the initial unit in a nuclear power programme should be . 300 MW. It would be surprising if that Organisation were to make a recommendation of this technical nature. (4) Had we adopted a smaller unit there would have been a saving of capital but production costs per unit of electricity would be higher. As a result we decided thai a 500 MW or slightly larger uni: was the optimum ""size. In addition such a unit was an appropriate one for the New South Wales grid having regard to lhat Slates demand pattern. (Question No. 17X9) Mr Jacobi ask.ee! the Minister for National Development, upon notice: Has any agreement been reached with any of the three governnients who are parties to the agreement for collaboration in Ihe development and exploitation of the gas centrifuge for enriching uranium (Great' Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands) regarding the supply of centrifuge technology to Australia if Australia should accept a lender for the nuclear power station at Jervis Bay from - either the Nuclear Power Group of Great Britain or Kraftwcrke-Union of West Germany.",90
162,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No, but an offer was made by the consortium to consider such arrangements if either the United Kingdom or West Germany suppliers was the successful tenderer. Formal arrangements cannol be considered until the successful' tender has been decided. Tariff (Question No. 1805)",90
163,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"the Minister for Trade and Industry the following question, upon notice: (1) Is the motor vehicle industry in Australia protected by tariffs.

(2) When did '.he Commission make its report on the application. Mr Gorton-The a'nswer to' the honourable member's question is as follow?: (1) The Commission' commenced its formal inquiry inlo the application by South Australia al a hearing in Canberra on 3rd August 1970. (2) The Commission's - recommendationdial an advance grant of $5m be- {laid in 1970-71 was conveyed to the Governor General by the Chairman of the Commission on 10th August 1970. The Commission reported on the application on 1st October 1970. Atomic Energy (Question No. 1*87) Mr Jacobi asked the Min ister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Arc ihe economic factors associated with uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor fuel element fabrication such that large plains have a considerable cos's advantage. (2) Is he able to say whether many countries have found it advantageous to undertake joint projects in this area lo achieve favourable economies of scale. (3) Can he stale, which countries arc establishing or considering joint facilities. (4) Does Ihe Government contemplate co-operative action in this area; if not, why not. (5) Will the recent Nabarlek uranium discoveries make co-operative Government activity more desirable.",91
169,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) The economics of reactor fuel fabrication and proven LU:Iilium enrichment processes depend on a number of factors but in general the production costs decrease as the size of Ihe plant increases. (2) and (31 Great Britain. Germany and the Netherlands have been negotiating an agreement for a joint programme on fuel enrichment which, apart from the hope for favourable economics, will more importantly offer the advantage of combined technological development and scientific expertise. But this agreement has not yet been finalised, and I know of no other such joint projects on co-operative enrichment. There has been a co-operative effort on the part of OECD countries in the high temperature gas-cooled reactor 'Dragon' in Britain and fuel fabrication is part of the co-operaiive effort, but the economics of it were not the basis for this co-operation. (4) The Government has no plans for a cooperative programme in uranium enrichment and would not consider such a move until Australia's long-term future requirement for enriched uranium is known. (5) Not necessarily. Naturally, this discovery ancl any future discoveries which increase Australia's proven reserves of uranium could lead to initiatives towards a co-operalive enrichment programme lo meet local demand and for export purposes. (Question No. J888) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by Mr Yastihiro Nakasone, the Director of the Japanese Self-Defence Agency, that Australia might be interested in co-operaiing with Japan and other countries in establishing a uranium enrichment organisation. (2) If so, what is the Government's attitude to this proposal. -. (3) Have any discussions been held with the Japanese Government on the possibility of 3iich a project. (4) Can he say which nations are considering joining such an organisation.",92
170,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Government has not received and consequentlyhas not discussed any oiler to collaborate wilh Japan in establishing a uranium enrichment organisation. (3) No.' (4) No. Atomi c Energy (Question Nn. 188!*) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has the South Australian Government submitted a proposal to Ihe Commonwealth to connect the South Australian and Victorian electric power grids with a view to establishing a nuclear power station to supply bolh States with electricity. (2) If so, has the Commonwealth considered this proposal. (3) Are suitable sites available for ihis type of nuclear power station in ihe south-e.nl of South Australia. (4) Would the economy of this type of power station be competitive wilh fossil fuel plants. (5) Was a benefit/cost analysis done on this proposal; if so, with what result.",92
171,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Such a proposal was raised informally by a previous South Australian Government but no current proposal is under consideration. (3) No detailed studies of available sites have been made for South Australia. The siting of reactois involves many complex issues such as availability of cooling media, nearness lo population and load centres and other considerations. When a definite proposal is made sites must be considered individually. However, it seems probable lhat physically suitable siles could be found in the region. Uranium (4) Al the present time a nuclear power station would not be economic in South Australia as electricity can be produced more cheaply from oil or natural gas. (5) Although no benefit/cost analysis has been done by the Commonwealth a number of less detailed studies have been made on the proposal to interconnect Victoria and South Australia. Superficially such a scheme could have attractions because of ihe time differences between the States. The pooling of generating resources might reduce the total amount of generating plant required in each system either to meet peak demands or provide spare plant. It has been ascertained however that the economics of such interconnection are not attractive at present. Very long transmission lines would be required from Adelaide to Melbourne, and there would be virtually no intermediate load centres to be served. This position may change in the course of time.

Commonwealth Public Service (Question No. 1921) Mr Keogh asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that it is many years since the $48 allowance based on Public Service Regulation 97A and paid to Postmasters in lieu of quarters has been varied. (2) If so, will he give early attention to having this and other rates in the Public Service Regulations, which have remained unaltered for a long period, adjusted to the level of current costs of living. Mr Gorton- I am informed by the Public Service Board that the answer to the honourable members question is as f o l lows: (1) Yes. (2) Allowances in the Public Service Regulations are reviewed from time to time and adjusted as circumstances require. The allowance referred to in part (1) of this question is of long standing, lt was the subject of a claim before the Public Service Arbitrator in 1966 when the Postmasters' Staff (Number) Increase June 1950 June 1970 Number Percentage 507 607 100 19.7 479 551 72 15.0 417 930 513 123.0 <d) 533 9,722 9.844 122 1.3 2,197 4.341 2,144 97.6 6,032 9,799 3,767 62.5 H36 . 2,327 1,491 178.3 438 te)3.42l (e)2,983 (e)6S1.0 7.141 10.809' 3,668 51.4 (f) 243 71,377 107,686 36,309 50.9 1,159 047 3.004 17,538 -26 4.554 1.053 2.018 997 1,126 14,384 154,992 229,380- 74,388 48.0 (b) Office (d) Before 1961 with Depart(I"") Created 1964. Association filed an application to vary the allowance from $48 a year to $.400 a year. Postmasters are the only class of public servants to whom such an allowance is paid. Whilst the Public Service Board and the Postmaster-General's Department did not seek the withdrawal of the allowance, having regard to ils long existence, they opposed ihe claim on the ground lhat there was no reason to distinguish in this respect postmasters from other officers of the Service. As one reason for dismissing Ihe claim the Arbitrator considered that there was no justification for officers who were not' provided with official quarters to be placed on parity .with those who happened to occupy oflicial quarters at rentals which may be lower than that required for private quarters. - Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station (Question N». 1926) Mr Jacobi asked .the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Will he provide details of specifications required of all tenders for the nuclear power station at Jervis Bay relating to: (a) radionuclide emissions for airborne effluents in terms of (i) gross beta values, (ii) levels of individual radionuclides and (iii) time of storage ot orf-gdses required before release lo the atmosphere: and (b) radionuclide emissions ior nuterborne effluents in terms of (i) radionuclide levels in cooling water and (ii) radionuclide levels in high conductivity liquid wastes and laundry wastes, in terms of gross beta values and levels of individual radionuclides. (2) Is he able to state the relationship of ihese radionuclide emission standards to (a) International Atomic Energy standards, (b) United States Atomic Energy Commission standards, io) standards specified by the Slate of Minnesota and (d) standards - pecified by the Stale of Maryland.",93
173,Mr SWARTZ,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) For commercial reasons information contained in ihe lender specifications is al ihe present lime restricted lo the tenderers, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, ihe Atomic Energy Commission and its consultants. Bechtel Pacific Corporation. However all radioactive discharge from the Jervis Bay nuclear power station will be controlled to limits less than J/IOlh of those specified as safe by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, ihe internationally recognised expert body on the matter. Those specified standards are accepted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. They are also accepted by ihe USAEC. The Slates of"" Minnesota and Maryland, in ihe United States of America, have adopted limits which are approximately in the same order of magnitude as those specified for Jervis Bay. Jervis Bay Nuclear Power St .(tion (Question No. 1927) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn lo the recent publication ""Ecological Factors in ihe Siting, Design and Operations of a Nucicar Power Station' by Dr Davy, M. S. Giles and E. Charash. (2) Does this publication contain an> data ot Ausualian origin. (3) If not. will he inform the Hou<e when and where Australian data relevant lo the ecological hazards ns-ociatetl with constructing a nuclear power station al Jrrvis Bay will be published with special reference lo (a) concentration factors of critical radionuclides in marine organisms found in ihe Jervis Bay area, (b) movement In tritium through the marine food chain of So:.;th Coast estuaries, (c.) eating habils of ihe local population ancl (d) redistribution of airborne radionuclides ancl the influence of local topography and meteorology on this redistribution. Mr Svrsirlz-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) Yes. 1 made the paper available lo members of this House on I2ih June last year. (2) The paper presents a general discussion of the current approach lo ecological considerations for the siting of nuclear power stations and does not contain dala relating specifically .to. the proposed site at Jervis Bay. (3) As I have stated in the House ..m several occasions, when a final choice of the reactor for ihe Jervis Bay project has been made. I will make a full statement to the House. The statement amongst other things will traverse the possible effects of the reactor on the ecology of the Jervis Bay area. In addition 1 should mention that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission intends to hold a public symposium in Sydney tuwaids the end of the financial year. The Commission will contribute papers lo the symposium on a number of aspects of the Jervis Bay project including those relating to the possible effect of the pow.er station on the ecology of the area. Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station (Question No. 1928) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Is he able lo state whether the United Slates firms Westinghouse and General Electric have developed nuclear power reactors which claim to reduce emissions of radionuclides to near zero levels by ihe development of sophisticated air hold up systems. (2) ls it a fact that this new system will only add about $1,000 per megawatt to the cost of a nuclear power reactor. (3) If so. will he investigate the possibility of having such a system incorporated into ihe proposed nuclear power plant al Jervis Bay.",95
174,Mr SWARTZ,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Bolh Westinghouse and General Electric have slated thai they have units available which reduce :he emission of airborne radionuclides. (2) The cost will depend on the size and type of station involved and exact cost .lata is not available al present. (3) The feasibility of incorporating such units into ihe proposed Jervis Bay plant will depend to a large extent on the type of reactor chosen. However the availability of Ihese units will certainly be taken into consideration when a contract is being negotiated. Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Station (Question No. 1929) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has ihe Government adopted, as a long term strategy for planning future nucle.ir development, the building, initially only, of reactors of the. type - accepted for the Jervis Bay nuclear power station,, and then the building of fast breeder reactors as soon as they become available. (2) If not. what strategy has been chosen.",95
175,Mr SWARTZ,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (J) The construction of nuclear powei stations subsequent to the Jervis Bay plant will be the responsibility of the individual Stales. The Government proposes to assist the Stales as far as possible in their forward planning. The introduction of fast breeder reactors will depend on the economics of such systems, their sizes relative to the capacity of State systems at the time and the availability and price of plutonium. For these reasons, it would not be prudent at this stage to commit Australia lo a fixed approach to nuclear power. (2) The only strategy which has been considered for Australia's nuclear development is to construct conventional converter reactors, of the type offered for ihe Jervis Bay Station. Such reactors will produce plutonium for use as fuel in fast breeder reactors if these, as expected, become available later this century. Jervis Bay Nucicar Power Station (Question No. 1930) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: '(1) Has his attention been drawn to a suggestion by the eminent nuclear scicntisi. Professor Sir Mark Oliphant, that the introduction of nuclear power to Australia should be delayed until fast breeder reactors are available. (2) Is he able to stale whether the first fast breeder power station is expected lo enter the United Kingdom power grid well before 1980 and that a short time thereafter the majority of British reactors are expected to be of this type. (3) If so, will he consider delaying Ihe introduction o£ nuclear power until these fast breeder reactors are available.",95
176,Mr SWARTZ,COMPARISON BY,"The answer lo the honourable members question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) A 250M.We prototype fast breeder reactor is scheduled on line at Dounreay in 19*74. Subsequently the extent to which fast breeder power stations will contribute to the overall power supply of the United Kingdom will depend on the success of this unit. (3) No. It would be a mistake to delay the introduction of nuclear power to Australia. Fast breeder reactors have not yet been shown as commercially practicable and in any case depend for fuel of plutonium produced in converter reactors of the type being considered for Jervis Bay. (Question No. 1931) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) What alternative sources of advice on nuclearpower, other than the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, are available lo the Government (a) within the Commonwealth Public Service and (b) outside the Commonwealth Public Service. (2) Has the Government considered commissioning independent consultants to provide advice in the development of nuclear power in Australia; if not, why not.",96
177,Mr SWARTZ,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Wilhin the Commonwealth Public Service niy department provides policy advice as dinstinct from technical advice on nuclear matters principally in respect to its relationship with other sources'of energy. In addition ths Government is advised on some aspects of health and safely from the National Radiation Advisory Council (responsible lo the Prime Ministerj and the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory (respon: sible to the Minister for Health). Outside the Commonwealth' Public Service ihe views of the Stales on nucteur power development will be made availablefrom ihe newly formed Commonwealth-Slates Consultative Committee on Nuclear Energy. The Electricity Commissions of the larger States also have had officers attached to nuclear installations overseas and as a result these Commissions are in an informed position on nuclear mailers -. Finally the Commonwealth ha.s access lo the views of State Departments of Heaith, universities, etc., on various aspects of nuclear development. (2) So far as the Jervis Bay project is concerned il has already been reported lhat the Government has engaged ihe services of the Bechtel Pacific Corporation, l t is not considered necessary however lo engage, independent consultants to provide advice on ihe general question of the development of nuclear power in Australia. Commonwealth Industrial Court (Question Nn. 1947)",96
178,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Are any formal or informal records kept at the industrial registries of each application for a rule nisi under sections 140 and 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. (2) If not, why not. (3) If so, what is the difficulty in supplying ihe information sought in question No. 848 (Hansard, 22nd September 1970, page 1490). Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that: (1) There are records of each successful application for a rule nisi bnt no records of unsuccessful applications. Nuclear Power (2) ' and (3) Applications for a rule nisi are made directly to a judge ex parte in his chambers or at his home. If the application is granted the applicant is required to file Ihe rule and supporting affidavit with the Registrar (Regulation 70). ff the application is refused there is no rule lo file and there would be no record of the application in Ihe Industrial Registry. Papua and New Guinea: DLO Conventions (Question No. 1950)",96
179,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon noiice: What is ihe legal difficulty which prevents the Commonwealth from ratifyingand implementing in Ihe - Northern Territory and in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea the International Labour Organisation Comention No. 82 relating to discriminatory wage rates on grounds of race or colour. Mr £ edden-Tb e answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ILO Convention No. 82-Socia l Policy (NonMetropolitan Territories), 1947, relates only to external territories and, therefore, does not have any application in the Northern Territory. The Convention covers awide range of matters and prescribes detailed policies and measures which ratifying countries undertake to apply in their non-metropolitan territories. The policies to be followed are directed to the well-being and development of the peoples in such territories and to the promotion of the desire on their part for social progress, ln particular, they are directed to the improvement of standards of living as the principal objective in the planning of economic development: to protection of migrant workers: to non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex. belief, tribal association or trade union affiliation; and to education and training. Compliance with all provisions of Ihe Convention, and not only the particular aspect referred to by the honourable member, is necessary to enable it to be ratified. 1 would refer the honourable member to the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for External Territories, to Question No. 1427 (Hansard. 26th August 1969, page 712) concerning its application in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Conciliation and Arbitration (Question No. 1951)",96
180,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: In view of his answer to question No. 1218 (Hansard, 2nd September 1970. page 906) that 40 per cent of Australian employees are working under Commonwealth awards and that only fiftytwo Commonwealth arbitration inspectors are employed compared with 239 State inspectors who are authorised to inspect under Federal awards in New South Wales. Western Australia and Tasmania alone, wilt he state what financial reimbursement is made to the States in respect of State inspectors carrying out inspection of Federal awards. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that no financial reimbursement is made to the States in respect of State Inspectors carrying out inspection of Federal Awards. The arrangements for the authorisation of State Inspectors to carry out inspections under Federal Awards are mutual, inasmuch as they also provide for the authorisation of Commonwealth Inspectors to carry out inspections under State laws, awards and determinations. The inspection of Federal awards by State Inspectors and of State prescriptions by Commonwealth Inspectors forms a very small part of the total number of inspections and it was agreed between the Commonwealth and the participating States that no financial reimbursement of either parly was called for. Conciliation and Arbitration: 1 Awards and Agreements (Question No. 12.18.)",97
181,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) How many employees in Australia am covered by Federal awards or agreements. (2) What percentage' does this figure represent of all employees. (3) What is ihe number of Commonwealth arbitration inspectors employed in each State. (4) Can he say what is the number of arbitration inspectors employed by each of the respective Stale governments. (5) Is it a fact thai in some Stales ihe Commonwealth has authorised Slate inspectors to carry out inspections in relation to Commonwealth awards. (6) If so. how many of these inspectors aro involved and in which States are they authorised to act on behalf of ihe Commonwealth. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) From information revealed in the Commonwealth Statistician's 'Survey of the Incidence of Industrial Awards, Determinations and Collective Agreements, May 1968' it is estimated that 40.1 per cent of employees in Australia are affected by Commonwealth awards. In terms of numbers of employees this estimate could bo expressed as 1,740.000. (Excluded from Ihe 1968 survey where all employees in rural industry, in private domestic service, of private employers in hotels, restaurants and other personal services, employees of private employers not subject to' payroll tax and exployees in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory). (3)Number of Commonwealth Slate Inspectors New South Wales (including Australian Capital Territory) .. 19 Victoria .. .. 13 Queensland 6 South Australia (including Northern Territory) .. .. 7 Western Australia .. .. 4 Tasmania .. .. .. 3 52 (4) It would not be appropriate for me to supply information on the staffing of State authorities. (5) Yes. (6) State Inspectors are authorised to inspect under Federal awards in New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Althogether, 239 State Inspectors are so authorised. Conciliation and Arbitration Wage Rates (Question No. 1958)",97
182,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: Does any provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act make it possible to require an employer to employ labour at wage rates fixed by the Arbitration Commission in cases where an employer regards these rates as uneconomic. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honAustralian ourable members question is as follows: ' If an employer employs labour on work making covered by an award of the Commonwealth ciliation and Arbitration Commission, he is obliged to observe the terms of that award. Offences against Commonwealth Law: (Question No. 1961)",98
183,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMPARISON BY,"the Attorney General, upon notice: (1) What arrangements did the Commonwealth make with the Government of New S-.iulh which led to New South Wales Magistrate Rogers being now engaged solely, or almost solely, in dealing with offences against Commonwealth law. (2) Is it a fact that this magistrate is an ordinary magistrate appointed by the Government of New South Wales. (3) What reimbursement does the Commonorchardists. wealth make to the Government of New South Wales to compensate the State for the time spent by Mr Rogers in hearing cases affecting Commonpermitting wealth laws. Mr Hughes-The answer to the honourorchardists able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) During the war years arrangements were made with the New South Wales Government for a Court of Petty Sessions constituted by a Stipendiary Magistrate and an office of a Clerk of Petty Sessions to be located in Commonwealth premises for the hearing of' Commonwealth cases. The Court and the Petty Sessions Office are presently located in Phillip House. Mr Rogers now retired. (3) The Commonwealth makes no direct cash reimbursement to the State for the services State magistrates. The State of New South Wales receives payment from the Commonwealth mal Court fees in respect of matters ih which the Commonwealth is applicant or prosecutor. - (Question No. 1969) 1 Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) How many carpet makers are there in Australia.. (2) Do they use Australian wool. (3) What was the size, texture and composition of the carpet in the main haU of the Australian pavilion at Japan's Expo '70.",98
184,Mr ANTHONY,COMPARISON BY,"The answer provided by my predecessor (Sir John MCEwen) to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that there are 29 firms making carpet in Australia. (2) Australian carpet manufacturers mostly use wool from New Zealand, Britain, India and Pakistan. At times a percentage of specially selected wool is blended with the traditional wools. The high-quality Australian wool which has achieved great fame throughout the world for apparel is not suitable for carpel manuConfacture because of its tendency to felt. (3) The carpet used on the floor of the exhibition and dispersal halls was made in Australia and covered an approximate area of 750 square yards. It was an Axminster type carpel with a pile composed of wool from New Zealand, BriHearings tain, India, Pakistan and Australia. Chemical Sprays (Question No. 1971) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Wales Primary' Industry, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether the prices of chemical spray materials in New Zealand are as much as 50 per cent lower than those in Australia. (2) If so, does this give New Zealand orchardists a considerable advantage over Australian (3) Is he able to say whether the difference in price is due to the Government of New Zealand the entry of spray materials duty free and, in other cases, by paying a subsidy to producers to keep costs down so enabling to compete on export markets. (4) Will he order a - review of 'he competitiveness of Australian orchardists, giving particular attention to the cost.of chemical sprays. (5) Will the Government - consider extending assistance to Australian orchardists similar to that enjoyed by the New Zealand orchardists.",98
185,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honis ourable member's question is as follows: Information on the price of chemical spray materials in New Zealand is ""not readily available of in Australia. An inquiry' Is being made in New Zealand and I will be able to answer ihis question of norwhen Ihe information is received. Victorian Railways (Quesdon No. 1974) Carpet Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: On what dates has he (a) received' letters from the Premier of Vic- toria; and (b) written letters to himabout the acquisition of the Victorian Railways by the Commonwealth. Mr Gorton-Tb e answer to the honourable member's question is: . . (a) 2nd September 1970 (b) an acknowledgement was sent on ISth September 1970. Iron , Steel and Zinc: Exports to Mainland (Question No. 1975)",98

188,Mr ANTHONY,COMPARISON BY,"The answer provided by my predecessor (Sir John MCEwen) to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Chairman referred to the Tariff Board's support for the Monash project in an address he gave to the Royal Institute of Public Administration in Canberra on 23rd April 1970. (2) No. Supporting the Monash project means supplying estimates of the average rales of protection afforded Australian manufacturing industries and assisting in the up-dating of input-output data compiled for 1962-63. Estimates of the average rates of protection for industries are based on the Customs Tariff and data available from ihe Statistician; and Ihe up-dating of input-output data also is based on information compiled by ihe Statistician. (3) Yes. The Tariff Board has always taken great care, and will continue to do so in the future, to ensure that confidential information it receives does not pass to outside bodies. It will continue the practice of aggregating confidential data from individual firms into a non-confidential form, before publication or release. (Question No. 1994)",100
189,Mr CALWELL,COMPARISON BY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Does Ihe Government intend to implement recommendations Nos 1 to 8 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution; if so, when. (2) Has his attention been drawn to recent happenings in (a) Tokyo and New York, when ihe health and properly of cilizens were greatly damaged because of air pollution and (b) the United States, where the smog spread in a 1,000-mile belt across the country; if so, has the possibility of similar occurrences in Australia in future been considered by the Government and, if i l has, with what result. (3) Will the Government promote an understanding of ecologism in Australia so that all Australians can be taught to live in harmony and balance with nature and not continue to destroy the natural ecology that gives us life. (4) How many copies of the Senate Select Committee's report were printed. (5) Is it a fact that no copies are now available to the public. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has made no decision yet on the recommendations of Ihe Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution. Air pollution is only one facet of the problems of the total environment and departments with an active interest in environmental problems are studying the reports of the Parliamentary Select Committees on Air Pollution, Water Pollution and Aircraft Noise, with a view to preparing recommendations to the Government. (2) While my attention has been drawn to the recent occurrences of high levels of air pollution in Tokyo and New York, the Government has not specifically considered these particular events. I would point out to die honourable member that the legislative and administrative provisions for air quality control rest at present wilh the individual Slates. (3) The interrelationships between atmospheric pollution and ecological balance are complex and incompletely understood at the present time. Promolion of public understanding of these matters will call for educational programmes that would largely be the responsibility of State Governments to conduct. (4) 3,330. (5) I am informed that demand for the report has necessitated 3 separate printings and that copies of the third print were dispatched from Ihe Government Printer to the Australian Government Publishing Service Bookshops on 29th September 1970 and lhat copies were available for public purchase at the time of the honourable member's question.

190,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPARISON BY,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: 1 feel it necessary to preface my answers to these questions by reminding the honourable member that the Commonwealth provided the capital moneys for war service land settlement only in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. In the other three States the Commonwealth shared los - es equally and also provided finance for living allowances and the remission of certain charges during the year immediately following rhe allotment of holdings. The answers to '.he questions asked by the honourable member are: (0Special advances made to accelerate scheme lo New South Wales and Victoria Acquisition development of land Advances to settlers .. Administration costs of Stale authorities delegated to handle advances to settlers . - Operation and Maintenance Loxton headworks .. .. Living allowances lo settlers Caretaking and maintenance of vacant holdings .. Special concessions to settlers on King Island .. .. Remissions of rent and interest (a) .. Losses on advances to settlers (a) Excess of cost over valuations of hold ings (a) .. (a) These sums were paid to Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria as the Commonwealth's share of costs in ihose Stales. Similar costs iri the other to: Remissions of rent and interest Losses on advances Excess of cost over valuations .. were remitted or written off by the Commonwealth. (2) Nine thousand one hundred and forty-eight farms were provided and allotted to ex-servicemen. Due to surrenders of leases for various reasons and re-allotment lo olbet qualified ex-servicemen, $9,777. the number who were settled on farms would be higher lhan this figure, although statistics have been maintained to show the' exact number of specifically ex-servicemen who have been assisted by the Scheme.

However the number of commercial egg producing 3.411 farms recorded in accordance with .. 7,774 information supplied by owners of hens at approximately the mid point of 174 the 1969-70 season, is set out on page 3 of my Annual Report on the .. 429 operation of the Poultry Industry 1,327 Assistance Act for the year ended 30th . 1.336 June 1970.

The Boards publicise the provisions of the legislation in industry journals and, where necessary, by circular letters to producers. Marine Industry (Question Nn. 2005) Mr Keogh asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Do statistics reveal that the Australian marine industry is now an important secondary industry providing employment for many persons in both skilled nnd semi-skilled trades. (2) Is he able to say whether week-end boating activities and professional fishing requirements are seriously affected by the lack of Commonwealth finance lo the various Slates to provide marine facilities for boat owners. (3) ls he able to say whether the New Zealand Government allows a rebate of 15 cents pei' gallon on petrol used for any type of marine activity. (4) If so. will he give consideration to an alteration of present Government policy so as to make a percentage of the petrol tax available to the Stales for use in the development of suitable marine facilities. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware thai there are various important industries, large and small, that collectively could be regarded as comprising ihe Australian marine industry. (2) I. do not wish to comment on the adequacy of marine facilities provided by the States. The Slates have available substantial funds, including assistance provided by the Commonwealth, which they may use for any purpose, including Ihe provision of marine facilities. (3) It is understood that a rebate of 14.8 cents per gallon is allowed by the New Zealand Government on motor spirit used by marine vessels engaged in other than commercial activities. For commercial vessels the total duly of 18.1 cents per gallon is rebated. (4) This is a matter of policy. However, as a general rule, the Government does not consider ii appropriate for there to be a link between the proceeds of a tax and expenditure on a particular fype of activity or facility. Since 1959 there has been no relationship between petrol lax proceeds and Commonwealth road grams io the Stales. TABLE 1.

(6) Is he able to supply figures similar lo those requested in question (5) for the main public libraries in each of Ihe Slates. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: While it would noi be appropriate for me to reply on behalf of Slate and local government authorities, who are responsible for Iheir respective State and municipal public libraries, the Acting Commonwealth Statistician has provided such information as is available on public libraries in the Commonwealth Territories. (I) The figures in Table 1 refer mainly lo Commonwealth expenditure on the National Library of Australia which conducts the Canberra public library service and assists with the provision of .similar services in other Commonwealth Territories.

(2) If so, is the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission one of the organisations which he had in mind when he made the statement. (3) Is it contrary to the best interests of Australia for the Commission to grant wage increases that are related to increased prices but unrelated to productivity. (4) What has the Government done to measure and record productivity trends in Australia. . Mr Gorton-The answer lo the honourable member's question is as follows: : (l).Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Details of the number of books available and the rate of borrowing per head ""of population in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory public libraries are shown in the following table.

When wages increase faster than productivity the effect is to increase prices rather than real wages and this is not .in the best interests of Australia. (4) Estimates of national productivity (i.e. gross national product at constant prices per person at work) are prepared by the Treasury ou the basis of national accounts, labour force and census data published by the Commonwealth Statistician and are presented by Commonwealth Counsel to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the course of hearings in national wage cases.

192,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the statement made on 1st Oclober 1970 by the Minister for Labour and National Service that the Government had made no provision-.for. *a. contemporaneous measurement of productivity in Australia and that it is impossible to devise one. (3) Did be, at the 1970 New South Wales Liberal Parly Conference say that wage increases cannot be thoroughly justified as really valid and essential without paying regard to productivity increase. (3) If there are no measurements available of productivity in Australia, how is it. possible for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to comply with his dictum. ..... Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) In his statement la Parliament during the debate on the Appropriation Bill on 1st Oclober the Minister for Labour and National Service was referring to the difficulties of breaking up national productivity trends into their constituent industry elements. This is because of problems of consistency and comparability between the data used to estimate output and titose used to estimate labour input. The Minister was also referring to the fact that productivity movements can only be measured in retrospect. However, these difficulties are not gready relevant when considering overall economic capacity for national wage purposes. (2) Yes. (3) See the answer to part 4 of Question No. 2011.

(2) What steps have since been taken to achieve greater localisation of any of the professions in the Territory.",104
197,Mr BARNES,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The document referred to ls an internal working paper prepared by the Manpower Planning Unit of the Territory Department of Labour in August 1970, on the demand for and supply of professional manpower during ihe period 197119S0. ft is as yet only in draft form nnd does not necessarily represent the assessments or views of the Administration, lt was sent on a confidential basis, to the major Administration Departments and statutory authorities, Commonwealth Departments in the Territory, the University of Papua and New Guinea and the Institute of Technology, with the object of obtaining their views on the validity of the assumptions underlying the projections and of the techniques employed. The findings in the document are at this stage only tentative and are subject to further evaluation. (2) The Government is giving high priority to accelerating the pace of localisation in all areas of employment in the Territory. The Government will re-examine the present planned levels of intakes into tertiary and vocational training institutions in the Territory in the light of the reports of its manpower advisers, and a manpower expert at present making an investigation in the Territory under the United Nations Development Programme.

(2) What amends have been made to the prisoner assaulted in police custody near Rabaul (Hansard. 2nd September 1970, page 834, and 17th September 1970, page 1262).",106
201,Mr BARNES,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No criminal prosecution or disciplinary proceedings have been taken against any police oflicer in connection with the case of Mr Tabarang Marum and his subsequent transfer to Finschliafen for Ihe sittings of the Supreme Court under the mistaken impression that he was a man committed for trial before that Court Mr Tambaraji Qwnte. An inquiry was nndertaken and its conclusions were given independent consideration. Whilst this inquiry revealed the necessity of tightening certain procedures to prevent cases of mistaken identity arising in the future il concluded that no one person could be held sufficiently culpable for the somewhat unsual events which occurred so as lo be deserving of prosecution or disciplinary proceedings. Mr Tabarang Marum was admitted to hospital under the name of 'Tambaran'. Mr Tambaran. Qwatc, the person committed for trial, was also admitted to hospital, under the name of 'Tombalar Narai'. A telegram requested the police at Lae to arrange Ihe movement of 'Tambaran' for the Supreme Court sittings. The police at Lae had no prior information as io ihe matter. When the police sergeant inquired at the Lae Hospital the superintendent, who knew the identity of the person to be transferred to Finschliafen, was absent. The oflicial at the hospital brought to the police sergeant Mr Tabarang Marum. who was Ihe only person admitted to the hospital under the name of 'Tambaran'. Mr Tabarang Marum did not ask why he was being taken to Finschhafen. The warrant of commitment was sent by post and its delayed urrival contributed to the confusion which arose. corresponding kinds of work in Australia, plus a Territory allowance. Salaries and allowances paid to expatriate and indigenous employees as at 27th October 1970 were: Salaries Allowances Highest Lowest Average Highest Lowest Average 5,515 1,125 3,320 3,348 2,155 2,752 1,482 338 394 Nil Nil Nil 6,665 1,070 3,867 4,305 2,744 3,774 Copra Marketing Board are unskilled, e.g., labourers.) The Departmental Head. Department of Law. is Against Police taking action with respeci to procedures relating lo warrants of commitment. (2) As slated in the Prime Minister's answer to the honourable member's question without notice relating to ihis matter (Hansard. 17th September 1970, page 1262). the allegations of assault upon ihe prisoner whilst in police custody have not been proved. No compensation has been offered to the prisoner in respect of the alleged assault and no claim has been made by him or on his behalf. Industrial Agreement (Question No. 2031) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, Upon notice: (1) Has the industrial agreement known as the Melbourne Building Industry Agreement as varied from lime to time operated in Victoria since 1956. (2) Is il a fact that Commissioner Chambers, as lie then was in 1956 refused to register the agreement because il contained provision for overaward payments and thai, as a consequence, the agreement as varied, has remained unregistered and probably unenforceable ever since thai date. Mr .Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The industrial agreement known as the Melbourne Building Industry Agreement lo which the honourable member has referred became operative for the first lime on 1st January 1957, for a period of twelve months. The signatories to this Agreement were, '.he Master Builders Association of Victoria, Ma-tcr Plumbers Association of Victoria, Building and Allied Trades Association, Terraz/.o and Paving Association of Victoria, Viclorian Trades Hall Council, Australian Builders Labourers Federation, Building Workers' Industrial Union, Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union. Victorian Operative Bricklayers Society, Victorian Plasterers Society. The Agreement has been re-negolialed for varying periods since that date. (2) In November 1955 Commissioner Chambers refused to certify a Memorandum of Agreement designated Ihe Melbou ine Building Industry Agreement, under section 37 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. 1904-1.955. Certification was sought by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners who were a parly to the 1955 Memorandum of Agreement. Mr Chambers' refusal as recorded in transcript contained ihe following reasons: When ihis agreement was presented J made it very clear that 1 could have no objection to the parties reaching agi'eement to pay above award rates. The real difficulty .is created when of the parlies lo an industrial dispute seek to have ihose over-award payments confirmed as award minima. 'From the copy of Ihe agreement supplied by the Master Builders' Association of Victoria, it is clear that the appropriate Tribunal is expected to consent to making the agreement an award provision before it becom;s operative and. no doubt, :his is directly influenced by the terms of contract which, in most it not all cases,, require such approval before additional wage costs can be recovered. 'Apart from any otber factor, it cannot be overlooked lhat the present proceedings for an award affect many different classes of employers in three States (Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia), such as other master builders, joiner establishments, mixed industries generally and Slate and Fedcrai Governmental instrumentalities. 'Whilst i l is claimed that this agreement between Melbourne and metropolitan master builders and the Union is without piejudice, il cannot be assumed to be without prejudice for very long.' The Agreement has remained unreaivered since that date and therefore does not have the status of an Award of ihe Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Industrial Informution Bulletin (Question No. 2033) Mr Clyde Cameron asked thi'; Minister for' Labour ancl National Service, upon notice: (1) What was the backlog in publishing the Industrial Information Bulletin on 21st May 1970 when, in reply to question No. 810 (Hansard pages 2619-20) he stated that action had been taken to reduce (he delays that can occur al each stage of preparation and printing.

Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 21st May 1970 the issue of the Industrial Information Bulletin covering the month of January 1970 was being printed. (2) On 12th October 1970 the issue covering the month of June was in preparation for the printer.

Workers Compensation (Question Nn. 2034)",106
202,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"the Minister for Labour ancl National Service, upon notice: (1) Is there any advantage in the Commonwealth and Ihe States conforming to a uniform pattern for recording the (a) period of incapacity, (b) cost of claims, (c) incidence of injuries, (d) location of injuries, (e) cause of injuries, (f) hour and day of injuries and (g) working hours prior to injuries due Io industrial accident or disease, as an essential first slep towards prevention of industrial injury. (2) Are these statistics available in respeci of (a) Commonwealth employees and (b) other employees in Territories of the Commonwealth. (3) What action has he taken to secure a uniform pattern for recording statistics concerning industrial injuries. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) to (g). The practical use of statistics lo prevent accidents 'ms most value when related to a particular indu-lrial activity or jnderlaking. National figures have an indirect advantage in providing information on overall patterns and trends. (2) (a). Statistics are available, for die calegories I (a). 1 (c), 1 (d) and 1 (e) above. (b) Accident statistics are being compiled for non-Commonwealth employees in the Australian Capital Territory. (3) Steps towards a uniform standard of leporling were first laken in 1958 with the adoption of a minimum standard by those Stales which were producing statistics for the'first time. This standard is now used by the majority of stales and for Commonwealth employment. Progress is kept under review by ihe Commonwealth and Slate Departments of Labour and by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. Tariff (Question No. 20361 Mr Clyde Cameron askecl the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn io the reference in the Tariff Board's annual' report wherein attention is drawn lo the large gap between wage increases and productivity gains in most countries wilh ihe exception of Japan and Germany and the view is expressed thut the latter countries' success in closing this gap will be an important determinant of the competitive position of each couniry in world trade in manufactures. (2) Has his attention also been directed lo the statement of ihe Board thai the main countries supplying Australia's imports experienced larger increases in wages than that which has occurred in Australia during the past 2 years. (3) Does his attitude coincide with the view expressed in the report and ihe conclusion reached by the Board in relation to wage and productivity trends in Australia vis-a-vis those operating in Japan and Germany. (4) Is there any advantage in closing ihe gap bcluccn wage and productivity trends in Australia. (5) If so, how can ihe Conciliation and Arbitration Commission close the gap without having statistics lhat accurately measure and record productivity trends in Australia. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)-(4) Yes. (5) I suggest that the honourable member refer to ihe answers to 2 of his earlier questions on notice-Nos . 2011 (pan 4) and 2012 (part 1). Pastoral Industry (Question No. 2037)",107
203,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Did the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recently refuse to award a 40-hour week to station hands employed under the Pastoral Award on the ground, inter alia, that there was no evidence of any serious unrest among station hands. (2) Did Mr Justice Gallagher recently grant a 35-hour week to coal miners on the ground, inter alia, thai failure to accede to the union's demand would lead to industrial unrest. (3) If so, should evidence or lack of evidence of industrial unrest be taken into account when the Commission is determining union claims for improved wages and conditions of employment. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The application of the Australian Workers' Union to vary the hours of work provisions relating to station hands in the Pastoral Industry Award 1965 was dismissed following a lengthy hearing during which the union had opportunity to fully present its case. In their reasons for judgment the members of the full bench stated that the merits of the claim were ventilated before then extensively. Their Honours concluded, inter alia, that 'all in all it our view that present circumstances do not justify granting the union claim'. In dealing specifically with the position of station hands who live on properties, the judgment referred to the custom of providing accommodation, meat and some amenities free or at nominal cost and observed thai-'It may be thought that this, combined with ihe hours of work is a somewhat feudal approach to employment, but on the preponderance of the evidence we do not find there is any serious unrest among station hands and we are satisfied they regard it as a benefit to live on the properties'. In any assessment of the ground upon which the application was dismissed, I suggest thai it would be incorrect to take any of lire words used out of their context. (2) The decision of the Tribunal does not indicate that the prospect of industrial unrest was a ground upon which Mr Justice Gallagher granted a 35-hour week to coal miners. It is noteworthy that in his decision, Mr Justice Gallagher said that the Tribunal instituted the proceedings 'on its own motion when it became apparent that direct action in the form of strikes and threats of strikes rather than resort to arbitration was being used as the method for obtaining reduced ordinary hours for mine workers'. (3) I would refer the honourable member to sections 39 and 40(1) (a), (b) and (c) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Pastoral Industry (Question No. 2038)",108
204,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Does the International Labour Organisation's Convention No. 47 provide that a country ratifying lhat Convention shall declare its approval of the principle of the 40-hour week. (2) If so, does the Commonwealth approve of that principle. (3) Does the Commonwealth propose tc ratify this Convention. (4) If so, will the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission be asked to reconsider its recent rejection of the 40-hour week for station hands employed under the Federal Pastoral Award. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) ILO Convention No. 47-Forly-hou r Week, 1935, provides, inter alia: 'Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention declares its approval of(a) the principle of a 40-hour week applied in such a manner that the standard of living is not reduced in consequence.' (2) and (3) The Convention was ratified on 22 October 1970 by Australia which became only the fifth of the ILO's 121 member countries to do so. (4) Discussions with the International Labour Office indicated that Australia could ratify the Convention on the basis of its existing law and practice. Ratification does not impose an obligais tion to apply the 40-hour week immediately to all workers, including such groups as rural workers. As I have indicated, only 5 countries have ratified this Convention even though it is worded very flexibly. This illustrates that there are relatively few countries with a standard working week of 40 hours. (Question No. 2039) Mr Clyde Cameron asked ihe Minister for Labour and National Service, notice: Is he able to stale what has been the average weekly overtime worked by each Australian employee, who works overtime, in each industry group in each of the last 3 years.

206,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OF POPULATION IN COMMONWEALTH TERRITORIES,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Does the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission still adhere to the doctrine of comparable wage justice when determining wage claims. (2) If not, what is the doctrine which currently guides the Commission in wage fixation. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In determining wage claims the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission considers all relevant factors placed before it by the parties and interveners, if any. Comparative wage justice, if relevant, is one of the factors. Other factors taken into account by the Commission aTe referred to in the Commis10953/71-R-[4 ] Overtime Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Comprehensive statistics are not available of overtime worked by each employee in Australia. upon However, my Department collects data on overtime worked during a selected week each month by employees in a sample of some 2,600 larger private factories throughout Australia, employing in total over 550.000 persons.

Their aggregate purchases, however, represented only a small percentage of the total wool sold at auction. Figures for 1969-70 are not yet available. Australian and foreign-owned wool buying houses routinely purchase wool for clients in more than one country. Information on whose behalf they are operating is treated as confidential by these firms.

This report was publicly released in May this year under the title 'Report on Industry Location Survey'. The forward estimates part of the New South Wales study on comparative costs of providing public services in various locations has been completed. The New South Wales Department of Decentralisation and Development has advised, however, that the report on the study on public costs, which was carried out under its auspices, will be confined to the forward estimates part of the study since, as a result of technical difficulties, the Department has found that few valid conclusions could be drawn from the historical costs part which was completed some time ago. The study of the estimated cost of water in the Greater Sydney region to the year 2001 has been completed. Detailed work has continued on the Victorian Study on comparative (historical) costs of providing public services in various locations and on. the traflic congestion costs study.

Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) As indicated in - answers to recent questions on notice dealing with the availability of estimates of productivity in Australia-in particular, questions Nos 524 (Hansard, Sth May 1970, page 1644), 1821 (Hansard, 27th October 1970, page 2830) and 2028 (Hansard, 30th October 1970, page 3168), asked of the Treasurer-ther e are no regularly published official estimates of labour productivity. Some of these answers have indicated the Statistician's intention to examine during 1971 the desirability of compiling and publishing measures of change in product per unit of labour force despite their significant conceptual limitations. This examination will consider measures at the level of major industries, groups of industries, and gross national product. Arbitration (Question No. 2120)",112
221,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,WORKING OVERTIME,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Did he tell a Committee for Economic Development of Australia audience on 8th October 1970 that if would not be relevant for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award wage . increases in a particular industry on the basis of trends in productivity or profitability in that industry. (2) Is it a fact that at.that ume the Commission had not given its decision on the Australian Council of Trade Unions' oil industry case in which a claim for increased wages was based upon profitability. (3) Will he now give an assurance that he will not in future make pubHc statements on issues that are before the Commission or awaiting decisio. Mr Sneddert-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) In an address I gave on Sth October 1970 to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. I reiterated the essence of a submission about the relevance to wage increases of productivity or profitability in an industry which had already been made by the Commonwealth before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission during the hearing of the Oil Industry Case. (Question No. 2121)",112
222,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,WORKING OVERTIME,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: How many different definitions has the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission given to the term public interest on the various occasions when such term was at issue. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the honourable member to my answer to his Question No. 379. (See Hansard of 22nd April 1970.) I have nothing to add to that answer. (Question No. 2125) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether the Bolsa Island dual purpose nuclear power plant was 'ejected by the Californian participants because the charge for water had increased from 22c lo -37c per 1,000 gallons. (2) Is it a fact that in South Australia the cost of water per 1,000 gallons is 44c in Adelaide, 92c in Whyalla. $1.30 in Port Augusta, $1.45 in Port Pirie and $1.92 in Eyre Peninsula. (3) If so, in view of these relatively will he initiate a detailed investigation with the object of establishing a dual purpose nuclear power plant in South Australia, instead of proceeding with the costly Jervis Bay project, which appears to be uneconomic in terms of the cost power.",113
223,Mr SWARTZ,WORKING OVERTIME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Consideration was given to the construction of a dual purpose nuclear power/desalination plant at Bolsa Island, United States of America, but ihe project was abandoned because of poor economics, l t was estimated that the cost of water from the proposed plant would be in the range of 91c per 1,000 gallons for a 50 million gallons per day plant down to 56c per 1,000 gallons for a plant producing 150 million gallons per day. (2) I cannot confirm Uie figures stated by the honourable member but to my general knowledge I would say that they appear to be of the right order. (3) No. There would appear little advantage in considering the installation of a duplex plant of the type proposed until the construction of such plants has been shown to be feasible by those countries with advanced nuclear power programmes. Containerisation (Question No. 2129) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister for Arbitration Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) What (a) imports and (b) exports were carried by container ships in 1969-70. (2) What percentage of non-bulk (a) imports and (b) exports did this represent. (3) Has the Government carried oui any cost/benefit analysis since the introduction of container ships; if so, what was the result of this survey, and how does it compare with overseas results. (4) If such a survey has not been undertaken, is one under consideration; if not, why cot.",113
224,Mr ANTHONY,WORKING OVERTIME,"The answer provided by my predecessor (Sir John MCEwen) to the honourable member's question is as follows: With respect to questions (1) and (2), in 196970 container vessels were periodically being Nuclear power phased into both ihe Australia to United Kingdom-Europe and the Australia to Japan trades. They are not yet operative in any other overseas trade. Information is not yet available as to the precise quantities of cargoes carried by container vessels in that year. However, operators anticipate that as their container services become more established a larger percentage of cargoes within the trades concerned will be carried in container ships. As to quesdons (3) and (4) the Government, of course, maintains a detailed scrutiny of its own container and vehicle deck ship operations. Consequently, in broad terms it is informed on operational costs and the benefits connected with these high costs, new type services. I made a statement in the House on 19th October in which I expressed my belief that the expected benefits and economies of container shipping would in fact be realised. I believe the Government's views are adequately set out in that statement. Australian National Line (Question No. 2130)",113
225,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,WORKING OVERTIME,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is if. a fact that the Australian National Line had negotiated an industrial agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation concerning work at roll-on, roll-off shipping terminals in which the parties had agreed to what virtually amounted to a 35-hour week. (2) Is it a fact lhat, as a consequence of his intervention, the Government has taken action to prevent the agreement from being signed or ratified. (3) Is it also a fact thai 3 of the icli-on, rolloff terminals built by the ANL are idle because of industrial disputes and that the . Government's interference in the affairs of the ANL is causing deep concern to senior officials of the ANL.

This document had been sent to the Public Service Board by the Council on 25lh March 1970 and discussed at a meeting between the Board and die Council on Ist April 1970. I have been advised by the Board that the meeting concluded with the deputation from the Council undertaking to provide for the Board's consideration additional material on certain aspects relating to regulation 34 (b). Although that material has yet to be received, the Board bas advised me that it is continuing its examination of those aspects of the Council's submission which relate lo Ihe Public Service Regulations. The Council's submission raised questions about the availability of information in particular areas and 1I have asked for a report on tbese questions as well as on the rest of the Council's submission. 1I have been advised that all the information necessary for this report has not as yel been collected, but as soon as I have the .esults of these inquiries and advice from the Public Service Board on the results of its examination, I will consider the question of receiving a deputation from the Council. Once a decision has been Organisations reached the Council will be informed. (Question No 2171) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Was ihe Australian Atomic Energy Commission established in 1953 becaues of (a) the increasing demand for industrial and domestic power, (b) Australia's then limited resources and (c) the contention that nuclear power could provide a significant economic advantage over conventional power. (2) Is it a fact lhat oil and coal deposits discovered since 1953 have extended ihe guaranteed - projected industrial energy supply by at least 100 years, while the economic promises of nuclear power havs not eventuated. (3) If so. do these factors make the proposed Jervis Bay project premature.",119
231,Mr SWARTZ,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) The Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1953 to carry out the functions prescribed in the Atomic Energy Act. In brief these are: (a) lo promote the search for and mining and treatment of uranium in Australia, with power lo buy and sell uranium on behalf of the Commonwealth. (b) to develop the practical uses of atomic energy by carrying out and assisting research, constructing plant and equipment and employing and training staff. (c) to collect and distribute information relating to uranium and atomic energy. Neither the Act nor the Second Reading Speech associated with it contain the reasons suggested by the honourable member for the establishment of the Commission. (2) Discoveries in Australia of oil and coal deposits since 1953 have certainly extended the guaranteed projected industrial energy supplyalthough 1 would not hazard a guess on the number of years of such an extension. Promises of nuclear power have in fact eventuated and nuclear power is at present making a major contribution to the energy needs of highly industrialised areas such as the United Slates, Europe and Japan. (3) No. As has been stated on other occasions the Conimonwealth'3 interest in nuclear matters and the proposed Jervis Bay project is based on ihe following reasons: (a) To enable Commonwealth and State Departments and Authorities involved to gain experience in ordering, constructing, commissioning and operating a nucicar power station. (b) To assist in establishing a nuclear industrial! potential in Australia by encouraging Australian industry to develop the new skills and techniques to the exacting standards required in nuclear installations; and (c) To put us in a better position to adopt fast breeders rapidly when they become commercially available. Atomic Energy Atomic Energy (Question No. 2172) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) is it a fact that the cost j f electricity produced by coal fired stations has not increased since 1953, despite a 43 per cent increase in the cost of living since that time (2) What was the average cost per kilo-watt hour of electricity in (a) 1953 and (b) 1969. (3) Do these figures illustrate the efficiency of State electricity authorities. (4) If so, why is the Commonwealth entering this field of power production which is the responsibility of the Slate Governments. (5) Is it a fact that two-thirds of the cost of nuclear power arises from fixed charges such as capital cost and interest. (6) Do the costs of these factors move commensurulely with rising costs. (7) If so, how can the price of nuclear power become competitive with conventional power which has been shown to have remained constant since 1953.",129
232,Mr SWARTZ,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (1) and (2) The actual cost of production of electricity from all Australian coal fired power stations is not available in any published form. The best information I can give the honourable member relates to the average selling prices per unit of electricity. These average selling prices to a great extent reflect variations in cost of production at power stations; in addition however they include costs of transmission and reticulation and the running costs of the electricity instrumentalities. As has been noted by the honourable member the average cost per unit of electricity to consumers has been remarkably stable as shown by the following table: Year ending Consump- Average 30th June Revenue tion selling price $ million million cents/kWh kWh 1953.. n.a. 8,835 n.a. 1954.. 192 10,095 1.90 1955.. 213 11,248 1.89 1956.. 234 12,450 1.88 1957.. 268 13,845 1.93 1958.. 293 15,048 1.95 1959.. 317 16,058 1.98 i960.. 347 17,640 1.97 1961 378 19,108 1.98 1962.. 407 20,237 2.01 1963.. 442 22,589 1.96 1964.. 481 25,200 1.91 1965.. 520 27,916 1.86 1966.. 561 30,078 1.86 1967.. 608 32,754 1.86 1968.. 661 34,828 1.90 1969.. 732 38,225 1,91 1970.. n.a. n.a. n.a. (3) 1 believe lhat such stability of average selling prices in the face of rising general costs could not have been achieved except in circumstances where Ihe responsible authorities were highly efficient. Without detracting from this statement however I think it necessary to point out three factors which tend to lower electricity charges. These factors are common to electricity systems undergoing major expansion in many other parts of the world. The factors are: (a) economies of scale accrue from the use of larger generating units in respect of capital cost, efficiency and use of the heat content of fuel and operation and maintenance costs. The maximum size of the generator unit is related to the size of the system and therefore in a growing system costs should improve provided the expansion rate is sufficiently high to counteract inflation. (b) Usage of electricity per consumer is increasing. However revenue tends to increase at a greater rate than expenditure as the cost of reticulation systems and overhead costs remain relatively stable despite a greater throughput of electricity. I might add that the statistics quoted above conceal the fact that most electricity tariff schedules have risen; but as a significant part of the total sales is made under tariffs which have a sliding scale according to the quantity used the average selling price does not increase as much as increases in the rales in the tariff schedules. (c) Technological advances have besn made in the design of plant and in high voltage transmission. The first has resulted in cheaper and/or more efficient plant additional to those benefits arising from increased size; the second has permitted the location of stations adjacent to coal fields and has reduced fuel costs. (4) It is acknowledged that power production is primarily (he responsibility of State Governments. In special circumstances however where major national interests are involved, such as the Snowy Scheme and the proposed Jervis Bay pioject, the entry of the Commonwealth into this field is warranted. (5) The capital and interest components of the total cost of production of electricity from a nuclear plant depends on the type of reactor involved. In the case of natural uranium fuelled reactors the component could exceed 2/3ids of the total cost. (6) In the long term capital and.interest costs move commensurate with other costs but in the short term labour .costs move much faster. Labour costs represent a fairly small component of generation costs in conventional stations and a smaller, component still in nuclear stations. (7) Conventional power stations in Australia's Eastern States are very advantageously placed fuel, jvater and proximity to load centres. Accordfrom ingly 1 think it will be some time before nuclear stations are competitive with conventional stations in this area. Such a competitive might well be reached in Australia befoie the endof the century. Nuclear power is already competiAustralia's tive in major industrial countries overseas which have passed through the stage of the favourable circumstances we at present enjoy. My reasons for this view are: (a) as shown above the rapidly increasing size of our electricity systems will enable the size of generation unite to increase: cost reductions with increasing size occur far more rapidly in nuclear units fhan in conventional units. (b) Conventional stations have been developing over a long period and the scope for further technological development is becoming limited: nuclear power is a relatively new field still possessing considerable room for further technological advances. (c) Some increases in the costs of coal into generating stations may be expected as less advantageously placed deposits have to be resorted to. Atomic Energy (Question No. 2173) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) Has Australia, since 1953, become increasingly aware that its natural water resources are limited and that within the next 30 years the south-east of the continent will face a severe water shortage. (2) Is it a fact that the population ot Australia in the last census was 12 million and by the year 2000 it will be approximately 23 million when the average water consumption per head of population will reach 150 gallons per day. (3) If so, should nuclear power installations be designed not only for electricity production but also for the production ofadditional fresh water. (4) Are there any reasons why it would not be better to invest in an experimental dual purpose reactor for the desalination of water as well as the production of electricity instead of the Jervis Bay plant designed only for industrial and domestic power production.",129
233,Mr SWARTZ,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"The answer to thu honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware that concern in Australia regarding water resources can be related to any particular date. Nor have I seed'any authoritative evidence to indicate that there will he a severe water shortage in the south-east of Australia within the next 30 years. There is no doubt that increasing care will be required in the management of our resources but this is not the same thing as facing a severe shortage. (2) I would not think that any prediction of Australian population by the year 20QJ could be regarded as a fact, but the suggested figures seem reasonable. (3) On the basis of present estimales of costs for of water from nuclear desalination plants and conventional sources, .there does not appear to be any economic justification for use of such plants in Australia for desalination put poses in position however the immediate future. (4) There is little merit in die proposal for first nuclear power station to be a prototype nuclear power/desalination complex. No desalination plants bave yet been constructed anywhere, which would be of sufficient size to contribute to large-scale water needs. When desalination technology has developed overseas, the Government will Be anxious to ensure that advantage is taken in such technologies where appropriate. Overseas Investment in Australia (Question No. 2203) Mr Keogh asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Was his attention ever drawn to a press report of 14th October 1968 wherein the French Government, in a case where it had no power in law to prevent a share transaction, by an expression of disapproval effectively stopped a plan for the Fiat company of Italy to buy Micbeiin's controlled shares In Citroen and so preserved the independence of the French firm. (2) If so. will the Government act >'n a similar manner with the object of preventing any more takeovers of Australian companies by foreign companies and investors, whether they be British, American, Canadian or Japanese and thereby stop 'selling a bit of the farm each year to pay the rent', a remark made some years ago by the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have seen a copy of a press report of 14th October 1968 concerning an agieemcnt to keep the Citroen company of France under national control. (2) The Government's policy with regard to foreign takeovers of Australian companies was explained in the course of the statement 1 made in the Mouse on 16th September 1969 on overseas investment in Australia. In that statement 1 said that, whilst our general experience over the years has shown that almost all overseas investment in Australia accords with our country's interests, it has also shown that there remains a need for the Government io be ready lo guard against the transfer from Australian control of established companies in particular areas of activity. 1 went on to say that, although we expect the need to arise only on rare occasions, as a Government we reserve the right to do all in our power to prevent particular takeovers when, in the circumstances of the case, we would consider it to be bad in the national interest. The Government's policy continues to be as explained in the above mentioned statement. The honourable member will also be aware that to assist in retaining and expanding Australian ownership of industry and resources, the Government recently established the Australian Industry Development Corporation. Commonwealth Employment Service (Question No. 223S)",130
234,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"the Minister for Labour and National ' Service, upon noiice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an advertisement appearing in the Geelong Advertiser .of 3rd October 1970 under the name of NSK Manufacturing (Australia) Pty Ltd calling for applicadons to be forwarded to the Commonwealth Employment Office in Geelong for certain classes of tradesmen stipulating maximum age limits ranging from 30 years in the case of electricians to. SO years of age in the case of process workers. (2) Does the Government approve of the action of this employer in using a Government agency to recruit labour with such severe age limits. (3) Did the Commonwealth Employment Office pay for the cost of the advertisement.. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The advertisement, indicated that for some trades specified age groups were preferred. (2) The Commonwealth Employment Service consistently pursues a policy of advising employers that ability and capacity to do the job should be a prime consideration in selection, and that only in exceptional circumstances or where the individual's welfare is affected should age be a factor. The Commonwealth Employment Service therefore brings to the attention of employers seeking to engage labour the most.suitable of the persons seeking its assistance to obtain employ-, ment irrespective of any age limits that may be specified, but with due regard to-the duties of the position to be filled. When an advertisement is. placed and paid for by an employer, as was the"" case on (his occasion, responsibility for its content rests with the employer who has the right of decision as to who shall be engaged. The Commonwealth Employment Service, irrespective of any age preferences indicated, will refer to employers persons beyond those age limits if it is satisfied that they are capable of performing tha' duties, required. It did so in this instance. (3) Nn. Commonwealth Conciliation and 1 Arbitration Commission (Question No. 2237)",131
235,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"the Minister for L a b o u r ' and National Service, upon noiice: (1) Is there a constitutional requirement which specifies that a Presidential member of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall be a life appointed Judge. (2) If not, and in view of his public statement that the Commission must take responsibility for the economic consequences of its decisions, and"" that wage increases should not exceed increased productivity, will he state why he has opposed the proposition to take the steps necessary to appoint an economist as a Presidential member of the Commission. (3) In view of the Prime Ministers reply to question No. 1532 (Hansard, 13th October 1970, page 2065), justifying the fixed-term appointment of Commonwealth statutory officers sucb as the Public Service Arbitrator, the Commissioner and Second Commissioner of Taxation and the Chair-' man of the Tariff Board, will he state why (a) Presidential members of the Commission must be appointed for life and (b) Commissioners and Conciliators must be appointed until fhey reach 65 years of age. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourcontinues able member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) This proposal has been considered on several occasions, but the Government has not seen fit to adopt it. (3) The Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that, subject to the power of removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity which applies to Commissioners and Conciliators as well as presidential members of the Commission: (i) a presidential member he resigns or attains the age of seventy years; or in the case of such a member who is a Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, until he resigns or dies; (ii) a Commissioner or a Conciliator shall hold office until he attains the age of 65 years. (Question No. 2238)",131
236,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXTERN AL INSTITUTIO NS,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon ing notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Commonwealth ation and Arbitration Commission has frequently fixed wage rales that were below the (a) market rate or (b) premium rate. (2) If so, what reasons can be advanced for use of the penal provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to prevent the labour from resorting to strike action as a means of securing market or premium rales for their labour. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honwas ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission fixes minimum wage rates in its awards, (2) My predecessors and 1I have many times indicated the Government's view that the so-called 'penal clauses' of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should only be used as a' last resort when all notice: other reasonable steps have been taken to resolve disputes. Tbis policy is reflected in the amendments made to the Act in June of this year. They provide, inter alia, for the processes of conciliation and, needs be, arbitration, to be availed of before the so-called 'penal clause', section 119, can invoked. Moreover, a' presidendal Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission must have issued a certificate before been action can be taken under that section to have the Commonwealth Industrial Court impose a penalty because of an award breach by a union. And before it can be held that there is such a breach by a union because of its part in a strike the Commission constituted by a presidential member must first have been satisfied that a so-called 'bans clause' should be inserted in the award. It will be seen from this that before the 'penal clause' of the Act can have been opportunity will have been given the parties to a dispute to settle their differences. If, despite that, the union resorts to direct industrial action or to resort to such acdon contrary to the award provision, therein lies the justification for the use of the sanctions provisions of ihe Act. Union not only have the right to seek to better the industrial lot of their members. They also have obligations to abide by the awards made to protect their members. Arbitration (Question No. 2240) Mr Clyde Cameron askect the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon shall hold office until notice: (1) What are the names of the 19 unsuccessful applicants for financial assistance under Conciliation and Arbitration Regulation 138 referred to in his reply to question No. 849 (Hansard, 3Ulh September 1970, page 1966). (2) Which of these applicants had been granted a rule nisi by a Judge of the Commonwealth IndusArbitration trial Court for the action at the date of his application for financial assistance. (3) What were the Registrar's reasons for refuseach of the 19 unsuccessful applications. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honConciliourable member's question is as follows: Upon inquiry I am informed: (1) In order to protect the interests of the persons concerned the Industrial Registrar has the adopted the practice of not divulging the names of unsuccessful applicants for financial assistance. sellers of I agree with this practice, (2) Six of the applicants. (3) In 13 of the applications no reasons were given for refusal. In the remaining 6 the refusal expressed to be the absence of reasonable ground for taking the proposed proceedings.

Mr Snedden-The answer to the honban or ourable member's question is as follows: Upon inquiry I am informed (1) Regulation 138 (then regulation 130A) was made in 1949 during the administration of the Chifley Labour Government. Sub-regulation (3) invoked every was added in 1956. (2) 217. (3) (a) 198. (b) 19. (Question No. 2241) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: What are the names of those persons who have received financial assistance in mum prescribed by Conciliation and Arbitration Regulation 138. Mr Snedden-The answer io the honourable member's question is as follows: Regulation 138 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations gives the Industrial Registrar or a Deputy Industrial Registrar a discretion to direct in certain circumstances that such financial assistance as he determines be given by the Commonwealth to a member of an organisation registered at his Registry in respect of proceedings that member proposes to take under section 140 or 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The regulation does not prescribe any minimum. South A f r i ca (Question No. 2244) D r Everingham asked Ihe Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an Australian Associated Press report of 14th October of a speech by the South African Prime Minister in which he claimed that he needed arms to withstand a planned Communist terrorist onslaught as well as to keep sea lanes open. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to the claim of a former South African naval gunner in the South Africa Defence and Aid Fund's Sydney Newsletter for October 1970 that an officer instructed him and others lhat their chief function was to oppose all Africa, except Rhodesia and Portuguese colonies, to prevent persons escaping and terrorist landing in southern Africa and lo act as marines to defend white civilisation in Africa in the case of a black uprising. (3) If his attention has been drawn >.o these reports, will he. in view of their importance, make a statement indicating the altitude of the Australian Government to the British policy of supplying naval arms to South Africa.",132

(2) How many such persons were employed for this purpose 5 years ago. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As expressed, the honourable member's question covers a wide field. For example, inquiries may be made of persons who make applications for social service benefits or in connection with the requirement that wireless and television receivers be licenced, and so on. l t would clearly involve very substantial time and expense to research and assemble the data on this basis and I suggest therefore that the honourable member might reconsider the terms of his question, in the meantime, I 'refer the honourable member to my answers lo Question No. 1101 which appeared on page 1961 of Hansard of 1st October 1970, and Question No. 62 which appeared on page 607 of Hansard of 27th August 1968.
