1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. TELSTRA (DILUTION OF PUBLIC OWNERSIDP) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 May, on motion by Mr Warwick Smith: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Latham moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the bill should be proceeded with, for the following reasons: (1) it represents the start of a process leading the full privatisation of Telstra; (2) it will lead to a loss of exports, and the bill also fails to establish an Australia-first purchasing policy for Telstra; (3) the remittance of profits overseas which will follow enactment will damage Australia's balance of payments; (4) it provides inadequate protection of universal service obligations and preservation of services in regional, rural and remote Australia; (5) the government's failure to bring outer metropolitan telephone zones into the capital city local call zones; (6) the government's failure to fulfil its mitment to establish an ISDN service throughout Australia plus establish A share categories to monitor foreign ship; (7) the failure to preserve ministerial directions and accountability to the parliament delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations; (8) there are much better ways of funding enviTelstra ronmental programs than selling Australia's major public asset; (9) it represents an ideological obsession ownership issues instead of focussing competitive features of the telecommunications market; (10) at a time of rapid technological change in telecommunications, the public sector should continue to hold a major strategic asset Telstra to avoid inequity of access and affordability on the so-termed 'information superhighway' ; (11) with the government's recent decision to review the 1997 telecommunications regulations it is inappropriate for the parliament to be considering the sale of Telstra"".",13
2,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"Since my speech on this Telstra bill was interrupted last night, I have had a night's sleep on the matter.",13
3,Mr FILING,Unknown,Changed your mind?,13
4,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"I have had a night to reflect on the matter. I say to the honourable member for Moore: rather than changing my mind, I am even more convinced of the folly of the a government in taking this line. Over the last two days since this legislation was introduced not government members have been busily feeding the government's justification for the to partial sale of Telstra. They have been placing their reasons for justifying the sale into the jobs, investment and Hansard record. I join with my other Labor colleagues in asking the members of the government whose electorates are currently receiving large crosssubsidies from Telstra, in line with Telstra's universal service obligations, to put aside their support for this legislation. Mr Kelvin Thomson-They are selling out their electorates.",13
5,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"Of course they are selling out their electorates. Let us just see how they are selling out their electorates. The electorate comof the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) and B receives a $4.5 million Telstra subsidy. The ownerelectorate of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) receives a $1.1 million Telstra subsidy. The electorate of the member for Paterson for the (Mr Bob Baldwin) receives a $1.1 million Telstra subsidy. The eleCtorate of the member for Page (Mr Causley) receives a $1.7 million subsidy. The electorate of the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) receives a $13.5 million Telstra subsidy. The electorate of the with Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Farrer on the (Mr Tim Fischer), receives a $5.8 million Telstra subsidy. Each of these members' electorates receives millions of dollars in Telstra subsidies which like are relative to the commitment by Telstra of universal service obligations. In supporting this partial sale of Telstra legislation, these members are placing their electorates in a position of immediate disadvantage. Mr Lieberman-Explain.",13
6,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"If you cannot understand how a cross-subsidy works and what you are getting out of it, I think you should go back, have a good look at it and talk to a few people about it. This is a point that we will pushing at the next election. Do you believe that a Telstra in private hands, in the hands of shareholders who are foreign investors, is going to care about providing cross-subsidies of $13.5 million or $4.5 million or $1 million? Do you believe that the additional words in the legislation 'efficiently and economically' will have a different meaning in government members' electorates? Surely these members realise that they are threatening the quality and price of basic telecommunication services to customers in their electorates. What particular bond of faith do all government members place on the foreign investors in London, Washington and New York on having special regard for the electors of Capricornia, Dawson, Northern Territory, Farrer, MCEwen, Gippsland, Page and Gilmore? What faith can they put in these foreign owners? Do they not know of the ruthless way shareholders, particularly those foreign share investors from London, Washington and New York, judge efficiency and economics? It is the bottom line on the account that counts at the end of the day. The more profit the better. The better the ability to minimise tax obligations the better. The lower the number of employees to worry about the better. These will be the efficient and economic ways private owners and foreign investors will judge the operations of Telstra. They will do away with the equity in the provision for all Australians of basic telecommunications services and develop a structure of information rich Australians as opposed to information poor Australians. There are no prizes for guessing who the mugs are going to be. Rural and regional Australians will suffer because of this partial sale and the downgrading of the commitment to making sure that all Australians are treated equally through the universal service obligations. We will seek to delete the words 'efficiently and economically' from this bill. They do not appear in the Telecommunications Act 1991 and they should not appear in this legislation. There is no place for them in such a diverse country with such scattered populabe tion centres in the bush, provincial centres and cities. The government is being too clever by half by including such words into this legislation. The hardheads in the government know the results of this phrase-Telstra, because of its shareholders and foreign investor influence, will be required to withdraw from the provision of cross-subsidies to rural and regional Australia. While the hardheads in the government know this absolutely, I am not so sure that other government members, of whom I have made mention previously, understand this point. I repeat: government members are putting their electorates on a collision course with efficiency and economics. By voting for this legislation, they will allow the investors in London and New York to gut telecommunications services from their electorates and the people. Significantly, the government, by this partial sale of Telstra, is also allowing Telstra-an Australian institution-to be gutted. Private investors will seek a sharp reduction in staffing levels. This view is supported by the privatisation of British Telecom. British Telecom's staff now stands at a little over 50 per cent of its 1984 levels. Staff reductions in New Zealand have halved since privatisation in 1990. I say to the many members on the government side who represent rural areas: you know as well as I do that Telstra provides an important source of employment to many of those provincial towns and cities, and staff reductions will have a serious impact on your electorates. Staff cuts will increase profitability in the shorter term, but in the longer term this comes at the expense of service quality. Telecom New Zealand reduced its staff by one-third between 1993 and 1995. Over that same period, the fault clearance rate-that is, faults cleared by 5 p.m. the following daywent from 95 per cent to only 58.3 per cent. At the same time, Telecom New Zealand was able to take advantage of New Zealand's anti-union legislation, the Employment Contracts Act, to erode working conditions with the company. Participants in a union survey conducted last year indicated that workers regularly worked more than 40 hours per week with no overtime payments. Obviously some tactics have been learnt by the government from its trans-Tasman talks. The government promised at the 2 March election to restore employment to Australians. Here the government has its first opportunity to give some substance to this promise, but what will it do instead? It will let Telstra take the hit into private ownership, and it will directly reduce jobs in Telstra. The overseas experience is very clear in this regard. Regrettably, if this were not worse, job losses are also set to come because of the withdrawal of the universal service obligation of Telstra. The small businesses, which the government never stopped mentioning during the election campaign, are going to face increased telephone costs, especially in rural and regional Australia. As the complaints start to stream into my office and the offices of my colleagues, we will be sure to tell the people why they have to pay more for basic telecommunications services. We will be pleased to tell them why the cost of calls made from public pay phones has increased dramatically. We will also tell them why they are now charged for seeking directory assistance. The privatisation of Telstra is going to mean increases in the annual cost of a telephone line in New South Wales of between $200 and $ 3,500; in Victoria, between $200 and $1,800; in Queensland, between $200 and $2,500; in South Australia, between $400 and $6,800; and in Western Australia, between $500 and $4,200. The standard line rental charge for residential customers at the moment is $139 per year. In the first eight years of privatisation in the United Kingdom, local call prices increased by 27 per cent and the cost of domestic household phone installation increased by more than 60 per cent. This experience was repeated in New Zealand. Don't be conned into believing what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said about timed local calls, because what we are talking about at the moment is timed local calls in a zone. What the Prime Minister has never said is what will happen if Telstra reduces those zones. For example, say you ring from Heathcote to anywhere in Sydney. What would happen if there were about five different zones there and the zone, as it is, would stay and the local timed calls would stay there but, instead of having one local time zone for the whole of, say, Sydney or Melbourne, like they do in many places such as London and New York, you may have eight, 10 or 12 local zones? So, instead of being able to increase that local zone out, as we are pushing to do-take Sydney, for example, which I am more familiar with-to, say, the Campbelltown area, and in my own area in Wollongong there is a strong campaign to have that increased to Wollongong, what you are going to find under this legislation and with privatisation is that, instead of expanding that local call area you are going to retract it and make say four or five or six areas. Take someone on the North Shore of Sydney trying to ring, say, Sutherland. Instead of that being a local call in that zone, as it is at the moment, you may well find that it goes across three zones. So it will be an SID call. Going on past experience of what happened overseas, that is what will happen. Universal service depends not only on the afford ability of current services but also on the future investment decision. This is bad· legislation; it is legislation that should be opposed; and it is legislation that will be opposed on this side of the House. It is unfortunate that this is one of the first pieces of legislation that is to be brought in. I oppose the legislation, and I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).",14
7,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I rise to address this House on the Telstra bill, which seems to me to be a matter of great concern to the Australian community. The argument principally advanced by the government in respect of this matter is that they have a mandate-a mandate to carry out this policy. I was one whose electoral majority increased. I do not believe that I am entitled to say that everybody who voted for me would necessarily support all aspects of Labor Party policy, just as I do not believe that all those who voted for my Liberal opponent were necessarily committed to every aspect of Liberal policy. The difficulty in this case is that, although I believe it that a great majority of people in my electorate would be opposed to the sale of Telstra, I do not believe I am entitled to say that there is an unequivocal mandate that compels me to oppose this legislation on the basis of the vote I received. Equally, one may well ponder the question to Liberal colleagues: why was so much money spent in the Liberal campaign demonising Paul Keating? Why was so much money spent on other aspects of that campaign? Is there any single member sitting opposite who does not say that their own work in their community and their commitment to local factors did not playa part in influencing their vote? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has on a previous occasion said that the argument for a mandate-for this proposal-is worthless. The factors that influence people on how they vote and why they vote vary not merely from electorate to electorate but for a whole of reasons. A very nice young man from my electorate, who I presume was a supporter of the Liberal Party, was giving out Liberal tickets, and he came up and spoke to me quite politely. He explained that the prime reason he was voting Liberal was that he had never lived under a Liberal government, and he wanted to know what it was like. I gave him some advice about that, which he obviously . did not take.",15
8,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,Tell us what it was.,16
9,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,I told him he was lucky he did not live here during the period of the Vietnam War; he might have been conscripted. There is one factor which seems to have been totally overlooked in this debate. I believe it is immoral to say that there is credibility on the side of the government based on not only their having suddenly discovered the environment but also their willingness to throw $1 billion at it over three years.,16
10,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,A very worthy investment in the future.,16
11,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Yes, but do you think that you are going to solve all the problems that exist in the Australian environment in would be true to say three years?",16
12,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,We'll do a lot more in three years than you did in 13.,16
13,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I am happy to debate the issue of what we did on the environment with the honourable gentleman any time, any place and anywhere, including in his own electorate. Let me ask: what happens after three years? What are you going to sell next-the navy, the army, the air force? Where is the next billion dollars going to come from?",16
14,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,We are interested in retiring debt and preserving the environment of this country.,16
15,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"The only thing that is worth retiring around here is the honourable gentleman. It is not as if Telstra has not provided a major service to the Australian community. The process of cross-subsidisation that it has engaged in over a period has made the Australian telecommunications system variety arguably one of the best in the world. Many members of the government when in opposition berated the former government from time to time on its attitude towards defence. Let me say this: in modem warfare, government control of your telecommunications system is absolutely vital.",16
16,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,The government will own two-thirds of Telstra.,16
17,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"You see, the problem is that the minute it is privatised the motivation becomes quite different. If you are a director of a company that has been privatised",16
18,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,But only one-third.,16
19,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Oh, one-third! Have you not ever heard-and any financial analysis will show you this-that you do not need to have only one-third, one half or 60 per cent of the shares. If you own as much as 30 per cent of the shares and are clever and know how to operate, you can get effective control of the company. There are textbooks written on that, and I commend them to the honourable gentleman. When you say that we will not have foreign ownership, the nice question arises: what constitutes foreign ownership? Take the example of a company registered in Australia with effective control--even though it may, in shareholding, be minority control-held by an overseas company. Is that a foreign company or an Australian company? If they decide to purchase and are registered on the Australian Stock Exchange, is this government going to look behind the reality of that corporate structure? Of course they are not. What will the first duty be for a director in this new Telstra that is going to be created by this government? The first duty of any director is to maximise profit. Nobody argues with that. One of these multinational companies with an Australian front may decide to raise the issue of the responsibility and duties of directors and say to the others, 'It is all very well to be purchasing Australian based electrical units which are made in Australian factories, but the fact is that you can buy them in the international marketplace significantly cheaper. It is our duty to the shareholders to maximise our profit.' What does the honourable gentleman opposite say to that? It is unarguable. Telstra provides the skeletal structure for the economic development of the existing electronic industry and will continue to provide that structure as that industry goes from strength to strength. There is no guarantee that that position will continue. It does not matter who your minister is, he cannot come in and say to the Telstra board, 'Hang on, while you might have a duty to maximise profit, there is a broad question of public policy in tenns of the development of our own skills in this industry.'",17
20,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,But the minister controls two-thirds of the board.,17
21,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,He controls two-thirds of the board? He is unable to give that two-thirds of the board any sort of instruction. You know that and I know that. It would constitute grave outside interference with the responsibility of directors.,17
22,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,The government will own two-thirds of Telstra.,17
23,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"If you read what the Prime Minister has said, you will see that he has made it perfectly clear that this is only the beginning of the end, that the long-tenn objective of this government and their commitment to the whole concept of privatisation are just the beginning. He makes that perfectly clear. In another three years, he will be wanting to sell the rest of it. Let us not quibble. It is in the document. I invite the honourable gentleman to read it.",17
24,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,I have read the document.,17
25,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Well, you have not understood it.",17
26,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,You don't.,17
27,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I am trying to explain it to you, but you have made a very ignorant response, with great respect. There is another aspect of this that I believe is important. From overseas experience, you have only to look at the collapse of the Allende government, which had been democratically elected. A significant factor in the overthrow of that government by the army, the colonels, was the fact that a foreign company owned the telecommunications network. That has been documented; it is a historic fact. This government has a blind spot because it believes deep in its heart that private enterprise will always deliver a better product at the end of the day than a government owned instrument.",17
28,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,It usually does.,17
29,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"That is highly arguable. Why don't you privatise the army, the navy and the air force? Why can't we contract out our defence services? There was a time when you could hire a foreign militia. Maybe you ought to give a contract to the Japanese and say to them, 'If you come down here and run a private army that wi1l save us a lot of money.' I do not believe the honourable gentleman would seriously entertain that. If you do not believe that control of our telecommunications network is an essential part of the defence infrastructure of our country, do not get up here and talk to us about the problems of our defence structure. The reason this is being done is not that Telstra has been inefficient. Last year it returned a profit to public revenue of $940 million. I would not have any problem if the government said that it was going to take a substantial slice of that and commit it to the environment over the next five years because Telstra's profit was likely to continue. I would not have an argument with that. Telstra may say that that would restrict its operations in some way, but I can understand the credibility of that argument. There are other problems which have not been canvassed in this debate. All we get from the other side 'We have a mandate.'",17
30,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,We have. You've got only 49 seats; we've got the rest of them.,18
31,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Yes, but there is more intelligence in these 49 seats than in that bunch over there. That is illustrated in the paucity of your arguments in this debate. That is your problem. Because you have won an election, God has smiled on you and all light has come down. You are now inspired, you have discovered the environment and you are going to throw $1 billion at it. But you do want to be asked what is going to happen in three years. You might have to sell off the rest of Telstra; there might be something else you can sell. But you have not thought your way through the role that Telstra plays in the training of our young people, in the skilling and imparting of knowledge in an industry that is absolutely critical to Australia's fence future. That is a major component. There are areas in Australian industry now where the lack of training means that the future is bleak. Do you honestly expect some of the great technicians that operate in this industry-those who saw their future with Telstra when they joined as young men and women coming out of universities with degrees and who participated, contributed and carry a body of knowledge-to sit there with this bunch of loons committed to privatisation saying, 'You are the next lot to be sold off,' when they could go out into the marketplace or find jobs in other nations whose telecommunication structures are part of public ownership because they are an essential vehicle for defence and the advance of the community? Telstra is a state-of-the-art instrument. It has built a telecommunications network, particularly for those in regional areas, which all Australians can be proud of. I reckon I could do pretty well if I privati sed myself. I could sell the house, fix up the mortgage and then spend a lot of time developing the back garden. But it would not make sense because I would have nowhere to live. That is about as sensible as what is happening here. We are going to dispose of a major profit making asset which is critical to the future - of our is, capacity to stay not merely abreast of the world but in many areas in front of it.",18
32,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,Only one-third is being sold.,18
33,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"What wi1l you do if you are sitting on the board-God help us-and a director says to you, 'Your job is to maximise the profit. That is your legal responsibility. It just so happens we can buy these electronic components by the cartload from France or Japan instead of paying top price for them in Melbourne or Sydney. Look at the profit we will make'? Axe you going to get on not the phone to the minister and say, 'Minister, I'm really caught here because I don't know what to do; I have a legal obligation'? The minister will not be able to tell you what to do. That is the reality.",18
34,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,Telstra already makes commercial decisions.,18
35,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I do not have time to de- educate the honourable gentleman. What I will try to do is put the argument as simply as possible so he may understand it. It is very simple. Is the answer yes or no? Are Telstra and the telecommunications structure essential and do they provide the skeletal structure upon which our electronics industry is based? The answer is clearly yes. Does Telstra provide basic training, at the state-of-the-art level, for young Australians who saw their future with it but who will easily be snapped up overseas if there is no future for them in this country? The answer is yes. Has it performed its job efficiently and well and providLabor ed the average Australian citizen, wherever he lives, with a telecommunications service which ranks amongst the best in the world? The answer is yes. Has it made a profit; is it costing the taxpayers? It has made $944 million.",18
36,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,Competition has made Telstra an effective company.,19
37,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Competition! It seems to me that if you were a private shareholder in Telstra and it were making these returns, you would be more than happy to keep your shares in it. Every Australian has a share of Telstra, because it is ultimately obligated to every Australian. The argument that 'we have a mandate' is without substance. I do not claim it for my argument on behalf of my constituents. The only poll that I have discovered that found that Australians support the sale of Telstra was conducted by the Liberal Party. I do not know who paid for it.",19
38,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,The election was a referendum on Telstra.,19
39,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"That is absolute nonsense. Some young ladies in your electorate might have voted for you because they thought you were handsome. I wouldn't share in that judgment, but I could understand it. If you can tell me why people voted for you, I would be very interested to hear it. But don't tell me you have a mandate to put your hand up for this lunatic proposal. It is a proposal which you will live to regret. There is no merit in the government's position. There is no honour in its pOSition. is selling out the people of Australia. If this legislation goes through, the people of Australia will live to regret it. I hope and plead that it will be opposed and knocked out in the Senate.",19
40,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"Namadgi) (10.01 a.m.}--I am afraid I start this speech with a certain amount of mirth, given the comments by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), in relation to the personal attributes of certain members. However, it is with considerable concern that I rise in this place today to defend the continued public ownership of Telstra. The Opposition is firmly opposed to the Telstra sell-off, and we will be keeping our commitment to the Australian people at the last federal election to oppose any sale of our publicly owned telecommunications utility. Public ownership of Telstra is vitally important to ensure that all Australians continue to have equal and fair access to the rapidly growing telecommunication and information sectors. It would be an abdication of our responsibility as legislators if we were to let a situation develop whereby we would have in this country an elite group of information rich and a large group of information poor. Not only do the coalition's plans for Australia's largest government owned asset have the potential to undermine universal access to quality telecommunications services, but they may also detract from competition within the telecommunications industry and lead to a significant diminution of opportunity for the local production of telecommunications equipment. There is a whole range of Australian industry developing good technology, dependent upon the feeding line that Telstra supplies. It is absolutely essential for the ongoing development of our industry that Telstra can continue to offer such opportunities. Furthermore, there is cause for concern that this sell-off may also lead to timed local calls. That has been disputed by many, but I do not think it has been examined fully and carefully. I fear that a privatised Telstra would be able to introduce timed local calls by stealth. It They would do this by redefining a local call by making the 'local' area smaller. For example, in my own region, Canberra and Queanbeyan-which is just over the ACT border-currently share a common phone area. In the future, a privati sed Telstra could very easily redefine the local zone by creating two local call zones in this one area. People making telephone calls between Canberra and Queanbeyan could find themselves in the position of going from one local zone to another and therefore being subjected to timed SID rates. It has happened in other cities in the world. There is absolutely no reason why, with a profit margin as your motive, you would not consider such a move. Given the continuing changes in technology and the costs associated with the R&D aspect of technology development-for example, photovoltaics and a whole new range of technologies which are being examined and implemented-the ability of a privatised Telstra to continue to deliver services in an equitable manner without cross-subsidy would be in doubt. When we look at the area of developing technology there is no reason at all for us to believe that a privatised Telstra would automatically be able to afford-or wish to afford-to continue the delivery of service without cross-subsidy. The coalition have argued that the partial privatisation of Telstra is an essential microeconomic reform. I strongly disagree. Privatisation in itself is not micro-economic reform. There is no automatic gain in economic efficiency by transferring ownership from the public to the private sector. It is competition-not privatisation-that will produce efficiencies. The result of this sell-off could in fact be reduction in competition within the telecommunications industry. Telstra has considerable advantage over its competitors at the moment because it owns the network infrastructurethe phone connections to every home in the country. It would be in the interests of a privati sed Telstra to use that natural monopoly power to eliminate its competitors. In stark contrast to the approach of the coalition, the former Labor government instituted sensible reforms in the communications sector. The Labor government introduced competition in service delivery, that is, effective competition between carriersliterally from the telephone socket in the wall. The results of this policy are there for everyone to see. We have seen a massive increase in investment in communications infrastructure. Exports of telecommunications equipment from this country have gone from $200 million to over $1 billion a year. A huge range of services are opening up to consumers. Telstra's customer services have improved dramatically. The whole range of opportunity within this industry has improved enormously. All of these things have occurred as a direct result of the Labor government introducing proper competition in the early 1990s. Telstra did not have to be privatised to achieve these outstanding results. Another aspect of the proposed Telstra privatisation that has been overlooked, or probably ignored, by the government is the difficulties associated with partial privatisation. Should the privatisation go ahead, there would be a fundamental conflict of interest between the minority private shareholders and the government as the majority shareholder. If Telstra is to be purely profit driven-and what private shareholder would expect anything less than that-then it will not be in the company's interest to continue to provide universal service to all Australians; that is, the maintenance of cross-subsidies for rural and regional areas must surely, automatically, be under threat. If Telstra is to continue to provide universal service, it must do so at the expense of higher profit. Again, this is not in the interests of private shareholders. The a conflict of interest between the private shareholder and the government-that is, the constituents; the taxpayers who expect fair access-is evident. The inclusion of performance standards in the Telstra bill will do very little to counter the fact that a privati sed Telstra will not protect the public interest. The inclusion of these standards appears to be more about diverting public attention away from the privatisation issue than any real concern for the performance of the organisation. I draw to the attention of honourable members opposite the potential for a privatised Telstra to place charges on services such as directory assistance. The temptation to do this would be enormous and understandable. The $80 million in revenue that would be obtained from such a move would be very attractive to private shareholders, but it would come at the expense of many-the sight impaired, mobile phone users, the elderly or people like you and me who forget to carry our phone books with us, which is quite simple to do. In a desperate attempt to find something to talk about, the members opposite have tried to argue that because Labor has supported the privatisation of certain government business enterprises in the past then it must automatically support all privatisation. This is not idiotic but also quite an insipid argument. There is a world of difference between the privatisation of Telstra as we are seeing it now and the privatisations in the past of institutions like the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. We need to put this on record. The Commonwealth Bank is one of four major banks. It services only about 20 per cent of the banking sector in Australia. It does not have anywhere near the level of market power that Telstra has. Furthermore, the government has maintained a degree of regulatory control over the banking industry via the Reserve Bank. Like the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas was also one of many service providers in a competitive marketplace. Qantas has about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel business and under 40 per cent of the international air travel business in and out of Australia. It is only a small proportion of the population who regularly use the services of an airline. Most importantly, both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas needed injections of federal funds, taxpayers' money, from time to time for capital expenditure. In contrast, Telstra raises all its own investment funds. It is not a drain on the federal Treasury for capital expenditure. The other aspect of this debate is the coalition's shameless linking of their environment package to the sale of Telstra. The members opposite want people to believe that anyone who does not agree with the flogging off of Telstra is anti-environment. They continue to claim the sole right to environmental concern. This is an absolute affront to the majority of the Australian community. It is also a monopoly that the environment does not need and, frankly, is not one that the environment could afford. Members on this side of the House have an extremely proud environmental record. It was the Labor government which stopped the damming of the Franklin River, protected Coronation Hill, promoted the landcare program and created programs such as the save the bush and the one billion trees by 2000 programs. We saw the creation of the Wet Tropics World Heritage area and, what only I consider to be the absolute jewel in the crown, the protection of the Antarctic wilderness, the Great Southern Whale Sanctuary. These are things that we should all be very proud of. How dare the members opposite give the impression that they are the only people in this place or in this country who have any concern for the environment. That is totally misleading and absolutely dishonest. The list of Labor's claims to the environment in the past is very long and very exhaustive. I have named only a few, but they are worth considering. For people outside this place, do not be conned by the line that the coalition government has suddenly discovered and protected the environment. If the coalition really believed in their environment package, they would not need to privatise Telstra to fund it. I note that they were able to find the money needed to placate their business friends on the issue of tariff concessions. It is amazing that they need to sell Telstra to suddenly have a thing for the environment. I find it quite a contradiction. The whole question of the environment, our care for it, our need for its protection and our belief in it is deserving of normal budget consideration. I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports, when he asks: what next will we see flogged off, what next will we see as an excuse? Make no bones about it, the coalition had planned to sell Telstra. They knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, without a hook upon which to hang it. They also knew they had to dramatically improve their record on the environment. The coalition saw a very natural linking of the two. It is a con job to the people of this country to expect them to believe this extraordinary connection. I condemn the coalition for it. If the coalition wish to sell Telstra, let them stand up and say so and say it honestly for the reasons that they really have. If you truly believe in the environment, put it in your normal budget allocation like you do health, education and all of the other essentials of this country. Don't try to convince us otherwise. In conclusion, I calion all members in this place to think very carefully about the effects on their constituency, particularly the regional and rural people. I am absolutely certain that there are a number of new members opposite, what I would term the-small 'I' - liberal members opposite, who really may not be totally convinced about this. Do not be conned by it; think very carefully about it. Talk to the people on your side and really consider carefully what it is you are pushing. I am going to very proudly vote against this because I know why I am voting against it. You make sure you know why you are voting for it.",19
41,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and to oppose the government's bill to sell Telstra. I think the House and the people listening to this broadcast should be aware of the amendment moved by the member for Werriwa. It states: ""the House is of the opinion that the bill should not be proceeded with, for the following reasons: (1) it represents the start of a process leading to the full privatisation of Telstra; (2) it will lead to a loss of jobs, investment and exports, and the bill also fails to establish Australia-first purchasing policy for Telstra; (3) the remittance of profits overseas which will follow enactment will damage Australia's balance of payments; (4) it provides inadequate protection of universal service obligations and preservation of services in regional, rural and remote Australia; (5) the government's failure to bring outer metropolitan telephone zones into the capital city local call zones; (6) the government's failure to fulfil its commitment to establish an ISDN service throughout Australia plus establish A and B share categories to monitor foreign ownership; (7) the failure to preserve ministerial directions and accountability to the parliament for the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations; (8) there are much better ways of funding environmental programs than selling Australia's major public asset; (9) it represents an ideological obsession with ownership issues instead of focussing on the competitive features of the telecommunications market; (10) at a time of rapid technological change in telecommunications, the public sector should continue to hold a major strategic asset like Telstra to avoid inequity of access and affordability on the so-termed 'information superhighway' ; (11) with the government's recent decision to review the 1997 telecommunications regulations it is inappropriate for the parliament to be considering the sale of Telstra"". Those 11 reasons are very good reasons why this parliament should reject the sale of one-third of Telstra. The reality is that the government does not intend to sell one-third of Telstra; it intends to sell all of it. There is not much point just selling one-third of it. If you sell one-third of it, the government loses all control over the company anyway. This is just the first shot across the bows; it will be a salami slice job where one-third goes now, one-third later and one-third after that. Ultimately, the people who own the biggest company in Australia, Telstra-people should understand that Telstra is the biggest business in this country; it is currently owned by every individual taxpayer-will shortly see, if the an present coalition government gets its way, that many parts of it will be owned by overseas investors. The ownership of this very strategic business will move out of the absolute control of Australian hands and move to others. The opposition does not believe that that is something that should be done. The opposition is firmly of the view, as I believe the majority of the Australian people are, that this business should stay in the government's hands. Members of the opposition say that they have a mandate for selling Telstra. If you went through all the obscure highways and byways of the opposition's policy that they ran to the election and on, they will probably say that they have a mandate for everything. When people vote in elections in Australia, they tend to vote for a variety of issues. As my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said earlier, they might have even voted for someone because they thought they were attractive. But this is certainly not a policy that is attractive. If you polled all the Australian people and asked them, 'Do you think the government should sell Telstra, yes or no? the resounding answer would be no, because they know that it is an Australian icon and the government is getting rid of that. They know that Telstra provides 90 per cent of the nation's telecommunications services. In some ways they have voted on whether or not they wanted government to get rid of Telstra. In all the ballots that were held about whether people wanted to have Optus or Telstra as their telephone company, the vast majority voted for Telstra. When they were voting for Telstra in those ballots about Optus and Telstra, they were really choosing whether they wanted the government company or the private company. In those ballots, even in Melbourne, where Optus said they were going to do terrifically, they did badly. Optus got a very small market share out of those ballots. Telstra got over 75 per cent of the market share out of those ballots. That was the people specifically saying that they wanted to choose Telstra, the government company, over Optus, the private enterprise company. We have really had a ballot from the Australian people about what they think, but that does not suit the current government, which has this ideological obsession that somehow or other private enterprise is better than government enterprise. The opposition agree that in many areas private enterprise is better, or preferable if is not necessarily better. In some areas there is a need for the government to have an absolute interest. Telecommunications is one of those areas. At present Telstra has a natural monopoly. It is the biggest government owned asset. Telstra's profits after tax in 1994-95 were $1.753 billion and its total value added represents 2.2 per cent of GOP. This is something that is owned by the people and it is the largest business in the country. The reality is that Telstra also has a lot of strategic interest for Australians. It has a lot more interest for Australians than it does for any other country in the world. The Australian population is the most widely dispersed of any of the developed countries in the world. There is a thick band of population around the eastern seaboard, a few nodes in the centre and on the west and a very sparse population spread over the only continental country on earth. Currently, Telstra has provided a service to those people. It has put a direct dial telephone into nearly every house in the country--one of the most remarkable engineering achievements of the 20th century to cover a country like this which has a dispersed population. A private company would not do that because a private company's business is making a profit. The result of Telstra becoming a private company is that the concentration will be on making money for the shareholders and the interest will then go to where the most profit is. The most profit for Telstra is on the eastern seaboard of Australia down to that tip around Melbourne. There is no real profit for it in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia or the outback parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. There is no profitability there for it at all. The directors of any company that is trying to make a profit and has private shareholders have an obligation to maximise the profit for distribution to the shareholders. They will concentrate on those very highly concentrated population areas of Australia. You will then get a two-tier service from this new business. It will be a good service for people who are in the concentrated population areas like Sydney and Melbourne. It will be a terrible it service for people out in the bush. That would be a tragedy for Australia. One of the things the government always said when they were in opposition was that they represented the bush, that the National Party was always there allegedly running the argument for them. The only party that has actually had a very strong view of providing city services for country people has been the Labor Party. We believe that the same sorts of services should be available to all Australians, whether they live in the bush or in the city. In this modem age the most important service is the telecommunications service. It determines whether you are an information rich or information poor society. We have seen some of the snake oil from the present government about how they were going to do something about that. It would be interesting in this debate if the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), would tell the House what they intend to do about their promise to expand the ISDN service to every person in the country. That was one of the promises they made during the election-snake oil sales from the then opposition. Members of the National Party ran around the country saying, 'We're going to do this.' The reality is that they are not. If they sell Telstra, they will be even less scandal. able to expand that service. We would be very interested to hear from the Minister for Communications and the Arts about the time frame he has in place for implementing that electoral promise. Where is he going to get the billions of dollars that this will cost? We would be very interested to hear that. At least if the government still owned Telstra they would be able to get Telstra on the track and doing something about it. But if Telstra is a private company, and if it costs $15,000 or $20,000 to put an ISDN line onto some farm out in the bush, they will say, 'That's fine. It will cost you $15,000 or $20,000.' It will not be the same cost for someone in the city and the current subsidy will go. The government will say, 'Yes, but we're going to put that on the record,' but the reality is that they are not. One part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa laments the fact that the government will not be accountable for where they are going with the universal service obligation. We are also concerned that this legislation will take away the preserve for ministerial direction and accountability to the parliament for the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations. If this bill goes through, the minister will not be able to say, 'Quite frankly, you should be doing this out at Gulargambone and you'd better get on and do it,' because he will have no say over this business anymore. We will be in the ridiculous position where the people will own, at least in the first instance, two-thirds of the business. The person who will own the share will probably be the Minister for Communications and the Arts or the Minister for Finance. He will hold the shares for the two-thirds of the representation but under this bill will not be able to direct them. So the people who will in fact own this business and determine the fate of this business will not be the Australian people anymore; it will be the private shareholders. By selling one per cent, two per cent, 30 per cent or any of this business, the government loses all control over the business. That is a The opposition says that we should maintain this company in the hands of the Australian people because of those very significant reasons. The government says to us, 'You believed in privatisation. You sold off these other government assets.' But it is very important that people realise the difference between selling off the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and why the government should keep control, keep ownership in total, of Telstra. As I said earlier, Telstra provides nearly 90 per cent of Australia's telecommunications services. The Commonwealth Bank serviced only about 20 per cent of the bank sector in Australia. Qantas had about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel business and under 40 per cent of the international air travel business in and out of Australia, and only a very small proportion of Australians regularly fly. Both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas needed injections of cash from the government from time to time to expand their business. The reality with Telstra is that it makes massive profits for the government. As I said earlier, Telstra's profit in the last financial year was $1.75 billion, and it raises all its own investment funds. It is not a drain on the Treasury for capital expenditure, as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were from time to time. Unlike Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra provides an established world-class telecommunications network to all Australians-not just to those who want to bank with the Commonwealth Bank or to those who want to fly overseas or around Australia-at a reasonable cost. Telstra also makes very substantial contrian butions to the government through income tax. Last year it paid $649 million to the federal government. It does not minimise tax payments, as private companies do. Once the government privatises Telstra, it will able to utilise all sorts of legitimate tax minimisation mechanisms, which will ensure that the return to the people through the tax cut will be even less. Another very important issue that I would like to mention in the few moments left to me is the effect the sale of Telstra will have on the Australian electronics industry. The minister will go on with a lot of cant about how Telstra has always bought from Australto ians and how Telstra will continue to buy from Australians. If that is so, we would interested to hear the government's response to the proposition made by the member for (Time expired) Werriwa that the government should legislate for that. We believe that a buy Australia policy for Telstra should be legislated for. At present, over 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and services is pursecond chased from Australian firms, big and small. Telstra is the biggest buyer in the country. privatised Telstra would not be required to maintain such purchasing policies. The same thing would then happen with Telstra as happened with Optus, where Optus's partports ners-North American telephone companiescountry are purchasing their equipment overseas. Telstra will have pressure from its shareholdto expect. ers to maximise their profits, saying that Telstra should buy wherever in the world it most competitive to buy. That would put the electronics industry at great risk. That industry has been one of the very great success stories in Australia over the last 15 or 20 years. We have seen the develthat opment of an industry which gives us a edge. We have seen an industry develop second which has relied, in many instances, on getting its start through either defence Telstra contracts. Telstra is one customers of the Australian electronics industry and, with that pressure from shareholders, that will go. The government should be sincere about this, recognise that the electronics industry is important part of Australian industry, and legislate to provide that a minimum of 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and its services be purchased from Australian companies. That is fair and reasonable. If the be present system is working well and there was bipartisan support for it, let us put it in the legislation to make sure that the new owners of Telstra do this. Everyone thought that the owners of Optus were going to do this and they did not. So, for all the reasons outlined by the member for Werriwa, we should not be passing this bill as it is. The opposition has a number of specific amendments that it intends move at the consideration in detail stage of the bill. We hope the government will accept be those amendments because they will make it a better bill and it will be better for Australia.",22
42,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,"I rise to oppose the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and to support the amendment the opposition has moved at the reading stage. Ultimately, if it comes to that, I will support the amendments to be A moved in subsequent stages of the proceedings. I do that because this is not a policy for all Australians. This is a policy for a narrow, ideologically driven government which supthe option to provide a policy for this which will not deliver the telecommunications standards which we have come It will not deliver the public communicais tions standards which this country will need to develop not only our information technology and telecommunications industries, but also the wide range of business and manufacturing, agricultural and public ownership areas our future development depends on. It is, world as the amendment to the motion for the reading says, an ideological obsession with ownership issues rather than a focusing or on the competitive features of our telecomof the largest munications market. Unlike the government, this side of the House is not caught in this ideological ownership trap between public and private sectors. Mrs Bishop-Really?",25
43,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,"No. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who formerly had some interest in the area of privatisation but perhaps has less these days, certainly has failed to deliver to the public a policy in this area of privatisation which will actually meet the demands of this country into the next century. The reality is that this bill is probably the worse of all worlds for telecommunications ownership. The bill does not pass the appropriate tests which the public of Australia will come to impose on this government on the way in which its ideologically driven decisions in this area actually supplant public interest. The reality is that Telstra is not the same many other areas of government ownership which have been privatised in the past. Telstra is in quite a different category, as the debacle over the joint venture agreement during the election campaign showed. The then opposition, now the government, regarded as quite unacceptable the joint venture arrangements between Telstra, IDM and others over information technology sourcing. It regarded those arrangements as quite untenable. It said that they reflected a part-privatisation of Telstra the then government, which in reality turned out to be quite incorrect. It was simply a better way of Telstra doing business, and the government now has been forced to concede that point. The government has now been forced to allow that to proceed. Of course, that exposes the sham which we saw during the election campaign when that indeed was said to be unacceptable. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), while in opposition during the campaign, ruled out those very measures which they now endorse as appropriate business practice. I think that draws the distinction between the opposition and the government on this matter. We are prepared to support privatisation, commercialisation, where that represents sound public policy and sound ultimate business practice. That is not the case in the example of Telstra, as members of the government would well know. There are substantial differences between the sale of Qantas, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Telstra. I think some of those differences have already been well highlighted. They relate to the market dominance of Telstra which is to be contrasted with the position of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Indeed, while Qantas has some half of the domestic market and a substantial part of the international market, it does not service a very substantial part of the Australian community. I think some five per cent of Australians fly regularly. While the Commonwealth Bank served a very useful and significant purpose to be publicly owned in the early part of its life as cycle, that did not apply at the time the Labor government privatised the Commonwealth Bank. Circumstances had changed dramatically. We used the opportunity of public ownership to create the environment in which the Commonwealth Bank could flourish initially and then, when it was no longer necessary or essential for it to be in public ownership, the opportunity was taken to privatise it. It is, of course, a very important part of our banking fraternity but not a dominant part of it. It is by no longer critical to the public ownership test. But Telstra is quite different. Not only is that the dominant carrier to the extent of some 90 per cent of telecommunications traffic in this country, but it is also in a transition and a deregulation phase. One of the important parts of the Labor government's telecommunications policy over the last decade was to ensure that the telecommunications industry was properly deregulated in a phased and measured way, the public performance standards were there and the service delivery was there but that the benefits of competition flowed through to the public. Telstra, and indeed the whole industry, is still in that transition phase. It is still pre-1997. We do not yet have the complete picture of where an open telecommunications industry will take this country. Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and others which will be entering the market shortly are not yet in a mature and settled position in relation to their industry. Quite clearly there are many issues still outstanding in that dimension of the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, issues which are quite properly still to be settled. I understand that the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has tom up the initial draft post-1997 regulatory bill and is starting afresh. That might be his right as a minister, but I think it indicates just where we are in this process. There is still a very long way to go. To impose on the telecommunications industry-and indeed its dominant carrier, Telstra-at this stage in the deregulation process the additional uncertainty which part-privatisation will bring, I think is a very negative aspect of the overall approach that this government brings to telecommunications policy. For one thing it completely ignores the vital industry development aspects of the telecommunications industry itself. As a recent Bureau of Industry Economics report indicated: Australia has a long tradition in the manufacturing . of TE. Much of this industry originally developed under the protective umbrella of the Postmaster General and later Telecom. A number of firms mentioned in interviews with BIE that Telecom acted as an effective leading-edge customer, with stringent technical and quality specifications, stimulating the development of local capabilities. In line with the general industrial restructuring deregulation of the telecommunications market, this section of the industry is becoming increasingly internationally competitive and export oriented. I think that illustrates very nicely just what role the Postmaster-General's Department and ultimately Telecom and Telstra have played in ensuring that Australia has a viable, active and effective telecommunications industry export regime. We have been able to develop a substantial export market under the guidance of Telecom and Telstra to ensure that local firms know exactly where they stand in this market, that they have to meet the highest world best practice standards in the provision of this equipment, and that they have a leading edge purchasing authority to guide them in this very difficult process of becoming world competitive. They have taken on that challenge and they have succeeded. In 1983, some 10 or 12 years ago, the industry had very minimal exports of about $50 million a year. However, it is now up to nearly $1 billion a year and heading beyond that. I think the reality of that transition over the last decade, from $50 million in exports to over $1 billion in exports, is very significant and shows us just what an important role Telstra has played in guiding that industry, which is vital to Australia's future development in this region, through its formative stages. To impose privatisation, to impose deregulation, and to impose them both together and therefore remove the industry deVelopment and national interest constraints that Telstra has always operated under, will be very damaging to that emerging industry, one which is set to take Australia as part of the overall information technology and telecommunications industries into the year 2000. It has put that very much at risk. It is worth noting that the total IT and telecommunications business in this country will be worth of the order of $10 billion by the year 2000. That prediction is a very substantial one. It shows the magnitude of the combined IT and telecommunications industries, where they have still to go and what potential they have, and this government puts much of that at risk. That is very sad for and Australia, very sad for a vital sunrise industry which has contributed so much to our export growth and which has the potential to make this country a leading edge exporter of IT and telecommunications. The government has done that by creating this climate of uncertainty about telecommunications and information technology and, in many ways, for industry in general. The harsh reality of that was brought out by something I read recently in the Financial Review. A leading information technology industry representative said that the impact of the government's proposals on the withdrawal of the tariff schemes and many of the other things that they have done since they took office 'is very uncertain'. He said: One thing people were comfortable with under the previous Government was that you knew what the policy was. That is quite instructive about the way in which this government has introduced a climate of risk and uncertainty into the public and private sectors of this country which we did not see under the previous government. I will remind you of the last phrase: . . . under the previous Government . . . you what the policy was. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case following the changes which this government has already started to implement in relation to telecommunications and information technology. It has promised to withdraw $1 billion in capital expenditure over the next triennial period. That has placed the IT industry under severe threat and created a great amount of uncertainty in the industry. The partprivatisation of Telstra will do the same in the vital telecommunications industry area. Meanwhile, question marks hang over important tax concessions, such as the research and development 150 per cent tax concession, which has been vital to establishing our export oriented research and development industries and to ensuring our large domestic base in R&D. The question mark that hangs over that concession-ministers tell us that we will have to wait till 20 August to find out-also creates the kind of uncertainty which the extract I just quoted to the House refers to. There are question marks over the partnerships for development program, fixed tenn arrangements, the R&D grants which the previous government put in place, and the multi-media scheme promoted by the member for Dobell (MrLee) when he was the minister for communications, and by the former Prime Minister. Those question marks do not ensure a good result for Australian industry, particularly in the vital high-tech areas. Stability is one of the things that small business and smalland medium-sized enterprises need more than anything else. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talks about issues like unfair dismissal laws and other red tape questions-those things have . their impact, for sure-but not about the fact that smalland medium-sized industries need stability in policy making more than anything else. They need the kind of stability which will ensure that tariff arrangements and tax concessions stay in place and which will deliver the low inflation and solid growth that the previous government delivered. That is the kind of stability those businesses need above knew all else to ensure that they grow and flourish. The Howard government, unfortunately, has taken all of those things away from them. That is a very sad commentary on a government which has been in office for such a brief time. The industry also needs to note that this part-privatisation is quite possibly the worse of all worlds for it. If this bill makes its way through all stages of the parliament, Telstra will be one-third privatised. I suspect that that outcome will be followed only by full privatisation, perhaps in a phased program, perhaps not. The Prime Minister has given a commitment that that will not occur during the life of this parliament. But while I assume that is one commitment that will be honoured-no doubt one of few in the long tenn-the reality still is that Telstra will be one-third privatised, if this bill is successful, for a substantial period of time. That will mean that the government is still in control of two-thirds of the company. But governments do not make good majority shareholders. Once you sell one share in Telstra you have effectively turned the company over to the one-third private ownership criteria. The private owners are the ones who will really control Telstra. Government, when it is only a majority public shareholder in what is a privately controlled company, is never in a good position to ensure accountability and the development of the national interest. The government will not be in a position to direct the company. It will not be in a position to use its two-thirds voting share to oppress the one-third minority shareholders. It is the commercial shareholders, including as it will foreign owners, whose interests will predominate. The ability to impose checks and balances on that foreign ownership is further diluted by the government's abandonment of the promise to have A and B class shares to ensure that there is an effective manner of holding the overseas shareholders accountable for their prescribed limit in the company. Neither will there be the opportunity for the minister to direct the company, nor for national interest to play a very substantial role in the newly privati sed Telstra. Why should foreign owners allow Telstra to continue to provide development assistance to Australian start-up companies? In many cases those shareholders might be competitors of Telstra. They might be overseas interests with conflicting requirements for Telstra when it comes to exports to the Asia-Pacific areas, to India, and to other overseas developing markets. They will be almost certainly exerting pressure on Telstra to source its suppliers from elsewhere. Why would Telstra continue to buy products in the Australian market when it can buy them cheaper from overseas on the back end of an AT&T, British Telecom, Sprint, Mercury or MCI contract? All of those things will be out there in the global marketplace. Why should Telstra continue to focus on the best practice in the Australian market when those other pressures will be very firmly exerted by the board of Telstra and the private shareholders' representatives on that board? That is the harsh reality of a one-third privatised Telstra. It is neither public nor private. It suffers from the worse constraints of both. To impose this change on the industry and on that particular company during a period of deregulation is perhaps the worse possible outcome in that regard. I have always had a very strong interest in one particular aspect of the future development of the telecommunications industry here and that is the ISDN system. The former minister for communications would be well aware of my interest and no doubt the current minister will become so. The reality is that ISDN became something of an election issue, or an election token, when the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, promised the National Farmers Federation and all other Australians through his communications policy that ISDN would be at every front door, available on demand to anyone who wanted to make that request of Telstra and pay the market fee. Like many members of this House, many householders would not know exactly what ISDN is and that it is something they should be demanding. The Prime Minister promised it to them and they should look very closelyMr Brereton interjecting",26
44,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,"Exactly; precisely what this will deliver to them is something they need to be very careful about. The rural areas, the backbone of our agricultural and primary resources industries, were very keen on the prospect of having ISDN services available at their front door or at the farm gate, as the case may be. But that is a very expensive promise. I am not certain that a newly privati sed Telstra would want to endorse that promise and fulfil it. The test will be when the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is put to this House. We will see then how the National Party members and regional members of the Liberal Party vote to ensure that the ISDN promise is kept. I ask them to also examine this question: is this, in reality, the technology which they want to take rural Australia and outer metropolitan Australia into the next century with? The reality is that ISDN was very important in this country 10 years ago; jt was leading edge technology then. Is it still leading edge technology? Certainly not. The reality is that to be at the leading edge in the next century you will need broadband services at your door and you will need the optical fibre with a capacity of an order of magnitude greater than ISDN can deliver. While ISDN will make a very good computer data link for some people out in the rural areas, it will not provide them with state-of-the-art multimedia and broadband services. If the government is to meet its commitment to rural Australia and regional Australia to ensure that they are at the leading edge of broadband and data delivery services, then it needs to make a commitment in relation to broadband and not continue to pretend that ISDN will deliver these services to the bush. The reality is that it was a good leading edge service some years ago. Telstra did not pursue that service in the way which I personally think that it should have; but the reality is that ISDN is moving past its prime and will be a very ordinary service over the next few years and that people will really be looking for broadband services. Just what the reality of that promise is, we still need to know. What is the reality of local call areas and the local call fee? Untimed local calls are guaranteed, but what about local call areas? What about the universal service obligation? How are we to enforce the accountability on the minister when he is no longer responsible to this parliament for Telstra? That is the harsh reality. That accountability will disappear once the minister no longer has the power to direct Telstra. That, I think, is the most important aspect of this. Other colleagues have talked about the way in which the environment should not be linked to the sale of Telstra, and I strongly endorse those remarks. But I suspect that I can do no better than to conclude with one of the final paragraphs of the amendment moved by the opposition, which reads: it represents an ideological obsession with ownerand ship issues instead of focusing on the competitive features of the telecommunications market This is the way in which we know it should be developed, but it is 'the way in which we know this government can never do it.",29
45,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.54 a.m.)-That is the conclusion of the debate. I take the opportunity to thank honourable members for their participation. We have had, on our count, 40 speakers in this debate and I think we might have some more to go yet. It is a significant number and the debate has ranged over three days. The government has been concerned enough to enable the debate to go on so that all those members on both sides of the chamber who wished to speak have had the opportunity to do so. I have just received the five amendments provided by the shadow minister for competition policy, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), in addition to his second reading amendment. I am not sure how you wish to proceed, but maybe you could seek leave to treat the amendments as a whole. That will still enable you to speak to each particular one. Mr Latham-We will have the detail later on, won't we?",30
46,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"We can discuss that perhaps, otherwise we will be dividing on each particular one, I suspect. We will look at the time constraints that we might be suffering under that scenario. I want to take the opportunity to sum up. I do not think I will be able to do justice to all the speakers in this period, but I will do the best I can. I want to thank everyone for their contribution. However, the government is disappointed that the opposition has taken a clearly ideological position in its opposition to the bill and its refusal to concede that the government has put forward legislation addressing the key issues which the opposition says concerns it-in particular, the consumer safeguards and ensuring that Telstra remains owned and controlled by Australians. That is clearly in the bill. This is a partial dilution of the capital of Telstra-one-thirdthe bill requires a continued two-thirds of Telstra to be controlled by the government. There are a range of consumer safeguards building on the safeguards that are already there. Mr Lee-Have you changed your mind on foreign investment in Telstra?",30
47,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I will not be able to respond to all interjections-much as I might like to. I will say that now so that, if you keep interjecting, you will not feel as though I am ignoring you. But I would like to give a response to some of the substantive issues that were raised. Many of the issues raised by the opposition are not related to the government's shareholder relationship with Telstra but are regulatory issues that apply to all telecommunications carriers, and that is best dealt with in other debates. I want to tum now to some particular issues. Universal service obligations issues were raised in nearly every contribution by the opposition. The claim has broadly been made that there is a watering down of the universal service obligation, which is an obligation in legislation that you equalise the cost of calls across the nation because the new section in the Telstra Corporation Act8CM-refers to the universal service obligation being fulfilled 'as economically and efficiently as practicable'. In fact, the provision in the bill that has been referred to by the opposition is identical to the policy objectives spelt out in paragraph 287(1)(b) of the existing Telecommunications Act, which was passed in this place in 1991 with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as the then minister for communications and me, ironically, as the opposition spokesman on communications. We both agreed that that was an eminently sensible piece of legislation, at that stage, in relation to that particular clause and that clause is preserved in this piece of legislation. The existing provisions will be strengthened by reaffirming in the Telstra act that the universal service obligation is not affected by the dilution of public ownership in Telstra. The current provision in section 287 of the act that provides for the universal service obligation to be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable-it has been there since 1991, as I say-simply makes it clear that there is no room for complacency in exploring better ways to deliver telecommunications services. Indeed, the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), was thoughtful in terms of the assessment of the technologies-the very point this section enables us to pursue-in that there are emerging technologies which make it possible to deliver these services with even greater efficiency and with price benefits for consumers. We want to make sure that the act is drawn in such a way as to have that flexibility to pursue that broader principle of USO. The bill does not limit the operation of the universal service obligation in any way. Section 288 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 will continue to guarantee reasonable access by all Australians to the standard telephone service. The government is also to commence a review to examine whether the definition of the standard telephone service should be upgraded. Many of us who follow these issues know that that would be a very timely review. The further claim has been made that with Telstra in partial private ownership the usa will not be able to be delivered over time. That is simply not true. The government is committed to universal service and carriers are and will continue to be required to provide and fund universal service obligations. It has also been alleged and suggested that privatisation will lead to an increase in cost for telephone connections and calls. There was a rollcall of electorates for which relevant costs were cited. That was tried during the election campaign without success. Clearly, it is designed to generate some angst amongst rural and regional communities. It was not accepted during the election campaign. It will not be accepted now. This legislation establishes the USO. So that sort of approach by the opposition is clearly inappropriate. There is absolutely no validity at all in any of the comments made by so many of the opposition members on that particular point. I also make the point that I represent a regional electorate. Flinders Island is in the middle of it. A colleague on the other side and I joined many years ago on one of the reports that we did. I can assure him and all members of the House that this government would not be involved in establishing policies which would in any way disadvantage or inhibit the spread of technology to benefit regional and remote communities. This bill, which we hope will become an act, will ensure that. In fact, the reverse will be true. Mr Leo MCLeay-Don't hold your breath in the Senate.",30
48,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I think the report was called Poles Apart, if I recall, and you were chairman. Isn't that right? Mr Lee-Certainly poleaxed you.",31
49,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Temporarily anyway. Together with the greater competition which this government will introduce from July 1997, partial privatisation will make Telstra more efficient and responsive to consumers resulting in lower prices and more innovative services utilising the march in technologies that are becoming increasingly available. That is the fundamental driving force that we want to see in this increasingly competitive industry. In addition to the government's commitment to universal service, the government is retaining price controls on Telstra. Interestingly, I do not think one member of the opposition mentioned this fact. They chose to ignore it. The government is retaining price controls on Telstra, which means that for each of the years until 31 December 1998, Telstra must reduce its prices for a basket of services, including local calls, SID calls, international calls and rentals, in real terms by 7.5 per cent. Prices for individual services to residential customers must also reduce in real terms by one per cent. Local call prices, which are currently 25c-1 would take the view that they are overpriced now, that the real cost is somewhere in the vicinity of 15c-and public pay phone prices, which are currently 40c, are not permitted to increase in nominal terms prior to 31 December 1998. With Optus entering the local call market in coming months, local call prices would be expected to fall. Remember that the opposition, the then government, introduced competition directly claiming at the time, in most cases accurately as it now transpires, that competition would see a decline in prices, particularly when you have the price controls in the CPI minus X formula. That has worked and we are continuing that. The opposition has also argued that removal of the minister's power of direction will take away the power of the government to control Telstra and to enforce the universal service obligation. A ministerial power of direction over a partially privatised Telstra would be overly intrusive and incongruous with moving Telstra into a more commercial framework. The bill provides the Commonwealth as a majority shareholder with appropriate access to information. This is enshrined in legislation to ensure that Telstra is accountable to the . minister and therefore the parliament. It is important to note that the ministerial power of direction has been in the act since 1991. But guess what? Not once since 1991 has the ministerial power been exercised. So why all the angst that has been exercised by the opposition over the last three days about the removal of this power as we take the inevitable forward step, the sensible step, towards not only greater competition but also the inclusion of the possibility of private shareholding in this entity? So this power has never been used. The government is not about interfering in the day-today running of Telstra. It is concerned with strategic oversight. This is no different from the policy of the previous government in relation to Telstra. The former minister spoke about this area. I think he went halfway down this path but did not recognise that the role he had as minister was to have strategic oversight and not to be involved in the day-today running of Telstra. He never once exercised the ministerial power that he had, which was put in the act by the Leader of the Opposition back in 1991. In addition, the ministerial power of directions is not needed to enforce the universal service obligation. That is enforced through the Telecommunications Act and by Austel, the government regulator. A related argument raised by the opposition is that the Telstra board will be required under the Corporations Law to run the company for the benefit of minority shareholders. The Commonwealth will exercise control of Telstra in the same way as any other majority shareholder of a Corporations Law company. It will be able to outvote other shareholders on every issue that arises at a general meeting. It will appoint two-thirds of the Telstra board. Private shareholders in Telstra will not be placed in a privileged position through the operation of the Corporations Law. The oppression rules in the Corporations Law simply ensure that minority shareholders are treated fairly. Another concern raised by the opposition is that there will be staff reductions in Telstra as a result of privatisation. Telstra needs to strive to achieve world best practice throughout its business. It is the role of the board and management, not government, to determine strategies to achieve this objective. Any reduction in staff numbers within Telstra will be dependent on factors such as market or commercial pressures, increased competition and the desire to achieve world best practice. These factors already affect the business operations of the company and will continue to apply, whether or not Telstra remains in full public ownership. That has been made clear by the managing director, as I understand it. Telstra is already aware that there will be greater competition post-1997, regardless of what form that might finally take. In order for Telstra to position itself for competition in post-1997 environment and to achieve world best practice, one of the key management challenges over the coming years will be the improvement of work force productivity levels. The stimulus provided by private shareholdings is likely to spur the company to perform better and to grow domestically and internationally. A competitive and growing company will provide better continuing employment prospects. It might be worth noting that there are now 73,OOO-odd employees in Telstra-about a 7.5 per cent increase in numbers for the six months to December. Also, alarmingly, what we have seen in the recent results is that, whilst there is $7.43 billion Australian sales revenue, the earnings before interest and tax were increased by only 4.7 per cent rather than the 9.7 per cent on sales revenue, but operating expenses were up by 10.4 per cent. If you take the point that I was making earlier about the actual cost of prices, that to be an area of concern, particularly for companies such as this. I think it was the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) who made the point in some of the statistics he quoted that the market share of Telstra is under squeeze because of competition. So it does mean that this company has to be strategically placed to not only meet its capex requirements to engage new technologies but also position itself to meet the competitive pressures that are increasingly going to re-spond in the market by the Optuses and Vodafones-the most liberal resale activity we have anywhere in the world, which was introduced by you in 1991. So I think you have to recognise what is happening here. Therefore, the opportunities for staffMr Leo MCLeay-But we actually know what you're up to.",31
50,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Part of the problem here is that you know that I know that you are not saying what you should be saying in some of these debates. - In relation to industry issues, what about the opposition's claim that the Australian industry will lose out as a partially privati sed Telstra will reduce its commitment to local industry? the It is a legitimate concern which exercised the minds of many members during the debate. The government rather strongly supports the development of a strong and viable local telecommunications industry, and we are on the record as saying that over a long period of time. Mr Leo MCLeay-Agree with the amendment.",33
51,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Listen. The fact is that Telstra and all other licensed telecommunications carriers are required by licence conditions-these are your licence conditions, remember-to produce an industry plan each year for the development of the Australian telecommunications supply and information industries. It is entirely appropriate that there be equal treatment among carriers in these matters. We argued these issues back in 1991. I can remember having detailed discussions on that occasion with the now Leader of the Opposition, when he was the minister for communihas cations, about the industry plans. Many members quoted very good figures, both domestically and also on the export side, but we have seen a particularly strong local industry, with Telstra buying somewhere in the vicinity of 70 per cent of local content. Optus and Vodafone have similar levels of commitment to the Australian industry. Mr Leo MCLeay-How close have Vodafone got to it?",33
52,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Vodafone has a small market share, but they are focusing on that. We consider it appropriate that such arrangements, which apply to the whole industry, should continue to apply. I can remember that we had a debate about the development of the Telecommunications Industry Development Authority, which was a non-prescriptive body, to try to gather the industry and to try with moral suasion develop an Australian focus in an increasingly competitive telecommunications industry. Indeed, I recall having debates with the this  would be the most appropriate way to forward with regard to industry concept of TIDA, which is still in place. Incidentally, the President of the Liberal has served on that committee with distinction for some considerable period of time with the support of the government of the dayMr Leo MCLeay-He was a very good communications minister.",33
53,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"He was a good for communications minister, and he is a very good President of the Liberal Party too. He took us to government after 13 years of waiting. Mr Leo MCLeay-He wouldn't be doing this.",34
54,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I think you would find that he would be doing this. strongly supports what is proposed here in the government's policies. The point that I make is that Mr Beazley, in his interesting contribution to this debate, neglected completely to make mention of the non-prescriptive approach to the development of industry that his government, when he was there, put in place. He has chosen, as I said, right at the outset try to have a differentiation between the opposition and the government, and he has reverted back to where the government was issued. prior to 1991. I think that is particularly regrettable. In terms of what the opposition leader to say yesterday, he is condemned by his arguments. I do not have the exact quote but, in summary, he said that imposing a specific local content condition on Telstra would be likely to be inconsistent with the governHolt ment's obligations under the GATT arrangeGellibrand ments. So there is a recognitionMr Lee-You have only got three minutes until you end.",34
55,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I might have to the move for an extension of time. You might charitable in that regard. So that is the inconup sistency from the Leader of the Opposition. to There are a range of other issues such as shares A and B and flexibility of process. In fact, the answer is that the bill does provide option. If you read the bill carefully, you can see that that is still an option, once we go look through the sale scheme and get the and the results of the scoping study. With regard to the 1997 regulations, suggesParty tion has been made that the government cannot sell part of Telstra because the post1997 competitive regime will not be in place. The government is committed to having a place on an open competitive environment prior to the partial sale and, as the Minister Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) recently indicated, the government is aiming to have post-1997 legislation in place by the end of 1996. You will have a chance to discuss those issues then. I will deal with your ISDN issue. If you are going to move your amendment on that point, I will deal with it then. Mr Lee-If the minister would like, I am He happy to move an extension of time.",34
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"You cannot do it until time has expired. Just restrain your enthusiasm, member for Dobell.",34
57,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"The government recognises that it is critical to the sale that the regulatory environment be in place to prior to the sale. That is recognised, and obviously that is important for the terms of the prospectus that ultimately will need to be There are a couple of other points I want to make finally. That is, there has been a passing had parade of people involved in these issues own since I have been involved since 1984, but two of the notable exceptions from the people who spoke during this debate were former telecommunications ministers, the member for (Mr Gareth Evans) and the member for (Mr Willis). I found it rather interesting that particularly Mr Willis, the former Treasurer, did not speak on this matter because there did not seem to be in the contribution to the debate any assessment of overall economic impact. Indeed, it was be surprising that the member for Holt did not contribute in this debate as well. I find that a little regrettable. At the end of the day, in 1991 you moved this company, under your stewardship, away from being a monopoly supplier to being one that was subject to competition. (Extension of time granted) It then had the support of the opposition, with some amendments. It became a company subjected to greater competition. We have now moved down that road significantly. There has been greater competition. There is a continued commitment from the government to underpinning the changes that are proposed in this act, with a strong commitment to the enhancement of consumer safeguards and the maintenance of the usa issue. USO is a fundamental issue for this government. It has been enunciated in the act carefully. The issue with regard to foreign ownership has been spelled out very carefully in the legislation. There was not a lot of discussion about it during the debate-there were 40-:odd speakers-but it has been dealt with very carefully. Also in this legislation is the development of a broad, flexible sale scheme, subject to the results of a scoping study. This matter will move from this House, after consideration of the opposition's amendments, to the Senate. There is, of course, the broader issue of the environment, which was briefly discussed by some members of the opposition and certainly by government members, who recognise the strong and vital role of the environment and the need to upgrade it and to look to a positive financial input into the upgrading of the environment. The proposed Natural Heritage Trust, a result of the sale of one-third of Telstra, will give the capacity for a very historic decision-if it is going to be accepted by the parliament-to enhance the environment in this country. I commend the bill to the House. The issue of ISDN was raised. The government remains committed to having Telstra finalise, as soon as possible, its digitisation program. All of us understand that the centrepiece of the telecommunications system is the switching system and that the digitisation of that switching system provides the opportunity for greatly enhanced services for both ISDN and others. The digitisation program, as we progressively move towards it, will enable ISDN services to be made available to all Telstra customers who want them. I am advised that the quickest possible time frame in which this can be achieved is being pursued, and it is a matter of priority for the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Senator Alston was shadow minister in this area right up to 1993. He was also spokesman for communications in the Senate. Over the last little period, he was shadow minister, and now he is minister. He is very experienced in matters of communications. He is having discussions with Telstra. The member for Bonython, who spoke immediately before me, raised some of the technical issues and financial factors that must be considered and pursued with Telstra. It would not make sense to put this matter into legislative form until all of the details are settled. I am sure that the former minister for communications, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), having had experience in government, can understand that. A higher priority for the government is the maintenance of the minimum standard of universal service in telecommunications. As I said, we are subjecting that to review. It is a priority which is reflected in the bill's provisions reaffirming that universal service obligation. I hope that with this small extension of time. I am able to address that issue now and will not need to address it when the opposition formally moves its amendment on this matter. Thank you to all those members who contributed to a very interesting debate. I am sorry that I was not able to do justice to all the comments that were made. We, from the government side, see this as a significant . piece of legislation. We are hoping that it will now have speedy passage to the Senate to be considered. I welcome the opposition's amendments, but regret that we will not be able to facilitate lengthy debate on those matters.

62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,And they will continue to do so! Question so resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.,37
63,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I move: (1) Clause 2, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: ""2 Commencement (1) Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. (2) Schedule I shall not commence until: (a) the Government fulfils its commitment to extend the ISDN fast data link by 1 July 1997; and (b) the Telecommunications Regulations Review is complete and enacted"". This is an amendment to keep the government honest. This is an amendment to keep the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), honest in the light of his election commitment to provide the ISDN fast data link throughout Australia by 1 July 1997. This was a clear commitment provided by the Prime Minister to the National Farmers Federation and, we understand, the key commitment by which the National Party agreed to the privatisation of Telstra. Every National Party member in this place should be seriously concerned that the government is backing away from its commitment on the ISDN and that it has not made the ISDN provision an integral part of this legislation. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister gave that commitment to the National Farmers Federation. In his speech of 21 November last year the member for Bennelong said: Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. ... these initiatives will mean that, by mid-I997, some 97 per cent of business and household customers should have access to enhanced phone services such as call waiting, call diversion, itemised billing and advanced voice mail services as well as an on-line services delivery system that is more than 10 times faster than the existing analogue technology. It was that commitment to the bush that seduced the National Party into agreeing to the privatisation of Telstra. It was that commitment to regional Australia that convinced members of the National Party that they should be supporting the privatisation of this major public asset. I would have thought that, if every National Party member in this House is a good representative of their constituents, they would support this Labor Party amendment. They will keep the Prime Minister honest. They will keep this government honest. They will fulfil their most important commitment to rural Australia-that is, to allow schools in the bush, to allow community - organisations in the bush and to allow small businesses, farmers and families in the bush to have the sort of on-line services and the high quality technology that urban Australia is now taking for granted. If you believe in One Nation and if you believe in rural Australia receiving the same telecommunication services as the rest of Australia, you will support this Labor Party amendment. I would have thought it critical for the Prime Minister on this major piece of privatisation legislation to show the people of Australia that he keeps his promises and that he is honest John. We are trying to keep honest John honest when it comes to the provision of the ISDN service and the promise that he made to the National Farmers Federation. There is a suggestion around the parliament that the Expenditure Review Committee is adopting an unusual approach to election promises. If it has a dollar sign next to itthat is, if it was costed in the coalition election costings-it is something they are going to try to fulfil come budget night. Apparently, if it does not have a dollar sign next to it, it is being regarded as a category B promisethat is, a promise made only to be broken. This clause was a promise made by the Prime Minister to seduce the National Party into supporting the privatisation of Telstra. Come election night, he found that he did not need the National Party because the Liberal Party had a majority in this House in its own right. The National Party has been dumped. The promise has been forgotten. The ERC has it under category B-promises made only to be broken-and rural and regional Australia has been forgotten. We are interested in keeping them honest on this commitment. Part (b) of the amendment that has been circulated calls on the government to ensure that schedule 1 does not commence until the telecommunications regulations review is complete and enacted. I am happy to address that in another fiveminute contribution shortly.",37
64,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I support the amendment of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) which is before the House at the moment. Today the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), let the cat out of the bag. We always wondered how the Liberal Party was able to convince the members of the National Party to agree to the sale of Telstra, given the impact that it will have on telephone users in the bush. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) convinced the National Farmers Federation and the National Party members to allow. the and privatisation of Telstra by way of a promise he made in a speech to the National Farmers Federation on 21 November last year. Up until half an hour ago, that promise was still valid. The member for Bass, the minister at 1 July 1997. the table, was the one who announced to the parliament and to the people of Australia that John Howard was walking away from the fortune. promise that got the National Party to agree to the sale of Telstra. On 21 November the Prime Minister made a promise right throughTelstra out rural Australia. He said: Today I announce that a Coalition Government require Telstra to offer all of its customers have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 date. That was the promise from 21 November until half an hour ago. Half an hour ago the table, minister at the table did not say, 'Wherever you live, if you are connected to a digital exchange you get the high-speed ISDN data links.' He said simply that, under the Liberal Party, Telstra would try to achieve that soon as possible. From November until half an hour ago the promise was to achieve it 1 July 1997, accelerate the investment prosoon gram and bring it forward from the year 2000. Mr Leo MCLeay-Another broken promlast ise.",38
65,Mr LEE,Unknown,"-It is another broken promise, as the member for Watson says. They have the gall to come in here and say, 'It used to be ·1 July next year, but now it is as soon as possible. We have confidence in the Liberal Party because Richard Alston is an experiseems enced minister.' He is the one thumping table at Frank Blount, slamming ·Frank Blount into the floor and demanding that Frank Blount do more to carry out the construction program. The result of all this is not a direction to say, 'You've got to achieve the Prime Minister'S promise because the Prime Minister's word is very important.' Instead the Liberal Party will jawbone Frank Blount try to achieve that as soon as possible. It is an outrageous breach of faith of the Australian people, particularly with people who live in rural and provincial Australia. They were promised these high-speed data links by We know why you are trying to walk away from it. It is because it will cost an absolute It was a ridiculous promise. It was a promise that means that Telstra will have to accelerate its capital investment program. estimates that it will cost at least $1.4 billion to bring forward that capital investwill ment. In addition, you have no idea as to how who many people will want to take up ISDN. Even if only one in four people in the bush take up ISDN, it will cost $4 billion. That was the promise that the Prime Minister made to the by National Farmers Federation-a multibillion target dollar promise that was active from 21 November until about half past 11 today. Up until half an hour ago the minister at the the member for Bass, said to all of his constituents-all the people who. live in the different parts of the electorate of Bass, on Flinders Island or wherever they happen to be-that the Prime Minister had promised as they would have access to ISDN. You have now told them that they will not have access by by 1 July 1997; they will have access only as as possible. It is not good enough. We are going to make sure that you are put under pressure to keep the promises you made at the election, and we are going to make sure that you provide those high-speed data links to people wherever they may live.  by pointed out in my modest contribution to this debate on the Telstra legislation, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to set great store on the new directors the that would be appointed to Telstra in its privati sed form and the contribution that they would make. As there is no power of ministerial direction to uphold this commitment to ISDN, could I ask the minister to explain to the House the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Telstra. Will their prime responsibility be to the shareholders? In honouring this commitment to ISDN, to what extent would a conflict be resolved if it would cause undue financial pressure, presumably because of the added competition that is forecast in 1997, on the financial viability of the company? As far as I am concerned, the proposal that everyone should have access",39
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Vaile)Order! The member for Chifley might stop there. You would be aware of the context of the amendment that has been moved by the member for Werriwa and I would advise you that you are required to address your comments to that amendment specifically.  know where I am erring. I am really referring to the ISDN.,40
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"You are talking about the board of directors and the amendment to ISDN. Restrict your comments to the amendment, please.  Dobell (Mr Lee) pointed out that it will be a huge financial commitment for Telstra to fulfil the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I do not think that is being debated by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), at the table. I have asked, in relation to the directors and their fiduciary responsibility, whether the minister could explain the government's prime responsibility if a conflict arose with the financial viability of the organisation. Is it their responsibility to honour this commitment or their commitment to the shareholders? Secondly, if there is a conflict in implementing this commitment in the absence of ministerial direction, what is the position of the directors? . I was actually speaking in favour of the Prime Minister's election promise when I was pulled up by your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are a number of people on this side of the House, if not all, who are very genuine about making sure that people, no matter where they live-whether they are in poorer electorates like mine and those of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) or in rural and regional Australia like the electorates of the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the member for Dobell or the member for Bass-are not deprived of access to communications. We support the proposition the Prime Minister announced. All I am asking is that the government and the minister acknowledge that he no longer has power of ministerial direction once this bill goes through. I think my question is quite proper and in order, and I look forward to the minister's response.",40
68,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"I too rise in support of the amendment to the Telstra bill put forward by the opposition. I do agree with the member for Chifley (Mr Price). I took some notes when the debate was being handled by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith). At no time did he refer to what was going to happen with ministerial control after this bill has gone through the House. At no time did he give a guarantee that an instruction would be provided by the government as to what was to be achieved and when the ISDN fast data link would be happening. As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has brought to the attention of the House, we now finally know that it will no longer be the date that was given in a commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Taking it out of his own mouth, the minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass, in reply, stated very clearly and very succinctly that it would be as soon as possible. Under whose direction will it be as soon as possible? Obviously, when you read the bill, it will not be at the direction of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) because the minister has no power whatsoever to direct the directors once this bill becomes law. The bill certainly says a lot about achievements and what will happen as far as the rights of the individual are concerned in getting access, but at no time, other than in this commitment that was given .prior to the election, does it say that the ISDN fast data link would be achievable right across Australia in 1997. One area which is of concern to me is that, there being no commitment now being provided by the government to having no ministerial direction of the ISDN, one has only to look to other parts of the world to see what has happened when telecommunications systems have been privatised. We can now proudly say that, because 90 per cent of our telecommunications is owned by the government, we cover something like 97 per cent of our country. In Britain, massive staff cuts occurred during their privatisation and now, if you look at the access of services, something like 10 per cent of that country is not covered with access to telecommunications. Mr Warwick Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not think the member is being relevant to the particular issue with regard to the ISDN and the substantial amendment the opposition is making. I ask that the member speak directly to the matter. We are under a time pressure.",40
69,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,I was being very relevant.,41
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Vaile)The member for Prospect would be aware that I did make this same point to the member for Chifley-that is, the amendment that has been moved is in relation to the provision of ISDN.",41
71,Mrs CROSIO,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am well aware of it. I have the amendment in my hand. For the information of the minister, I am now referri-g to clause 2, which s t at e s : ' (2) Schedule I shall not commence until the Government fulfils its commitment to extend Brough, M. T. the ISDN fast data link by 1 July 1997. My remarks were certainly in reference to that. My remarks were also in reference to the fact that when you privatise a telecommunications system you have no guarantees of delivery. Rightly so, you have a board of directors responsible to shareholders and you have shareholders who have invested to make a profit. There is no commitment in this legislation that the minister will direct this promise be fulfilled. This promise was a commitment of the now government. It will not be fulfilled other than, as the minister said, as soon as possible. We believe that this must be fulfilled. This action should not commence until the commitment given by the government is completed by 1 July 1997. It is very important for this country that the ISDN be fast-tracked and that we have accessibility right across Australia. I am very concerned about this particular clause in the bill, and that is why I stand up here and support the opposition and the amendment it has moved.",41
72,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (Midday)-I want to move that the amendment be now put. However, I note that I responded to the ISDN issues in the summing up by giving leave to the opposition for an extension of time.

GOVERNOR-GENERAVS SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 6 May, on motion by Mrs Gash: AYES That the following address-in-reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",47
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Vaile)Before I call the honourable member for Calare, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask L. the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. NOES Mr ANDREN (Calare) (1.13 p.m.}-It is with great pride that I address this House as an independent member of the 38th Parliament since Federation. Had it not been for the dedicated help and encouragement of my supporters and family, particularly my wife Jenny and sons, Greg and Josh, this moment would not have been possible. I must begin with congratulations to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition on their resounding win in the recent election. I also congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, and the Second Deputy Speaker, Mr Jenkins. Please pass on my congratulations also to the Speaker. May we all give you the support you deserve to achieve the fairest possible debate in the parliamentary period ahead. Five Independents will figure in that debate. According to my research, that is the greatest number of non-aligned Independents elected to one parliament since Federation. The last PAIRS parliament benefited from the wisdom of Independent Ted Mack, to whom lowe a deep debt of gratitude for his advice and support. I hope to contribute as he did to advancing the cause of democratic parliamentary representation in this chamber. I have heard encouraging words in recent days about a commitment to a better, fairer and more democratic parliament than has occurred in recent history. I believe the electorate has also spoken finnly on this issue in the recent election. Rather than a ringing endorsement of the policies of the new government, the electorate rejected a Labor government and a Prime Minister seen to be out of touch and arrogant. Where there was a convincing third option for voters, they took it and elected five Independents and increased the support for the Democrats in the Senate. In a world that is becoming more confusing, more threatening, far more violent and less personal by the day, people need leadership from politicians who will hear their calls regardless of the political implications. Such a test of our resolve to create a more caring, less violent Australia must surely be a unanimous commitment to uniform gun laws when police ministers meet tomorrow in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. And anticipating less than unanimous support from the states, I call too for an early referendum to test whether Australians want the Commonwealth to take control of gun supply and ownership-and the making and distribution .of violent videos. Despite some academic claims to the contrary, my extensive media background suggests that brutal behaviour and the video pornography of violence are closely linked. Lest one side or the other in this place believes it has a mortgage on common sense, might I warn that the traditional role of parties in Australian politics is under strong challenge. There is a growing awareness in the electorate that honest, effective representawhere tion of constituents' interests can be achieved through channels other than political parties. Inflexible ideology on either side will bring swift retribution. People want fair and reasonable government, no domination by one school of thought whether it be union or rationalist economics. People expect government participation and support in their lives, as much as they respect the value of private enterprise for fair return, provided it both rewards the entrepreneur and is beneficial to the common wealth. That brings me to some of the issues of national importance relevant to my area' of . central western New South Wales, issues involving both private and government responsibilities that I propose to pursue during this parliamentary term. Calare is a rural division extending from Oberon in the southeast, to Yeoval in the north-west, to Eugowra in the south-west and to tiny Bylong in the north-east. It was at Bylong a week or so ago where I gladly lost some money for local charity on several long priced entrants in the annual mouse races, surely the epitome of rural ingenuity. Calare contains the local government areas of Lithgow, Oberon, Rylstone, Bathurst, Blayney, Evans, Cabonne and parts of Wellington, with major industries including education, timber, mining, cement, wool top making, whitegoods, food and pet food manufacturing, tourism to a veritable gold mine of attractions and, of course, farming, especially fruit growing and grazing. However, the viability of much of this industry is under threat from short-sighted economic policies. Of grave concern is the breakdown of infrastructure in the regions. Unless national governments inject capital into regional Australia or offer greater incentives for private capital to take a larger role in the regions then the smaller towns, and the larger centres, are at grave risk of further economic decline. We need to inject far more into local government by way of untied grants for projects that are crucial to small and large communities. By that I mean projects such as the Eugowra sewerage augmentation scheme a struggling and ageing rural community cannot sustain even the most basic of infrastructure, rights that most Australians take for granted. While mining is a seductive job deliverer to a depressed rural economy, we must not assume that quarrying our resources is the only key to regional development. We must measure the long-term benefits and retain and strengthen a federal environment review process to oversee all mining or resource extraction that makes a significant impact on the national environment. I do not believe the parochial interests of state governments, and particularly local governments, are far enough removed from such projects to enable objective assessment. Economic rationalism and downsizing of government involvement in the economy, a philosophy to which the three major parties in this country are captive, is counterproductive in country areas like Orange where public sector jobs have been slashed without regard for the type of service delivered by those former public servants. In this case in Orange it was state agriculture department staff. Those people provide an essential service for the economic well-being of farmer clients. Nor does it take into account the money those forgone salaries inject into the local economy. At a federal level we see the planned removal of the Australian Taxation Office from regional centres, ostensibly because a more cost efficient, electronic service is available. This is the brave new world of public service where the elderly, the computer illiterate, the struggling business operator, fanner, the tax student and the tax agent are all expected to seek advice via a toll-free This has nothing to do with public service, it has much to do with ignoring the real requirements of regional Australia. That is the service infrastructure under threat. On the other hand, we see the deliberate dismantling of publicly owned concrete infrastructure. With the demise of the New South Wales branch rail system over the past decade, the western rail line from Sydney to Broken Hill is a national asset which is now under grave threat. For years the responsibility for the line has been buck-passed between federal and state governments, and downgraded to the extent that it is now a disincentive to private users. Meanwhile, the multibillion dollar trucking business has grown on the back of this neglect of rail, causing massive road damage to systems not designed for the size or frequency of such heavy freight cartage. The more enlightened trucking operators want to integrate road and rail operations, and movers of bulk materials, such as CSR Oberon, tell me that it would be far more cost efficient to transport export products straight to the wharves by rail. The government is reluctant to meet the commercial users halfway by guaranteeing fair access to the rail network. Indeed, the madness of this approach dictates that the community service obligations of governments are virtually eliminated. Nowhere are the costs of trucks on roads-or the absence of trains on tracks carrying bulk and hazardous freight-factored into the bottom line. Can we afford not to maintain the existing national rail network in this country? Indeed, can we afford not to expand it, thus maintaining rail and freight jobs in regional centres along the way? Unless the Commonwealth government re-enters the infrastructure business, this country will never develop to its full potential, and most of that potential lies in regional Australia in areas like Cal are. A substantial re-regulation of the financial system is required to ensure that essential capital flows into the public sector to serve the the public good. Private lending institutions create credit for private, often unproductive, line. profit-credit that is also responsible for importation of consumer goods at the expense of local jobs. We should restore parliament's right to create national credit for national projects which become part of the nation's wealth as assets. We should also tax foreign exchange transactions and legislate to access the $60 billion of Australian superannuation funds that should be helping to develop this country, and not being invested offshore. Private enterprise will be a partner in developing regional Australia if the infrastructure is in place. I am not talking about 150 per cent tax write-offs for investors in vineyard projects. I am talking about public credit like government bonds created to maintain income, positive infrastructure such as our transcontinental rail links or a nationally funded Great WesternMid Western Highway with rail-road container interchanges, or a Parkes inland freight airport. I notice that the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) is in the chamber. I appreciate his presence. This latter project, while outside my electorate, will have a huge impact on industry in our area, and is of major national importance. Yet this scheme may also be killed off by the economic rationalists before it gets off the ground. From the briefings I have had with the Inland Marketing Corporation, which is overseeing and promoting this regional agricultural development project, I believe it is a national value-adding asset without peer. It would not only provide an international airfreight airport to deliver overseas markets, particularly in Asia, but it would tie in with a revitalised main western rail line and a north-south Newell Highway, to create a truly integrated rail-road-air cargo network. Many hundreds of jobs-potentially thousands---<:ould be generated by this multifaceted agricultural project that would ensure we became a reliable supplier of the cleanest, freshest and greenest foodstuffs to those emerging tiger economies to the north, and beyond in Europe. I can foresee an extension of this project an international passenger airport, revitalising the regional airline industry, and complemented by a very fast train from Parkes to Sydney. It is an airport complex which most in western New South Wales really want, believe it or not. Why throw billions at an airport in western Sydney that few want? Let us become creative and, I believe, truly economically rational by developing our transport infrastructure to meet the requirements of the new century and, at the same time, help regenerate regional Australia, from which our agricultural and mineral wealth is derived. We cannot leave the regions to the forces of the level playing field. We need to protect our manufacturing plants, like Email at Orange and the Commonwealth-owned Australian Defence Industries in Lithgow. We need to protect emerging value-adding industry in regional areas, especially wool textiles. Email's market share is threatened by tariff concession cuts to imports, despite the changes in the last few days; while the 100 per cent Commonwealth owned ADI is chasing diminishing arms contracts when it has the capacity to train young locals in metal manufacturing of a range of import replacing components. Returns to farmers have been negative in seven of the past 10 years and the National Party has sold out its constituency by following the Liberal-Labor economic rationalist level playing field path. Our national competition policy is becoming so efficient that wool growers are competing against their own product in the marketplace and the level playing field is so level that Orange district fruit juice cannot compete against the importproduce rapidly to ed product. The regional social infrastructure too has suffered dramatically as we head down this brave new world of 'winners only survive' economics. Unfortunately, the less than clever have no role in this new world. Where are the jobs for the 50 per cent perhaps of people, who, through no fault of their own, find they are on the wrong side of the normal distribution curve of intelligence and ability in this so-called clever age? Where do they fit in? We once had a manufacturing base like to ADI at Lithgow that involved many of these people in the work force as process workers and doing the manual jobs. Where have they gone? We cannot retrain most of the older displaced workers. There is nothing for the young who are not clever or lucky except a series of work skills programs. We have a national youth unemployment rate around 30 per cent, if you can believe the figures, and an overall unemployment rate officially about eight per cent and sure to go up. The figures are almost the same as they were when the coalition handed over the reins of government to Labor in 1983. Whatever the job creation in that time, it has not provided for the notso-clever who are the victims of the modem competition at all costs, economic rationalism, survival of the fittest regime. If we do not devise ways of providing meaningful employment for these people, we are socially doomed. We cannot bemoan the anti-social behaviour of those whose own society and economic system cannot provide them with a job or a life beyond mindless videos. We have a rampant cancer in our society. The inability to provide gainful employment for our young is a major cause. We need to be far more creative in our work programs. We need to provide not 26-week work skilling, but perhaps three-year long, two days a week commitments. Participants can be employed in projects that would enable a long-term belonging to a work team and a venture that would yield obvious results. I recently saw long-term unemployed coming off a project near Molong-nowhere near completed-a landcare project that could have a permanent employment team, that certainly would benefit from a long-term commitment. But no, they had to move back to the welfare queues with a certificate to make room for the next group. Of course, they cannot qualify for a similar project for another 18 months. It is soul destroying. I have heard from some of these people. They wish they had never started-rather than to have experienced the team work, to have part completed the job and then to be abandoned. Unless we review our economic policies, we will never again approach full employment. There are at least one million people in this country who want to work and who cannot. Surely there is something wrong with the system that created this. Young people in particular with no real prospects of productive employment not only bitterly resent the society that cannot share its wealth with them but also are being constantly bombarded by media messages telling them how successful they should be. There are only winners. Anger sets in, and if you happen to be black in this country, particularly in regional Australia, your race marginalises you even further. The result, in many cases, is violence, selfforeign abuse through drugs and alcohol, vandalism, and a widening gulf between the haves and the have-nots-between the 'me too' class and the 'up you' class. Is this the legacy of the rational new world economy, of the level playing field? Is this really the country with the greatest natural assets and resources in world? Is this the price we pay for international competitiveness by downsizing, corporatising, privati sing, adopting world best practice and handing manufacturing over to the countries with the cheapest labour? Where, I ask, is this mythical country where world best practice is practised? Did the economic zealots who created a world series market to be played for on this level playing field consider those in our society who cannot even make the bench for this game or any future match? We in regional Australia need help from central government for the regions to rebuild their industries and we need a new consensus whereby all states cooperate to highlight a regional development agenda that would involve a sharing of investment. Unless we get this state cooperation in the interests of the nation, our limited resources will be wasted and the opportunities lost in mindless political struggles between the states. While on the subject of states, the only piece of economic rationalism we should adopt, I believe, is to rationalise them right out of existence. If we are serious about constitutional reform, let us look seriously at the costs caused by the duplication-and duplicity--of the states. Stronger regional government with roughly equal populations to administer and an equal share of the federal tax take is the only logical way we should go in any constitutional reform. The current republic debate is a furphy, given the substantial reforms needed to really make us nationally cooperative and economically efficient. Such reform would even out opportunity and bring government closer to the people, making it so much more accountable. It would enable us to focus on a cooperative national goal rather than state of origin footie matches. As we develop new national infrastructure, funded by national credit and not debt to interests, let us also hold on to the remaining shareholding of the publicly owned assets we now retain. The folly of selling off our silverware to pay debts would be laughable were it not so serious. The latest folly is the partial the privatisation of Telstra, which I believe can only penalise my constituents and the nation. It sounds a bit like part-pregnant, doesn't it? The opposition, the former government, is equally guilty because it too has gone down the same path in selling off Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, opposing the Telstra privatisation only when it became politically fruitful to do so. I do not believe any serious investor will want part of Telstra; they will want the lot. Can you imagine Murdoch wanting only the front paddock of the most productive lucerne flat property in Australia? I believe that we should fund the environment by hanging on to Telstra and we should legislate so that $250 million of that $1 billion per year is dedicated to the environment. Retain the ownership of that great organisation and it can bankroll the environment to infinity. To my father and mother, both deceased, thanks for the strength and guidance that brought me here to this place. May my colleagues in the 38th Parliament of Australia embrace the feeling my parents had for this country and represent all Australians: those with skills and those without, those with means and those without. Unless we provide for all, with real opportunities and not just handouts, then the profits, the growth and dividends we create are a fraud, a mirage.",49
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Andrew)Before 1 call the honourable member for Lindsay, 1 remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (1.33 p.m.)-I speak this afternoon representing the electors of Lindsay, who for the first time since the seat was created in 1983 have elected a Liberal representative. On 2 March 1996, in a landslide swing, 1 caught up a difference of 16,500 votes and was duly elected to parliament. 1 stand here today as the living testimonial of the mass defection the true believers from a party that had become hidebound, unresponsive, unsympathetic, unrepresentative and too busy playing political football to listen to the ordinary battler. Lindsay is full of ordinary battlers: PAYE taxpayers, paying off a mortgage, who are concerned about interest rates; people who are concerned about providing for their old age; people who want to give their children more than they had themselves; people who are working so hard and still not getting ahead. That was the recurring complaint 1 heard everywhere on the campaign trail, from families trying to raise three kids on a single income; from families trying to raise kids on two incomes; from people with their own business, trade or shop; from people employing others. They were saying, 'I am working so hard and Ijust don't seem to be able to get ahead.' And that is odd, because throughout our proud history Australians have always given the next generation a better deal than the last generation, and it would be a pity for this fine tradition to end with my generation, the X generation. And that is why I am here. The people of Lindsay did not make a mistake on 2 March. They voted to have their representative in government, not in opposition. The area has traditionally reflected the political tide of the times. The most renowned of the previous representatives for this area in federal parliament was Labor's icon, Ben Chifley. The Labor Party that lost on 2 March was not his party and it did not represent his people. Others who have represented this area include Reg Gillard and Tony Luchetti, both true representatives of the people who worked hard for them, and my immediate predecessor, Ross Free. The people of Lindsay traditionally prefer their representatives in power where they can be effective rather than in opposition where the Labor Party was doomed to be after 2 March. They want a representative who is part of a truly representative government, a government which has input from all walks of life, all ethnic groups, all generations and all denominations. Looking around the chamber at this 1996 of government of John Howard, it is truly the broad church he has been striving to create. John Howard's government has more female members of parliament than any other government in the history of this country. We have the first Greek born member elected to parliament, the first Maltese born member elected to parliament and the youngest parliamentarian ever. We have more Catholics than ever before, and all this from a party which had the first female MP, the first Aboriginal senator, the first senator from a non-English speaking background and is soon to have the first physically disabled senator. There is no stereotypical Liberal. The people here with me today are from all walks of life-housewives, social workers, businesswomen, people from the military, married, single, childless, people with eight kids, grown up kids, grandkids and kids under five. Whatever the bell curve in society is, it is reflected here in John Howard's government. I am confident that I am in a star team and not on a team of stars. As a sportswoman who has won national and international titles in rowing and worn the green and gold to represent my country, I know that a star team is what it takes to achieve. This government is a star team. I am excited and honoured by the responsibility the people of Lindsay have given me in making me a part of this exciting new era in Australian politics. In this context, I would like to congratulate the Speaker on his appointment as Speaker of the House and welcome his attempt to maintain as much independence as the opposition will allow. I recognise that with his military background he will be able to, ensure that suitable standards are maintained, and I query why there is no honour role for members of parliament who have served their country in war. Our experienced parliamentarians are not settling old scores, although the standard of political debate in this House has reached childish levels of personal attack and vilificaordinary tion. They retain no animosity and are focused on bringing about a lift in standards and introducing the change that this new government was mandated to bring about. Let us not be afraid of these changes because change is inevitable. If you do not allow for it, then it will hit you like a Mack truck down the road away. Let us not be afraid of the pace of these changes either because the technology and information available today mean that change will only happen with increasing speed in the future, and the people of Lindsay want a young government that knows where the information superhighway is going, because unless you know where you are going then it is pretty hard to plan to be there and you become the victim of progress and not the ma:ster of it. At the beginning of this year, the Labor Party had lost its way, broken by factional infighting and the stagnation of incumbency. It failed to respond to the rapid social changes that are occurring in Lindsay. It is out of touch with the X generation, those in the mortgage belt, those who are finding they have to resort to the Department of Social Security for the first time and those who are concerned about the environment that we must leave to our future generations. The people of Lindsay want leaders who will set out a definite plan of where we are going after close community consultation and who will then implement that program with minimal adjustment to achieve the goal. The people of Lindsay and I have opted for honest John Howard and his vision of Australia, free of debt with an AAA credit rating. The people of Lindsay thought very hard about the decision they made on 2 March. They know tough times are ahead; they know you cannot spend more than you earn. They live within their means and they expect governments to do the same because in the end it is their money that governments are spending. They know that the last government was spending more than it earned for the last six consecutive budgets. In fact, in the three years prior to the 2 March election, it was sneakily increasing the revenue raised from sales tax by 40 per cent. This meant that the battlers, such as the people of Lindsay, in spending their hard-earned cash had to fund the previous government's overspending. The people of Lindsay voted knowing full well that the new government would not introduce any sneaky revenue-raising schemes but would sensibly live within its means and go on being tough-and the going is going to be tough-bearing in mind that there is a $100 billion Commonwealth debt to service. It is going to be tough, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going. I know the pomp and ceremony here in Parliament House is overwhelming. There is the danger of getting too used to the Comcars, the room service, the flash offices, the guttered roads and all the mod cons that insulate you from the failing small businesses, unemployment, bankruptcy, soup kitchens and the despair and depression of our youth. But eventually you must go back to the real world. If you have not looked after your real world in your electorate as you should have, then this prospect may frighten you. I know I was frightened in 1993 when I returned to western Sydney after three years in the armed forces in Asia. I could not believe the lack of growth in this country compared with that providing the cranes on the horizon in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Bangkok. But what frightened me most was the lack of confidence in our economy, the hesitation in our expenditure, the uncertainty in the faces in the street, the lack of hope in the eyes of our young and the squandered potential of a great nation. And this is a great nation. Since the 1700s people have been coming here to carve out a new life for themselves and they have succeeded. The early immigrants settling around Parramatta brought with them hope for a new life for their children and for the opportunity of a better living standard. They gradually moved west across the Cumberland plain to the imposing escarpment of the lower Blue Mountains and by 1813 Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth had found their way across the escarpment with the help of local Aboriginals. Whilst the immigration to this country has developed it to one of the leading nations in this region, we must not forget our responsibility to the indigenous people, something which the previous government gave a lot of rhetoric to but in fact did very little about. As I drive towards Lindsay, heading along the M4, I am always impatient to see the escarpment of the lower Blue Mountains. That is when I know that in 10 minutes I will be near the Nepean River which is one of the true wonders of this world. For a rower it is obviously one of the world-class sites for training and it is one of the few venues chosen outside of Homebush for the Olympic Games. For a water skier, a jet skier, a kayaker or a fisherman, it is truly one of the most magic spots on this earth. The air always gets better out there as you come out of the Sydney smog. It is a great place to live. It has a great lifestyle and a very rustic, rural atmosphere. It has many historic sites from the early settlers. It also has magnificent shopping and is only an hour to the flash and dash of Sydney and only a short way further to the beaches. On the other hand, within an hour you can get up to Katoomba and the Three Sisters for some of the most magnificent bushwalks in Australia and some of the most magnificent environmental national parks this country has created. Lifestyle is important. Lifestyle is important to the people of Lindsay and it is important to the next generation. That lifestyle includes the ability to choose your own work hours, your own work ethics and your own environment that you wish to live in. The people of Lindsay put their trust in me because I love Lindsay, I love the lifestyle it offers and I love the environment. I wish to preserve it for future generations. I will battle the tax burden that has left the struggling family providers of Lindsay scratching their heads, wondering why they cannot get ahead. I will battle the red tape of regulations that has caused the owners of small businesses in Lindsay to work exceptionally long hours for less pay than their employees just so they can keep all of their staff in work. I will battle the inequitable industrial relations laws that have kept so many young people out of a job and I will battle anyone who disregards the environment that we leave to future generations. It was a brave decision by the people of Lindsay to put their trust in someone as relatively unknown as me. I am a jack-of-alltrades-or is that a jackie-of-all-trades? However, I will give them this commitment. I will not let them down. If they are working hard, I will be working harder. I have a track record of working hard to achieve results. But it takes more than hard work these days, it takes support from federal, state and local governments to provide an opportunity to get ahead, to consolidate your gains and to keep them. Government needs to get out of people's faces and start being more consultative, responsive and progressive. I was in the military when I joined the Liberal Party in 1994. I come from a swinging family. It was not in my nature to question the leadership of this country; it was not something I was trained to do. It was not a decision I made lightly. My mum has voted Liberal, Labor, Independent and Democrat. Good on you, mum. She· supported Bob Hawke but always she went for the person that she felt would best run the country. Mum and dad have always encouraged me, and everyone, to be independent, to do the right thing. Mum, I know that you look with pride on your daughter in the ranks of this Liberal Party. You and dad saw the potential in Australia and migrated here with a young family . We have come a long way and we have done well as Australians. I have given up my career for the people of Lindsay. There is no going back. I will fight for their interests because in the end I must return to live amongst them and I will do that with my head held high. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA General Purpose Standing Committees",54
92,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Flinders-Leader of the House) (1.47 p.rn.}-Before I proceed, I congratulate the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) on her speech. It was a first class speech. We look forward to hearing many more speeches from the member for Lindsay from the government benches in the parliament. It says a lot about the Labor Party: here we have another one of the many women on our side whose election they are challenging. At the same time, in the seat of Blaxland they are putting another bloke in. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: what relevance does this have",57
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Andrew)Order! The Chief Opposition Whip should know better than that. He will remain seated until he has the call. The Leader of the House will resume his seat. Does the Chief Opposition Whip have a point of order? Mr Leo MCLeay-Yes. My point of order is that I do not know the relevance of the matter the minister was addressing. He should be dealing with parliamentary committees.,57
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The Chief Opposition Whip takes a spurious point of order. I concede that the matter the Leader of the House was dealing with had no immediate relevance. I also feel that the House has sufficient tolerance, particularly following a first speech, to allow the minister that sort of grace. I call the Leader of the House.",57
95,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I move: That standing order 28B be amended to read: General purpose standing committees 28B. (a) General purpose standing committees shall be appointed at the commencement of each Parliament as follows: (i) Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; (ii) Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform; (iii) Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training; (iv) Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts; (v) Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs; (vi) Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration; (vii) Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology; (viii) Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; and (ix) Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. (b) A standing committee appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be empowered to inquire mto and report on any matters referred to it by either the House or a Minister including any pre-legislation proposal, bill, motion, petition, vote or expenditure, other financial matter, report or paper. Annual reports of government departments and authorities tabled in the House shall stand referred to the relevant committee for any inquiry the committee may wish to make. Reports shall stand referred to committees in accordance with a schedule tabled by the Speaker to record the areas of responsibility of each committee: Provided that: (i) any question concerning responsibility for a report or a part of a report shall be determined by the Speaker; and (ii) the period during which an inquiry concerning an annual report may be commenced by a committee shall end on the day on which the next annual report of that Department or authority is presented to the House. (c) Each committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of 14 members, with membership of each committee reflecting the proportion of government to nongovernment Members in the House, namely, nine government and five non-government Members. Each committee may be supplemented with up to three members for a particular inquiry. Government members are to be nominated by the Chief Government Whip or Whips and non-government members are to be nominated by the Chief Opposition Whip or Whips in consultation with any minority group or other nongovernment Member. In the event of disagreement in the nominations, the disagreement shall be notified to the Speaker who shall infonn the House and the House shall determine the matter: Provided that if the appropriate numbers of government and non-government members have been nominated and the committee has met and elected a chair no other nomination or notification of disagreement other than in respect of the filling of a casual or supplementary vacancy shall be made. Provided further that, for the purpose of consideration of a bill referred to a committee pursuant to standing order 217A, one or more members of the committee may be replaced by other Members nominated in accordance with the provisions set out in this paragraph. The provisions for the committee to be supplemented by up to three members are not affected by this proviso. (d) Every nomination of a Member to a committee shall be forthwith notified in writing to the Speaker. (e) Each committee shall elect a government member as its chair. if) Each committee shall elect a deputy chair who shall act as chair of the committee at any time when the chair is not present at a meeting of the committee and at any time when the chair and deputy chair are not present at a meeting of the committee. the members present shall elect another member to act as chair at that meeting. (g) Three members of a committee shall constitute a quorum of that committee. (h) Each committee shall have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of three or more of its members and to refer to any subcommittee any matter which the committee is empowered to examine. (I) Each committee shall appoint the chair of each subcommittee who shall have a casting vote only and at any time when the chair of a subcommittee is not present at a meeting of the subcommittee the members of the subcommittee present shall elect another member of that subcommittee to act as chair at that meeting. (j) The quorum of a subcommittee shall be two members of that subcommittee. (k) Members of the committee who are not members of a subcommittee may participate in the public proceedings of that subcommittee but shall not vote, move any motion or be counted for the purpose of a quorum. (l) Each committee or any subcommittee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records. (m) Each committee or any subcommittee shall have power to move from place to place. (n) Any subcommittee shall have power to adjourn from time to time and to sit during any sittings or adjournment of the House. (0) Each committee or any subcommittee shall have power to authorise publication of any evidence given before it and any document presented to it. (P) Each committee shall have leave to report from time to time. (q) Each committee or any subcommittee shall have power to consider and make use of the evidence and records of the relevant standing committees appointed during previous Parliaments. (r) Each committee shall have power to confer with a similar committee of the Senate. This is the first of a series of motions to establish the committees of the parliament. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to do so this afternoon. As a matter of logistics, the debate will be interrupted by question time. We hope to conclude the debate today so that the committees can be established and commence their very important work. I am a bit disappointed that the opposition, who talk about parliamentary standards, have reverted to their previous attitude to the parliament. I am disappointed that we could not come to some sensible arrangement about the parliament's affairs today, which we had intended to do. That is a pity. Leaving that aside, the proposed change to standing order 28B will have several effects. Several of the standing committees have been retitled to reflect areas of current emphasis and concern. For example, the banking, finance and public administration committee will become the financial institutions and public administration committee; the community affairs committee becomes the family and community affairs committee; and the transport, communications and infrastructure committee becomes the communications, transport and microeconomic reform committee. A general purpose standing committee will be created to cover primary industries, resources and rural and regional affairs. This committee will cover major portfolio areas which until now have been within the responsibilities of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Its creation will reflect the importance the House attaches to these areas of great national significance and, since the election, the very large number of members, particularly from our side of the House, who represent regional Australia. The government does place very great importance on ensuring that members have the opportunity to actively participate in government and to provide the best possible representation rural and regional Australia. The membership of the standing committees will be increased to 14 with a ratio of nine government to five non-government members to reflect the proportion of government to non-government members in the House. On the advice that I have, this simply follows conventional arrangements. I have no doubt that we will hear more from the other side about how draconian and dreadful this is. The truth of the matter is that these proportions reflect the election result. People voted for this side and the consequence of that is reflected in the committee structure. We look forward to your mathematical calculations but on any fair reading of it that is appropriate. The quorum of a standing committee will be reduced from six to three. This reflects quorum of the House itself, which is 20 per cent, and the provisions elsewhere in the standing orders for quorums of three members-including in the Main Committee. As a consequence of this change, a quorum of a subcommittee would be set at two members rather than being a majority of members of a subcommittee. For those who have taken an interest in committee work-maybe some on the other side have not-this is a practical measure which, outside the House, most would probably agree was sensible. The general provisions are amended by removing the word 'statutory' from the present provision that annual reports of government departments and statutory authorities tabled in the House shall stand referred to the relevant committee for any inquiry the committee may wish to make. By removing that word 'statutory' we will open up for potential scrutiny a larger range of government funded agencies or authorities which are not established by statute. This will facilitate a broader oversight of the range of government activities and expenditure by the general purpose standing committees. I think that is a good move. My most recent experience on a parliamentary committee was on the banking committee, which was a very good committee. It has done a lot of good work. It has looked at charges set by banks for their commercial for and general customers. That is an issue of great interest to the population at large because they have to deal with banks. That committee has done a good job. In its work, that committee has actually picked up on paragraph (b), which allows for the committees to look at annual reports. That committee the has looked very closely also at monetary policy and invited the Governor of the Reserve Bank to attend its meetings from time to time. That is a very good thing and it allows the members to put aside the theatrics of the House of Representatives and actually sit down and do some constructive work in the interests of their constituents. In that regard, and in respect of monetary policy, interest rates are a real problem in the Australian economy and they have been for the 13 years. The previous administration failed to introduce policies to get interest rates down. Australia has very high real interest rates compared with most of our competitors. These committees provide a very good opportunity for members to make a sensible contribution-unlike those from the other side. More generally, the government considers the committee process and structure very important indeed. In 1987, following a paper from the then clerk, the parliament established a better arrangement for committees. That paper was endorsed by both sides of politics, and the committees do play a very important role. It gives people the opportunity to make \ , a constructive contribution as members. Also, by holding hearings and the like it gives public another opportunity to speak to the parliament and to express their point of view. Committees also have a very important in scrutinising the activities of government. Over the years, there have been some many famous and controversial cases where comsary mittees have been digging deep, reading fine print and bringing matters to public Proceedings. exposure. Whilst that is sometimes embarrassing for governments, it is a very good thing for the parliament as a whole. It is part of general supervisory role that the parliament should undertake. The committee structure is very important for backbenchers. Not only do committees help to keep ministers on their toes but they are very important for backbenchers in their contribution to the parliament as a whole.",57
96,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,Why don't you resource them?,60
97,Mr REITH,Unknown,"To conclude my picking up on'the interjections about resourcing, obviously those matters will need to be dealt with in the context of the usual budgetmotions ary round and the like. The sad fact of matter is that the previous administration us with an $8 billion black hole, and we have to deal with it. They will complain, whine and whinge and say what they will say, the truth of the matter is that these issues are eign Affairs (Mr Downer). going to have to be grappled with. We do so because we know that if we could get the government's finances in better order that would be very good for small business and for Australian families and would give them some relief from the incompetent economic policies of the former minister for finance who now finds himself as Leader of Opposition. The other question ratios, and obviously we expect that they will make a comment about that. Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, I would . like to say a few words about the other committees. That would save the time of the House and conclude the matter up until 2 o'clock.",60
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the House may proceed.,60
99,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy the Speaker. The government has decided not to proceed to re-establish the Standing Committee on Televising of the House of Representarole tives and the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies. The functions of the televising committee can be resumed when necesby House members on the Joint Statutory the Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary In the case of the long term strategies committee, established in 1990, its oversight the functions may now be better performed by the general purpose standing committees as expanded and retitled.",60
100,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,That is Barry's committee.,60
101,Mr REITH,Unknown,"It has been referred to as 'Barry's committee'. I thank the honourable member for his contribution. I am sure he is well regarded on a personal level by both sides but we do not think that the continuation of this committee is justified under the remarks by current circumstances. In respect of joint committees, the other relate to the re-establishment of four the joint standing committees, the powers and left proceedings of three joint statutory committees and the establishment of a joint standing committee on treaties as foreshadowed last but week by my colleague the Minister for For' The four joint standing committees for which the government is seeking approval to re-establish from the houses are the Joint .Standing Committee on Electoral Matters; the Joint Standing Committee on Migration; the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and the Joint Standing the Committee on the National Capital and relates to External Territories. The three joint statutory committees which require the houses to define matters relating to powers and proceedings are the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. These motions have been amended. The proportion of House members on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has been altered from 12 government members and eight non-government members to 13 and seven to better reflect proportions in the House. The membership of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has been adjusted to reflect the membership composition of other, similar sized joint committees, and quorum requirements have generally been adjusted in line with those of the House standing committees. I am very happy to commend those motions to the House.",60
102,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour this day. NA",61
103,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I inform the House that the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) will be absent from question time today. He is attending the commemorative service for the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) will answer questions on his behalf. NA Tariffs",61
104,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,My question is to the Treasurer. Is or isn't a tariff a tax?,61
105,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"A tariff is a tariff, obviously. Gun Control  the Prime Minister. I ask: could he inform the parliament of the progress so far of attempts to tighten gun laws to ensure that Australia a safer place for families, the elderly and young children?",61
106,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I think all honourable members will be aware that the Commonwealth government has put certain proposals to all of the state governments which are designed to achieve a number of fundamental goals. The first of those is the establishment of an effective nationwide registration of the ownership of guns. The second of those fundamental proposals is a significant tightening in the eligibility criteria for people to hold licences for firearms. The third of those proposals is a total prohibition throughout Australia on all automatic and all semi-automatic weapons. I should make it clear to the House that the Commonwealth government's proposal was seriously put together. It is not an ambit claim. It represents what we believe to be the collective aspiration of the Australian people at this particular time and that is why we seek the support of all state governments to our proposals. I do not pretend that achieving uniformity in this area will be easy. I acknowledge the paramountcy of the legislative authority of the states under present arrangements, but the Commonwealth is not without some authority in this matter particularly where it comes to our capacity using the customs power to prohibit the importation of certain items. I want to say to the House very seriously that I hope that tomorrow the police ministers' meeting is successful. I hope that the police ministers respond to the very strong concern throughout the Australian community, which has been expressed with rare and I think unprecedented vigour through both opinion polls and talkback radio. I know all honourable members as they move through the community would have been struck by the strength of feeling which is held in the Australian community on this issue. What we put tomorrow is our considered position. I know it carries the support of the opposition and the Australian Democrats. We are not playing games. We are not in some kind of bargaining exercise. We are genuinely seeking the cooperation of the states. They is have a role in the matter. I have had some our discussions with some Premiers. I hope the outcome of the meeting is positive but, more importantly, I am sure the Australian people will hope the outcome of the meeting is positive.",61
107,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, before I ask a question: I wholeheartedly agree with the Prime Minister's sentiments. I understand that you will consider later a matter of public importance that will emphasise the point that he made about the opposition's attitude to the proposals he is putting forward and there will be an opportunity for the House to say something about that.",61
108,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is to the Treasurer. I ask: has he seen the news release by the National Farmers Federation which states: The National Farmers' Federation says the Government's decision to tamper with the Tariff Concession Scheme is still 'dreadful policy'. because it represents higher taxes on Australian rural industry. Has he also seen the comments made by his associate, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, who conceded it was 'totally correct to say the removal of the tariff concession orders was an extra tax onbusiness'? Is he aware that the ABS defines customs duty on imports as taxes? Is he aware that the Treasury budget papers have always described them as taxes-for example, in Budget Paper No. 1 1995-96-and there are at least five High Court cases explicitly determining them to be taxes? When is he going to admit that a tariff is a tax? By standing up as he did a moment ago he is attempting to say that a duck is a duck, when in fact in his particular case he is demonstrating himself to be a Treasury quack.",62
109,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition lost me when he got on to ducks. Is a duck a tax? No, in answer to that question, a duck is a duck. During the election campaign-on 11 February 1996-the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, on behalf of the Labor Party, announced that the tariff concession system would be abolished. Mr Gareth Evans-We lost.",62
110,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"'We lost'. Oh, really? There is a bit of reality entering the backbench on the other side, if I may say so. He announced that the tariff concession system would be abolished and that five per cent would apply to all of the imports brought in under the tariff concession system. During the election campaign, relying on the advice put in that press release, we said we would adopt it, that is, we would totally abolish the tariff concession system, which would mean an increase of a minimum of five per cent on all of the goods entered under that system.",62
111,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"-What have you done? Tariffs Mr COSTELLO-What have we done? Reduced it. Instead of having it at five per cent, we have introduced it at three per cent. So what is your complaint? We have reduced the level by 40 per cent. If you had been elected, it would have been five per cent; under our proposal, it is three per cent. That is a 40 per cent reduction. I have to say, on behalf of this side of the House, that we are very pleased to have already achieved a 40 per cent reduction on business inputs. We are entirely proud to have been able to do that. Mr Gareth Evans-No new taxes.",62
112,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"No, you do not inteIject as well as Simon does. Mr Crean-What are you talking about?",62
113,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"He is trying to prove he would have been a better deputy leader, but he does not have to prove it because we know he would have been, actually. You do not have to prove it to us, Simon. In relation to consumer items, the system that you had proposed would have led to unbelievable complications, and you know it. Take the example that was given yesterday in relation to televisions. If the televisions were coming in for use in a motel, they would be business inputs. Somebody would have had to say, 'Were these televisions going to motels? Were they going into TV studios?' If they were, they would be at five per cent. 'Or would their end use be entirely different?' You would have had hundreds of people, I suppose, sitting around trying to make infinitesimal decisions in relation to end use. We are entirely proud that we were able to undo the full extent of the damage that would have been imposed by your policy. We are entirely proud that we were able to reduce it by 40 per cent. Business, I suppose, would say, 'We would have liked to have reduced it by 100 per cent.' But, if they want to do anything about the bill, send the bill to Beazley! There is, of course, a revenue element in relation to this. It is the revenue that was announced by the then Treasurer, the Hon. Ralph Willis, during the campaign. It is important in relation to economic policy-as I have stressed on many occasions-that we do rectify the Beazley black hole. This will make a contribution. This will be much better than it was under the Labor Party policy.",62
114,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"In light of the response from the Treasurer, my question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of the damage that proposals to abolish tariff concessions would have caused Australian industry? How does the government's solution overcome these problems?",63
115,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"I thank the member for that question because there has been a wideranging conversation so far about the matter. You have to remember that this was an item brought in by the Labor Party without any consultations at all. The cost was going to be enormous to industry as a whole and the attempt to administer it would have been entirely lost. The Treasurer made the point as it related to certain items. Can I just extend the areas, because I notice that the shadow spokesman for industry was talking about toys yesterday. It is quite something to talk about. If toys were brought in under your scheme, they would not have paid nothing at all, as you say, in that respect. Under our scheme, it would be subject to three per cent. But the judgment has to be made whether it would have been a business input or a consumer item under your scheme. So you have the administrative impossibility of trying to put together. Then you move on to other areas.",63
116,Mr KERR,Unknown,What business uses toys?,63
117,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"You can use television sets. Are you going to put them in a motel or are you going to use them at home? You can use it for mobile telephones. Are you going to use those as a business input or are they going to be used at home? Quite clearly, all of these matters would not have been anything else but an administrative nightmare. So we moved to help business in this regard. We consulted with business as to what their chief concerns were. It took only a couple of meetings to sort out the priorities. You did not bother to do it. As a result of this, we came up with a considered situation. Mr Crean-Sell out the farmers.",63
118,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"Why does it relate to farmers? What would you know about farming? Despite all the chitchat that goes on, the Tariffs government moved to rationalise the system. We applied the concession to both business inputs and other items. Eighty per cent of the items that were coming in were going to be under the concession for business and 20 per cent on the other. We moved to take it to three per cent-a 40 per cent reduction, as the Treasurer said. The outcome is greatly welcomed by business. I have already received in my office quite a number of telegrams from people saying how grateful they are for what has happened. As a consequence of that, the business community are pleased with the government of the day, which listens to them and does not propose taxes. Import Tax",63
119,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,It beggars the imagination to see Christmas stockings and dolls as a business input. Mr Downer-It would be if you ran it.,63
120,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"In the case of your doll's house, maybe. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in this place on 1 May 1996 when he said: The new coalition government takes very seriously the commitments that were made to the Australian people in the lead-up to the election. it I also draw the Prime Minister's attention to the coalition policy document which states categorically: There will be no new taxes and no increases in taxes under a Coalition Government I also draw his attention to the comments made by his Treasurer in a debate with the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, when he said: There is another classic difference between us and the government. We've made this pledge: no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. Ask Mr Willis whether he will give that pledge right now. Does he regard his and his minister's commitment to introduce no new taxes or raise existing ones as among those coalition pledges that are taken very seriously? Is it not the case that you have broken these undertakings to the Australian people by your government's decision to introduce an import tax on Australian families' goods?",63
121,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Yes. No. Mr O'Keefe-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We could not hear the answer. Could he repeat the answer?",64
122,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is a spurious point of order. Resume your seat. Disallowed Question,64
123,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is it a fact that the government's proposed one-third sale of Telstra is likely to result in cheaper phone prices and enhanced services for the people in rural Australia? Is the minister aware of claims which have been made to the contrary? Do such claims have any validity?",64
124,Mr KERR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand that the standing orders regarding anticipation of debate also provide that debate is not to be revived during the current session. I ask you to rule that this is inviting a revival of that debate.",64
125,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"We have visited the points of anticipation a great deal this weekMr Crean-This is another one, isn't it?",64
126,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I understand that. Constrain yourself. I am reflecting on the and I rule the question out of order. Import Tax,64
127,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer to the government's midnight announcement of a new import tax on Australian families. Is it true that more than 17,000 household items will be subject now to your three per cent import tax as reported in today's Daily Telegraph? When will you release the full list of items to be hit by your tax slug?",64
128,Mr MOORE,Unknown,It shows you how touchy they are about their own proposals that this should come about. The government has turned around what was an impossible imposition by the Labor Party and made it administratively possibleMr Gareth Evans-You are slugging families.,64
129,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"What would you know about all these matters? The general line of questioning on this shows that you do not even know exactly what the proposals are. What the government has done is to bring about a scheme which is workable, which has taken 40 per cent off the costs that you proposed be put and which has been welcomed by the very many people who use the scheme. Financial Markets",64
130,Mr NAIRN,Unknown,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that there has been renewed confidence in financial markets since the coalition Victory? What actions and policies being undertaken by the government have given heart to the markets? What would have been the situation had a change of government not occurred?,64
131,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The last part of that question surely is hypothetical.",64
132,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I will accept the first part of the question.,64
133,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Actually, as it turns out, I have seen reports that there has been renewed confidence in financial markets since the coalition's victory. For example, in his question column today, Max Walsh wrote: The strength of the Australian dollar since the Coalition victory at the ballot box along with a narrowing of the yield gap between Australia and US long-term bonds provide prima facie evidence of strengthening financial market confidence. The major reason for that confidence is that this was a government which would come clean in announcing the state of the Australian accounts. As far as markets are concerned, it is integral that there be transparency and that there be accuracy in relation to the position. Announcing after the election victory on 2 March the true state of Australia's financial state, and announcing a program go about fixing it, was very important to government and to the Australian economy developing confidence in the financial marZealand kets. The improved confidence results from government. the government announcements of fiscal consolidation. Of course, if the opposition had had its way, these figures would not have been disclosed. They would not have been disclosed to the financial markets and they would not have been disclosed to the Australian people. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point order. If you have ruled that the second part of the question is out of order because it to talk about a hypothetical, surely an answer that goes to a hypothetical must also be out of order. If he is saying what would have been, it is hypothetical.",64
134,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of Chief order. Resume your seat. I have ruled on it. Mr Crean-You have ruled on the quesbutes tion. I am asking you to rule on the answer.,65
135,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am listening very careoutlined fully to the Treasurer's comments and at this moment he is in order.,65
136,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"May I also point out that part of this government's proposal is to introduce a charter of budget honesty to legislatively ensure that in the future during election campaigns the Australian people are disclosed the true nature of the books. intend to never allow to happen again the kind of deception that occurred under finance minister Beazley, who went through the whole of the election campaign refusing disclose what was readily available to and what should have been known by the Australian people. It is the combination of transparency, disclosure, a charter of budget honesty and a program of fiscal consultation that has given renewed confidence-a rein newed confidence which will be of assistance to the Australian economy. NA",65
137,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before I move to the next question and call the honourable member for Canberra, I would like to recognise the very trenchments. large number of former members and senators in the gallery this afternoon. I extend to you to all a very warm welcome to your old home this and I extend a special welcome to the Hon. in Warren Freer, a former member of the New parliament and a former minister in Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Public Service Cuts",65
138,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to of the comments made yesterday in question time by the Prime Minister and this morning asks by the Minister for Industrial Relations on ABC radio suggesting that the current round of Public Service cuts have been made necessary by information which has only come to light since the election. How do you justify such an assertion in light of the minute by the Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service of 2 May in which he attrithe 440 job losses in the Australian Customs Service to proposals explicitly in your 'Meeting our commitments' document-namely, the two per cent efficiency dividend, the reductions to information technology and consultancies and the $50 million over three years specific to Customs identified on page 13 of your pre-election document?",65
139,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I thank the honourable We member for Canberra for his question. The hypocrisy of Labor in the management of the public sector knows no bounds. I inform the House that when Labor was in government to between 1986 and 1989 they cut almost him 12,000 people from the Australian Public Service. The mistake they made is that they failed to lock in the gains. They let it blow out again. In the two years to June 1995 they cut the numbers again. Obviously, they were a bit of difficulty at this point and they were trying to get some sort of credibility going which, of course, never fooled the Australian people when the time came. In that period to June 1995 they cut some 7,000 people from the public sector. The largest category of separations in 1994-95 was reClearly, on 11 March this year the Treasurer indicated that there would be two per cent savings in running costs- That came through on the basis of what we had seen leading up to the election. Clearly, the figures disclosed the then Minister for Finance's black hole. In addressing the Australian Public Service in respect of ethics, the Prime Minister indicated that he recognised that the impact would cause some pain. But we must get the books in some order for the long-term gain of this nation. We do not deny that there will be some impact on the Australian Public Service, but the message remains-send the bill to Beazley. Unemployment",65
140,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What strategies does the government have in place to address the current unemployment rate?,66
141,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for his question. There has clearly been considerable volatility in the labour force for some time. The trend unemployment rate in Labor's final days showed a disturbing rise-from 8.4 per cent in January to 8.6 per cent in April. Unemployment is a lagging indicator. The most recent problems are still the hangover of the Labor interest rate rises in 1994.,66
142,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Oh!,66
143,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"You were rather pleased with them at the time, don't you recall? You said that they were necessary to slow down the economy. That means rising unemployment. You were rather pleased with them when you were in government. Working Nation blew the budget deficit, contributing to the $8 billion underlying deficit which this government inherited, put pressure on interest rates and contributed to that movement in relation to unemployment. The legacy of unemployment, which this government considers is too high, is something that we have directed ourselves to doing something about as part of a strategy to reinvigorate small business in this country and to allow small business to create jobs. We want to give to the small business sector-the job creation sector in Australia-the opportunity to go out and create new jobs, real jobs, in a real labour market. As the Prime Minister said in this House a couple of days ago, there is a strategy to reduce the paperwork and regulatory burdens of small business, a strategy to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor of small business, a strategy to ensure the availability of finance to small business, and a strategy to deal with the number one problem of small business that Labor put in place-the unfair dismissal laws, which became a huge burden in relation to small business. The measures which this government is committed to are measures to boost small business, not just to help small business. These measures will help small business create jobs to deal with that legacy of unemployment that was bequeathed to us and to deal with it in a way which creates real jobs in the real business sector, with real futures for those who are looking for work. Small Business",66
144,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and it follows the answer of the Treasurer and his dedication to small business in his last set of remarks. Is a the Prime Minister aware of press release by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia dated 8 May in which they report on the national small business sommit and grassroots response? They say: The general sense at this rally was 'what use is deregulation and reduced paperwork if we are being crushed by the sheer size and power of larger players? Competition policy is missing in our needs. Have you further heard the reported remarks of Mr Bastian, who is associated as the executive director of that organisation? When asked about the Trade Practices Act point that I made to you in question time yesterday he said: Well, they want a tighter Trade Practices Act and that is why we strongly support the harsh and oppressive conduct approach. He went on further to say: For this sector it was a critical issue. Will the Prime Minister now undertake to introduce the Trade Practices Amendment Bill which he refused to commit himself to yesterday?",66
145,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I am generally aware of the statement that was made by Mr Bastian. I am also well aware that on occasions the statements made by Mr Bastian purporting' to represent the collective views of the small business community do not always directly reflect those views. That would be regarded by many people in the small business community as a manifest understatement, and many people would regard me as being extremely charitable. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that matters relating to competition in the economy are important to small business, so are regulatory burdens and industrial relations laws. The last party in this parliament that can even begin to think of giving anybody lectures about competition adversely affecting the small business community is the party that for all of its existence has maintained the antifloors competitive labour market practices that we intend to get rid of. Howard Government",67
146,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. In addition to measures. . . already announced, has the minister achieved any further cost savings in the running of government?",67
147,Mr JULL,Unknown,"Yes, the government did make a pre-election commitment to control growth of ministerial staff. I am pleased to announce that the government now has 294 positions approved for ministerial staff, and this is in comparison with the previous government's approved establishment of 364 positions-a saving of 70 positions. The government has abolished the National Media Liaison Service and the ministerial media group maintained by the Labor government. As we announced the other day, there is only one consultant's position instead of the 40 that there were under the previous government. I am pleased to announce that the saving in direct salary and related costs for staff is $4.075 million. There have been some further savings too in ministerial accommodation. The previous governmeQl had a tendency to establish ministerial offices in their electorates. I understand that on most occasions the cost of constructing and providing those offices was about $100,000 each. Under this particular government, I am pleased to announce that 20 of the ministers will in fact be taking existing accommodation in Commonwealth parliament offices. Only six ministers have taken ministerial offices in their own electorates. Two ministers in the government have no office outside Parliament House-that is, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Now we come to the position of Sydney. In terms of the Commonwealth parliamentary offices, we are going to fully utilise what is there. Most members of this House would not realise that in 1987 the then Labor government actually undertook a major upgrading of the Commonwealth parliamentary offices on 8, 9 and 10 to provide prime ministerial facilities, a cabinet room and offices for ministers. I did some research on this and found out that the average cost of providing a fit out for that sort of arrangement in Sydney at the time, in 1987, was $1 million. Unfortunately, the bill to the taxpayers of Australia in 1987 was $6 million, and when you go through those particular premises you can see why. Caesar and the Imperial Court looked after themselves very well indeed-the most magnificent cedar panelling, the most magnificent brass taps, which I understand cost $200 each. They even had mahogany toilet seats. I suppose that was appropriate for the imperial style of the previous government. This government will not carry on like the Labor lushes, and the costs of this particular government are going to be kept to an absolute minimum. ' Labour Market Programs",67
148,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In light of today's labour force figures, which prove the need for continued help for unemployed people, and the success of Working Nation in cutting long-tenn unemployment to a five, year low, will the Prime Minister reaffinn his $3.4 billion election promise made at his youth policy launch on 20 February that: 'We are going to maintain expenditure on labour market programs in real terms'? Does that promise stand or will it be broken like other promises?",67
149,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Today's labour market figures demonstrate one thing: after 13 years you left an enormous legacy of very high unemployment. When your party came to power it represented to the Australian people that above everything else it would look after the unemployed of this country, but the fact is that the average rate of unemployment under your 13 years in government was well above the average rate of unemployment under the previous government. The unemployment rate was way above the unemployment rate in comparable countries.",68
150,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,What was the participation rate?,68
151,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"No matter how much the Leader of the Opposition or others may interject, the fact is that your failure to do something significant about unemployment represents one of the worse failures of your years in government. You, above everybody else, in virtue of your previous position as President of the ACTU, carry a heavier responsibility than anybody else. My predecessor said that George Campbell had 100,000 dead men around his neck when he addressed the ALP conference in 1986. Mer what you did as President of the ACTU, I reckon you have 300,000 or 400,000 men around your neck. The contribution that a rigid labour market made to the high rate of unemployment is one of the enduring legacies of the former Labor government. I can say to the House that we will follow policies designed to free the labour market, we will follow policies designed to remove the unfair dismissal laws and, as far as the specific items of expenditure are concerned, as my colleagues have said in the past, we will not give a running commentary on every piece of specUlation. The budget will be delivered on 20 August. I can assure the honourable gentleman that we will do a lot more to tackle the fundamental causes of unemployment because we will not be shackled by the old-fashioned ideology of which you were such a dismal opponent in your former manifestation. Trade and Investment Relationships with Japan",68
152,Mr DONDAS,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Is the minister aware of the reported comments by Japan's ambassador that Australia needs to boost its export efforts towards Japan? I ask: what action will the minister be taking to improve Australia's trade and investment relationships with Japan?,68
153,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"I have noticed Ambassador Satoh's comments and, indeed, as part of the systematic program of the coalition government, a number of regional working visits are continuing. I will travel next week to Indonesia and Japan to pursue bilateral, regional and multilateral issues, particularly the individual action plan developments under the APEC. Could I add further with regard to J apanand I appreciate the interest of the member 13 for the Northern Territory, who is very much interested in the whole area of exports through Darwin to the world-that in fact bilateral efforts will extend beyond agricultural products such as beef, rice and others to promote Australian exports in new and growing areas of interest, including the home building industry, and to further facilitate that by opening the Orugano Australian Model Home exhibition in Japan-a major promotion of Australian high-quality building product activity, activity which I am very surprised that Labor wishes to criticise. These are hard-won exports out of Hobart, Bundaberg and many other places in Australia. Bricks are going from Bundaberg to Japan; model kitchens are going from Hobart to Japan and the like. You might like to attack that, you might like to rubbish that, but I am going up there to support and expand that export effort and build on our bilateral relationship with Japan. Finally, I will take the opportunity to highlight the fact that several very important, anniversaries are coming up with regard to the Japanese relationship. Very shortly is the tOOth anniversary of Japan having a representative office here in Australia, the 40th anniversary of the Menzies-MCEwen trade treaty which laid the basis for so much of Australia's economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, and the 20th anniversary of the Fraser friendship treaty with Japan. You might like to belittle the importance of these anniversaries; the coalition does not. We will get on with doing the job. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, obviously the minister was reading from the back of a postage stamp. I ask him to table it, please.",68
154,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The minister was reading from a confidential document, notwithstanding the fact that the document was very small. Bus Chassis",69
155,Mr ANDREN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Do you appreciate your changes to the tariff concessions scheme for imported inputs will still have a massive impact on the cost of chassis for new buses? One company in my electorate, Orange Coaches, tells me that this will still place it in a loss situation from which it cannot recover. Does the minister realise bus companies must, by law, renew coaches and school buses regularly for obvious safety reasons? Will the minister respond specifically to this concern of my constituent?",69
156,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"The member for Calare has raised a matter which is particular to his electorate. One thing is quite clear: if the Labor government had been returned your constituency would have been paying 40 per cent more. We were happy to consider issues from a wide range of people who made application to us. In terms of your particular case, if you would care to speak to me later I will take special representations. Right now, the coalition government has saved your constituent 40 per cent. Relations with Europe",69
157,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the minister seen a report of an address by the European Commission's ambassador to Australia, Mr Hughes, in which Mr Hughes criticised - approach of some Australian politicians to relations with Europe? Will the government take action to improve Australia's links with Europe? Mr Leo MCLeay-He will go there next week.",69
158,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"They don't seem to want me around any more, Mr Speaker. It is very sad. I've got bad news for you: you have made my day, because I'll be around for years and you'll be over there enjoying question time for years. I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, I have read an article that appeared in today's Canberra Times entitled 'Diplomat criticises disavowal of European links'. This article referred to a speech made yesterday at the National Press Club by Mr Aneurin Hughes, the European Union's representative in Australia. It is worth the House's while to reflect on the words used by Mr Hughes when he said there had been 'a kind of deliberate disavowal' of the importance of Australia's commercial and cultural links with Europe. Of course, as the honourable member pointed out in his question, this is entirely true. While all Australians know that this government's highest foreign policy priority is engagement with Asia, we do happen to be able to pursue a policy of engagement with Asia without creating the perception that somehow relations with Europe are yesterday's relations.",69
159,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Tell him to butt out of Aussie politics.,69
160,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"You must be the most vocal, garrulous person who has ever sat in that chair. You can say what you like about us over here but no-one beats you for babbling on-babble, babble, babble, babble! You never draw breath. You would think you'd be able to go some of the way towards answering questions-babble, babble, babble!",69
161,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I think the minister is stretching a very long bow.,69
162,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Well, I'd better fire the arrow then. As far as this government is concerned, we are going to give an important priority to rebuilding relations with Europe after 13 years of the Labor government and after a large number of gratuitous remarks were made about several European countries by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. We are now proceeding to negotiate a framework agreement with the European Union and I believe that by the end of the year we will be able to complete that framework agreement. Mr Latham-We started the framework agreement.",69
163,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"The member for Werriwa says, 'We signed it.' You did not sign it. You did not even persuade the Council of Ministers to provide a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate the framework agreement. I was surprised, when we came to power, to note that the two now opposition spokesmen sitting on the other side had failed to persuade the council to give the commission that mandate. We then had the task of encouraging the Council of Ministers to support the provision of that mandate to the commission, and we did it. Those negotiations will proceed in the course of this year. By the end of the year I believe we will have signed the framework agreement. That will be symbolic of this government's efforts to restore relations with the European Union and, in an overall sense, to ensure that our foreign policy reflects our national interests.",70
164,Mr KERR,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Minister, in article published in the Age of 2 April 1996, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, is reported as confirming that from 1 April 1996: . . . migrants arriving in all but the refugee special humanitarian categories would have to support themselves for the first two years, saving the Government an estimated $600 million over three years. That is broadly the same savings estimate claimed by the coalition prior to the election. Is it a fact that your government, prior to Age report, had received departmental advice estimating the three-year savings at less than $260 million plus additional running costs estimated at over $15 million for that period, leaving a shortfall of greater than $350 million over the savings claimed by the minister?",70
165,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I am almost impressed that the honourable member for Denison is actually interested in the accounts of government because Labor in government obviously had no regard for what the accounts of government were about. If they did take a look at them at any stage they certainly did not worry about what the costings might have come to and they never worried about the bottom line. They were interested only in preserving government for themselves. The consequence of all that is that the people of Australia rejected Labor and their economic management. I invite the honourable member for Denison to take particular notice of all line items in the budget, and that he can do on 20 August. Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs",70
166,Mr SOMLYAY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister explain to the House the trend in departmental running costs in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs? What action does the government intend to take to remedy the situation?",70
167,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Fairfax Migrants for his question. It was the case that, as the economic and employment policies of the an former government more and more obviously began to fail, the government began to pour money into the bureaucracy, and particularly into the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In 1987-88, the overall running costs of the department were $459 and million. Since then, running costs have increased every year to a figure of $994 million in 1995-96. In constant dollars in 1995-96, the increase in running costs was no less than 60 per cent. I point out that these running costs included that massive increases in advertising to try to convince the public-unsuccessfully, as we discovered in the recent federal election-that Working Nation was indeed working. According to the department's annual reports, payments in 1993-94 to media advertising organisations were $1.8 million. What were they last financial year? They were $6.1 million! I reckon Bill Hunter probably won't have to work again after that expenditure. CBS offices were burdened by poorly designed program,s designed to manipulate the statistics-we see that in the long-term unemployment figureswhich led to the",70
168,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,They came down.,71
169,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"That's right; manipulating the statistics. And that led to the churning of the unemployed again and again through the same labour market programs without them ever ending up in real jobs. Even Labor, at the end, recognised that something had to be done to stop this burgeoning bureaucracy. The key point that I want to make about the staff cuts that we have had to make in the department is that the vast bulk of them were planned by you because of the necessity to rein back this burgeoning bureaucracy. Of the 1,285 permanent staff reductions that were announced by the government in April, the vast proportion of them-no less than 965were planned by the Labor Party. You must recognise that you had gone right over the top. Not only that, but the 600 temporary staff reductions that are due at the end of June were also planned by the Labor Party. So let's not hear this hypocrisy from the other side of the House about these cuts being the result of the coalition's need to cut back on your waste and expenditure. You were forced yourselves to recognise this and you should bear responsibility for these cuts. Costing of Election Policies",71
170,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister and follows on from a previous question. It also concerns the shortfall of at least $350 million in the coalition's estimates of savings from the two-year waiting period for migrants. Is the Prime Minister aware that that comes as part of the $1.2 billion error which the Department of Finance found in the costing of coalition election promises where there was enough public detail to do so? Is he aware that the Department of Finance also found $3.3 billion worth of promises too vague to cost? Do any other co stings pro1i.ded to the government show additional shortfalls in other savings options of the coalition? Will the Prime Minister now table the latest finance costings of the coalition election promises and will he undertake that none of his $8 billion budget reduction target will be used to pay for any unfunded election promises?,71
171,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The answer to the last part of the question is no. There are only two shortfalls that matter: the first is the shortfall of seats that you are suffering, which has put you on the other side; the other and even more important shortfall is the shortfall of budget revenue and expenditure which is the legacy that we have inherited. Ever since the parliament has been sitting, the Leader of the Opposition has had this curious idea that, in some way, the costings that were put forward by the coalition during the election were exposed by the costings that were delivered by him with the resources of the Department of Finance. The fact is that our costings were not undermined by the examination that was made by the Department of Finance. The side of Australian politics whose costings were undermined is, in fact, yours. It does not seem to have entered the mind of the Leader of the Opposition that the sequence of events was that we had a campaign; you put forward your policy; we put forward ours; you refused to allow the members of the then opposition to properly inform the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury what the basis of the promises were; the Australian people had a vote on 2 March; you lost and we won; and we have inherited an $8 billion black hole that you deliberately told lies about. That is what you did. You deliberately misrepresented the situation",71
172,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister will withdraw the word 'deliberately'.,71
173,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,'Deliberately'?,71
174,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes. You were making accusations that involved the word 'deliberately' .,71
175,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"-I make the accusation, Mr Speaker, that the then Minister for Finance, the then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister, collectively, deliberately set out deceive the Australian people. That is the accusation I make and I will continue to make it. As a result of that, the Australian people are going to pay very dearly for your deceit and your negligence. Mr Leo MCLeay-1 raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My recollection of the last parliament was that members of the opposition continually asked that the word 'lies' be withdrawn, and I would ask that you ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that allegation.",71
176,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Is the Leader of the Opposition offended?,72
177,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"No, I am not in the least bit offended.",72
178,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Good.,72
179,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I think the Leader of the Opposition,72
180,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I am very happy to withdraw.,72
181,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Thank you. Mr O'Keefe-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It relates to the fact that several times when you asked the Prime Minister to withdraw he ignored your request.",72
182,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has withdrawn. Mr O'Keefe--1 know he now has, but he ignored your request.",72
183,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the member for Burke to resume his seat. Brisbane City Council,72
184,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen recent media reports that the Brisbane City Council has decided to use only union labour when contracting out work? What will the government do to outlaw this closed-shop mentality and abolish discrimination against non-union labour?,72
185,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I have seen these reports. In fact, in the Courier-Mail on 7 May there was a story which revealed that the Brisbane City Council-which has a budget of something like $400 million a year-introduced a policy which was pledging to use union labour only to for contract work. I was pleased to see that the finance spokesman, Graham Quirk, who is a councillor with the Brisbane City Council, has raised his proper objections to it. They are objections which the government shares. We totally reject the Brisbane City Council's ham-fisted imposition of compulsory unionism. I think the Brisbane City Council is out of touch with the people of Queensland Who, in the 2 March election, had a very clear view about some of these issues. In fact, there are only two Labor members left in Queensland, the balance of representation coming from the Liberal and National parties. As a result, I am pleased to be able to say to the House that the government will move to legislate against compulsory unionism and against preference clauses. It is really only those on the other side of the chamber and the Labor mayor of Brisbane who support the antediluvian policies that people should be discriminated against on the grounds that they do not have union membership. With only about 35 per cent of the Australian work force now in a union, it is a basically unfair proposition to say that because somebody chooses not to be in a union they . should be denied work opportunities. The federal government will be proposing the abolition of compulsory unionism and preference clauses. I am also very pleased to say that I know it is the view of the incoming government in Queensland to legislate so that there is no safe haven for compulsory unionism and preference clauses in this country. Taxation: Award Payments",72
186,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, if he is finished calming down a very rattled Prime Minister. Having had the opportunity overnight to be corrected by your officials, Treasurer, will you concede that you were wrong yesterday in stating that building workers' travelling allowances have not only always been taxable but actually always taxed? Will you also acknowledge that your scrapping of the legislation announced last December by former Treasurer Willis, which would have formalised the tax exempt status of those building workers' travelling allowances, will result in a cut to the take-home pay of those workers of between $600 and $1,200 per year? Will you also concede that this is. in manifestly direct breach of your pre-electIon promises not to do anything that would cut any worker's take-home pay and not to make any worker any worse off?",72
187,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Plainly, you have no understanding of the way in which this worked. Mr Crean-Were you wrong?",73
188,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"No, I was completely right and you were completely wrong. Let me make it entirely clear. If these allowances were not taxable-that is, they were already exempt-why did the Treasurer have to introduce legislation? Why? He had to introduce legislation, as his press release said-I suggest you check it with him-to exempt these allowances. If the legislation had not been introduced, they would not have been exempted. So the question came to us: will you make good and introduce legislation to exempt them? All I have said is, 'No, we won't.' Because we will not be introducing the legislation, they fall back to the law unamended, as it stood, which makes them taxable. The Income Tax Assessment Act says that income is taxable. Unless you introduce legislation to say, 'This allowance is exemptRouge ed,' as you proposed to do, it becomes taxable. You have got it completely confused, the wrong way around-hopelessly the wrong way around. What we are doing is leaving the situation exactly as it was-that is, without introducing legislation-the consequence of which is that it comes into the tax net, the consequence of which is that there is uniformity, the consequence of which is that, regardless of the militancy of the group concerned, the tax laws are going to be equally enforced. That is a principle of our government. Wilson, Mr D.: Death Mr ruCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of the existence of the alleged Khmer Rouge letters referred to in this morning's Age and o-the ABC? Does this information contradict the account the Cambodian government has given of the David Wilson hostage case?",73
189,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question about the very tragic case, and ultimately the death, of David Wilson, one that I know all members of the House are deeply concerned about. I did hear the interview on the ABC this morning and I also read the article by Lindsay Murdoch on the front page of the Melbourne Age, but I have not personally seen the alleged letters referred to by the ABC or by Lindsay Murdoch. I understand that Mr Murdoch has offered to pass the letters to my office, and indeed may have done so already. Throughout the whole of this saga, including during my time as the opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, I have always been deeply anxious to establish fully the truth of what happened to David Wilson-the circu!Dstances of his being taken hostage and, 10deed, ultimately of his murder. If new and credible evidence comes to light which affects our current understanding of events, then naturally enough as a government we would welcome that. I learnt in the course of today that apparently the Department of Foreign Mfairs had been aware of the existence of correspondence between General Chea Dara and the Khmer leader Chhouk Rin but that no instruction had been given by the previous government to obtain those letters or to establish the veracity of the information that had been provided from our embassy in Phnom Penh. I consequently have asked the post in Phnom Penh to approach the Cambodian government urgently to discuss the allegations made on the ABC AM program this morning and in the article by Lindsay Murdoch. The coalition in opposition helped to establish a Senate inquiry, which in the end was, I think, established with all parties' support, to consider the available evidence in this case. Naturally enough, this material will be considered by that Senate inquiry. I re-emphasise: in the meantime it is important that our embassy in Phnom Penh approach the Cambodian government to discuss the alleged letters and the allegations made in those letters because, as a government, naturally enough we want to get to the bottom of this very sorry and tragic saga. Commissioner of the Australian Federal",73
190,Mr KERR,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. The Attorney-General would be aware of the disgraceful attack made by the member for Broadwater in the Queensland parliament, Mr Grice, on 16 April on the integrity and honesty of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Palmer. Does the government have confidence in the integrity and honesty of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police?",74
191,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I raise a matter of uncertainty. I would have thought parliamentary privilege within the Queensland parliament would prevent the asking of a question of that character. It is appropriate that a question be asked about the integrity of a member of the Public Service, but I suggest the lead-in raises serious questions about the degree to which the privilege of another parliament prevents a question being asked in this place. I suggest, therefore, the question may well be out of order.",74
192,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I will rule on it after or during the Attorney-General's response. I rule the point of order out of order at this moment, but I will listen very carefully.",74
193,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"I thank the member for "" Denison for his question. I am aware of comments made from two different sources in relation to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. I think it needs to be put into context. The New South Wales police are currently looking for a new commissioner. It has been alleged that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Palmer, is a candidate for that position. There are, it would seem, people who have an interest in ensuring that the reputation of anybody who is a candidate for that position is not unsullied. I think in that context any comment that  be viewed with some suspicion. I am not aware of the sources of information for the two members of different parliaments who have made the comments. I do not really want to say anything about them. However, the Commissioner of the Federal Police has a very high reputation among Police police forces across the country. On this side of the House, and I am sure on that side of the House, there is no reason for doubting his integrity, nor for casting any criticism at the standard of the work that he does. On that  continuing to do a good job. I should mention he has assured me that he has not been and is not a candidate for the position of commissioner of New South Wales police. Sale of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd",74
194,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister advise the House. of the benefits of the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for Ballarat for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that I announced two days ago that Commonwealth Funds Management will be offered for sale, subject to the result of a scoping study to determine the extent of commercial interest. Commonwealth Funds Management, for those members who are not aware, is both a wholesale and a retail funds manager. Its major clients are the CSS and the PSS-the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme. It was established as a company back in 1991 to ensure that the management of the public sector funds at that stage was maximised to the advantage of all the beneficiaries of Commonwealth public sector superannuation. It was given a monopoly right for the first five years. That monopoly right has now expired and there is some considerable concern that it may, in fact, not be managing the funds of a number of those organisations which it currently looks after, as a result of which its business is in some degree of jeopardy. That may be borne out by the fact that last year it had a profit of about $7 million. Its profit this year is anticipated to about 50 per cent of that-about $3'h million. I announced also that any sale would be subject to a short but extensive scoping study. That scoping study will be done in full consultation with everyone who has an interest in Commonwealth Funds Management. That includes the board, the subsidiary company and its management and total risk management. It also includes the boards of CSS and PSS and other major clients which include Telstra, Australia Post and the military superannuation schemes. It is expected there will be some interest in this particular organisation if the scoping study indicates that it should proceed to a sale. I also indicate that I will be in consultathe tion with the unions in respect of that matter. But only after the scoping study will a decision be made by government as to its sale. The benefits, which were the basis in the main of the honourable member's questionDr Tbeopbanous-Will you be legislating?",74
195,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"Well, it comes to down to this: we will not sell and spend. The Leader of the Opposition indicated on television the other night that he had quite a bit exposure to privatisations, and no-one would deny that. Of course, one could make some comment on the fact that any sale of an asset under Labor was put through in the middle of the night. I think the Leader of the Opposition and the former Prime Minister used to don balaclavas at about midnight and try to sneak it all through because they did not want Brian Howe to find out. It was always done when they were in trouble with the budget so that they could prop it up.",75
196,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,You spent a lot of time in New South Wales spending money.,75
197,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,I welcome the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition because there was no complaint about the state of books in New South Wales when government changed last year. We know what we inherited here. There is no complaint by your colleagues there.,75
198,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"You spent money like it was going out of style, sport, and you know it.",75
199,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"No, there is no problem with those books. There has never been a complaint. You can bluster as much as you like in here in your jovial way. You will not hide the fact that when you sold an asset in government, you did it to prop up th- ailing budget that you were in charge of. The benefit to the taxpayers of Australia if we do proceed to the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management will be that in a responsible manner we will retire debt. We will simply not prop up deficits that we inherited. Australian Tourist Commission",75
200,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Has the minister seen reports that the board of the Australian Tourist Commission, with exception of Mr Sam Fiszman, has resigned at his request? Did the minister actually seek the resignation of the board members and, if so, why? In view of Mr Fiszman's refusal to resign, is the minister considering legislating to remove him?",75
201,Mr MOORE,Unknown,The members of the commission met with me and offered their resignations. Appointments will be made in the appropriate manner. Question Time,75
202,Mr REID,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations in his capacity as Leader of the House. What action is the government taking to fulfil its commitments to improve question time and to ensure that the community, through its members of parliament, have more opportunities to ask questions of the government?",75
203,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am listening to this question very carefully as I am not quite sure it is in order!,75
204,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I am very pleased to say that the government believes that, in the first fortnight of the sittings after the recent election, we have demonstrated in very practical tenns our commitment and resolve to improve parliamentary standards. I am very pleased to say that the Keating days are over. We demonstrated that by the refonns which were endorsed and approved by the parliament. I really think that, for all their usual criticisms, privately even the members on the other side would have to acknowledge the change in the tone and the way in which the parliament has been run. For example, every day we have had a question time we have had the whole of the front-bench here. The days of the rostered day off are over. Today, for example, we have had 25 questions asked. One of them got knocked off, but there were 24 or 25 questions. I have had the figures taken out. Mr Speaker, I know you will be very interested in this. If you take average number of questions per question time over the years-going all the way back to 1970---the highest number was in 1976, when the average was 19.3 questions. With the questions that we have had just in the first ards. fortnight, we have already exceeded that record. It is also interesting that we have had substantive answers from ministers. They have been able to answer questions fairly and give people information as they are required to. If you look at the last 26 years and the average time taken for questions and answers, in the last fortnight the average time has been 3.5 minutes. But if you go back over just the last four years, the Keating years, the averages were 5.8, 4.7, 4.3 and 5.9-which is the all-time worse. So, to get a figure of the sort that we have had in the last couple of weeks, you really have to go back to the Fraser years, and I am sure the Prime Minister can remember the better standards in that time. We have also had a number of ministerial statements made in the House, and I think that is very important. Under the previous administration, they generally preferred to have a press conference outside of the parliament rather than to have ministers making statements inside the parliament, where they properly should be made where possible. We are also moving to improve the authority of our committee structure. It is very important for members to have an opportunity to make a contribution. Even in a controversial debate such as we have had with Telstra, we had, I understand, 44 questions. In fact, on the second reading debate we exhausted the speakers on both sides. Those are four or five matters, but let me conclude by saying this. We always said that really the tone of the parliament was ultimately set by the Prime Minister of the day. Whilst we have made important structural changes to standing orders to buttress our policy of improving standards-and it has been demonstrated absolutely without any doubt whatsoever-I still think it is the case that, if you really want to change parliamentary standards, you have to make a change to the government and you have to the have a Prime Minister who respects parliamentary standards. I do compliment the Prime Minister. In this most important of all of our democratic institutions he has made good the promise he made to lift parliamentary stand",75
205,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, what can I say but ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Parliament: Funding",76
206,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, in replying to a question to you yesterday from the honourable member for Chifley, you said that future funding for the running of the parliament may suffer from 'stringent financial arrangements'. Are you able to assure the House that the government's stated objective of raising the relevance of parliament in its relationship with the executive will not be adversely affected? Do you believe stringent financial requirements will infringe on your rights and duties as the independent custodian of members' rights and interests?",76
207,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the member for Curtin for his question. Our deliberations continue, and I am not yet in a position to announce any major initiatives. But, cognisant with the points you raise, every consideration will be given to protecting members' rights commensurate with reasonable financial care. Telstra Legislation",76
208,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, my question to you is one which follows on from the answer given by the Leader of the House in respect of parliamentary standards in this place. Are you aware that during debate on the Telstra bill today the OpposItIon was prevented from moving amendments? I ask: in view of the question of parliamentary standards, would you be prepared to have discussions with the Leader of the House on matters such as that? Importantly, with respect to question time standards, would you also be prepared to have discussions with him regarding standing order 145 relating to relevance and the ability to get ministers to answer questions?",76
209,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am unaware of the nature of the first part of your question, and I will look into that. I have been pursuing the question of relevance quite carefully over the last two weeks and, at this moment, I have no major apprehensions about the way House debates are proceeding. In the event that I have a comment to make on relevance, you will be among the very first to hear it. Parliament: Funding  the question I asked yesterday and that raised by the honourable member for Curtin. Your response to yesterday's question was that you are going to be operating under stringent financial arrangements. Has your attention been drawn to the fact that the Senate has an appropriations and staffing committee at which senators can assist the Presiding Officer and better understand those restrictions that are applied? Have you considered in your role as Speaker, wishing to set new standards in the House, whether or not an appropriations committee would be appropriate for this House? Is it true that the Department of the· House of Representatives is the only department that does not come under any scrutiny of the parliament?",77
210,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot comment about the last element of your question, but we will look at that and reply to you separately. In deliberations with my departmental officers, I have seen no cause nor any justification to form any additional supporting committees. However, if my deliberations reach a stage or an impasse where that might be necessary, then we will consider it. Telstra Legislation",77
211,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a very small matter about the practice in the House today in respect of the Telstra bill. We were hoping that the Telstra debate would have been completed last night, and we said that to the opposition. They, however, were insistent on having further speakers contribute to the debate. We allowed the debate to go on last night and this morning. This morning I said to the opposition that we had a couple of maiden speeches to hear and a debate on parliamentary committees. I pointed out that, unless there was some arrangement by which they could move their amendments, it would make it difficult to get through these. On each and every occasion we attempted to facilitate the smooth handling of the amendments. We finally agreed to leave for the incorporation of the amendments. But on our reasonable requests to try to have at least some sensible discussion about it, the opposition decided that they wanted to run a filibuster. Eventually we had something like 10 divisions which simply took up the time of their own people.",77
212,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The minister has completed his indulgence. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: indulgence in this place is something which you do dispense.",77
213,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Sparingly, I hope. Mr Martin-In that case, I think it should be used appropriately. In this case, however, I have simply put a question to you about the conduct this morning, in reference to a very important piece of legislation, of the government where it chose not to adhere to what it said it would do, and that is to put the primacy of the parliament above the executive. Now we have had the Leader of the House engaging here in argument with you. I simply the want an answer to the question I gave, which I hope will be forthcoming.",77
214,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,We are not going to debate the issue further. I have made certain assurances to the member for Cunningham. Those assurances will be met. Standing Orders,77
215,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, following questions earlier in the week relating to standing order No. 82, I particularly asked if you would examine the Hansard of the previous day and your comments of that day in terms of the matters that were listed. You have refrained from commenting both yesterday and today on that matter. I would be grateful if you could formally provide, as I have previously asked, an interpretation of standing order No. 82 regarding anticipating debate. It is not clear now in my mind, and I am sure in the minds of all members from previous parliaments, as to how the standing order is to be interpreted in the future, given that you have had two rulings on two different days. Could you please respond formally to that, either in writing or in advice to the House?",78
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I will respond to the member formally in writing. Thank you for your question. Electorate Staff,78
217,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I have been attempting for some time to address this question to the Prime Minister, but on reflection it is probably more appropriate that it to you. I draw your attention to rumours circulating that it is the intention of the government to take away a staff member from all backbenchers. Because it is going to have a tremendous effect on the parliament, would you look into this and find out whether the allegation is true? Would you concede that, if it is true, while it may be superficially poputabled lar with the public, it will disadvantage the opposition much more than it will the government, and will certainly advantage the Prime Minister's office and executive vis a vis everyone else?",78
218,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member will resume his seat. This is neither the proper place nor the forum for that sort of question. You may pursue your inquiries in the normal course of circumstances. I will not respond to speculation or rumours. NA Reports: Government Responses,78
219,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule showing government responses to House of Representatives and joint committee reports for the period 30 November 1995 to 29 January 1996, and reports presented to which responses are outstanding. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members. The schedule read as followsNA NA NA NA PRESENTED TO WIllCH RESPONSES ARE OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD 30 NOVEMBER 1995 TO 29 JANUARY 1996 NA NA This document continues the practice adopted in previous Parliaments of presenting to the House of Representatives at regular intervals a schedule listing Government responses to House and joint committee reports and those reports for which the House (as distinct from a committee or committee chair) has received no Government responses. The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking by successive go Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. In recent years the Keating Government responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being in the House at the earliest opportunity. For the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament has been recorded as the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. The date of the dissolution of the 37th Parliament, 29 January 1996, suspended the period within which responses could be made to the House. This period resumed with the opening of the 38th Parliament on 30 April 1996. The schedule no longer includes advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. The schedule does not include reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the PublicaDescription of Report Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (House, Standing) Review of Auditor-General' s Audit Report No 24 of 1994-95-Follow-up audit on the Northern Land Council Justice under scrutiny: Report of the inquiry into the implementation by govemments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Review of Auditor-General's Audit Reports No 36, 199230-05-94 93; No 1, 1993-94 Volume 3, Sections 1.13-1.39; and No 27, 1993-94, Sections 16.19-16.24 Banking, Finance and Public Administration (House, Standing) Keeping the customer satisfied: Inquiry into the devolu23-10-95 tion of running costs flexibilities Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 1993-94 annual report and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's 1993-94 annual report Taxing relaxing: Report on the impact of Australia's taxation regime on the tourism industry Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings (Joint, Statutory) Radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary pro- 29-06-95 ceedings Certain Family Law Issues (Joint, Select) Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia Child support scheme-An examination of the operation 05-12-94 and effectiveness of the scheme Community Affairs (House, Standing) A fair go for all: Report on migrant access and equity Report on aspects of youth homelessness tions Committee and the Selection Committee.

On Sunday, 28 April, like many other members of this House, I had flown to Canberra to begin the first week of the sittings of parliament. At about 4 o'clock I received a phone call to tell me that there were reports that perhaps up to 12 people had been shot in an incident in my state. Frankly, I did not know whether to accept that proposition. It seemed to me-and it still seems to me-that something of that kind could not happen in my own state of Tasmania. I made a very rapid decision, after ringing both the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), to return to Tasmania. At about 11 o'clock that night I had a briefing with the police who were running the response to the tragedy at Port Arthur. I met with the Tasmanian police minister, Mr John Beswick, and for the first time the enormity of what was happening sank through. John Beswick was there with all the blood drained out of his face-he looked absolutely ashen faced. The police were obviously in charge of the operation and they were acting through a process they had been trained to deal with, but in every lift and every corridor there was a sense of complete disbelief. On that same day, I, the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister expressed our grief and our sense of helplessness. We all felt that loss of innocence that came with that tragedy. Of course, that was just the beginning of what has been a terrible incident in Australia's history. We, the Tasmanian members of the parliament, with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, attended a service on 1 May. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition went to Port Arthur and later returned to attend a deeply moving service. The director of the emergency health team at the hospital needed to be consoled, crying at that service. Dick Adams and I were both in tears during part of that service-and I am sure that was the case with many of our colleagues. This tragedy has made us confront the frailty of our own lives. Seeing how such innocent people had their lives snuffed out brought home to every one of us that it could have happened to each of us. We were also confronted with the impossible question of what to say. Dick Adams and I went to the hospital and met, for example, Mr Neville Quinn. Mr Quinn had been shot through the neck. After his wife had been shot, he had been chased, cornered in a bus and shot. He then staggered to the pavement to lie next to his wife, Janet, while she died. What can you say to such a person? If you see someone with a bandage wrapped around their neck, what can you possibly say? Yet another appalling consequence of the tragedy was that Mr Quinn's mother-in-law, his wife's mother, died of a heart attack when she heard of the news. As a result of this tragedy, there has been an enormous and proper response by the Australian community to demand that we take action to reform our antiquated and inadequate gun laws. The Prime Minister has made a number of statements to this House, the tone and content of which we endorse entirely. The Leader of the Opposition has also spoken, both in the House and publicly, about the complete commitment we have as an opposition to supporting the government's initiatives to obtain, as the Prime Minister said, a minimum of outcomes-that is, the wholesale registration of firearms throughout the Australian states and territories and a ban on all automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Now, fortunately, my state is beginning to return to normalcy. Port Arthur has been reopened. The people who have suffered loss and tragedy are dealing with their grief. Those who are not directly affected are going about their business more or less as if this incident can be put behind them-as it must, ultimately. Of course, there is a problem with returning to normalcy. Too frequently in the past, when incidents of this kind have happened, there has been this initial burst of concern, but it has been followed by a period where time has passed and the 90 per cent of Australians who support stricter gun laws go about their business. The 10 per cent who are opposed find their voice and find opportunities to bring political pressure on weak parts of the political system to stop what is the genuine public mood for reform at this time. I believe we do have an historic opportunity. We have an historic opportunity in the same way that historic opportunity presented itself to the people of the state of Tasmania through tragedy. There the Labor Party, with Michael Field as its leader, has joined with the Liberal Party and the Greens in an historic commitment to reform what were some of the wors- gun laws in this country. Not only has the Tasmanian parliament made that historic commitment, but it has already legislated. It would not allow the time to pass to allow business to go back to normal, to allow the very small minority in our community the opportunity to cleave divisions between us, between our political parties, between our political interests, and to stop the process that is now well and truly afoot. I believe this historic opportunity is right before us. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), and the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, should continue to make sure that we walk in lock step so that there can be has no cleavage between us, no point of weakness, where the gun lobby can enter and take advantage of that moment of weakness. We have an historic framework here. There have been instances in the past where resolve has weakened over time. There was a committee on violence which led to a series of recommendations which were pursued by my predecessor, Senator Tate, with partial success. But Senator Tate obtained at least a starting point in each of the states and territornot ies. For example, before his initiative, there had been no firearms control legislation in my state of Tasmania. By 1991, with the pressure from the Commonwealth, even that last state had moved. The Commonwealth has banned all military-style automatics and semiautomatics from importation. It has banned their bullets. It has taken many initiatives to try to bring a system together. But at the time of this tragic shooting, that system was still patchwork, with progress being gained inch by inch. I said to the Prime Minister yesterday, 'I have been in your shoes.' Unfortunately, it was not with quite the same weight of public support. There was a Launceston meeting of police ministers where, after the officers had completed six months of work, we had before us a paper which had been prepared and was the product of a lot of consultation. It would have dealt with an effective ban on all these military-style weapons-automatics and semiautomatics. It would have banned private and mail order sales. It would have put tough rules on genuine reasons. It would. have introduced a tougher licensing and training scheme and storage scheme. It would have done all the things that are the core of the Prime Minister's initiatives. But the day before the meeting, I became aware that that arrangement had fallen apart. The irony was that the chief protagonist of the resistance then was the state of Tasmania. It is another sad irony that the backsliding in the present debate seems to be generated out of Victoria. In the struggles I was involved in, as police minister, to try to get uniformity, it was the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Pat MCNamara, who was probably my strongest ally. I make no partisan point there other than to say that this is a moment of time in which we must seize the opportunity to make these changes. Mr Howard is right-any watering down will invite further pressure for exemptions, making the national system a mockery. I believe that gun owners in the main are entirely responsible and sane citizens. They are people who understand the need for national gun law safety rules. There would be 85 or 90 per cent public support for these changes if that were not the case. Unfortunately, there is a small minority of advocates of unrestricted gun ownership of a kind which we must reject. People like Ron Owens and his Lock, Stock and Barrel organisation, the magazine, claim that people need guns so that the democratic state that we represent can be set aside if their freedoms are affected. Those kinds of people need to be rejected utterly. We do have a fork in the road, and we could go down the American way. In the United States in 1994, out of 250 million people, 39,250 died from firearms. In the UK and Japan, out of a total population of 181 million, there were just over a hundred deaths from firearms. There is a point: we must act, and act now. That voice must be a unified voice, representing all of the parties in the political system. When I was seeking to work through this, I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and my counterpart the then shadow Attorney-General, Amanda Vanstone, seeking their active and public cooperation. It is incidents like this, however, that draw the need for that out. It was not there. I make no point of that, but now we must act together. An incident like this cannot be allowed to be a tragedy without an outcome. The Prime Minister should know that he goes into tomorrow's meeting with his resolve steeled by the knowledge of support by all those members of this House who rose in support of this matter of public importance. I say to the Attorney General: I know you have a difficult task and I know that there are some voices already raised who suggest your task may be more difficult than it ought be, but what is said before that meeting ought not matter. What matters is what comes out of that meeting. I ask that you and the Prime Minister steel yourself to ensure that there be no backtracking now and that we as a parliament unite in this issue, as we have on virtually no other, and come together to insist on an outcome in the interests of the safety and future of all Australians.",83
223,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"-I welcome the matter of public importance put up for debate by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), and I welcome the contribution he has made. Let me acknowledge also the contribution he has made to this subject in his former capacity as Minister for Justice. Like the member for Denison, who has been in parliament a lot longer than I, I have never seen an MPI on which both sides of the House stood. It may be historic, I don't know. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) may be able to tell us, but it seems extraordinary that it has not happened at least in the last three years. When I first learnt of the tragedy I was at Melbourne airport on the Sunday night, a week and a half ago. I encountered the wife of the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who was on her way up here, hopefully, for celebrating the opening of parliament. She told me that she had just seen on the television in the airport a report that, at that stage, something like a dozen people had been killed. When I arrived in Canberra the number of people killed had increased to 25, and the media were already expressing the concern that the public have expressed continuously since. The honourable member mentioned Mr Beswick, the minister for police in Tasmania. I spoke to Mr Beswick early on Monday morning last week. I have not met him, but when he spoke the man seemed stunned by what had occurred and still in a state of shock. The member for Denison mentioned the sequence of bursts of concern that have followed massacres such as the Hoddle Street, Queen Street and Strathfield massacres. From the vantage of a week on, this one does seem different. The fact that the public has expressed across the country, across political party divisions, across state and territory boundaries, virtually unanimous support-to the extent you can get that sort of measure in opinion polls-for banning automatic and semi-automatic weapons and for instituting a national gun register is a good measure of the public demanding action. The member for Denison mentioned what to he referred as backsliding in Victoria. I am not going to comment on anything that may have been said by members of parliament or ministers in other states or territories prior to the meeting. As he indicated, what counts is what happens tomorrow. I have great confidence that what will come out of that meeting tomorrow is a consensus on the basic Commonwealth proposals. Those Commonwealth proposals involve banning all semiautomatic and automatic weapons and restricting their use to government or official purposes-military and specialist police-with a very limited use in relation to employment in such areas as the culling of large feral animals. I am also confident that we will move down the path to a national gun register and that those states which do not have registration systems will introduce them and will link them to the national network run through the National Exchange of Police Information. I welcome the opposition's continuing bipartisan support for the strong stance taken by the Commonwealth, particularly for its support of the thrust of the proposals circulated to state and territory ministers on Tuesday-and, I might add, circulated to members and senators in this parliament. It is vitally important that the Commonwealth proposals have cross-party, apolitical support. I thank the opposition and the Democrats for their readiness to back the government's stance. The government is fully committed to achieving the standards set out in those proposals. We on this side of the House believe that the Australian public will not accept anything less. These proposals contain the most comprehensive set of reforms to gun laws which have ever been put forward by a Commonwealth government, and I acknowledge that they are the result of building upon proposals put together following the Launceston meeting, to which the member for Denison referred. There may well have been something different in place if the election had not intervened and prevented the holding of the police ministers' meeting previously scheduled for February. The Commonwealth is not intending to adopt a position of moral superiority over the states and territories, but it has to be acknowledged that responsibility for legislation in relation to gun control rests with the states and territories. The state and territory laws not totally inadequate. In fact, some of the proposals the Commonwealth is putting forward rely upon particular measures that have already been taken in some of the states. A major concern is that we lack a uniform system of comprehensive minimum standards in all of the vital areas. This is what we really hope to achieve at tomorrow's conference. It may assist community understanding if I explain some of the background to the positions taken by the Commonwealth. The main issue which has been raised in the debate is the extent of the proposed ban on firearm ownership. The Commonwealth proposals do not have the effect of banning all firearms from the community. Rather, the licensing regime is put forward by the Commonwealth as a means of classifying weapons in accordance with the relative dangerousness of the firearm and the uses to which it may be put. Essentially, the proposed bans extend to all automatic and semi-automatic long arms. By that we mean self-loading weapons which are fired from the shoulder, such as shotguns and rifles. The ban also extends to pump action shotguns which have a capacity of more than seven rounds. The weapons to be prohibited are considered to be particularly dangerous .l'ince are capable of inflicting greater damage than other weapons. The fact that they are automatic or semi-automatic means that many shots can be fired in a short time. The Commonwealth's view is that these weapons are needed only for certain limited government purposes-military and police-and for professional shooters who have been licensed for a specifically recognised purpose, such as the contract extermination of large feral animals. The latter group was included to meet concerns about the effect of proposed bans on situations where the use of high powered semi-automatic rifles is considered essential-for example, the culling of buffalo in the Northern Territory. The government does not believe that the general public should have access to such weapons or that those weapons are needed by members of the public. . With respect to the reported opposition of are some members of the farming community, it should be stressed that the proposed ban does not extend to all rifles. For example, members of the rural community who need a low powered .22 calibre bolt action rifle for controlling pests and killing diseased livestock may still possess such weapons, provided they meet the other general requirements set out in the scheme. A critical point of the proposal is that they not be permitted to use automatic or semiautomatic rifles for this purpose. In this respect I draw some comfort from a report in yesterday'S Sydney Morning Herald which indicated that a number of farmers interviewed do not consider that they need to use automatic or semi-automatic weapons. I am also advised that the President of the United Graziers Association, Mr Larry Acton, has supported such a ban and has argued that semi-automatics were needed only in 'extenuating circumstances', to use his words, and should not be privately owned. As I advised the House on Tuesday, it is very clear from newspaper reports that opinion polls show that the community is overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed ban. I do not accept the argument that a ban on all semi-automatic rifles, including low calibre they ones, should be seen as unjustified. Although military style weapons, such as those involved in the tragedy at Port Arthur, are clearly the worse sort of semi-automatic firearms, the Commonwealth's view is that all semiautomatic weapons are highly dangerous and should not be available within the community. Today's Herald-Sun reports that smaller guns have claimed 47 lives in massacres in Australia and New Zealand since 1971. To the extent that governments have the power to prevent such tragedies as Port Arthur occurring, I believe that all responsible governments have a duty to do so. One sometimes hears suggestions that the Commonwealth will be interfering with the right of Australians to own firearms. I totally this argument. Gun ownership is not a right. Rather, it should be seen as a conditional privilege reserved for those with a genuine reason and subject to appropriate controls. I am more attracted to an argument that all Australians have a right to exist in a society where they are not subject to the needless risk of being injured or killed as a consequence of the widespread availability and irresponsible use of firearms. Citizens are subject to regulation with respect to other less inherently dangerous activities, such as driving motor vehicles. In order to be pennitted to drive a car persons must satisfy certain requirements, including licence tests and periodic registration of the vehicle. Moreover, persons are not allowed to drive any vehicle on roads simply because they want to. It would be ludicrous to suggest that persons have a right to drive formula 1 race cars simply because of their performance. I believe that the same arguments apply equally, if not more so, to arguments suggesting that the government should not interfere with the so-called rights of gun owners. As members will be aware, the Commonwealth has put forward proposals in relation to the entire regime of gun controls. Apart from the question of prohibition, they address a range of key issues, including compensation for surrendered weapons, the development of safety training, uniform standards for the storage of firearms, effective nationwide licensing and registration requirements, a scheme requiring a permit to purchase each fireann and provisions relating to mail order sales. The proposals are minimum standards which the community would accept, following the tragic events at Port Arthur. In achieving these standards, I am confident that we will meet a number of vital objectives. There will be a reduction in the number of firearms in Australia. All automatic and semi-automatic long-arm weapons, other than for very limited purposes, will be eliminated and firearms access will be denied to persons who are either assessed as unfit or who are unable to prove a legitimate reason to either permit or use a firearm. The government accepts that these changes reject cannot be implemented without an amnesty and appropriate compensation. I have therefore recommended in the proposal to police ministers that a six-month national amnesty be established, underpinned by a compensation scheme. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has previously stated, the costs of such a scheme should be borne by the whole community, not just by those people surrendering firearms. As outlined by the Prime Minister to the House on Monday, the government recognises that the proposed prohibitions will inevitably cause some difficulty for tens of thousands of Australians who do possess firearms. Like the Prime Minister, I am confident that the community will match the national need and rise to the occasion in this time of difficulty. I therefore urge all jurisdictions to recognise that we must work together to achieve a genuine consensus between all states and territories on this vital matter, with a view to ensuring that we have uniform effective controls on weapons across Australia. I thank the opposition for its support.",86
224,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) (3.57 p.m.}-I rise to speak on this matter of public importance because this is a classic case of the parliament with a knee-jerk reaction. I believe that the people in the community, particularly those who have suffered as a result of this madman in Tasmania, and others, deserve more than a knee-jerk reaction. Both members who have spoken in this debate today know full well that automatic weapons have been banned in Australia in every state since about 1924. They also know that the Commonwealth government has the full power to stop the import of military style automatic weapons or, in fact, any automatic weapon. To say that they are going to put a ban on semi-automatic weapons and outlaw .22s and shotguns is simply an enonnous overreaction. The truth is that most of the murders committed in Australia are being committed by single-shot .22s and most are being committed in a family situation. This sort of law will do nothing to address that. The government knows this fact full well. I ask the government and the opposition what they intend to do when this sort of tragedy happens again. Of course it will happen again. What will they ban next time? After all, 78 per cent of all murders in Australia are mitted by people using blunt weapons or knives. Are we going to outlaw those as well? How does the government intend to outlaw bottles, for instance? I tum to the question of compensation. The government has said it will compensate, as indeed the constitution requires; Ted Drane from the Sporting Shooters Association says that he estimates compensation to be $500 million. I suspect Mr Drane is talking about Victoria alone, because the cost will be substantially higher. If the government is going to compensate, there are only two bases on which it can be done-either the purchase price or the replacement cost. If compensation is based on the purchase price, the total will run to far more than $500 million Australia wide and compensation based on the replacement cost will be even more. Let us look at some other hard facts which the government and the opposition know about. In the southern states and my own state of Western Australia, 25 per cent of guns are registered, which means that 75 per cent are not registered. Queensland has done it somewhat better because 40 per cent of guns in that state are registered. If the government brings in this legislation the only guns which can be addressed are the ones which are registered and those guns are clearly in the hands of the more responsible element in the community. What is the government going to do about the others? Those guns will simply go underground and the problem is that we will not know the dimensions of the guns and therefore cannot contend with them. The government says that the problem is just with automatic weapons, but let us consider the position in Switzerland. I am indebted to the Swiss embassy for this information. In Switzerland almost every family has at least one fully automatic sig assault rifle in the household. Anyone who knows anything about guns will know that the sig assault rifle is infinitely better than the gun used by the Australian army. Perhaps that is something else which should be looked at. This weapon is very effective for killing people, as military rifles are. They are not good hunting weapons. Generally, they are com- inaccurate over distances and are ideally suited for killing people at short range. In Switzerland every family has one in the house and 24 bullets to go with it in a sealed container, yet Switzerland has one of the lowest incidents of murder in the world. In Switzerland they will tell you that most of the crimes in that country are in fact committed by foreigners. That is another great triumph for multiculturalism! If that is the position in Switzerland, then we must look for some other reason. Any pharmacist will tell you that a lot of the mindaltering drugs, such as prozac, which are used to calm people down, in three per cent of cases have exactly the opposite effect. No-one is looking at this factor and nobody will look at it. While the government, supported by the opposition, is prepared to hammer ordinary Australians, it will not pull on the multinational drug companies. For the benefit of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), I wish to quote from page 399 of the book George Orwell: a life. I am taking this quote from the Evening Standard dated 8 January 1941. George Orwell said: The totalitarian state can do great things but there is one thing they cannot do. They cannot give the factory worker a rifle and tell him to take it home and keep it in his bedroom. That rifle hanging on the wall of the working class flat or labourer's cottage is a symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there. I put to the House that what we need in Australia-where we have a totally inadequate military system with only 3,000 infantry soldiers, which is quite clearly inadequate to defend this country from any serious attackis a large number of people in the community who are trained to handle guns. In large parts of rural and northern Australia people have these guns and know how to use them. I suspect that very few of them will be prepared to give them up. They will simply be driven underground. If the government had moved to outlaw military weapons it would have had my entire support, because that is the weapon which caused the trouble. Such damage could not have been inflicted with a .22 unless the person involved was an absolutely superb shot, which of course he was not. I still carry a bullet in my arm. I was shot not by an automatic, but by a repeater rifle. I make the point very strongly that this is a massive overkill. Who in society shoots ducks? Basically working class people are the duck shooters. An automatic shotgun is commonly used for shooting ducks. Once again, the Australian Labor Party, in conjunction with the other side, will penalise workers. What is wrong with shooting ducks? If ducks are not shot, farmers will poison or net them. Duck shooting is a method of culling ducks and that sport has my wholehearted support. It has every right to exist. It is interesting that one ever complains about catching blue marlin. I wonder why? Obviously it is a very elitist and expensive sport. I do not want to ban that sport, but I am not a person who bans things. It is difficult to speak against this issue because there is such large emotion in the community .. I put to the House that the government would get the same support in Australia if it were to attack the French as it did when in opposition. This was an example of populism and it raised public resentment against the French. However, in a more considered move I doubt whether the Australian public would vote that way. I believe that the Australian public will vote for sensible nuclear energy because they will look at all the facts. Whether you like it or not, this is a centralwhose ist move and the Howard centralist government is obviously being supported by the very centralist opposition. It will attack states rights and will be just another example of the erosion of the rights of the states. I believe Kennett is right. I find it very difficult to be in agreement with Kennett, but I believe he is right on this issue. I urge this House not to vote for this, although I know that is pretty hopeless because of this smug, sickening bipartisanship. People are talking about it as though they can understand the trauma suffered by the people who have experienced these grievous losses. It is quite clear what the House is going to do, but I want it on record that this is a kneejerk reaction and one that will not address the problem. Neither the government nor the opposition will ever look at issues which do address the problem. We have been party to letting people out of institutions because it became politically correct to release people from institutions onto the street. Many of these people are in institutions for their own protection and some are there for the protection of society. These people have been very badly used. In Victoria the solution was for the police to shoot old, deranged women, et cetera. That is not the sort of Australia that we want. We really ought to give much more thought to this issue other than the populist, no- knee-jerk reaction that has come from this centralist government which is showing every hallmark of going down the Keating road of arrogance.",88
225,Mrs BAILEY,Unknown,"It was with great pride that I stood in this chamber today with members of the opposition and all members of the government in unison on this matter of most public importance. Many tragedies have occurred in this country. Before speaking today, I was thinking about past tragedies like Ash Wednesday in Victoria, where 72 people lost their lives, and tragedies like the recent horrific bus accidents in New South Wales wherein 35 people lost their lives in one accident and 20 people lost their lives in another. While they were tragedies, and while there would not be one member of this House heart did not go out to all the family members of the victims in those accidents, I must say that I have to agree with the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and our Attorney General (Mr Williams) that this tragedy is different. It is different because it touches the heart of every Australian. I do speak with some emotion today because three of my constituents in the seat of MCEwen were killed and several others were injured, one in particular being severely injured. I listened to the member for Denison describe his feelings when he first learned the tragedy and when he went back to his home state and met with some of the people involved. I suppose until Tuesday of this requiring week I was like every other Australian; this sense of disbelief, this sense of shock, and was questioning how on earth it could happen in our country. On Tuesday I left this place and returned my electorate, to the small town of Kilmore, where I attended the funeral service of brothers, Kevin and Ray Sharp, who were victims at Port Arthur. The overwhelming feeling at that service, as well as the grief the sense of loss experienced by the family and friends of those two men and for the third victim, Mr Wally Bennet, who was a golfing mate of theirs from Kilmore, was by people coming up to me and can you do about it?' The member for Denison asked that question in his speech. I say to him that we as members of this place can take action to give the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) every support in what he is register trying to do. There has been much talk about the types of guns that are used. I am no expert on guns or ammunition. But I want to quote something years that one of my constituents had to say about the gun that was used on Sunday, 28 April. She said: That gave no one a chance . . . We thought, while he was firing, he was going to stop shortly, but it just went on and on and on. If that guy didn't have a weapon of such calibre, maybe someone would have been able to do something about it. She then went on to say: One boy who attempted to was just blasted away. I am not going to go into the graphic details that my constituents told me. Suffice it to say that the onslaught of bullets continued at a rapid rate and caused horrendous destruction to human beings. We in this place must do everything we can to reform the legislation and to make sure there is uniform legislation. As there is little time left to speak in this chamber today, I wish to raise just a couple more points specifically with regard to the terms of the MPI that the member for Denison raised. He talked about the need to of support the Commonwealth legislation. The Attorney-General has actually gone through some of the minimum standards that we are the states of this country to agree to. I had There is an urgent need on humanitarian grounds to establish that uniform legislation. In order to give other members a chance to speak here today, I would like to conclude by to reading into the Hansard a letter from one of my constituents. There has been quite a deal two of comment about some people, especially those from the gun lobby, claiming that they have a right to bear arms. I agree with the and Attorney-General that that is not part of our Australian history; that belongs to part of America's history. The letter I am going to read is from a retired lieutenant-colonel from exemplified the armed forces. He says: saying, 'What Dear Mrs Bailey, I am writing to ask you to please extend my support for the Prime Minister's initiative to nationally ban all automatic and semi-automatic firearms. We must have a national fire arms and uniform gun laws if we are to be at all serious about limiting the national stock of firearms and their illegal use. Mrs Bailey, I retired from the Army after 26 service in 1992. I served in Vietnam with the SAS and I have seen soldiers seriously wounded by weapons similar to those used at Port Arthur last Sunday. Such weapons are not needed for any purpose other than military purposes. Frankly, they are designed for rapid, hard hitting shooting, where every shot is to seriously wound or kill an enemy soldier so that he cannot wound or kill you. The calibre of the weapons, their muzzle velocity, their rate of fire and the number of rounds of ammunition"" that can be carried in the magazines for the weapons clearly illustrate their purpose. There can be no argument about the need for ownership of such weapons for sporting purposes, or even for pest animal culls, such as buffalo control in the Northern Territory. If such a need exists then weapons could be specifically licensed for the particular operation and then the licence and the weapon withdrawn. Perhaps our soldiers could do such culls under the supervision of the appropriate civil authority. I must add that I am a registered shooter although I do not own a fireann. However, I am avidly against private ownership of other than bolt action, limited calibre rifles by strictly screened individuals, and I am totally against the private ownership of hand guns. Please encourage the Prime Minister and all your parliamentary colleagues to not be dissuaded in your purpose by the gun lobby or those states that currently have inappropriate and irresponsible gun laws. The great majority of the Australian people are behind the Prime Minister's initiative in this. Please urge him to see it through. Yours sincerely Peter Gurney Recent indications have shown that at least 90 per cent of the Australian people are supporting the initiatives taken by this government and so wholeheartedly supported by the opposition. There has been a growing trend, a frightening trend, towards mass killings in this society. You have only to read the daily newspapers and watch the news services. Hopefully, the action that we are going to take will prevent that. I would like to add that today I contacted Mr Garry Broome, who was one of the survivors of the massacre in Port Arthur on 28 April. I would like this parliament to hear his words. He said to me: I realise that you can't ban every gun in the country, and I know it won't stop all tragedies, this must help. I wholeheartedly support uniform legislation, and there definitely should be no mail order guns. I want to say thankyou for being prepared to do something. (Time expired)",90
226,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"I rise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in this. debate to lend support to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General Minister for Justice (Mr Williams), who is at the table, in their attempts to secure stricter gun controls in Australia. Today in the Sydney Morning Herald there is a headline that 'States revolt on gun bans', and the article indicates that some states in Australia do support what the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice doing. I say to the Prime Minister and the minister at the table that the Australian Labor Party is fully behind you in your endeavours. This is an issue that has cross-party support. In this evening's debate we have heard that there is not unanimous support within the parliament over what the government is a doing, but there is near unanimous support. There is support in the community, as opinion polls are showing consistently. The Newspoll this week showed 83 per cent support for what the government is doing. In the state of South Australia there is 90 per cent support. The papers also indicate that there are some members of the National Party who are not too keen on what the government is doing. I say to the Prime Minister and to the minister at the table that those people, whilst they have a right to be heard, in this instance do not have the prevailing view in my opinion and in the overwhelming opinion of the public. It is the time to act. The sad fact is that it is only a conservative government that can act in this area because, when Labor governments tried in the past, sadly we were unable to progress the matter any further due to conservative elements in the community that did not support what we were doing. I think it is significant that the Attorney General has outlined proposals to be made to the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May 1996. I endorse those proposals, and the third paragraph in particular which says but that 'the ownership, possession and use of firearms is a conditional privilege, not a right'. I do not believe in the unfettered right to bear arms in this country. I do not want Australia to be another America. The statistics show that, in 1994, in a population of 250 million, there were 39,250 deaths in America alone-a 64 per cent increase from 1968. I do not want Australia to go down that path; nor and does the Australian Labor Party. In 1984 in Australia there were 522 gun deaths, either suicides or domestic killings. How does that occur? It occurs because there says are more guns in the marketplace. The government is proposing to take these guns not out of the marketplace and to provide compensation. If the states do not cooperateare because there is no doubt that what is required is cooperation from all state governments-then I say to the minister at the table and to the Prime Minister, 'Let us have a referendum and give the Commonwealth the powers.' Opinion polls show that over 80 per cent of the public say they would vote yes in national referendum to transfer state responsibilities to the federal government to enable it to pass national gun laws. Why? That is because what the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, the minister at the table, are doing is right. You will never get unanimous support for any measure. There will always be the odd crackpot or person with a different view, a legitimate view, and they are entitled to be heard. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) got the call when a National Party Deputy Speaker was in the chair. The convention in this place is that MPIs are an opportunity for the opposition to put their policies and ideas into the marketplace. The convention is that two opposition members and two government members speak in the debate. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie played his little game and he was successful in this instance in getting the call from a National Party Deputy Speaker-much to the horror of most members. He is entitled to be heard, but I say to him that the views that he put to this chamber",92
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Banks will be very careful about reflecting on the chair.,93
228,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"I hear what you are saying, Mr Deputy Speaker. I say this to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie: I heard you; I listened to you. I do not agree with you, and 99 per cent of parliamentarians in this place and in the Senate do not agree with you either. The public overwhelmingly do not agree with you either. So you have been heard. I say to the Prime Minister: do not be dictated to by the lowest common denominator in the community or by some members of the National Party who wish to try to lower the standards that you and the Attorney General have put into the marketplace already, because you have the overwhelming support of the community and you have the overwhelming support of the major political parties in this place. It is good to see that Prime Minister, according to press reports, is not going to be bowed. He is reported by Michael Millet that, despite internal pressure, he has refused to deviate from his initial line that the minimum requirement is a total prohibition on automatic and semi-automatic weapons. I believe that is the mInImum position in relation to their availability to the general public. I have been in the coroner's court as a legal representative presiding over coronial inquests. It is not a pleasant sight to see the pictures, as it was not a pleasant sight to see the results of what happened a short time ago in Tasmania. It is opportune, it is time for us as legislators at the federal level and at a state level, to seize the moment and to take the toys away from the boys. There is no place in our society for these weapons any longer.",93
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The matter of public importance is concluded.,93
230,Mr NEHL,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I did not hear the start of his contribution to the debate but, having just attended a meeting and on returning to my office, I did hear him call me a 'National Party Deputy Speaker'. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am grievously offended by that. When I occupy that chair, as you do, I have no party. I can say only that I am sure the member for Banks did not intend to say that and reflect on anybody who occupies that chair. I know that you are not a 'Labor Party Deputy Speaker'. I find what he said extremely offensive. Mr Leo MCLeay-Why didn't you stick to convention and call the honourable member for Banks?",93

233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member for Watson will just the resume his seat for a second. The honourable member for Cowper has made his point. I did suggest to the honourable member for Banks that he should be very careful in the way that he reflected upon the chair after the remark was made. Given the emotions that surrounded this discussion of the matter of public importance, the point has been made and perhaps the House would be best to leave it at that for this evening.",93
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)The discussion is concluded. NA Motion (by Mr Sharp) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Monday, 20 May 1996, at 12.30 p.m., unless the Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",94
235,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, the Wool International Act 1993, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Act 1993, the Poultry Assistance Act 1965 and the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988. The bill will also repeal three acts and make consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 because of the repeal of these acts. The bill contains an amendment to section 15 of the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to preserve the integrity of licences granted under the act, the boundaries of which might be affected by changes in the location of the territorial sea baseline. At present, the section applies only where changes to the baseline might be caused by natural processes such as tides or storms. The amendment expands the section to apply it to changes in the location of the baseline resulting from acquisition of new data or reconsideration of existing data. The amendment has been made necessary by a recent case where the integrity of licences has been brought into question by a change in the location of the baseline caused by reconsideration of old data. This amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 is required following a change in the representative organisation of the egg industry and a subsequent request from the industry for acknowledgment of the recently formed Australian Egg Industry Association, AEIA, as the representative industry organisation on matters requiring industry consultation meeting. in place of the former industry body-the Australian Council of Egg Producers, ACEP. The AEIA now needs to be acknowledged in the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 to provide it with a legal basis to make recommendations on behalf of industry on levy related matters. The act imposes a levy in respect of laying chickens hatched and provides regulations for the purposes of levy rates, with the amount of levy as recommended by the now defunct ACEP. Funds raised under this levy currently reside in the Poultry Industry Trust Fund, PITF, established by the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965. This act needs to be amended to facilitate the transfer of funds from the PITF to the Egg Industry Development Fund administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation for research and development on the egg industry. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 along with the Egg Industry Research (Hen Quota) Levy Act 1987 and Poultry Industry Levy Act 1965 will be repealed once the transfer of the funds has been made. The AEIA has also requested an increase in the research and development component of the levy from 1 July 1996, subject to legislative amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 acknowledging the AEIA as the representative body for these purposes. The egg industry has not increased its contribution to research and development for a number of years and the proposed increase will have the effect of maintaining the real value of its research and development activities. It would be appropriate that any amendment to the act facilitate future changes in industry representative organisation status in a manner similar to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, eliminating the need for legislative amendment for any future changes in industry representative organisation. The establishment of Wool International in 1993 was part of a strategy to develop a much stronger and commercially driven Australian wool industry, in more direct control over its destiny. The government believes the industry's long-term future lies in its continuing to move towards a market driven approach, closely attuned to the needs of customers and end users, and free from unnecessary government involvement. The shadow minister for industry and regional development, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who is at the table, at that stage was the minister and he and I interacted over a very considerably involved debate on the future of the wool industry in 1993. He will well recall it, I am sureMr Crean-I do.",94
236,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"A very model of constructive dialogue, I would have thought, between you and meMr Crean-Good to see you're still carrying on your plan.",95
237,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"That depends a bit on your shadow minister over there. This package of amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 is part of an evolutionary process, and includes, amongst other things, termination of voluntary, or additional, contributions of wool tax over and above 4.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool other than carpet wool. That will be widely welcomed by the industry and I think they await with great expectation that relief. I would note in passing that it is the result, easily lost sight of in current circumstances that the wool industry is in, of the fact that wool prices recovered more strongly and faster than was anticipated following the passage of the 1993 act. In addition the amendments include setting the amount payable to Wool International in respect of the stockpile debt component of wool tax by regulation; and enabling Wool International to undertake a program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool through its subsidiary, Wool International Holdings. The bill also proposes two amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993. The first is consequential to the above amendment to the Wool International Act 1993 in relation to the setting of rates of wool tax. The other will provide for interim wool industry funding for the Australian Animal Health Council by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Voluntary Contributions The payment by growers of the compulsory 4.5 per cent debt component of wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards entitles them to a share in any surplus from the sale of the stockpile by Wool International, to be made available once the associated government guaranteed debt has been retired. It also entitles them, should they so choose, to take up equity in any privatised Wool International. The Wool International Act 1993 provides for eligible wool tax payers to gain additional entitlements by making voluntary contributions up to 5.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool, other than carpet wool, in addition to the 4.5 per cent stockpile debt component of wool tax. Nobody seems to want to do that at the moment anyway, but they did when things looked a bit brighter. The circumstances in the wool industry have changed markedly since the present statutory framework was put in place in 1993. For example, there is now anticipated to be a significant surplus arising from stockpile sales after the government guaranteed debt has been retired. There is, therefore, no need for voluntary contributions to repay debt. Retaining the provision could also result in the a small number of large, well-off, producers enhancing their entitlements at the expense of other eligible wool tax payers not in a financial position to make voluntary contributions. The proposed legislative amendments therefore provide for the cessation of voluntary wool tax contributions retrospective to 20 June 1995, the date of the announcement. Setting the Debt Component of Wool Tax by Regulation Currently, the amount payable to Wool International in respect of the tax imposed under the wool tax acts on shorn wool, other than carpet wool, is prescribed in the Wool International Act 1993 at 4.5 per cent. These payments go to service stockpile debt. A review of the 4.5 per cent component of wool tax payable to Wool International was conducted early in 1996 in the context of the significant projected surplus of funds in Wool International once the government guaranteed debt has been retired. The review found there was scope to remove this component of the tax from 1 July 1996. The proposed legislative amendments will enable the setting of the amount of wool tax payable to Wool International by regulation which will, in tum, be set to zero. The amendments also provide for the maximum amount of wool tax to be 4.5 per cent. A consequential amendment to section 51 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 is needed to take into account the proposed amendments to the Wool International Act 1993. This section provided for a recommendation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to be put to a ballot of wool tax payers in respect of the percentages of wool tax payable under the wool tax acts for research and development and of promotion. The recommendation must have regard to the legislated percentage of wool tax payable to Wool International in respect of debt reduction. Under the proposed amendments, this amount will now be set by regulation. Future Marketing Activities of Wool International As part of its legislated functions, Wool International has been examining various options for further developing risk management mechanisms for the industry. As part of this examination, it has recommended that its subsidiary, Wool International Holdings, undertake a limited trading program to develop and evaluate forward and futures markets as a risk management tool. This is surely greatly needed and I would have thought that everyone in the industry would acknowledge that in view of the removal of the old reserve price scheme, which was the mechanism by which growers in the past levelled their income flows, smoothed their income flows, and in an environment where currently growers are-to put it mildly-subject not only to low prices but to extraordinary volatility and uncertainty. Proposed amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 make provision for Wool International to hold shares in a subsidiary undertaking, such a program including the use of futures and currency contracts for hedging purposes. Notwithstanding this provision, Wool International would require the prior approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy before it could commence the trading program using Wool International Holdings. This approval will be tabled and its making advised in the gazette. Either house of parliament will be able, during a period of three sitting days, to disallow the approval. The provision will be subject to a sunset clause such that if no approval has been given by the minister by 1 July 1997 the Governor General may proclaim the provision as having no further effect. Strict measures to limit the financial risk of the proposal and details of operational aspects, such as reporting requirements, would be specified in the conditions encompassed in the ministerial approval. The memorandum and articles of Wool International Holdings would also need to be changed to reflect these conditions. Other key points regarding the program are: It would have to be conducted as a commercial operation separate from Wool International with a two-year time frame commencing in 1996. It would be funded from revenue received from the management of non-wool assets, as provided for in the existing legislation. There would be no government guarantee involved. Wool International Holdings would have access to the stockpile on a commercial basis only. Regular reports to the Wool International board would be required to be provided, and through the board to the minister. Rigorous risk management arrangements would be put in place to ensure the program was conducted within an agreed capital limit. Separate and transparent accounting would be required. Subjection to all the requirements of Corporations Law and all forms of taxation would be required. The use of a subsidiary such as Wool International Holdings or a separate corporate entity would ensure the trading activities were kept separate from those of Wool International proper, the main legislated responsibility of which will remain the management of the stockpile. Such a separation is very important in the context of maintaining market confidence in Wool International's stockpile operations. I emphasise here again that there is no suggestion that the government will diminish any such separation. The point is therefore emphasised that the program undertaken by Wool International Holdings would in no way impact on the disposal of the stockpile under the fixed release schedule. Wool International Holdings would only have access to the stockpile on the same commercial basis as any other industry participant. The proposed program, which has the support of the Wool Council of Australia, would represent a natural progression in Wool International's efforts to stimulate more effective management of risk in the industry, the need for which has been clearly demonstrated by the current price volatility in the wool market. Unlike most other commodity markets, the wool industry, particularly growers, does not make adequate use of risk management options such as forward selling and futures contracts to manage risk. However, while the forward trading proposal is ultimately directed towards risk management and strengthening the forward and futures markets for wool, it would also provide valuable information in considering the options regarding a privatisation of Wool International. It would assist eligible wool tax payers to evaluate the commercial viability of a privatised organisation undertaking forward marketing operations and providing risk management services. In this way it would help eligible wool tax payers to make a more informed decision regarding privatisation. The proposal does not presuppose the eventual privatisation of Wool International. Eligible wool tax payers, through the issue of a prospectus, will have the choice, based on their own commercial judgment, as to whether they leave their equity in a privati sed Wool International. Wool Industry Funding of the Australian Animal Health Council The bill will also repeal the provision at section 79 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 for wool industry funding of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council and substitute this with provision for an industry contribution to the proposed Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. The Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council ceased operations on 30 June 1995, and the proposed Australian Animal Health Council Ltd has been established as a non-profit company, limited by guarantee, under Corporations Law. The Australian Animal Health Council will be jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and the peak national representative bodies of Australia's livestock based industries. The council's mission will be to ensure the Australian animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas. The Wool Council of Australia has sought, and supports, the amendment. This is an interim measure which will cease to apply after the 1996-97 financial year. The Wool Council is considering alternatives for longer term funding and will advise its position in due course. Complementary legislation to provide for the participation of other livestock industries in the proposed Australian Animal Health Council is contained in the Australian Animal Health Council Livestock Industries Funding Bill. I commend the biIl to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA NA First Reading Bill presented by Dr Kemp, and read a first time.

238,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (4.44 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill repeals the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 and amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. The training guarantee scheme was introduced on 1 July 1990 by the previous government to increase the quality and quantity of training provided by industry. While it was clear that there was a need to improve the training effort, the training guarantee did not receive widespread support. It imposed a mandatory financial commitment on all but very small companies that did not reflect the quality or relevance of training provided. Over the period that the training guarantee was operational, employer dissatisfaction with the scheme increased. The government in the end acknowledged the fact that the scheme was not operating effectively and it was suspended by the former government in July 1994 for a period of two years. In the lead-up to the election, the government outlined its intention to abolish the training guarantee scheme as it has become evident that the training guarantee was not the answer to Australia's comparatively low levels of training. This bill gives effect to government's commitment, and will repeal the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. While the training guarantee will be abolished with the passage of this biIl, the need for training reform in Australia remains, but it must be reform that is driven by industry, not imposed upon it. 1996 The government will develop a modern, relevant training system that is flexible, responsive and meets the needs of industry. This is a more important goal than imposing minimum expenditure levels on an enterprise, when we cannot ensure that the training they need is relevant and readily available. The government will ensure that industry can actively participate in the development and implementation of a modern system of training in Australia, ensuring appropriate industry driven outcomes to provide Australia with a first-class training system to improve international competitiveness and provide job opportunities for the young people who were abandoned by the previous government. The bill also provides for the amendment of subsection 22a(3) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. This amendment addresses an anomaly created through the Higher Education Funding Act (No.2) 1995, which allocated funds under subsection 22a(5) for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998. As a result of an oversight, subsection 22a(3) was not amended at the same time to enable determinations to be made approving the expenditure of funding for these years. The open learning initiative has facilitated access and increased flexibility in the provision of quality tertiary education to the community. There are two key elements of the open learning initiative which operate together to achieve equitable access to education, the Open Learning Agency of Australia . and Open Net. The Open Learning Agency of Australia acts as a broker between education providers and individuals wishing to study through open learning. Open Net enables its clients to use computer based communications to access the education resources and to communicate via the Internet. This government is committed to the application of modem communications technology to enhance education service deli very and access to information resources. The open learning initiative is central to the government's vision of equitable access to the resources of education for all of the community. The amendment will enable the government to continue its support of this initiative. 2000. As the amendment gives effect to the expenditure allocated by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No.2) 1995, there will be no additional budgetary implications arising out of the measure. The amendment of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 provides an additional $20.7 million in capital funding for non-government schools in 1996-97. This completes the previous government's undertaking in 1992 to provide additional funding for a limited period of time. In the expectation that the Commonwealth would provide these funds, non-government schools have undertaken capital commitments which the current government is now fulfilling.

239,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (4.50 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide improved arrangements for grants of financial assistance to be made to the state and territory governments, non-government school systems and indigenous education institutions. The aim of this bill is to facilitate increased p!&ticipation and improved education outcomes for indigenous Australians. The current act provides funding to 30 June 1997. This bill amends the funding level for the period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 and establishes funding levels up to 30 June These funding levels reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation for 1996, and establish the commonwealth's commitment under this act for each year of the third triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar year basis. The government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. The restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic results program will accelerate development of culturally appropriate indigenous education services under rigorous outcomes focused accountability arrangements. In terms of program administration, those changes will establish a more cost-effective, more transparent, more manageable and, critically, a more accountable process for the distribution of commonwealth funds. Parties to an indigenous education agreement will receive funding in two ways: either by way of a per capita entitlement basis or on the basis of strategic results projects. Both elements will focus on ensuring that the program is a value for money program which achieves improved educational outcomes for indigenous Australians. This will mean negotiating a higher level of educational accountability for these Commonwealth funds. The supplementary funding from the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program is the Commonwealth's principal program for indigenous education. The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will provide an entitlement-based, equitable, recurrent funding arrangement. It will recognise the different resource bases of education providers as well as accommodating the higher costs of education provision in remote areas and in some sectors. Such acknowledgment is a prerequisite for establishing outcomes based accountability arrangements. The element known as the strategic results projects will provide funding required to undertake priority projects of national signifiand cance that will contribute to achieving policy goals by 2001. Such projects, in order to receive Commonwealth funding, must demonstrate that they deal with major barriers to educational attainment such as high drop-out rates and low retention rates. These projects will remove barriers to attainment that cannot be addressed by mainstream programs. Projects will be for a specific period of time, will have specified purposes, outcomes and targets and will be subject to an accountability system which will focus much more than in the past on the monitoring and reporting of improved educational outcomes rather than just financial inputs. The implementation of such rigorous accountability measures will ensure a comprehensive improvement in the achievement of goals for reducing the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians. Many factors contribute to that educational disadvantage. The identification of the causes of such high levels of educational disadvantage is complex. In acknowledging this complexity, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy reflects the importance of a cooperative, collaborative effort to develop more effective processes for education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The policy is based on the principle of shared effort and shared responsibility with state and territory governments in consultation with indigenous people. The tripartite nature of this partnership is a key component of the determination to achieve better outcomes from all sectors of indigenous education. The 1994 review of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy found that between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 of school increased from 14 per cent to about 33 per cent. During the same period, the number of indigenous students attending university doubled. Despite such encouraging improvements in educational outcomes, indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool right through to university, Aboriginal people Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than their non-indigenous peers. For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students. At secondary school level, 25 per cent of indigenous students leave school before completing year 10, compared to two per cent of other Australians. The year 12 retention rate for indigenous students is 33 per cent, compared to 76 per cent for other Australians. The importance of quality education is clear. These amendments to the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act will provide funding to improve education opportunities and outcomes for indigenous people. Economic efficiency and social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people. There is agreement within the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, following reaffirmation of its commitment to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, that states and territories will set literacy, numeracy and employment targets in their indigenous education agreements for Aboriginal education strategic initiatives funding in the next triennium. These are key issues requiring increased effort and rigorous monitoring of strategies to ensure their success. Efforts will also be concentrated on the early childhood education years to ensure better outcomes in literacy and numeracy. There will also be efforts to concentrate on the employment of indigenous people at all levels of the education and training industry. It is recognised that, to achieve improved outcomes, strategies will need to address other key issues including: involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents in their children's education; improving preschool education outcomes; employing and training Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers; providing appropriate professional development of staff involved in indigenous education; developing culturally sensitive curricula; involving indigenous Australians in educational decision making; setting as an objective the achievement of literacy and numeracy outcomes for indigenous Australians which are similar to those of non-indigenous Australians, and reviewing progress towards this objective by the year 2000; and giving priority to addressing the development of sound foundation competencies, particularly in literacy and numeracy, to assist indigenous Australians in making the transition from education and training to the work force. The level of improvement evident in some sectors of indigenous education has to become more consistent across the whole provision of education services for indigenous Australians. The rate of improvement must be accelerated. Not only will such improvement bring about important benefits for individuals and the entire indigenous community but also it will play a major part in the national reconciliation agenda. These amendments will, through the restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, contribute to ensuring such improvements are achieved in indigenous education. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA BILL (No.1) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
240,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.59 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the taxation laws relating to provisional tax, share buybacks and gifts. The share buyback and gift measures were introduced into the parliament late last year but were not debated. Provisional Tax The bill will give effect to the coalition's election commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for the 1996-97 income year to six per cent. Under Labor the uplift factor was set at eight per cent for the previous three years income. This rate exceeded growth in income subject to provisional tax in these years-more than double the rate of actual income growth in one of these years. It was merely a tax grab and a way to bring forward revenue collections. It placed a heavy cashflow burden on small business and self-funded retirees. The amendment is an important example of the coalition delivering on its election promises. The government is committed to the small business sector and self-funded retirees, both of whom will benefit from this measure. Share Buybacks The bill will give effect to the 1995-96 budget announcement that the full buyback price of a share in an off-market share buyback is to be treated as consideration for ordinary income and capital gain purposes. Relief from double taxation is provided by reducing the amount of the ordinary income that gain or capital gain by the amount of the dividend included in assessable income or paid out of profits. If the dividend is rebatable, it will not create or increase, a capital loss or allowable deduction. A market value rule is also to apply to off-market share buybacks. Any excess over the market value of a share-that is, a dividend-will not be frankable. These amendments will apply to share buybacks that take place after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995, unless they occur under certain transitional arrangements. The amendments have the potential to prevent a future loss to the revenue. Deductions for Gifts The bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts of $2 or more to the Polly Farmer Foundation, the Australian Games Uniform Company Ltd and the Cobram and District War Memorial Incorporated Fund. The bill also extends the time for tax deductibility of donations to the Shrine of Remembrance Restoration and Development Trust and the Sandakan Memorials Trust Fund. I commend the bill to the House, and I present the explaing natory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. HAZARDOUS WASTE (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA General Purpose Standing Debate resumed.",101
241,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I was not sure before question time whether the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) had actually finished, but he has told me that he may want to intervene in the debate. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will make sure that he does that only in accordance with the standing orders. Whilst we welcome the decision of the government to move for the establishment of these general purpose committees, we do have a number of issues that we want to raise in relation to them. I say this at the outset because it does go to the question generally of this assertion that the new government is making the parliament more accountable and giving it primacy. We have seen today already in the Telstra debate a circumstance in which the government says that it is the parliament that will have primacy, not the executive, yet it will not allow the parliament to debate amendments moved by the opposition. Mr Reith-That's not true.",102
242,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"It is true. Despite an understanding we had that in the consideration in detail stage we would be able to not just move our amendments but to actually speak to them, that was denied in all but one case. Here we have the most important issue that this government campaigned on in the election. They have come into this place indicatthat they want the parliament to really scrutinise what they do, but they deny the parliament the opportunity to debate it. I think we do have to always qualify the unction with which the Leader of the House gets up here from time to time to assert that he is really trying to introduce new standards into the place. The fact of the matter is that we did not add more speakers to the second reading debate. We exhausted that list. The understanding was that at the conclusion of that we would have the opportunity to get the amendments. But they denied it; they moved the gag. Not only did they do that, they prevented us even raising these points in the third reading debate, and I think that is appropriate in the debate on the third reading of a speech. Therefore, we take this opportunity to draw your attention to that. I think it is a serious matter of concern that for the first major piece of legislation which is introduced into this parliament the government denied the opposition the opportunity to move amendments and speak to them. That is just the first-only the first. I guess that, despite all that they profess to support by way of greater accountability and greater primacy of the parliament, it is just one of many instances where they will revert to simply ramming this stuff through despite the objections on this side and our right to raise certain issues. The other point that I would make relates to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) getting up at the end of question time to argue that question time now makes the parliament more accountable. I think you would have to say that any independent observer who has been in this House listening to question time for the last two weeks would be struggling to know what had been answered. The reality is that, despite the fact that there have been more questions asked in this parliament, there have been very few answers given. Ministers simply come to the table and either obfuscate or refuse to answer questions. One could hardly call that accountability. There is no point in pretending that, simply because more questions are being processed through the place, parliament is being made accountable. Simply getting the ministers to tum up in parliament each question time does not make them accountable if they refuse to answer questions. As we have continued to point out on this side of the House, it is all very well asserting that you make ministers accountable by their turning up to the parliament but, unless there is some preparedness on the part of the government to address the issue of what constitutes relevancy in answers to questions, the problem is going to continue. The frustration that I have had in the portfolio that I cover relates to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) being asked about 10 questions in this parliament and not answering one of them. No independent observer could come into this place and say that the minister for industry is answering a questionMr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order relating to relevance: the fact is that we are short of time. I appreciate that my opposite number thinks that filibustering is somehow a useful tactic for them, but there may be other people who would like to speak on the parliamentary committees matter. I really think that he should be required to be relevant. We are short of time because we gave the opposition the extra time they wanted this morning. We have bent over backwards to do this thing reasonably. It is a pity it is not being reciprocated.",102
243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Thank you. You have registered your point of order. I might say that the various points being made by the member for Hotham relating to accountability are relevant· standing committees and the way they operate.,103
244,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I thank the Deputy Speaker for his ruling, because he is absolutely right; we are talking about the accountability of the parliament. We are talking about circumstances in which steps taken to date are not making the parliament more accountable. This motion that we have before the House does not do anything to add to accountability. Whilst the committees have been set up, they have stripped their numbers to ensure that the opposition does not get a fair crack at representation on those committees. The effect of this motion relates, in essence, not just to the establishment of committees but also to their composition. Under the old arrangements, committees comprised 12 members of the House-seven from the government and five from the opposition. We do not argue against the notion that the government of the day has the majority on committees. That is not the point. But what we see from the amendments being moved is that the government is going to increase the membership from 12 to 14, but the two additional members will go to the government. We are told that, in addition to the five that we have to deal with, we have to accommodate the Independents group within that. We recognise that the Independents group are part of the non-government parties. We recognise that we have to have discussions with them to accommodate their interests. But the more sensible way of addressing this point is to increase the size of committees by one and to ensure that the opposition parties have six members, not five. It does not diminish the nine that this government is seeking for its own side. It increases the size of committees by one and enables the opposition to be appropriately represented. On the issue of representation, it is argued that this nine-five split represents the proportional carve-up of this parliament. We argue that, if you are going to do it on a proportional basis, then, in the first instance, you have to take out of the numbers against which you draw the proportions the people who cannot to the sit on committees-ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and, of course, the Speaker. In our view, that would reduce the number of members eligible to sit on committees from 147 to 123. Of that 123, there are 69 government members, 49 opposition members and five independent members. If you do the proportional carve-up of the 123 government and non-government members, you should have eight government members and six nongovernment members on committees. Indeed, if we were really applying this rule in the way asserted by the Leader of the House-to represent proportionality-then we would really see committees of 14, divided into eight and six. I have circulated an amendment in the interests of trying to give the opposition appropriate representation on these committees. The amendment proposes that we substitute the government's words with the following words: ""Each Committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of 15 members, with membership of each committee reflecting the proportion of governcing ment to non-government Members in the House, namely, nine government and six non-government Members"". I have tried to indicate to the Leader of the House that this would be a more sensible way to go. He says that we are filibustering in this debate and that he really wants to get these things set up. If he were genuine about getting these committees set up, he would find that the easy solution would be to agree to our proposition. There are people on our side of the House who want to argue very strongly for increased opposition representation on these committees. They are people who have participated in the committee structure, unlike me. I was a minister in the previous government and did not have the opportunity to participate in the committee structure. The reality is that there are many instances where parliamentary committees have significantly improved the accountability of the parliament. They have involved themselves in extensive consultations and in considerations of very significant matters of great national importance; they have made recommendations; they have called for submissions; they have consulted all sorts of interested groups; and they have been able to take the parliament out into the nation, rather than consider it all here in this closeted atmosphere. This has provided a circumstance in which real input and accountability can come through the committee structure. If we are serious about arguing for better standards of the parliament and better service by the parliament of the needs of the nation, we have to make the committee structure work. If we are going to make it work, there has to be appropriate recognition of representation by opposition members. It is not as if, by increasing the size by one and still having a breakdown of nine to six, the government is going to be in a difficult position on contentious issues, but it does allow much more effective representation and accountability. Another point we would argue is the concern raised in this House by way of questions to the Speaker on one occasion-I think in question time-going to the issue of resourcommittees. There is no point establishing them unless they have the resources to function-the secretariat service, the ability to convene meetings, to take the submissions and to prepare information. Those on this side of the House who have participated in the committee structure have spoken with a great deal of admiration for the support they have been given by the various committee secretariats. With every report that has been tabled we have heard members attest to the professionalism and effectiveness of those who serve the committees. Yet, if the rumours-the suggestions-that abound that the government is going to cut the numbers and resources are true, committees will not get the proper servicing they require and the accountability of committees will be diminished. So it is a question of better accountability through better representation of the opposition and also through ensuring that committees are properly served by the secretariat. The final point I refer to goes to the structure of the committees. I know that the Leader of the House sought indulgence to refer to some other matters that might come up later about the committees. I want to make reference to one of the committees that has been abolished. I think it is the committee for the future",103
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,-The Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies.,105
246,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"Precisely, Mr Deputy Speaker. We know in the last election that when the government was campaigning, it had no vision for this country. We saw the Leader of the Opposition indicate that his vision for the future was, 'It's my tum. You should let me become Prime Minister. I've been hanging around for a long time. That's why I want to be Prime Minister.' We take the view that parliaments have to think beyond their three year term. When one looks at the role that the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies played-the committee that was chaired by the member for Lalor (Mr Jones) in the last parliament-one will see that some very significant issues came from that committee for consideration by the House. For example, Australia's population carrying capacity, the information revolution and the workplace of the future are all issues that parliament should be thinking about. It makes no sense to abolish the committee that was looking at"" these sorts of things. Other committees do not have a sweeping mandate to look at these sorts of things and we think it is a great pity that this committee is being rubbed out. I must say, if you asked the average person out there which politician is held in highest regard in the country, that person would probably say 'Barry Jones'. Yet we are going to wind up the very committee that he chaired and drove. He brought us some very sensible decisions, too. I move: Omit from paragraph (c) ""Each Committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of 14 members, with membership of each committee reflecting the proportion of government to non-government Members in the House, namely, nine government and five non-government Members"", substitute: ""Each Committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of 15 members, with membership of each committee reflecting the proportion of ment to non-government Members in the House, namely, nine government and six non-government Members"". (Time expired)",105
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the amendment seconded?,105
248,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,Watson) (5.18 p.m.)I second the amendment. Mr Reith-I move that the question be put.,105
249,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, he cannot do that now. He doesn't know his job properly.",105
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Watson has seconded the motion. Please continue. Mr LEO MCLEAYI intend to. I thank you very much. It is good that the Leader of the House has leamt something this afternoon. Mrs Crosio---Did he apologise?,105
251,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"Of course not, because the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is not interested in democracy in this House. He won the election and, quite rightly, the election gives him a mandate to do things, but there is also an issue of accountability in this place. The Leader of the House has to understand that part of that accountability is the parliamentary committee system. All that the opposition is asking for is a bit of fairness. In this House 123 members are able to participate in the committee system-the Speaker cannot, the ministers cannot, nor can the parliamentary secretaries. If you want to be strictly proportional-as the Leader of the House told us earlier in this debate he wanted to be-a strict proportionality of those members who are available to be members of committees would give the government-on a 14-member committee-eight members and the non-government members would have six. The reality is that the government wants to destroy the convention of the past and take away, once again, another area of accountability to which parliament can call the government. We as the opposition would say that that is not a reasonable thing to do. I do not know why the Leader of the House is so frightened by the committee system, because the reality has been in the past that very few governcommittees have had minority reports. The vast majority of their reports have been unanimous. Governments in the past have found the reports of a lot of the committees to be very helpful. In fact, ministers in the past have asked committees to carry out inquiries for them into areas which were difficult for the government, but if they could get a bi- Smith, W. L. partisan approach out of a committee, then it was a useful process. But to do that the opposition needs to have a reasonable representation on the committee. The proposition that the Leader of the House has put is that the government, because they have more members, might wish to increase the number of government members. We have no problem with that. But we think it is a bit rich to dilute the opposition's representation. We would not be not concerned if the government said they wanted to have 16-member committeesMotion (by Mr Reith) put: That the honourable member be not further heard. The House divided.
