1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA",13
2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore, isMr Sercombe-He's at lunch.",13
3,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"He is unwell. Mr Crean-Oh, we know that.",13
4,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"This is going to be a terrific question time! The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) will be the Acting Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and, in his normally competent way, will answer questions on Mr Moore's behalf. NA",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Indian Commerce Minister, His Excellency Dr Ramaiah. On behalf of the House, I extend to you, sir, a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Cross-Media Ownership",13
6,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his backflip on cross-media ownership rules. Has the Prime Minister explained his backflip to those he made promises to? If so, when and what precisely did he say to them and what was their response? I ask whether the Prime Minister or his office told the Sydney Morning Herald: Mr Howard's retreat has been influenced by internal polling showing the electorate regarded media overhaul as marginal and taking up too much of the Government's time. Isn't this just further evidence that the Prime Minister is a poll-driven, flip-flop, weak leader?",13
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You did a pretty good flip-flop before the ACTU congress this morning. You were going to dissociate yourself from the union movement; instead of that, you are locked into a bear hug with them for the next election. And we are delighted! In relation to cross-media matters, our priorities are jobs, taxation reform and fixing up the native title mess that you left behind. As far as we are concerned, they are the priorities on which we are going to focus. The most eloquent comment that was ever made in Australian politics in relation to deals done between media proprietors and party leaders was a comment that John Button made during an angry Labor Party cabinet meeting on the subject when he said, of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, 'Bob, why don't you tell us which of your media mates you want to help so we can end the meeting.'",13
8,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime  to end cross-media ownership rules before the last election another non-core promise?",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order.,13
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have repeatedly said, and I say again, that there were no deals done. The only promises that I made were to the Australian people, and I intend to deliver on jobs, taxation reform and native title, cleaning up the native title mess that you left behind. Business Regulation",13
11,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. How is the government's plan to improve business regulation helping to lower costs for businesses and generating growth and jobs for Australians? How will these improvements help consumers and small and medium size businesses in my electorate of Petrie?,13
12,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable the member for her question, because the honourable member comes from a family which is well known for its involvement in small business and has taken a great interest in the problems of small business. She would be aware of the Prime Minister's statement More time for business, announced on 24 March, which abolished the fringe benefits tax on car parking and taxi travel to and from work and cut out so many small businesses from the fringe benefits tax. It established a one-point registration process for the Australian Taxation Office, the Securities Commission, the ABS and the Insurance Commission, which will develop a single entry point for business to obtain information on Commonwealth, state and territory government requirements. On 24 August, on behalf of the government, I announced major reforms to the conduct of managed funds in this country, to have a single responsible entity which would be legally liable to investors and would cut down on duplication and costs. On 27 August, on behalf of the government, I announced that, for the first time ever, credit unions and building societies will be able to issue cheques so that they will be able to compete full-on with banks in the cheque process. This afternoon, I will be announcing the government's response to the Wallis financial system inquiry, which will provide a major structural reform to the Australian economy, one of the great structural reforms in relation to financial services, which is all about making things better for business and consumers. In addition, commencing next week, the government will be releasing the first part of the discussion papers under the corporate law economic reform program. This is a program to modernise Australia's Corporations Law to make us world's best practice in relation to business regulation. These papers have been developed in consultation with the business regulation advisory group and they will cover matters such as accounting, fundraising, takeovers, futures, securities, directors' duties and electronic commerce. It is a deep very wish of this government to continue modernising our regulatory structure, to make Australia best practice in the world in business regulation, to realise the dream of Australia becoming in this region a financial centre, to continue to develop those finance and insurance industries which are now earning Australia good export dollars and to make sure that we are world pacesetters in relation to business regulation. This program is now coming together from all sorts of directions-modern, low-cost, efficient, competitive-delivering benefits to small business and, most of all, delivering benefits to the Australian consumer. Cross-Media Ownership",13
13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of his long held views on Labor's cross-media ownership rules, which he described as 'knee-jerk' and 'vitriolic', and his policy backflip yesterday when he fully embraced those rules. Does the Prime Minister recall saying, as reported on 6 April last, that, The Fairfax share register is very unstable and you don't really have anybody running the country",14
14,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
15,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, but he actually said 'running the company.' Is it not a fact that the reason why that was so is his own weak-kneed mishandling of this matter? Was not this the thing which damaged Fairfax?",14
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Australian National,14
17,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Could the minister advise the House of the response of workers, union representatives, customers, regional communities and state governments to the announcement last Thursday of the sale of Australian National?",14
18,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. There has been an outstanding response to the government's decision to sell AN to the three new owners we announced on Thursday last week in partnership with the Minister for Finance. There has been a lot of coverage in the media and a lot of response from union leaders and community representatives. For example, the Adelaide Advertiser, a newspaper from the state greatly affected by the sale, said on its front page 'We're back on the rails' and, in the shortest number of words, said what people who work for AN actually believe has happened as a result of this decision-we are back on the rails. A number of newspapers commented very favourably. For example, the Launceston Examiner said: Cheaper rail freights likely ... users can expect a better service. The Adelaide Advertiser ran a profile on one of the apprentices who works for AN, a bloke by the name of Mark Edwards, who is featured on the front page. He is an apprentice boilermaker at the Port Augusta workshops. When he was interviewed, he said about the decision: I'm definitely over the moon. He is over the moon about the decision made by this government. We then go to people like community representatives. The Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, said: We are now embarking on a new era ... This will certainly promote confidence in the business Then we go to customers of AN. Mr John Lush of the South Australia Farmers Federation-farmers are one of the main customers of AN in South Australia-said: The Australian National crisis is now over. A window of opportunity exists for the South Australian country rail system to be rehabilitated. Phillip Peterson, a TasRail customer, said in relation to the government's announcements last Thursday: That is what is most likely to bring investment and jobs to the State. Then we can go to other political representatives like Democrat Senator John Woodley, who chaired the Senate inquiry into the sale of AN. On ABC Radio last week, following the announcement, he said: I've got to say that I'm really pleased. I mean, really thrilled about it actually. The union which represents drivers and service staff said that the decision that it was the 'best possible outcome' for rail workers. Indeed, the Public Transport Union State Secretary for South Australia, Mr Rex Phillips, said: ... this is better than expected. Commonsense has prevailed . . . The emphasis has been on investment in the future, regional investment and antly jobs. The Electrical Trades Union representative, Frank Sghirripa, who works at the Port Augusta workshops, said of the decision: It's the beginning of a new era for the Port Augusta community ... the workers were looking forward to the future. The Australian Metal Workers Union representative, Mr Kym Thomas, said: ... the union had fought hard to maintain jobs for the youth of Port Augusta, and that is now going to be achieved. The Australian Workers Union organiser at Port Augusta, Len Scharenerg, who has really worked out Labor on this issue, said: . .. it's either go down this path or go the way of the dinosaurs. There are no prizes for guessing who he thinks the dinosaurs are. The dinosaurs are the people on the Labor side who, through their 13 years of mismanagement of AN, destroyed sector. that company, particularly through their decision to create the National Rail Corporation the way they did. There are comments there from community leaders, political representatives, the customers of AN and from the workers, particularly people like the apprentices. There is only one thing that you can say about all of those comments; that is, they are all favourable. They all agree with the decision of this government to give AN a new future. The only people who do not agree with that decision are the Labor Party, who did so much damage to AN during their time in office, the same Labor Party who tried to block the sale of AN when the legislation when through the Senate. Those people in the Labor Party-the young and the heartless in particular-should be ashamed of themselves I'm because they are the only ones out of step on this issue and the workers know about it. They have worked out what Labor is up to. The best way to sum up what people really think about this is to use the words of Mr Rex Phillips, the Public Transport Union State Secretary for South Australia, who said: Trade union officials don't usually praise up Liberal politicians, but . .. I might even vote most import- Liberal at the election. These are the workers' representatives who know what the workers' interests are and who know who best represents the workers. The people on this side of the House are the people who can best represent the workers at AN and in South Australia. Cross-Media Ownership",14
19,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But then again he might not. My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister now intend to implement his commitment to the Australian people to have a full public inquiry into the crossmedia law?,16
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have made it plain before, and I repeat: our priority during the remainder of this term is jobs, taxation reform and cleaning up your native title mess.",16
21,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Can the Prime Minister chew gum and walk at the same time?",16
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Supplementary questions are the subject of guidelines, and the Leader of the Opposition is way outside the guidelines. Pravastatin",16
23,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services.,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber.,16
25,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think there is a bit of rabble here today.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Get on with the question.,16
27,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the minister aware of recent claims that clinical trials of the drug used in the treatment of high cholesterol have been stopped? Minister, what is the situation in regard to this drug?",16
28,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. Mr Leo MCLeay-Answer in words of one syllable.,16
29,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you can understand it, Leo, I will try. In a question to the Prime Minister last Thursday, the honourable member for Dobell asked about drugs of equal clinical value, and used the example of Pravastatin-which is called a 'statin' drugwhich is a cholesterol lowering drug. He claimed that the trial had had to be stopped because it was so successful. I wen t to check the honourable member's claims. In fact, what he is referring to is an article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 1995, which was about a trial of Pravastatin. But, unlike the honourable member's suggestion in the question about drugs of equal clinical value, Pravastatin was not compared with other drugs of equal value such as Simvastatin or Fluvastatin; it was compared with a sugar pill. It should come as no surprise to honourable members, even those who lack the technical expertise to understand pharmacology, that a drug aimed at lowering cholesterol should be more effective than a sugar pill. I would make the point to the honourable member that this is the exact reason we take scientific evidence on the basis of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and do not allow politicians to make arbitrary decisions on the misreading of an article where we compare one drug with a placebo. Tax A voidance",16
30,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware of burgeoning salary packaging practices by some state government instrumentalities-for example, favouring health care employees in Western Australia-which defeat his government's anti-avoidance objectives? If so, what action does the Treasurer intend to take?",16
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided. In relation to packaging, of course the fringe benefits tax prevents packaging for the private sector out into non-salary forms. We are aware that there are certain tax exempts which, because they are not subject to fringe benefits tax, it has been found are much more attractive to package into non-salary benefits. It is something that the government has looked at. But, on the occasions that it has looked at it, it has come to the conclusion that, by and large, tax exempts which do perform public services have a special position in the taxation system, and one that we recognise. However, I do make the point, as is regularly made to us, that where you have tax exempts which are competing against private sector operations you can get an advantage which your competitor does not get. The principle of competitive neutrality would say that in those circumstances one has to be careful that the special tax system is not taken to such an extent that it becomes an unfair competitive advantage. The government is, of course, aware of this, and it supports the competitive neutrality principle generally. It is very much a part of our competition policy. Where things can be done by the private sector we encourage it to be done for that competitive neutrality reason. But I assure the honourable member, as he knows, this is a government that has been very vigorous against tax avoidance. We acted in relation to the undue generosity of benefits to high income earners for superannuation, we acted in relation to R&D syndicates, we acted in relation to infrastructure borrowings and we acted in relation to foreign source income. This is a government that has been very active and vigilant, and we keep all of these areas under our constant attention. EI Nino Effect",16
32,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The El Nino effect is a matter of growing concern, particularly to people in my electorate of Wannon but also to people in many other parts of Australia. Minister, in view of the concern that has already been voiced publicly about the possible implications of the El Nino effect for Australia in the coming months, can you advise what predictions regarding the El Nino effect you have already been advised of? What are the likely effects regarding rural and regional Australia and, indeed, the whole of Australia? What action is the federal government already taking with respect to this predicted phenomena, and what actions are proposed by the federal government should the El Nino effect be as severe as some weather experts are predicting?",17
33,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I know that the issue that he has raised is of great concern to many people in this place, particularly those who represent rural electorates in the eastern part of the country where the predictions are, indeed, the most serious in terms of the potential impact of a fully de oped El Nino weather pattern. We hope it does not happen. Even the scientists who are putting forward the predictions will not mind, I am sure, us saying that this time we sincerely hope they have got it wrong. Nonetheless, it is as well for us to know and to use the modem diagnostic tools and better forecasting capacities that are increasingly available to us. There is no doubt that in many parts of eastern Australia people are already looking at the very serious prospect of declining yields and, in some cases, even lost crop yields; there is no doubt that in many instances people are already turning off livestock in large numbers. There is no doubt that many are already looking at very real difficulties. The government is watching the situation very carefully. From the Prime Minister down we are conscious of the need to meet expectations not only of people in the bush but of all Australians that the government will do what it can to help ease the burden in rural Australia should this develop into another full-scale drought. We hope it does not. But, if it does, whilst government assistance is no substitute for decent seasons and good prices, it can be a real help. It is worth noting that last week we redeclared drought exceptional circumstances in the northern Darling Downs and South Burnett regions of Queensland at a cost of some $20 million. I know that the relevant members, Mr Slipper and Mr Truss, are particularly relieved. They have had several things to say to me about the matter in recent times. This re-declaration is a recognition that the recovery that everyone, including farmers in those areas, believed was under way in June 1996 proved to be a false hope, a false dawn. Here is the demonstration that the drought exceptional circumstances systems, as we have finetuned them, are working. The drought relief payment has again been extended for an estimated 5,000 or so farm families. When we came to office, the recovery period was just six months. We have made it a standard 12 months and, in some areas, it will be lengthened over that at considerable cost. This is again demonstrating our commitment to rural people who are in vel- difficulties and our Willingness to help. In fact, the assistance is anything but paltry. In conclusion, I note that there will be a new program in place shortly to offer farm families a safety net when they lose access to the drought relief payment. All will shortly be revealed in the integrated rural policy package which has been alluded to since the time of the budget. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",17
34,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, now that you have confirmed your title as ' Mr WishyWashy' by caving into Labor's cross-media ownership rules, caving in on Labor's car plan and caving in on Labor's ship bounty proposal, will you end the uncertainty for the 100,000 textiles, clothing and footwear workers by caving in and supporting Labor's TCF plan?",18
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The great tariff slasher and job destroyer of the 1980s now returns. You do not persuade anybody in this parliament, any more than you have persuaded the union leaders that I have spoken to over the last couple of weeks. The constant theme of the union leaders is, 'Don't any of you and your colleagues imagine that we hold you responsible for the job losses of the last 13 years. We blame the Labor Party. They ignored us. They destroyed the protection for our industries and they don't convince us with their crocodile tears of the last few weeks about preserving jobs.' Meatworkers: Live Cattle Exports",18
36,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Last Friday meatworkers at the Stuart meat works in Townsville came to me with concerns about their jobs in relation to the live export of cattle. They claim that the live export of cattle is affecting the jobs at the meat works. Could you give me your comments on that please?,18
37,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the very interesting developments in the Australian livestock industries in recent times has been the explosion in live exports, particularly in cattle from northern Australia, and the numbers have now reached very high levels. Some estimates indicate that the equivalent of throughput for some seven to 10 works are now leaving the country in live form, and that is understandably putting some pressure on domestic works. I note that processors have expressed some concern about that in recent times. Over the last couple of years, I recall the answer from those opposite to their political mates in the union movement in relation to having a very successful live cattle export trade was to say, 'We'll put an export tax on them.' It was a successful export trade, so they wanted to put a tax on the trade to make sure it was not successful. But the real name of the game here is to ensure that our processing works are as cost-effective and efficient as possible and that their costs are as low as they can be. Again, those opposite failed completely to grapple with that issue. They failed to deliver any meaningful reform at all. The industrial relations changes that we have made are making a real difference. The reductions in interest rates are also making a real difference. In the last year under Labor, and members might be interested in this, the export meat sector in this country paid $62 million for meat inspection services; last year under us they paid $53 million-less, even without a subsidy. Just this afternoon I have completed dialogue with the meat industry which ensures that they will again pay $53 million this year, in contrast to $62 million in the last year under Labor. The final point I would make on this issue is to offer some hope, because we are genuinely concerned about those jobs. There are jobs being generated by the live trade. It is also keeping in business many northern producers and the trucking companies and so forth that go with them. But we are concerned about the processing works as well. That is why we want to give the meatworkers the opportunity to be more efficient and to preserve their jobs. One important aspect is that, often on the back of live exports, a boom in boxed beef exports can also be developed. I hope that takes place for the benefit not only of producers but also of those workers who might otherwise see their jobs go in processing plants in northern Australia. Vocational Education: T AFE",18
38,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. The minister will recall telling the House yesterday: It is very clear from analysis done by Australian National Training Authority that there are very significant numbers of places to be gained in growth from the state TAFE systems. Why then does an ANTA analysis recently presented to the minister describe such a claim as 'problematic' and 'even a limited target of a 2.6 per cent increase in government funded clients would be difficult for the states and territories.' Why has the minister told the House one thing, whilst ANTA has advised him exactly the opposite? Will the minister now table the ANTA analysis?",19
39,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I told the House yesterday, the Commonwealth has provided the states with a very significant offer. That offer is to give stability in funding for TAPE for the next five years.",19
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They had stability until the end of this decade.,19
41,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They did not have stability until the end of this decade.,19
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what they had.,19
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition! This is not a debate.,19
44,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is ashamed, of course, of the damage that was done to training opportunities for young people when the Labor Party was in government. He demoralised a generation of young people. He had youth unemployment at 34 per cent.",19
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I will leave aside the ignorance and go to the relevance. The relevance is this: he was asked a very specific set of questions on ANTA figures-no persiflage, no beating about the bush. What he needs to do is answer as to why he has given misleading information in this place.",19
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I will rule that there is no point of order, but I also take this opportunity to say that there has been increasing evidence of debates going on across the chamber when ministers are answering questions. The onus lies principally on the asker of the question to conform with the rules of procedure for this House, and then it is entirely within the precincts of the minister to adopt the same technique in response. The minister's response is in order. I will not accept these digressional debates.",19
47,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Commonwealth made this offer to the states of stability in funding for their TAPE systems for the next five years. I call on the states to match that offer and to give that stability to their TAPE systems. What is happening at the moment in the course of the negotiations is that uncertainty is being created. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On the question of relevance, I asked the minister to give an explanation",19
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You do not have the call yet. Mr Latham- Mr SPEAKER ,19
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the honourable member for Werriwa. Mr Latham-Can't I be heard down there? Mr Speaker, on the question of relevance, I asked the minister a specific question",19
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Werriwa reflects on the chair, the water will get very warm. Mr Latham-I did not reflect on the chair. Can I take my point of order, Mr Speaker?",19
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have the call. Mr Latham-Thank you. On the question of relevance, I asked the minister quite specifically to give an explanation to the House as to why his report to the House about the state TAPE systems and the number of places coming out of the ANTA arrangements are at direct odds with the analysis provided to him by ANTA. This is not to do with federal-state negotiations in the future; this is to do with the minister's honesty and integrity right now.",19
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order is upheld, but I have also ruled that there is too much digressional debate going across the chamber. The minister was reacting to some of that debate. The minister is aware of the thrust of the question, and I invite him to respond in the spirit with which the question was asked.",19
53,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no conflict whatever between what I said to the House yesterday and the words read out by the member for Werriwa from the document that he has from ANTA. Nobody has suggested that it is going to be easy and straightforward for the states to make their systems more efficient. It requires that will and determination that is there to deliver the best for young Australians. The point that the government is making very clearly to the states is that we have put on the table one of the best offers that young people looking for training in TAPE have had for a very long time. We ask the states to match that offer with a similar commitment. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a document.",20
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for Cowper. Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package,20
55,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of widespread allegations of corruption in the administration of the forest industry structural adjustment package, FISAP, in New South Wales? These allegations include that breaches in the FISAP guidelines involve payments where the recipients did not meet the requirements; that some of the money provided has not been used as it should have been; that some operators in the forest industry have been given an unfair competitive advantage through payments made by FISAP; that other operators who appear to meet the guidelines have been excluded from funding; that some stakeholders are actually on the FISAP committee; and that there is a conflict of interest for some members of the Forest Products Association. What action does the minister intend to take to investigate these disturbing allegations?",20
56,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I acknowledge that this matter has been of concern in recent times to him and to some other members on the north coast. I can advise the House that, as of today, I have taken action to get to the bottom of these allegations. I have initiated a preliminary investigation of them by the Business Ethics, Security and Investigations Unit in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and I have been assured that the New South Wales government will offer its full support for this process. I assure people that, if anything untoward is found at all, swift and effective action will follow. Defence Personnel: Northern Territory Election",20
57,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Defence. At what level within Headquarters Northern Command was the authorisation given to make available to Chief Minister Stone personal details of Defence personnel in the Northern Territory for his election campaign? Minister, when were you, your office, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel or her office first made aware of the request or of the release of the information? Was there any ministerial, or ministerial office, authorisation or approval for the release of this personal information?",20
58,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-;The answer to that question was given yesterday by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Quite frankly, I think it is nothing less than a childish question. However, I will find out if there is anything to add to that answer, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Drugs: Cost",20
59,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of recent claims that some people will have to pay up to $38 per month more for medication because of the government's therapeutic premiums policy? Can the minister inform the House whether there is any basis for such claims?,20
60,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for her question. There is no basis for such allegations whatsoever. Mr Costello--Who's been making them?,20
61,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These allegations were made by the member for Dobell in a question in the parliament last week. We attempted to replicate the member for Dobell's calculations. The only way we could do it was if we compared the lowest cost, lowest dose drug in one category with the highest cost, highest dose drug in another category. There are two flaws with doing this. The first is that the therapeutic premium applies across all dose ranges. So comparing the cost of a low dose with a high dose medication is completely erroneous and gives a totally incorrect result. The second thing that is wrong with the shadow minister's calculations is that they assume that there are no subgroups within categories. They assume that, say, nifedepine is charged at a similar rate to verapamil when you are looking at drugs within one category. In the very unlikely event that his constituent is on all three medications relating to heart-that is, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers-the three medications would be likely to cost up to $2 extra per month each if he chose not to change to a cheaper variety. The fact is that his constituent option of paying not a cent more. Defence Personnel: Northern Territory Election",20
62,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again I have a question to the Minister for Defence that he may be able to answer. Minister, do you recall that, in your colleague's written answer to my question last Thursday, she confirmed, 'Had any other candidate made a similar request, they would have been responded to in the same manner'? After checking details following concerns about this matter, why did the Defence Public Relations Northern Command advise the office of the Northern Territory Leader of the Opposition that such information is kept confidential, that there was no avenue to access any database that contained rank and that Chief Minister Stone could not have received his information from the military? Are you aware that that particular advice was conveyed to the office of the Leader of the ALP on 30 July, 12 days after your department provided those personal details of troops to Chief Minister Stone? When did you change the policy, or is it now your government's policy to release personal details only to your mates in the Liberal and National parties? How about an answer, instead of fobbing it off?",21
63,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have answered the question: I said I would get back with further details. The one thing I do know about that election is that the swing to the Country Liberal Party was so enormous that Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I have asked the minister a very serious question about a very serious matter. It is the third question I have asked without getting an answer in two days. It is not appropriate for the minister to digress and talk about the election results.",21
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order, but I do ask the Minister for Defence to address the substance of the question.",21
65,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All I can assume from the results of the election is that that sort of information must have been delivered to every elector in the whole of the Northern Territory because the swing was so enormous. has the The Labor Party is obviously violently wounded by this matter. To lose in six elections in a row must be very painful. The only thing the shadow minister can find to raise is this matter. If there is any further information to be added, I will add it. Nevertheless, I simply make the point once again that it was a monumental victory and, with the way you are carrying on, I think the next one will be even greater. Immigration: Unauthorised Boat Arrivals",21
66,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and it is on behalf of a number of my colleagues as well. Can the minister advise the House what has been achieved by this government to address the difficult issue of unauthorised boat arrivals?,21
67,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for the preface 'on behalf of his colleagues'. I know there is a degree of interest in this matter. I am able to tell the House that the government does believe it is essential that illegal entrants not entitled to our protection are dealt with as quickly and as efficiently as possible and are returned to their home country as soon as possible when those matters are determined. We always assist those who make genuine claims. Equally, they must be dealt with quickly and fairly as well. I think it is fair to say that we now have a proven record of success. Last week, 135 people from the Port Hedland detention centre were returned to China. These were the people who arrived in the Torres Strait in June from the Fujian province. I know there was a good deal of interest in that matter. Four people from that boat remain in Australia to assist us with further inquiries. Regrettably, the cost of removal is quite expensive. It was $590,000. I am sure no-one is pleased with having to incur this cost, but it is the only viable way of returning people with safety after an incursion of this type. It is remarkable that we now have only 55 people in our Port Hedland detention centre. Very much larger numbers of people were held in recent years. The centre has accommodation for more than 700 occupants. Since the coalition achieved office, about 900 people have arrived illegally by boat. The vast majority of those have been returned home on the basis that they failed to have any claims that met our protection obligations. In addition, we have been successful in arranging for the return home of large numbers of people who illegally arrived in the term of the previous government. It is a matter of some concern that has been drawn attention to before that, regrettably, over a period of time, numbers of people were held in detention for periods far longer than most reasonable people would have expected was appropriate. The message from this government is that people who do come here illegally are not fleeing persecution. They come here with false hopes and expectations if they expect to be able to stay permanently. They will be dealt with quickly and efficiently. If they have no claim to remain in Australia, they will be returned. Veterans: Review Tribunals",21
68,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney-General aware that the first Australian independent review boards were the war pensions entitlement tribunals and the war pensions assessment tribunals, both established in 1929? Is the Attorney-General aware of widespread concern in the ex-service community that the coalition's proposed changes to the appeal systems threaten veterans' access to a knowledgeable and expert repatriation appeals body that includes service members? Has the minister consulted ex-service organisations before proceeding with this plan to swallow up the Veterans' Review Board into his proposed administrative review tribunal? Can he assure these organisations that service members will have a future under his takeover plan?",22
69,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. The member is actually referring to the outcome of a report by the Administrative Review Council entitled Better Decisions. That council conducted a very lengthy review, engaged in extensive consultation with the communities affected by its proposals and came down with a proposal to amalgamate a number of tribunals in a new Administrative Review Tribunal. It included the Veterans' Review Board. On 20 March this year I announced that the government had decided in principle to adopt the recommendation of the Better Decisions report. Subsequently, an interdepartmental committee-an IDC-comprising officers from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, my department, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Finance, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs was constituted to develop proposals to implement the amalgamation. That IDC has been meeting since then. It has not yet finalised its report. Its report will go to cabinet. Cabinet has obviously not yet taken a decision. However, in July the government reiterated its commitment to the independence of merits review tribunals and expressed its confidence that the report of the IDC will be consistent with this aim. I think the member, and the community for whom he is currently speaking, can rest assured that all interests will be taken into account in the decision of the government. Literacy: Indigenous Students",22
70,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Members on both sides of the House would applaud the government's exemplary efforts in the area of literacy reform, but would be aware of the special needs of indigenous students who, when they begin school, may have little or no English speaking experience. Mr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: in accordance with your new guidelines, doesn't this clearly constitute a lengthy preamble, which you have asked to be kept out? There is not one question that has been mentioned here.",23
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Hotham. The point of order is upheld. The honourable member for Parramatta will move quickly to the thrust of his question.,23
72,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My Speaker, I was talking about the special needs of indigenous students who have not had much English speaking experience. What is the government doing to meet the special needs of those indigenous students starting school for the first time with little or no English speaking background?",23
73,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I acknowledge his great commitment to young people in his electorate. From a number of visits that I have had to Aboriginal communities it is very clear to me that Aboriginal parents want their children to be literate in English. Equalthat ly, it is also plain that many of these young Aboriginal students do not come from English speaking backgrounds and, indeed, in some cases English is actually their third language. I am pleased to inform the House that to help these students the government has decided to provide some $6.2 million a year for intensive English as a second language assistance for students who commence school for the first time next year. This is a very s.ignifican- breakthrough in providing foundatIon Enghsh language skills for young Aboriginal students. It shows this government's commitment to addressing in a very practical way the literacy needs of all young Australians. The target group for this program will be young indigenous students living in communities in which little English is heard or spoken and who are therefore significantly disadvantaged when their first exposure to English is when they attend school. Each eligible student will attract funding to provide an average of 10 hours of intensive tuition per week for six months to enable them to reach a basic level of English communication. Eligibility for assistance will be based on a local assessment of language barriers to individual students' participation in the classroom, and it is expected that some 2,000 students will be eligible each year. I am pleased to say that this initiative has been strongly welcomed by the Chairman of ATSIC, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, who said that the injection of these funds is a start to addressing one of the real problems confronting young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. He said: It is encouraging to see that the government recognises that our people face a language barrier and that they are prepared to assist us to overcome this situation. Industrial Relations",23
74,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, what are you doing to respond to the fact that the most recent statistics show private sector wages falling while workers are experiencing increased workplace pressure and stress? We now know the 'rock-solid guarantee' was a non-core promise. Whatever happened to 'better pay for better work'? Has it now become lower pay for harder work?",23
75,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which seems to be a preface to the matter of public importance which is to be discussed this afternoon. There are a number of facts and figures on the question of job security. For example, a while ago Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald reported that he had asked AGB MCNair to undertake a survey question, which was, 'How secure do you believe you are in your job at the moment?' Interestingly, only 4 per cent of the respondents in paid employment said that they felt very insecure and a further eight per cent said that they felt somewhat insecure. That left 25 per cent reasonably secure, 23 per cent secure, and 39 per cent very secure. It is true that, asked whether they felt more secure or less secure than they did a year ago, 18 per cent said that they felt less secure now; but against that 21 per cent said that they felt more secure, which left 60 per cent saying that they felt no difference. The recent AWIR study is also relevant to this, and there has been some interesting OECD material. Of more direct relevance is that if you ask in the public debate who is concerned about job security or insecurity, the Labor Party has a political tactic to raise the question of job security absolutely on every occasion. They get up in the morning and you say to them as they are walking along the corridor, 'How do you feel today?', and they say, 'We feel that job insecurity is on the rise.' If you say, 'What's the weather like?', they say, 'Job insecurity is on the rise.' In the trade union movement, they have got people going out with surveys promoting the idea of job insecurity and stress at work. Mr Costello-Push polling!",23
76,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Push polling. The Australian Services Union is just one example of this. They have got a questionnaire containing six questions, the last of which is, 'What do you feel would be the solutions to stress at work?' The third question is, 'Do you suffer from any of the following-never, sometimes, frequently?' Then it has got a list including headaches, indigestion and continual tiredness. It sounds like a description of those sitting the front bench opposite. The interesting thing is that there is no reference to whether or not these conditions relate to people's work performance. This is a significant issue. The reality is that if people are to enjoy higher pay and secure jobs, then what Australia needs is a system which allows the terms and conditions of people's employment to relate to the circumstances of their work so that through higher productivity people can enjoy higher pay. The questioner asks whether or not the government has fulfilled its commitment in respect of better pay for better work. No better and more graphic demonstration of us fulfilling that commitment is the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to give a $10 a week safety net wage increase to the low paid. Compare the reality of $10 in your pocket, which is a 2.6 per cent real change-that is, an increase in real wages for those most disadvantaged-to the situation that applied in the years from March 1984 to March 1996, when Labor was in government, when the minimum wages of those disadvantaged in our society actually fell by 10 per cent or more. Thank you very much for the question. Thank you for the MPI. The reality is that in government we are fulfilling our promises. What a stark contrast that makes to the years that Labor was in office delivering real wage declines for low income workers. Department of Administrative Services Business Units",24
77,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister please inform the House what has been the progress in selling DAS business units, and what has happened to the staff in this process?",24
78,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On coming to government last year we had a review done of the 12 business units of the Department of Administrative Services, and you would remember that in the August 1996 budget a decision was made to sell eight of those 12 business units. That decision was made for a number of reasons. A number of the enterprises had been losing on quite a lot of money. Some of them were restricted by tremendous bureaucratic overheads. There were constitutional problems with some of them. Access to capital was another real problem. I am pleased to inform the House that four of the business units have now been transferred to private ownership. They are: Dasfleet, DAS Distribution, Works Australia and Australian Operational Support Services. Yesterday I was delighted to receive a cheque for $407.9 million from Macquarie Bank for the sale of Dasfleet. The remaining four business units-Interiors Australia, the Australian Property Group, DASCEM and Asset Services-will be transferred to private ownership between now and early October 1997. These sales were certainly part of the government's agenda for smaller government. I am absolutely delighted to inform the House that we have achieved a very positive outcome for staff, with some 80 per cent of our staff who applied for jobs across all the business units being successful in gaining employment with the new owners. A great deal has been done too in terms of our outsourcing, and areas such as Nomad, Auslig, the Australian Government Publishing Service and support services have now been contracted out. One of the interesting things-it is probably the first time it has been done by a government, certainly to my knowledge, anywhere in the world-is that provision was made for the staff of these business enterprises to in fact buyout the businesses. Obviously, they had to compete with the private sector in those bids. At least two of these businesses will be taken over by the staff. Some people have been critical of what might happen to the staff members who did not go with their businesses. I think this department probably has the best redeployment, retraining and career counselling program, and those staff have been looked after. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that the savings to government and the better utilisation of that capital for governfollowing ment has been absolutely tremendous.",24

86,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-On behalf of the government, I announce today sive set of financial system reforms in response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry, the Wallis report. This is a major structural reform by the government which will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers. In line with our election commitments, upon taking office the government moved quickly to set up the financial system inquiry, headed by Mr Stan Wallis. I take this opporincreasing tunity to thank Mr Wallis for the job he did, together with his fellow inquiry membersarrangements Mr Bill Beerworth, Professor Ian Harper, Professor Jeff Carmichael and Mrs Linda Nicholls. The inquiry delivered a high quality report from change. making 115 recommendations for regulatory reform in the Australian financial system. The report was directed to the fundamental goals of the government, to increase competition and improve efficiency, while preserving the competition. integrity, security and fairness of the financial system. The system now provides annually over $40 billion worth of services to consumers and other sectors of the economy, directly employs over 300,000 people and plays an increasingly important role as a service export industry. The performance of the financial system and the cost effectiveness of its regulation are critical to the efficient functioning of the whole economy: and in its own right, the financial industry can make an increasing contribution to Australia's economic welfare and progress. Rationale and Goals for Reform The Wallis inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved since the major deregulation measures of the 1980s. After nearly two decades, now is the time to improve the system further. There are three main reasons. Firstly, in a globally competitive world must strive to be the best. Given its contribubasic tion to every other sector of the economy, creating the best possible financial system provides a vital foundation to Australia's System future economic success. The Wallis inquiry Australia's financial sector performance to be close to the world average rather than a comprehenamong the world's best. In every area, there remains room for further improvement. Reform is needed to secure those potential gains. Secondly, we must maintain the pace of reform to respond to change. The financial system is undergoing accelerated change through rapid technological innovation, globalisation and changing business strategies and consumer needs. Our regulatory must keep up. Existing arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally, and do not always ensure that we get the maximum benefits Thirdly, the Wallis inquiry found that there are a number of areas of the financial system which could be more competitive, and proposed a number of ways to promote more . The government is keen to pursue all of these initiatives. The proposals I am announcing today will: help obtain for Au.stralian consumers and industry the potential benefits of new technologies and world's best practice in the financial system, and at the same time maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industries; better focus regulation according to its underlying objectives and ensure that it applies in a competitively neutral way across the newly emerging market structures; and promote greater competition, and through it the achievement of greater efficiency, across the spectrum of financial and payments services. At the same time, the reforms that I am announcing today build on the advantages of we the existing arrangements, preserving the goals of safety and stability. NA I tum now to the main proposals for reform of regulatory arrangements in the financial system. The key elements of this package are a new organisational framework for the regulation of the financial system and a variety of measures to improve efficiency and contestability in financial markets and the payments system. Rationalisation of the Regulatory Framework The government has decided to establish a new regulatory structure based on three agencies. Each agency will be responsible across the system for clear regulatory tives. The government has decided: firstly, that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be strengthened and its role focused on the objectives of monetary policy, overall financial system stability and regulation of the payments system. As part of this, a new Payments System Board will be appointed within the Reserve Bank with stronger regulatory powers to ensure safety, greater competition and efficiency in the payments system; secondly, an Australian Prudential Regulasafety tion Authority, APRA, will be established products. to prudentially supervise deposit taking institutions, life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds; and thirdly, an Australian Corporations Financial Services Commission, ACFSC, will be established to cover market integriregulation ty, disclosure and other consumer protection issues. . The new regulatory agencies will have - ubstantial operational autonomy and a clear charter of objectives. They will have boards of directors or commissioners responsible for ,operational and administrative policies, and 'will be accountable to the Treasurer and the parliament for their performance. There will - be. legislative provisions to authorise the exchange of confidential information amongst ,!the three regulators and there will be fOperation between them, both bilaterally and <through a Council of Financial Regulators responsible for coordination across a wide range of issues. In principle, the government considers that regulation of building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and possibly other financial entities should come under this scheme, and will facilitate this transfer from state to Commonwealth regulation if the states and territories also agree. Given the importance of settling the future of these sectors as soon as possible, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be asking the states and territories to determine in principle their positions before the end of this year. objecBalancing Prudential and Competition Goals The Wallis inquiry concluded that prudential regulation should maintain safety while being sufficiently flexible to respond to financial system developments. Prudential arrangements should also minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency. The government agrees with this general approach. We have decided to establish a single licensing and prudential regulation regime for all deposit taking institutions. This will achieve more neutral regulatory treatment and maintain financial across all providers of similar deposit Non-bank deposit taking institutions will more readily operate on a national scale and provide more effective competition for banks and in the retail market. The new regime will provide a flexible approach to prudential to deal with the unique characteristics of different deposit taking institutions. Licensing and prudential regulation of life insurance products, as for deposit taking, should be provided under a consistent and competitively neutral regime. Therefore, subject to the agreement of the states and territories, we propose that the financial business of friendly societies be subject to the same regulatory arrangements as life offices. To encourage new entry and more effective close cocompetition the government will also: facilitate the establishment of non-operating bank holding companies, and allow holding companies to own more than one bank or other licensed entities; streamline the process of licence issue, transferring responsibility to the prudential regulator; remove prohibitions on mutual ownership of banks; facilitate possible future participation of wider range of entities in the deposit taking market; and streamline the regulation of financial institory scheme. tution shareholdings with a single ceiling of 15 per cent above which government approvals must be obtained. The broad objectives of prudential regulations, tion will be set out in the charter of regulator. In setting these objectives, the government will broadly follow the approachproviding es to the conduct of prudential regulation recommended by the Wallis inquiry, ensuring that standards of financial safety are not diminished. In particular, the conduct of regulation will ensure that the risk of loss depositor funds remains, as now, very remote and that regulation is consistent with internamaking tional standards. Prudential standards will far as possible be reinforced through encourgiven aging greater public disclosure by financial institutions of their risks, management tems and ratings. Total superannuation savings have reached $280 billion and are growing at a much rate than bank deposits. They are vital to the retirement security of millions of Australians and for increasing numbers of people sent by far the greater part of their total financial assets. The APRA will take respontions sibility for the prudential regulation of annuation funds and retirement savings accounts. This will create more consistent effective prudential arrangements for this rapidly growing sector, enhancing its safety while facilitating greater choice, competition and efficiency. Maintaining Protection of Depositors As part of its package of reforms, the government will fully maintain and in some areas strengthen the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the protection of depositors. There will be no lessening of protection for bank deposits from that which is currently provided. The existing depositor protection provisions will be retained under the Banking Act and extended to all licensed deposit takers. This will involve extending to all regulated deposit taking institutions the priority over the assets of an institution now afforded only to bank a depositors. This will apply for the first time to deposits in building societies and credit unions if they join the Commonwealth regulaThe APRA, instead of the Reserve Bank, will be responsible for dealing with institutions which are unable to meet their obligabut will undertake this action in close the cooperation with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will retain its existing role in liquidity support to financial institutions if such assistance is required. The operational effectiveness of the depositor protection provisions will be strengthened, of by providing powers for early intervention in a financially troubled institution and by clear that the regulator can wind up as an insolvent entity. The APRA will also be enhanced powers to take action in the case of financial difficulties experienced by syslife and general insurance companies, and superannuation funds. APRA will be a separate statutory authority funded by fees and levies from the institutions it regulates and faster will be outside the budget sector. Promoting Efficiency, Competition and repreConfidence in the Payments System The government has accepted recommendafor further measures to promote efficiensupercy and competition, as well as safety and confidence, in the payments system. The and payments system is a particularly important, yet little understood, part of the economy. It is the infrastructure that enables resources to be traded and goods to be exchanged. The smooth functioning of the economy relies on confidence in the payments system. The Wallis report concluded that there is considerable scope to increase efficiency in the payments system without compromising its safety. The government accepts there is a need for greater oversight of the payments system. A Payments System Board and new regulatory powers will be established within the Reserve Bank to regulate clearing and settlement systems, to control risk in the financial system and to promote efficiency and competition. The Reserve Bank will have the power to ensure that clearing stream bodies provide access to their facilities to third parties on reasonable terms. Access to clearing streams and settlement accounts would be liberalised on the basis of clear and open guidelines determined by the PSB. These guidelines will ensure there is no compromise in safety and stability objectives. Greater competition in payments services will be possible from new types of players processing payments on behalf of their customers. The development and application of new payment technologies also have the potential to reduce considerably the costs of financial services. To ensure that they continue to develop with consumer confidence and do not undermine the safety of the financial system, the funds underlying general payments instruments such as electronic cash and stored value cards will be subject to prudential regulation. The government has taken careful note of the inquiry's comments relating to ensuring that there are no impediments to migrating from paper based payments instruments such as cheques to lower cost electronic payment instruments. The government accepts that financial institutions will need to reflect the cost advantages of more efficient systems in the overall pricing structure of their services. the same time, the government is not yet assured that the financial system is competitive to ensure that pricing is always fair. Accordingly, it will continue to monitor informally developments in relation to financial sector fees and charges and will oppose any unfair or uncompetitive practices. Promoting More Effective Disclosure and Consumer Protection The inquiry also made a range of recommendations aimed at achieving more effective and efficient disclosure regulation, better regulation of securities and futures markets, promoting the coordination and extension of dispute resolution schemes and overhauling the regulation of financial advice. The government has endorsed a range of recommendations aimed at achieving more effecti ve disclosure and consumer protection. Financial sector conduct and disclosure regulation is currently undertaken by a variety of regulatory agencies. The main disadvantages with this are that: regulation is inconsistent across the range of competing financial products; financial service providers face a range of different regulatory rules that raises the complexity and cost of compliance; and consumers face inconsistent rules resulting in difficulties in understanding and comparing competing products. For these reasons a single market integrity and consumer protection regulator will be established-the Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission. The agreement of the states and the Northern Territory will be required since this commission will exercise all of the current powers of the Australian Securities Commission. The new commission will be given comprehensive market integrity and consumer protection functions across the range of Commonwealth level interests in the financial system. In addition to current powers, the commission will be given the same general consumer protection laws to enforce as currently exist under the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act as well as a range of enforcement powers. This framework legislation would provide specific regulation in certain areas and allow for industry codes of At practice in others, provided they are costeffective and fully meet essential standards adequately and coverage requirements. The Trade Practices Act will continue to have universal application administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. However, arrangements will be made to provide that the ACFSC undertakes full responsibility for consumer protection issues arising in the financial system. This will improve the level of specialist financial services consumer protection regulation in Australia as well as remove areas of duplication and inconsistency which are ultimately costly to the consumer. Disclosure requirements for retail financial products will be reviewed by the new regulator to ensure they provide information which enables comparison between products. In particular, I want to ensure that disclosure information is: comprehensible and sufficient to enable consumers to make informed decisions; consistent with that for similar products regardless of which institution offers them; and sufficient to identify remuneration or commissions paid to advisers. The government also endorses the inquiry recommendation for a single gateway for consumer complaints and dispute resolution and will act on this as soon as possible. Other Measures to Promote Efficiency The government will be pursuing a number of other initiatives to promote financial system efficiency. Further study will be undertaken of the potential economic benefits of changes in credit reporting and intra-group information sharing arrangements and of options for alternative instruments for social security payments. The implications of foreign investment policy for life offices and other funds managers will be reviewed as part of a broader review of foreign investment policy. Regulatory responsibility for self-managed superannuation funds will be transferred from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to the Australian Taxation Office. Once the new regulatory arrangements have been fully implemented, the existing requirement that banks hold non-callable deposits at the Reserve Bank will be abolished. This will eliminate a competitive disadvantage of licensed banks compared with their unlicensed competitors and ensure that all licensed deposit taking institutions face the same regulatory arrangements. Finally, the government also will establish closer consultation arrangements with the private sector on financial sector issues. A Financial Sector Advisory Council will be established to provide the Treasurer with ongoing advice on financial sector developments and policies. The members of the council will be drawn wholly from the private sector and a secretariat will be provided by my department. Conclusion The financial system inquiry and the many other financial system initiatives already announced by this government have received strong support in Australia and favourable recognition overseas. The reform package that I announce today represents the government's most substantial step yet to improve Australia's financial system. Further details of the measures we are taking are contained in the document I now table. The Prime Minister is writing today to the premiers and chief ministers seeking the cooperation and support of the states and territories. The government will also consult widely with industry and consumers on the details of the various reforms. Further reforms in the areas of disclosure requirements and other areas of the Corporations Law will be progressed through the government's corporate law economic reform program. A series of comprehensive papers containing proposals for reform will be issued over coming weeks, dealing with fundraising, takeovers, futures and securities markets, director's duties and electronic commerce. After consultation processes are completed, legislative proposals will be presented to parliament early next year. It is in all of our interests to press on with these changes. In pursuing these reforms, I look forward to continuing close cooperation with the states and territories and with the financial industry itself. The financial sector lies at the heart of the entire economy, and we all depend on its success. The measures I have announced today will facilitate greater choice and competition in financial services. They will encourage more rapid innovation, providing wider access and enhanced levels of service. Australia will have a world class regulatory structure that ensures the highest standards of prudence and safety and consumer protection. Regulation will be more efficient, with greater consistency and less overlap. More openly contested markets will drive lower industry costs and prices. These benefits will flow to all areas, including small business, those in rural and remote areas and consumers generally. At the same time, Australia's financial system will be positioned to compete strongly in the global economy and to continue to grow as a service export industry. The government's initiatives will ensure that Australia's financial system provides the best possible foundation for the continued development and growth of the whole Australian economy. I present the following paper: Refonn of the Australian financial systemMinisterial Statement, 2 September 1997.",26
87,Mr GARETH EVANS,OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED REFORMS,"by leave-The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has, after more than five months, finally got around to announcing its response to the Wallis financial system inquiry. Today's statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) at last tells us where the government is intending to go on the report's more detailed recommendations. Subject to some concerns and reservations about particular matters which I will come back to later and subject of course to reservations about not yet having seen the detail of the government's legislation, I can indicate that the opposition is in broad agreement with the substance of the Wallis report and its recommendations and with, accordingly, the government's acceptance of those recommendations. We do understand that some of the issues raised by Wallis are highly technical, but I have to say that a five-month delay in providing the kind of response we have heard today to the report is inexcusable for a government which has behind it all the bureaucratic might of the Treasury. In fact, it was not until the opposition announced a couple of weeks ago its in-principle support for the basic Wallis regulatory structure that we saw any sign at all of government action on this report. This kind of delay is really very typical of a government that is all drift, indecision and muddle. Here, as elsewhere, it takes the opposition to provide leadership. The long delay involved has adversely affected the financial services industry. All the major players have had to put a lot of their planning on hold as they wait for the future regulatory structure of the industry to be determined. Indeed I note that the government is not proposing to introduce legislation to implement any of its decisions today until some time into 1998 and, moreover, that the transfer of responsibilities from the states, which is a very important part of bringing this whole scheme to fruition so far at least as building societies and credit unions and so on are concerned, will not take place until July 1999. So I do urge the government to get its act together. Try to improve your relationship with the states. Get a bit of speed up and get the regulatory system effectively into place. Let me begin my response to the substance of this report by just saying a few words about the Wallis committee report in its context. The Wallis report is widely considered to be the most important review of the financial system since the Campbell report in 1981, but, as important as it is and as useful as it is, this ain't no Campbell report. The simple fact is that the changes recommended by Wallis, while they are quite far reaching, are still relatively small beer compared with floating the dollar, opening up the banking system to foreign banks and deregulating as we did most of the financial system. The Treasurer may want to claim these things as his own but these are Labor's achievements. The deregulation that took place through the 1980s has brought significant benefits for consumers and business: there is now much greater competition in key markets such as the market for housing and finance, consumers have access to a much wider range of financial products, and there has been substantial innovation in products offered by financial institutions with Wallis counting some 1,760 differentiated mortgage products now on the market and another 1,800 deposit products as the fruit of that kind of deregulation. Before deregulation many borrowers were forced to supplement their regulated bank home loans with personal loans of higher interest rates, and these cocktail loans have now disappeared. Although deregulation has brought tremendous benefits for business and consumers, it has not also been without its significant transition costs and disappointments, not least of those associated with the explosive and undisciplined credit expansion of the mid to late 1980s. But I think it is fair to say that the system is certainly now working a lot better. It has learnt a lot from those excesses. In particular, it is worth emphasising that the housing mortgage market is much more competitive than it has ever been and there are some hopeful signs of greater competition as well emerging in the market for small business lending. The Treasurer shamelessly claims that this greater competition is his own achievement, but anyone with the most cursory knowledge of the financial markets and how they have been working in these institutional frameworks knows that this competition developed before Labor left office. It has got nothing whatsoever to do with any changes introduced by the coalition government. Although an important part of the Wallis report is concerned with stocktaking the effects of that deregulation over the past decade, obviously what it is basically about is the future and, in particular, the appropriate regulatory structure for the Australian financial system in the 21 st century. It is worth saying that a Wallis-type inquiry into the financial system would have occurred no matter which side of politics had won the last election. As Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) foreshadowed the eventual need for it; Treasury had already commenced planning for a major inquiry, I can assure the Treasurer, despite his wishful thinking to the contrary, before we left office; and, indeed, an inquiry of this kind would have had to have been conducted under our national competition policy guidelines which required a review of the relevant legislation. Labor does understand the profound change that has been sweeping through the finance industry and the need for a new regulatory response to it. This change is the product of the financial deregulation which has already occurred, plus stunning continuing technological process and the impact here, as elsewhere, of globalisation. In the past, banks, life offices, superannuation funds and general insurers operated in quite distinct markets. However, with these other phenomena occurring-financial deregulation and so on-the differences between the products offered by these various institutions are becoming increasingly blurred. Life offices are now offering deposit type products which were once virtually the sole preserve of banks; super funds are entering the home mortgage market-so are the new mortgage originators; and the banks are offering superannuation and general insurance products. There are no signs at all of any slowing in this convergence in the services operated by different financial institutions. If anything, the trend seems to be accelerating. As a consequence, we have to put in place a new regulatory framework to accommodate these changes. That is what the Wallis report recommends. At the heart of the recommendations are those to create two new regulatory bodies, dealing with prudential supervision on one side and consumer protection on the other. What Wallis does not propose-or, indeed, give any consideration to-is the manifestly ill-considered proposal that was originally put forward by the Treasurer for a single megaregulator. That would have been an absolute bureaucratic monster. It would have ensured that, both on the prudential and on the consumer protection side, we saw standards slipping in the context of that kind of regulatory nightmare. On prudential regulation, the Wallis proposal embraced by the government is that supervision of financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry, be undertaken by a new body, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. APRA would pick up many of the current prudential supervisory responsibilities of the Reserve Bank, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the financial institutions scheme. The Reserve Bank, however, would continue to have responsibility for overall system stability, maintaining very close liaison with APRA, in particular, in arrangements for the provision of liquidity in dealing with the financial difficulties that might be experienced by banks and other licensed deposit taking institutions. The opposition is very supportive of the Reserve continuing to have that role; it is crucial. It is also worth mentioning in this context that the Reserve will have the responsibility for oversight of the payments system, with the establishment within it of a new payments system board. There is a very significant job for that board to do. Given the decision to open up the payments system to some new types of player, we will be looking very closely at the actual implementation arrangements for that. Going back to the creation of the single prudential regulator, APRA, in the form proposed, we do support that. There are no compelling arguments against moving to a new structure that will accommodate more naturally the profound changes that are taking place in the financial services market. On the other hand, there are some quite compelling arguments for bringing all deposit taking institutions under a single prudential regulatory body, the most obvious argument being that this will help to achieve a more level playing field between the banks, the credit unions and building societies. The Wallis inquiry was presented with quite substantial evidence that the state based regulatory scheme for credit unions and building societies, while having raised prudential standards considerably from what they were before, was nonetheless still cumbersome, duplicative and costly. As a result, the report found that if credit unions and building societies 'are to be an effective source of competition for the banks in the retail market, it is fundamental that they be able to operate on a national basis and to compete on the same regulatory terms as banks'. The opposition supports that key finding of the report. We hope that the states and territories, with a bit of encouragement, support and cooperation from the Commonwealth, will respond quickly and unanimously to the recommendation that they bring their relevant institutions under the national scheme. The new approach to prudential regulation proposed by the Wallis report would see the application of consistent depositor protection arrangements to all deposit taking institutions. The opposition believes that that will be of considerable benefit to credit union and building society customers. With the credit unions in particular filling the gap left by the banks in many rural and regional communities, it is vitally important that credit union customers be covered by the same depositor protection rules as bank customers. We have already stated our view in the opposition that the current system of depositor protection for banks has functioned well and should be the core of future depositor protection arrangements. We are pleased to see that the government has followed our lead again and not gone down the path of removing depositor protection provisions. We recognise, as the Treasurer said, that new legislation will be required to extend the existing depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act to other deposit taking institutions. The government must not use this process to water down the level of protection that is currently enjoyed by bank customers. I heard the Treasurer's statement today that that is not the government's intention. I simply say to him that we will be looking with a very beady eye when the legislation comes into ensure that that remains the case. When it comes to consumer protection on a wider scale, the current regulation of financial services in Australia is manifestly highly fragmented and in need of some consolidation. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Payments System Council, state and territory bodies responsible for administering state fair trading laws-all of them have consumer protection responsibilities in this area. Obviously, it makes good sense for the current fragmented arrangements to be rationalised in a new body, as the Wallis report proposes, as the government has now said that it will do, and the opposition supports that general approach. We simply hope that the proposed new Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission, the ACFSC, is properly funded and resourced to ensure that it can perform properly the proposed new regulatory functions. While it is logical that this new body, the ACFSC, acts as the day to day consumer protection and market conduct regulator for the financial services sector, we do believe, however, that the ACCC should retain its role as the economy wide regulator, without exception, of consumer protection. The has real teeth, has been willing to use them and should not be gutted. Although there obviously scope for some resource rationalislively ation with the new body, some allocation responsibility in such a way as not to ensure day to day duplication, overlap and confusion, we do have a concern-and this is one differproportion ence which I think is there; it is a bit hard tell the extent of the difference given that have not yet seen the legislation-based on the fact that we are worried that the ACCC would be completely dealt out of consumer protection in the financial services industry and that dealing it out in this the first step towards the fragmentation of a genuinely economy wide approach to consumer regulation. What we are saying is that, at the very least, the ACCC and the ACFSC should maintain a close working relationship, preferably under a clear operating agreement, with the ACCC retaining a reserve capacity, which you would not expect often to be utilised, to intervene to enforce the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act if it is becoming apparent that there is some shift away from a uniformity of regulatory approach. Maintaining strong consumer protection is absolutely essential in this area, as elsewhere. In that context, I emphasise that one great difference between the opposition and the government goes to the question of consumer protection in the context of bank fees and charges. Wallis recommends that banks and other financial institutions should have complete freedom to set fees and ment charges 'without government intervention suasion'. The Treasurer, unsurprisingly, supports that recommendation boots and all, and in doing it today he sent a green light the banks, and indeed to the other financial institutions, to go ahead and keep raising their fees and charges. That open slather approach runs right against the Prices Surveillance Authority's 1995 report into retail transaction fees and charges. Among other things, that report found that there was a need for the ACCC not to informally but to formally monitor fees and ACCC charges. The government has consistently rejected our calls for such a formal monitor, is an issue which has become very much more as successive interest rate reductions of have come into effect, as the banks' margins have narrowed and as they are looking now to fees and charges to earn a much greater of their profits. The best that the to Treasurer can offer today is a promise to we continue informally monitoring fees and charges. Frankly, that is not worth tuppencehalfpenny. Fees and charges will continue to spiral so long as there is no more formal monitoring process and, indeed, regulatory way would be process put in place. The Treasurer says that formal monitoring is unnecessary because consumer power is going to help keep fees and charges down, but consumer power can only begin to work when consumers have complete information about the alternatives that are available so they can in fact shop around to get the best deal. The trouble is-as I guess we all know in the real world-consumers are completely bamboozled by the fees and charges jungle. Last week Dr David Cousins, the former head of the PSA, one of Australia's foremost experts on bank fees and charges, admitted in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald that even finds it difficult to get consistent inforarea of mation on fees and charges which he can understand. The lack of authoritative, readily available and easy to understand information on the array of fees and charges in the marketplace today is a major market failure. There is a compelling need for the govern to address that failure by directing the or competition watchdog-ACCC-to formally monitor fees and charges, to make that information widely available so that ordinary to people can in fact shop around and keep competitive pressure on the banks and on the other institutions to offer consumers a better deal. The remaining area where we significantly depart from Wallis is that which was given no attention at all in the Treasurer's statement today-I suppose, he said everything he wanted to say on the subject in his initial response to Wallis back in April-and that is the subject of bank mergers and mergers between the major institutions in this sector. We have a very strong difference with Wallis in its recommendation to scrap the so-called four-pillars policy which has prohibited mergers between the major four banks. When the Wallis report was released in April the government did not rule out scrapping the four-pillars policy at some point in the future. Today's statement by the Treasurer has not changed that position because he was silent on the subject. I make it very clear for the record that Labor is steadfastly opposed to mergers between the major banks. We already have one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world and further mergers between the major banks would lead to even greater concentration and less competition. In addition, consistent with the ACCC's decision in the 1995 Westpac-Challenge case, we believe that strong regional competitors in each of the states are necessary to promote competition. Unfortunately, that ACCC position has now been watered down by the recent WestpacBank of Melbourne decision, a decision which, while on the face of it sets some conditions which modify the impact of the merger, only does so for a relatively short time and I think at the end of the day the consequences are going to be unhappy for consumers. The simple fact is that retail customers and small businesses bank locally-they do not bank nationally, they do not bank internationally-and strong regional competitors to the major banks to keep them honest in those local environments are therefore absolutely vital to competition. It is also appropriate for me to restate here the opposition's concern with the government's decision announced last April to implement the Wallis recommendation to scrap the so-called 'six-piIlars policy'. The six-pillars policy, otherwise know as the 'majors policy', was implemented by the Labor government to prevent mergers between the major four banks and the two large life offices. While the degree of job shedding would be far less than that produced by a merger between two of the major banks, nonetheless a merger between a major bank and a major life office would involve substantial job shedding. We remain very concerned about that prospect and we are concerned that, as usual, as predictable and as is to be expected, the government obviously remains utterly unconcerned about it. Yet another subject related to the role and financing of the banks and the relationships between them is the question of foreign ownership. I want to take this opportunity, again for the sake of completeness, to repeat the opposition's concern on the question of foreign ownership of the major banks. The Wallis report says there should be no special restrictions on foreign ownership of the major banks. The Treasurer said back in April only that there would not be 'open slather' on foreign ownership, but his idea of when the slather starts will make a great many people nervous. Our position is one of blanket prohibition against foreign takeovers of any of the major banks, and that is a position which we believe, in the national interest and in the interest of Australian consumers, must be retained. In conclusion, I have identified those areas of the Wallis report and the Treasurer's response to it where we do have significant concerns. I have also indicated those areas where we will be scrutinising with a very beady eye indeed the government's legislation when it is eventually introduced. But it is fair to say-and I say it-that generally speaking the Wallis committee has made a major and very useful contribution to the ongoing modernisation of a key sector of the Australian economy. We would have established such an inquiry ourselves and the proposals that have here emerged and have now been accepted by the government are broadly consistent with those which we ourselves would have embraced. Under these circumstances I am not engaging in my usual extravagant churlishness so far as the government is concerned; I am drawing attention in a measured and reasonable way to areas ofMr Costello interjecting",31
88,Mr GARETH EVANS,OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED REFORMS,"My usual honest, accurate and well-founded churlishness. I simply ask the government to take another careful look at the matters about which we have raised concern. I ask the government to take another careful look in particular at the consumer protection provisions, especially those provisions about bank fees and charges, but otherwise simply to get on with the task of implementation: to show some of that energy, to show some of that stamina, to show some of that enthusiasm for actually getting something done, as distinct from posturing feebly and emptily about it, which has so far eluded it. Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Industrial Relations",36
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to address the !ncreasing .level of stress, insecurity and uncertainty In Australian workplaces, along with its failure to deliver on its core pre-election promise to deliver 'better pay for better work'. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",36
90,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Canberra) (3.47 p.m.)Australian workers thought they were entitled to expect three things from this government when it was elected: they thought they had a rock solid guarantee from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no worker would be worse ?ff, they t-lOught the government had promIsed to mamtain their awards and they thought that they had been promised better pay for better work. Yesterday we established fairly clearly that the rock solid guarantee was not ever worth very much; it was not a core promise. We were able to refer to that quote from the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said: You have to remember that the statement was said in the context of a political campaign. It was just a casual comment. It was an ideal, not a commitment. It was obviously what the opinion poll of the day said, but the opinion polling must have changed, because the policy has changed. Nobody believes that any more. The promise to maintain the workers' awards if they wished to stay on them has been shattered. The awards as workers knew them no longer exist. They are being wound back to 20 allowable matters, and we have secret unreviewable contracts which can be unilaterally imposed to override awards. These are not agreements mutually agreed; these are conditions of appointment which you must accept. You do have a choice: you can accept the agreement or you can go without the job. That is the choice you have. Those two promises are long gone. What we find now and what we are worried about today is the loss of better pay for better work. Let us have a look at the facts; let us be a little bit empirical about this. First of all, let us have a look at better pay. The overall figures show that percentage changes in ordinary time earnings have been slowing over the past three quarters. Over the last three quarters, they have gone down from 0.8 per cent to 0.7 per cent to 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Each quarter since the middle of last year, since this government took over, those things have been falling. Mr Reith-Is that an increase?",36
91,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, per quarter-that is the average. But we are beginning to see some figures beginning to emerge about real wage declines in the private sector. Those same figures which are beginning to emerge showMr Reith-How do you work that out?",36
92,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you would like me to quote the average weekly earnings for May 1997, if you would like to read it, it is saying that data is beginning to emerge about falling wages in all employees' total earnings and in full-time ordinary time earnings in the private sector-both fell. But those are rather preliminary indications. What we do know is that there is a consistent pattern showing that the rate of increase is falling. Real wage declines in the private sector are beginning to emerge. The government made a miserable offer, based on awards, to people of $8. If the government's offer had been accepted a lot of people would have got nothing. But of course the industrial relationsMr Reith-It was your proposal.",37
93,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Your proposal was that many of them would get nothing. Mr Reith interjecting,37
94,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But your proposal deliberately restricted the number of people who could get an increase. Your submission to the national wage case was deliberately set out so that 600,000 workers would get nothing. You know it is true because you wrote it. The fact of it is that that is what would have happened. Fortunately, the commission rejected that and gave a little bit more-$lO. Those figures are on the public record. The commission gave a little bit more, but subsequent indications show that, within all the most conservative parameters about inflation, it could have been substantially more. Let us not forget that 33 per cent of workers depend on the award to determine their rates of pay. Those people's circumstances are getting consistently worse. We have got falling wages and worse. The results are getting increasingly unfair. In the last 12 months to June 1997 workers on the award received an average increase of 1.4 per cent. I know people will say, 'Oh, but inflation is falling,' but go into the households of the people who depend on that 1.4 per cent and ask what is happening to the things they pay for. In the last 12 months the price of food went up 3.2 per cent; in exactly the same 12month period-the 12 months to June 1997. The price of health care has gone up 7.2 per cent. That is what ordinary Australian workers are paying for. The people on those lower incomes are not getting the benefit of the fall in mortgages in their weekly pay so that they have the capacity to meet their living standards. We know-the statistics make it clearthat in the bottom two quintiles, in the bottom 40 per cent of income earning households, a very low percentage of people are paying off mortgages. It is in the order of 10 or 11 per cent. Yet, at the same time, while things are getting increasingly unfair for those people, things are getting pretty good at the top end of town. The latest Cullen Egan Dell survey showed quite clearly that executive salaries increased by 5.8 per cent in the same 12month period to June. We also find this morning's Financial Review says: Happy days are here again-if you are in the richest 5 per cent of the population ... the wealthy are cashed-up and spending freely again in a style reminiscent of the 1980s. ... French champagne sales are up 20 per cent in a year. BMW sales have grown even faster over the past 12 months, while plenty of well-heeled property owners in inner Sydney and Melbourne have enjoyed price rises of 30 per cent or more in that time. But there is not much of that happening in Blacktown, in Dandenong or in the working class suburbs of any of our cities. There is not much of it going on in Newcastle or Geelong where people are living in fear-fear of loss of their jobs and loss of their family income. You do not see a lot of BMWs driving around Lithgow these days. What is the government's response? It has introduced an industrial relations system expressly designed to make the outcome more unfair. Those who have the bargaining power can win bigger increases and those who cannot get nothing or worse. I reiterate: 33 per cent of Australian workers depend on the award system to establish their rate of pay. What in the new system helps these people? How do they get a fair share of the wealth they are helping to create? So much for better pay. All you get from Australian workers about the proposal that under this government they are getting better pay is a rather sad sort of horse laugh. But the situation is even worse when it comes to better working conditions. Before the election, the government really did not address what for many workers are the biggest issues: they are working longer; they are working harder; they are working more antisocial hours; and they are working under more stress-stress about whether they will have a job, about what sort of job it will be, about what the wages and working conditions will be, about how they will adapt those working hours and that change in income to meet their family and social commitments and about whether their kids will have a job. The minister in question time tried to cast some doubt on whether there is increasing social concern about the issue of job security by throwing in some data. But let us have a look at what some research done in March by Clemengers says: What are people concerned about? Recent changes in workforce participation patterns, however, worry many. The one problem seen as equally disturbing across all age groups is a lack of job security. The most vulnerable groups, the part-time and the unemployed, were particularly perturbed, as were blue-collar workers. The statistics are pretty strong. The following were very concerned about lack of job securirather ty: 41 per cent of the sample-50 per cent part-time workers, 46 per cent of unemployed people and 45 per cent of blue-collar workers. What we have is an increasing concern about job security from people in work and from those in households where perhaps there now only one part-time job. Mr Reith-So what were the figures last time?",37
95,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They did not ask it last rately time, to the best of my knowledge. But there is a very serious concern about job security. If you think the concern is not increasing, am very pleased and I hope you continue ignore it. The government did not address because it does not understand it. The governappreciate ment sees industrial relations exclusively an economic issue. It misses the whole social aspect of industrial relations arrangements. The same person whom the government wants to work a 12-hour shift is the person who worried about whether they are going to have time with their children and who outside working hours is actively involved in the community. But when you are working a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. shift, there is not a lot of time to be with your kids; there is not a lot of time to be involved in community organisations. These important social organisations that keep our society ticking over have depended, for the last 50 years and more, on people having time to be involved in them after they finish work. What is the government's response to this growing concern about job security? It is shown in every empirical study and given in every anecdote and discussion you have with people in every workplace that Australians are increasingly concerned about their jobs and their job security. The government, when it does not ignore it, makes it worse. The introduction of individual contracts, which make it easier to make changes to the working conditions that influence this concern over clearly job security, and the overall pressure for deregulation of the labour market are leading to some changes that are exacerbating this very real and substantial Australian problem. The market gives incentives to employers to employ their workers for longer hours than to employ new people. We are of seeing either cashing out of overtime or slashing of the rates. We are seeing penalty rates for antisocial hours disappear. Sometimes these are very unfair; sometimes they are not. Sometimes it is a decent outcome for is those individuals working with a decent employer. But what about all those people who are not parties to the contract and who would despelike to get some part of that extra work that is being generated? This is an issue that we need to begin to address, but this governI ment is consistently making it worse. There to are hundreds of thousands of Australians it seriously concerned about this. They do not the fact that the minister who is as supposed to be doing something about it thinks it is funny. They think it is an increasingly serious problem. There are lots of people working part time who want more is work; of course, there are the unemployed who want work; and there is an increasing proportion of people in work who would like to be working fewer hours. That is what the evidence says. It continues to say that the distribution of work is getting more unfair in our society. The government's changes make it very clear: the system does not protect those people any more. The government wants more and more people to work 12-hour shifts. It is removing the fundamental protections that have protected and enhanced the working conditions of Australians for generations. The Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the capacity effectively to pursue the improvement of your living standards through collective action-all of those things are being undermined. The government decides it will add to this: they have got a new strategy to help job security; they will make it a lot easier for you to get the sack. This does not seem to me fundamentally to go to the concern that ordinary Australians have about the security of their jobs. What we have is Australians working harder and for less. And for what? Where is the social benefit? We have not seen any upsurge in employment as a consequence. We have not seen any fundamental change in the relationship between growth and jobs. We have got growth declining. One of the substantial reasons for this is the insecurity that the government is creating. It might not be in the economics textbook but it ought to be obvious to anybody. If it was not obvious before now, yesterday'S housing figures and the response by Ron Silberberg from the Housing Industry Association, who is not renowned as one of our most ardent supporters, made it clear. The issue of insecurity in Australian households is what is holding back the housing sector. It is the reason why the benefits from the cuts in interest rates are not flowing into increased activity and jobs in the housing sector, just as the same problem is permeating the retail sector and other industries. So let us have a look at the picture. This government has been in government for about 18 months now. They are about halfway through their term. We have some chance to start to measure their performance. In industrial relations, what do we see? We see the number of strikes going up. So what does the government do? It has plans for industrial war but no plans for industrial peace. We see wages rising more slowly, or even falling, but the government is putting on pressure for them to go down and not up. When figures come out, you sometimes hear the minister saying, 'I am worried that the rate of increase is too high,' but I have never seen him express a concern that they might be too low. All the pressure is to put them down and not up. We see the outcomes of the distribution of work and wages becoming less and less fair and the government introducing policies to make it worse and not better. We see the job growth stagnant and the government slashing confidence and flattening the economy . We see rising stress and insecurity in the workplace and the government increasing the pressure on workers and reducing their protection. The government is consistently showing a pattern of ignoring this issue, which goes to the very heart of the social concerns of Australian workers and the households in which they live. If that litany of failure in the area of strikes, jobs, wages, fairness and confidence is a benchmark of this government's view that its industrial relations policies have been a success, 1 would hate to see what would be the benchmark for a failure. If they think more strikes, lower wages, falling jobs, increasing stress and insecurity are success, 1 would hate to see what constituted failure. Working Australians and their families and all those who aspire to work-if only they get half a chance-deserve much better than this.",38
96,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have seen some pathetic performances in this place over the years, but that was one of the most pathetic presentations from an opposition member that I have seen in a decade or more. I was left virtually without a response when the shadow minister, the member for Canberra, (Mr MCMullan) said, 'Let's be empirical,' and then rattled off a series of facts and figures which are patently and obviously wrong. For example, he said, 'Growth is declining.' Didn't you see the annual report of the Reserve Bank and yesterday's comments by the Reserve Bank Governor, who said that growth in 1996-97 would be just a bit under three per cent? How can you say that growth is declining when the Reserve Bank annual report, which was out yesterday, provided the actual figures which showed that you were wrong? You said something about the number strikes. Don't you bother to inform yourself of the statistics? The number of industrial disputes in Australia was more than two-thirds lower in 1996 than it was 10 years previously. It was the lowest number recorded in over 50 years. They are official Australian Bureau Statistics figures, which give a lie to some the shadow minister's claims. He even said, 'Wages are falling,' and then read of numbers which actually demonstrated that people have been getting wage wage decreases. It is quite an incredible performance. Then he bemoaned the circumstances of people who are on relatively low incomes. he should bemoan them, because no governembarrassment, ment did more to disadvantage low income earners than the Hawke-Keating government, of which this minister was a member. We recently had a very interesting discuslegislated sion in cabinet. In cabinet, we had a number of experts talking to us about the rate unemployment. It is public knowledge that one of those academic experts was publicly advocating a reduction of 10 per cent in wages for low income people. So, during the discussion in cabinet, I asked one of our advisers, 'Has it ever been known government of a Western democracy has advocated a cut in real wages of those most disadvantaged in our society?' Do you know what the response was from our economics adviser? The answer was, 'Yes, one such government had a policy of reducing the wages of the most disadvantaged in our value of that? society. In fact, it was the Hawke government.' Mr Wilton-How many wage increases did you support?",39
97,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will answer that question in a moment, but I have here a table which is a graphic demonstration of the decline in minimum wages of those who were defined by the statistician as being on minimum wages, namely, the CI4 minimum award wage. Between the period March 1984 and March 1996, as this graph shows, the real wages of those people actually declined. That was your policy in government. You of are dripping with hypocrisy to talk to us about people on low wages. When you were in office, it was your deliberate policy to reduce their wages-if they were lucky enough to have a job. You were the government that gave Australia the highest level of of unemployment since the Great Depression of of the 1930s. When you were a minister, your Prime Minister said, This is the recession out a series that we had to have.' Mr Wilton-When did you support the increases, not wage increases?",40
98,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Then I get the interjection, 'When did you support wage increases?' Let me answer that question. We have just supSo ported a wage increase. To your eternal we came into office and we said that, for those people who are on low incomes, we would make sure there was a fair deal for them. Not only did we make that promise before the election but, firstly, we the rock solid guarantees that we gave before the election and, furthermore, we of went down to the Industrial Relations Commission and we argued the case that these people on low incomes should be fairly treated and, lastly, the commission gave a $10 safety net wage increase. This would have to be one of the best outcomes for people on that a low incomes in recent history. Under our system, they got a $10 a week wage increase. When this matter was last before the commission, what did they get under your government? They got $8 under your government. What did they get under our government? They got $10. What was the I thank you for presenting this matter of public importance because, when you look at the real value of recent safety net increases and take C14 as an example, you see that after an increase they were up $359. That was a real increase of 2.6 per cent. Who is going to second this matter? Mr MCClelland-I am.",40
99,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I challenge you to give me a figure which is better than 2.6 per cent for the last $8 a week wage increase under the previous Labor administration. My challenge to you is to do that within the first minute that you stand on your feet after I sit down. I will give you $10 to say that you will not be able to beat that figure. I will give you $20 to say that you will not have the guts to say so either. That is the reality. You can have all the rhetoric you like about real wages for people who are on low incomes, but this government made commitments and legislated those commitments. We have seen those commitments in people's pockets. That is the most complete and comprehensive answer you could get. Let me pick up one other thing the shadow minister said. He said we had not kept that promise. I find that very interesting because one of your criticisms relates to the agreement making process. Under the agreement making process that we have, if you enter into an agreement, it will be approved by the relevant authority-the Industrial Relations Commission or the Office of the Employment Advocate-provided it meets a test. That test is that the sum total of all the benefits of a particular award must be matched by the agreement. Gi ven that all the guarantees that you gave people when you were in office about their being reasonably looked after were summed up in the no-disadvantage test and given that we have the same test, how can you as a matter of logic then attack the very proposition that we have implemented? Genuinely, I would like to know how you substantiate this claim. I will tell you how to do it and I will show you how vacuous it is. The only attack that you have been able to make is the attack you have made on the Office of the Employment Advocate. The embarrassing thing for you is that he has been before the committee and one of your members, who has just been appointed as the parliamentary secretary, at least had the common decency to say-I do not have the quotes, but I put them out the other daybasically that he was doing a meticulous job and that he was working in accordance with the law provided by the parliarnentMr MCMullan interjecting",41
100,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"By interjection, the shadow minister says, 'Yes, by that quote you are right.' That is my point. Perhaps it is a bit hard to get it into your thick skull, but that is the point. The reality is-and you have got nowhere to go on this-that we kept your nodisadvantage test. We made it a bit more flexible, but the concept is the same. We kept that test because we used that as a basis for maintaining and substantiating the rock solid guarantees. The whole thing really is incredibly vacuous. I am surprised that you had the gall to say some of the things that you have said. I suppose I should not be surprised. When you were in office-and I will give you this much-from time to time you were able to present Australia's problems and then in some ways sort of rationally argue for some solutions. We would say, 'You didn't go far enough. You didn't do enough. You were hamstrung by the unions,' but the truth is that the thing you have got going for you in your reputation is that, from time to time in your 13 years in office, you did confront some of these issues. Keating was in favour of tax reform. He knew it was the right thing to do, so he publicly advocated it. You know that in your hearts of hearts. If we were having a quiet beer privately after and you were being honest-which I am sure you are capable of-you would agree with me. It is the same with the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. You were in favour of it. You actually did it. We helped you and we supported you. On enterprise bargaining, you said, 'Here we have a problem. We have to improve Australia's productivity and look after workers at the same time. We can do this by the adoption of the idea of enterprise bargaining.' You let the unions basically run it so it did not work properly and everything else, but, basically, you enunciated the problem. For years you were in favour of tariff reform. It was an inadequate policy because you were not prepared to work on reducing costs so our people could be competitive. But you were out there publicly with a policy of tariff reform. What has happened since you have been in opposition? You basically abandoned everything which you in government said were answers to the problems. You have got the incredible impertinence to think that people are going to believe you when you get back into government. Why would anybody believe you? You are now opposing things which you were publicly advocating. Mr MCMullan-Are you going to deal with any of the issues or not?",41
101,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, I have dealt with most third highest. of them-more than comprehensively for your liking, I would have to say. You now have fallen into the classic stance of an opposition in that you are not prepared to publicly advocate the things which you used to be favour of because you are worried that they will not be popular and you try to undermine this government doing what you know should do because it is a solution to our problems. So you have abandoned the soluWorkplace tions that you yourself advocated and your alternative positionMr MCMullan interjecting",42
102,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You know this is true. Your alternative position is to basically campaign based on scaring and frightening people-the old scaremongering technique. Oppositions have been doing it since Jack was a little boy. On this question of job insecurity, no-one talks about job insecurity more than you do. You do it because you are trying to talk it Your great hope is that you can frighten the wits out of people. You are trying to puncture confidence as much as you can. Why? Bepared cause you think it is in your political interest. Don't worry about anything else, it is in your political interest. When you look at the figures, the Ross Gittins figure was interestgreater mg. Mr MCMullan interjecting",42
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Canberra should not keep up a running commentary on everything that the minister is saying.,42
104,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have not seen your Clemenger figures, and anyway you said they showed that they were changing over time. But you did not present a time series. How pathetic! If you have got two sets of figures, then maybe you can prove your case, but you do not have them. I interjected to invite you to do that, but you did not do it. If you look at what Gittins says, he went out and asked people. In fact, there was no substance for it at all. Look at what the OECD says when it comes to job insecurity, yet from what you say you would think that job insecurity in this country was rampant. Out of 24 countries surveyed, we were the third lowest-not the Mr MCMullan-When was that?",42
105,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was reported the other day. It is the 1996 OECD survey. He says to me in across the table, 'When was that?' It just shows that you have not even bothered to get out the latest international evidence on this we issue. How pathetic! Then you get the AWIRS. You did not mention the Australian Industrial Relations survey of the last few days. In fact, 63 per cent reported job satisfaction-and that was before we got in, so I reckon that figure would be up since then-and 75 per cent were happy with their hours. That was under your rotten system run a when people did not have a say. The reality on wages is that we have delivered what we have said. In a sense we have delivered more than what we said. I tell you what: at $10 we delivered a lot more than your $8. What an embarrassment it was when the commission said of your proposal that it up. would lead to higher unemployment. That is what it said. When it comes to job insecurity, the fact of the matter is that Australia, comto the rest of the world, does very well. That is not to say that there are not issues that need to be addressed, but the way to address those issues is to empower people to have a say. Of course, you are opposed to that because the people you want to have a greater say are the people up there at the ACTO congress. That is your problem and that is why we reject the MPI. (Time expired)",42
106,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barton) (4.17 p.m.)Firstly, to refer to that AWIR reportMr Reith-No, no. What about my challenge-in the first minute?",43
107,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am not in the minute yet. That AWIR survey said that slack demand rather than minimum wage levels appeared to be the main constraint on small business hiring. But, to collect my $30 from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), I refer to the example of the application by the transport workers for an across-the-board industry increase of 10 per cent which was opposed by the government. During the period of the previous government there were numerous increases of between 10 and 15 per cent-in the oil industry, the mining industry, the building industry and the communications industry. The fallacy of the government's industrial relations policy is that in those specialist industries where there are high levels of skill and they are still prospering-the government has literally ripped open the shirts of the employers and exposed their solar plexus, probably lower down than the solar plexus in fact-they have taken the role of the umpire out of the equation and those employers are going to find that they will suffer from the assault that they are going to get because of the government exposing them. But the reality for most workers is that are suffering stress and anxiety and it is now a major impediment to economic growth. I have referred to the AWIR survey which shows that slack demand rather than minimum wages is the main concern of small business, and that slack demand is the result of job insecurity. Job insecurity is now twofold. It is a question not only of holding on to a job but also of wages and terms and conditions of employment. Eighteen months after 1 January all but the 20 core conditions contained in section 89A of the act are going to evaporate. Overnight all conditions will go. Hard won conditions since the 1890s will go overnight. Mr Reith-Since the 1890s?",43
108,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They have been indeed won in a series of contests and negotiations since the 1890s. They have gone overnight under this government. If the workers want to attempt to restore their terms and conditions, they can only go to the those 20 core conditions under section 89A. Where do we find, under those 20 core conditions, anything resembling the termination, change and redundancy provisions which were contained in those famous test cases in the early 1980s? They are nowhere to be found. Employers do not have an obligation to give notice to workers about intended changes, whether those changes be in respect of the introduction of technology or in respect of the changing of manning level or in respect of outsourcing of work, which is an increasing phenomenon. There is absolutely no obligation to give notice and, of course, as a corollary to that, there is no obligation to consult in any way, shape or form with workers. Workers are totally exposed. This government has introduced unfettered and unrestrained managerial prerogative, despite the advances that were taking place in terms of a sophisticated industrial relations framework where workers were increasingly having a say in their own destiny-and to the ultimate productivity gains of the employers, I might say. Workers on basic conditions wanting to progress their wage rates-and this relates to the bet by the minister-are now left, in section 89A(3), with an inability of the they commission to award anything other than a minimum wage rate. The commission cannot make an award or order for an actual pay increase. They are left to award virtually poverty level wages with the $380 minimum wage rate. If workers want to improve on that minimum rate, they are forced into an enterprise bargaining situation. There is no longer any obligation to bargain in good faith. The employer is under no obligation to disclose, for instance, their profit level. The employer is under no obligation to disclose the salary levels of their chief executives. The employer is under no obligation to display what their proposed manning level changes are going to be. Workers are going in cold. All those enterprise bargaining in good faith provisions have gone. They exist right around the world in just about all European countries and in North America. Indeed, they existed in South Africa under the former apartheid regime. But we have not got those. They have gone. Workers are left very much on their own in terms of enterprise bargaining. They are a victim to the market power of the employer. When there is a restriction or a hiccup in the bargaining process, what happens? What happens is what we are seeing at Rio Tinto. The commission has no power to arbitrate under section 170N; that has been taken away. The employer is also a victim in those circumstances where the reverse of the coin applies and unions, in the specific circumstances of the industry, retain industrial power. The government has removed the ability of the umpire to adjudicate in such enterprise bargaining situations. In terms of the ability of the employer to undermine conditions, there is no obligation on an employer to bargain collectively. The employers are trying to go behind the backs of unions and pick off workers one at a time, like the Tarzan movies where the villains come in and pick the last ones off along the trail. The employers are able to do that by going behind the collective bargaining process and picking off employees. One example that I confronted was of employers inducing workers to sign individual contracts by offering them a free dinner. They were being as fickle as that to pick off workers. They have completely and utterly undermined the enterprise bargaining process. In terms of the ability of workers to retain their conditions, there is no longer any power of the commission under section 89A to make an award or an order regarding contracting out. There are High Court cases which say that that is clearly a legitimate industrial issue, because if an employer can avoid or get around terms and conditions of employment by contracting out to a contractor who is going to undercut wages and conditions, quite clearly living standards are going to be affected. That has all been removed. The commission's role as a legitimate umpire or referee to ensure and protect workers' terms and conditions has been completely and utterly obliterated. We have had worldwide respect for our system of industrial relations because it was one where the law of the jungle did not apply. It was one where the commission had the power to be an umpire. If one reads the constitution debates leading up to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, one will see that that motive existed as a result of the tremendous damage done by the disputation, which is going to be rife in those sectors where there is still industrial strength. As to whether this changed environment is necessary, in commenting on the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, the Financial Review stated: Some 83 per cent of small businesses said they were satisfied with present arrangements for determining pay and conditions; just 7 per cent were dissatisfied. Some 76 per cent of small businesses agreed with the statement that ""management thinks the award system has worked well in the past""; while only 9 disagreed. This government has introduced unnecessary draconian provisions which constitute an unprecedented assault on hard won terms and conditions and has created insecurity of such proportions that the economic development of this nation is being impeded. The tragedy is that that dogma has induced blindness on the part of this government and has prevented the government from seeing the reality and the tremendous damage it is doing not only to our economy but to an industrial relations system which was held in high esteem throughout the world.",43
109,Mr MCARTHUR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Obviously the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) has lost the bet. The Howard government provided a $10 safety net, unlike the Labor government. So the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is at the table, would be delighted to receive the $30 because he would like to contribute that to the 'Save Bill Ludwig Fund' in Queensland during the factional warfare in that state. Let us compare the 'better pay for better work' under the present Howard government with the performance of the former Labor government. Let us look at the coal industry. We see very interesting article here entitled, 'Coal Miners on notice'. In that article the general manager of Rio Tinto points out some of the outlooks. outrageous practices in the coal industry that were encouraged and abetted by the Labor Party during their time in power. Mr Clifford points out that the industry will not be able survive unless there are changes in the work practices and the industrial relations activities of the Rio Tinto company and the union movement. He observes that the coal industry is facing increasing competition from nesia, both in terms of the price and the quality that the Australian coalmine industry needs to export its coal around the world. Australia needs to improve its productivity and efficiency and at the Rio Tinto No. mineMr Fitzgibbon-You support Rio Tinto, do you?",44
110,Mr MCARTHUR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Hunter would understand that. You have been you understand what goes on and you support it, and your government supported those practices. What happened there was that work was allocated to individuals disregarding their ability to do the job, disregarding whether management wanted to make some change to the work teams. The unions said that workers would do exactly what they instructed There was no recognition of merit; there was no desire to improve workplace arrangements to improve productivity because of the stranbers glehold the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union had over the workplace. It was a closed shop in the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine; everyone in Australia knows that. Work was allocated according to seniority. New employees could work only a night shift; that was an unpopular shift. But of course union said that new employees would work at that time. The lowest paid worker received only $55,000 per annum-only $55,000 and their wage rates went up to $70,000 and $80,000. Industrial action in this coal industor try, under the arrangements put in place the former government, is 45 times the nastrike. tional average. There is a last on, first off seniority system for hiring and firing, as as compulsory engagements from union lists. law. a So if you were in the union and were put off, you were put on again. There was no ability to find new employees, new blood, with new The Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, as the honourable member would understand, only returns two per cent on investment. It is a to financial disaster, largely brought about because of the union practices of the former government. In 1996, the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine experienced 24-hour stoppages on no fewer than 14 occasions. That is double the Indocoal industry average and 100 times the average for all industries. In 1996, the working days lost per thousand employees for all industries was 131 days. Listen to this figure. For Rio Tinto No.1 mine, 12,800 working 1 days were lost. That is the comparison under the Labor Party regime. The first stoppages this year took place in relation to the dismissal of an employee for misconduct. They had a strike at the mine there, because one guy was sacked. When the company refused to reverse its decision there was a further 24-hour strike. How does the member opposite defend that? The matter was referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for arbitration. When the IRC found in favour of the company that resulted in yet another strike because they were not happy to to do. receive the umpire's decision. There were more union stoppages for the Parliament House rally-that rally that memwell recall at the front of Parliament House. The union insisted that 10 per cent of the work force be given time off to attend the protest. When this was refused they had a two-day strike to reinforce their position. The Hunter Valley workers also took industrial action in sympathy with employees the at the Vickery coal mine. What was the background for that strike? There was a fourday stoppage in protest to proposed changes to workers compensation laws. So it goes on. When the company refused to ban a contracwho had done some work for the company by during the stoppage there was a 24-hour They would not agree to any management instructions or the rulings of the Induswell trial Relations Commission or the courts of Last night at Parliament House, Mr Graeme Watson of the law firm Freehill, Hollingdale and Page addressed the Society of Modest Members, which is a free thinking group of the coalition. He discussed the provisions of the new Workplace Relations Act which have provided Rio Tinto with legal provisions to improve the work practices in the Hunter Valley No. 1 coal mine, to keep the mine open, to keep it working and to keep jobs in that area. It was under the new powers under section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act that Rio Tinto was able to seek an order preventing further industrial action and to get an order to get people to return to work. The Reith legislation is able to bring about a new attitude in the coal mine at Rio Tinto. The freedom of association provisions-that is, whether or not you join a union-are now being enforced under the new Reith legislation. The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act have prevented strikes from escalating to national stoppages. The legislation eventually encouraged those train drivers to cross the picket line and deliver the coal to the port-something that would not have happened under the previous Labor government. Mr Fitzgibbon-No, they didn't. That is just wrong.",45
111,Mr MCARTHUR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You know that as well as I do. The new industrial relations policy, the Reith legislation, has provided a cooperative environment where we allow employers and employees to bargain free of union interference and has ensured that irresponsible strike action can be prevented. The figures on what has happened at this mine are horrendous, as you understand. You know that. It is interesting to do a comparison with the si tuation under the Labor Party's preferred option. If we look at the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine in the Hunter Valley, there are some very intrinsic advantages in terms of the quality of the coal and the overburden. We get one tonne of coal for every 2Y2 tonnes of overburden. That is a very important statistic which allows that mine to be profitable. You would think that that would be one of the best mines in Australia. The ratio of those figures is important. That is a union dominated mine where there have been a number of strikes which I have recorded. It was a first off first on attitude so nobody knew that employees could be replaced and also replaced from the union list. Let us make a comparison with Queensland. We have the Ensham mine at Emerald in Queensland. They have 12 tonnes of rubble to one tonne of coal-a very difficult technical task. They decided to make a fundamental change to the industrial relations approach under the Reith legislation. The CFMEU of course wanted to fight that. One of the fundamental changes was the introduction of a 12hour shift. Thirty workers went on to the new contracts. The shift rosters ensured a new arrangement: 84 hours a week, seven days a week at the mine and seven days off. The workers wanted this change. It provided more leisure time for them in their week off back home. Mr Ken Foots, who is managing the mine, is reported as saying: Foots told the Australian Industrial Relations Commission earlier this year that the l2-hour shifts have been the key contributor to Ensham's productivity. Elsewhere in the Bowen Basin, open-cut mines operating on eight-hour shift rosters only achieve 5.5 per productive hours work a day because of meal breaks, crib breaks, demarcation and the extra time it takes to change over the three shifts, he said. ""The Ensham roster, combined with no demarcation, enables us to achieve 23.5 hours of productive work per day on a particular piece of equipment,"" he said, ""an improvement of more than 40 per cent in utilisation."" That particular change was supported by no less than Mr Graham Gosling, the National Secretary of the Communication, Electrical and Plumbing Union. He is one of your lot. He said that the changes have been very helpful. He said: The general view held by our members is that the working conditions, both in terms of the flexibility and the amount of time worked, you wouldn't take them off with a cannon ... That is what he said they were so pleased with these changes. He continued: On my experience there is certainly a high level of employee democracy there. Mr Foots went on to say: ... the mine is now a high-trust workplace with few managers, where employees virtually run the show. We have a situation where, under the Reith legislation, we have people being employed on merit, we have the task allocated to those employees who have the skills to do the job rather than the union dominated arrangements and we have employees being consulted by management to get the job done. Efficiencies have been created. Those mines will survive if these changes come about under the new industrial relations arrangements brought in by the minister at the table and jobs will be retained in the Hunter Valley, which the member would not understand.

112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA NA Motion (by Mr Andrew) agreed to: That the following order of the day, committee and delegation reports, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-Standing Committee-Report on greater autonomy for Torres Strait IslandersMotion to take note of the paper: Resumption of debate. NA Public Accounts Committee",47
113,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: Report 352-Review of Auditor-General's reports 1996-97-Second quarter, August 1997. Ordered that the report be printed.",47
114,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report reviews the audit reports of the Auditor General which were tabled in the second quarter of 1996-97. Three of those audit reports were selected by the JCPA to be examined at public hearings which were held on 3 February. These were Audit Report No. 13, Tax Debt Collection; Audit Report No. 15, Food Provisioning in the Defence Force; and Audit Report No. 17, Work Force Planning in the Australian Defence Force. The JCPA's report does not attempt to analyse in detail all of the audit findings and recommendations in those three reports. Instead, it draws attention to key issues discussed at the hearings and highlights commitments given by witnesses. The audit on tax debt collection was a constructive exercise which resulted in a number of sensible and useful recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Australian Taxation Office. An audit office analysis indicated that a combination of minor improvements to the timeliness of debt collection and the effectiveness of recovery level would result in potentially significant net ongoing benefits to the Commonwealth. The audit report estimated that even a modest improvement would provide a net benefit to the Commonwealth of about $142 million. The JCPA's review of the debt collection report highlighted three issues of concern. Firstly, there is a risk that penalties for late payments of tax are not being administered by the Taxation Office in accordance with the law. The legislation requires that additional charges be automatically imposed when a tax debt is paid late. An assessment by the audit office showed that 35 per cent of the outstanding debt cases finalised by payment in 1995-96 had no ATLP-late paymentimposed. The results of this assessment were supported by the findings of an internal tax Report office audit. Secondly, it is a fact that taxpayers with large tax debts are more likely to have late payment penalties remitted than taxpayers with small debts. The audit report noted the risk that penalties may be being used as a negotiating tool in debt collection. The JCPA considers that both practices are wrong and represent an unacceptable risk to revenue. Thirdly, the JCPA has a concern that too often litigation is pursued when negotiation would produce better results. It appears that good central tax office policy is not always matched by good regional office policy. A number of my colleagues have reported to me that regional tax officers were totally unaware of the thrust of the ATO's policy. From my own experience, my colleagues are right. The JCPA made suggestions and recommendations to improve the tax office performance in all of these areas. The JCPA looks forward to the ATO addressing these criticisms seriously and with urgency. Whether the response from the ATO is satisfactory will determine if the JCPA needs to conduct further inquiries. The JCPA's review of food provisioning in the Defence Force again highlighted significant shortcomings in the ability of Defence's financial management systems to generate accurate information on the total costs of Defence activities. Defence was unable to provide the total cost of providing rations to Defence Force personnel to the audit office or at the hearing and took some time to construct an estimate of cost after the event. Defence's estimate of total cost of provisioning was $277 million per annum. The lack of ready access to such information makes it extremely difficult for Defence to manage its resources efficiently and to account adequately for its expenditure and performance. It is clear that much remains to be 'done in Defence to reform financial management systems and practices. Financial management reforms need to be a clear priority for Defence, as it prepares itself for the Commonwealth's new accrual budgeting environment. As noted in the audit report and at the hearing, the fundamental flaw in food provisioning is the absence of a clear ADF-wide policy on food provisioning. The audit office highlighted the resulting risk that procedures on food provisioning are not aligned to Defence Force objectives and may not be cost effective or best practice. The Defence Force has acknowledged the deficiency, and the JCPA has been advised by Defence that a policy will be in place by the end of the year. The third and final report that the JCPA examined in this report was work force planning in the ADF. Work force planning is an issue of central importance to the quality and preparedness of the Defence Force. It is also an issue of great complexity. The audit report attempted to assess the work force planning systems used by the Defence Force with a view to identifying better practice and making recommendations to promote the overall effectiveness of planning systems. One of the main challenges identified during the review was a need to devolve a greater degree of management responsibilities from Defence Force headquarters to individual Defence managers. Although a balance needs to be maintained when devolving responsibilities in an environment that has a demand for strong, central controls, the committee considers that the advantages to be gained from increased management flexibility are quite significant. It is a balance which, if achieved, could help overcome many of the rigidities and inefficiencies in Defence's work force planning systems. However, it is clear to the committee that Defence faces some fundamental work force planning problems. The committee accepts that the personnel managers require better tools and levers for managing the strength of the service than are currently used and notes the efforts currently being made in Defence to address a number of work force planning issues. I conclude by thanking those people who contributed their time and expertise to the committee's review. I wish to thank members of the sectional committee for their participation in this most effective round-table process of examining reports of the Auditor-General. The work done by the JCPA staff cannot be overstated. They continue to perform to the high standards the parliament has come to expect. In particular, I wish to thank Jennifer Hughson for another report of the highest standard and quality. I commend report 352 to the House.",47

The Committee detennined that consideration of this matter should continue on a future day. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",52
130,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of the following bills: Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1997 Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1997 Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997 Sales Tax (Excise) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997 Sales Tax (General) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997 Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997 Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 The reason I move this motion is essentially to set in place a guillotine so that these particular items are dealt with today. The blue shows that these matters were intended to be dealt with today. Clearly these are important matters from the point of view of the Commonwealth and in respect of Commonwealth-state relations. Members of the House will appreciate that recently the High Court brought down a decision which invalidated certain state laws, which thereby undermined the capacity of state governments to raise certain necessary revenues for the running of those state governments. These nine bills are therefore obviously urgent. It is necessary that they go through this chamber to the Senate. I am surprised that the opposition would today be insisting on measures which would make it more difficult for the government to put these measures through. In fact, I understood that the opposition was attempting to cooperate with the passage of this legislation, which is clearly not the case. Who is running your fiscal policy over there? Who is running it? The fact of the matter is this is a matter of national priority. You people are playing childish, juvenile stupid games. It is amazing, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just so it is on the record, we have these matters before the chamber today. There are 10 speakers in all-four opposition, a couple of Independents and four government. In the normal course of events, with people's sensible cooperation, these bills could be dealt with without any particular difficulties. Members of the House will understand that in the Senate recently there was a debate on an entirely separate matter, namely, the future policy in respect of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The Senate has a view about that. They passed a resolution. Mr Crean-So does half your back bench.",54
131,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I will come to your intervention in a moment. By a message the Senate relayed their resolution to the House. The opposition's view is that this is an issue that they want to run. They, of course, are responsible for the problems in the TCF industries, but they want to see the government's solution to the problem that they created. They are very agitated about the TCF industries. They have this view that, if they could only force a vote in the lower house on the TCF industries, somehow it would be a great political advantage for them. That is their position. They want to have a debate today about the TCF industries. They tried to have it last night. We said, 'No, the government sets the agenda for the House.' It is absolutely amazing, Mr Deputy Speaker. The government won the election, and they think they get to run the House. Last night we said, 'No, we're not having that debate.'",55
132,Mr MELHAM,URGENT LEGISLATION,You need our experience to help you run the House. That's the problem.,55
133,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Today, this noisy irrelevant little left-wing injector here said-whatever he said; it was hardly comprehensible. The point simply is this: the opposition came to us-we have got a program for the day-and said, 'Unless you let us have a debate and a vote on the TCF industries we will withdraw cooperation for the management of the tax bills.' That was your position. For 13 years, when we were in opposition, understandably the government of the daythe Labor government-managed the agenda of the House. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was then Leader of the House. Never did I have the impertinence to hold a gun at the then Leader of the House's head and say, 'If you don't do what the opposition says we're going to make mayhem.' Yet that is the threat that we have had today.",55
134,Mr MELHAM,URGENT LEGISLATION,You tried anyway. You weren't very effective.,55
135,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"You have got to smile, Mr Deputy Speaker. These impertinent people come in here and say, 'If we don't have a vote on the TCF today, then we're going to make hell.' That is your plan. As I said to you yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition had a private member's bill. The private member's bill is",55
136,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is a motion for declaration of bills to be urgent but so far-and I have been listening very carefully to what the Leader of the House has had to say-I have not been able to detect anything, or very little, that actually goes to the substance of the motion. I would ask you to bring the Leader of the House back to the substance of the motion, otherwise presumably we could all debate the subject to a very wide degree.",55
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"There is no point of order, but I do ask the Leader of the House to address his further remarks to the matter at hand.",56
138,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I certainly am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think members of the House are entitled to know why we have moved this motion. The point I was making is that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had a private member's bill on the blue-I was just trying to find the exact details for the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) before he interjected-in respect of a proposed plebiscite for an Australian republic. The opposition said to us, 'Would you mind putting it on not today'-that is, Monday-'but on Tuesday given'Mr Leo MCLeay-And why?",56
139,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Because there was a condolence motion on. That was fine. So I said, 'Fair enough, I agree.' Mr Leo MCLeay-We want to help you.",56
140,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"You came to us and we said, 'Yes, okay, we will oblige because we are cooperative in these matters.' Today what they have said is, 'We require the government to have a vote on the TCF.' Naturally enough, I said, 'No, we will not be having a vote on the TCF.' So then you said that you would not allow us to get the tax bills through. Mr Leo MCLeay-No, that's not what we said at all. That's a lie.",56
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Watson is out of his place.,56
142,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I said, 'If the opposition is not prepared to give us cooperation in the management of the House, then obviously we are not prepared to give time today to the Leader of the Opposition on his bill.' I do not mind if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to introduce it at some other time. But, given those opposite have told me to my face that they are going to do everything they can to delay the passage of these important bills, obviously I am not going to bend over backwards to provide additional time to the opposition. However, I have no objection to the Leader of the Opposition introducing his bill at some other time. We agreed yesterday, at their request, to change it. If he wants to move that bill at some stage, that is fine. I do not have an argument about that. What I do have an argument about is that the opposition is not entitled to hold a gun at the head of the government and require of us that we hold a vote on a matter of their choosing. When you say it, it just shows you how absolutely absurd this proposition is. Never in 13 years when we were in opposition was such a proposition ever put. Never would we have had the gall, the hypocrisy, the impertinence or the arrogance to have lost an election and then demand that we should run the agenda. Well, you do not run the agenda. I am a bit disappointed because I thought last week that your more feral characteristics had left you in the winter recess and the reds of Bordeaux had tempered your normally far too excitable nature. Too early did I hope for a more sensible approach from you. That is why we have moved the suspension of standing orders. It is regrettable that we have had no cooperation from the opposition. You leave us absolutely no choice-given that you have signalled that you will do all that you can to prevent it-because, of course, we are going to have this legislation through today. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",56
143,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"We, of course, oppose this proposal to guillotine a package of tax legislation. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has got the hide of a rhinoceros and Pinocchio's nose. I have never heard such an appalling explanation for this mess that we find ourselves in because of the mismanagement of the Leader of the House. We have before us now a proposition to guillotine through what we had agreed to put through. We had even agreed to cut our speakers back by 15 minutes to get this proposition through. But what did we get today? We got the ratting on a deal by the Leader of the House. This was the deal: we all know the tragic circumstances of yesterday in which the world was mourning the loss of Diana; we had an understanding with the government that, if they wanted it to be a low-key day, we would cooperate. On that basis, because the private member's bill that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to move happens to relate to a plebiscite on whether we move to a republic-it just might have been a bit sensitive on the day that the monarchy lost one of its favourites-we offered to pull it off yesterday, when it was slotted in, on the basis that we were guaranteed a time slot today. That was the deal. No ifs, no buts, that was the deal. That is what you have ratted on; and that is why you have this lack of cooperation from us now. The second point is that, had the ment stuck with the deal, the Leader Opposition would have introduced this bill at a quarter to five today and would have been required to have concluded it at 10 to fivereferred 50 minutes ago. So we would have been least into the third speaker on this so-called set of taxation legislation for which you say you now need a guillotine. What incompeof tence, what foolishness, what stupidity what an inability to manage the affairs of the here. House! You might think you are a player in the leadership stakes-and, maybe you are, with the other incompetents that are on your sidethe but your function in this case is to manage government business, and all you are doing delaying it. You are delaying it by your stupidity, by your arrogance and by your nonpreparedness to cooperate. We have given this government absolute cooperation in the way in which legislation has gone throughnameless we have even had the Leader of the House thank us for doing so-because we do recogthe nise that the government has got a mandate get its legislation through. But the government does not have a mandate to rat on deals. important thing for a politician is that their word is their bond. That is their currency. Once one debases that currency, one is worthis one of themless as a politician. And that is your position. But, more importantly, you are required to manage the affairs of the House. You are now in the position where to get this legislation through, which we had promised to get through for you, you have to guillotine it. You will get no other cooperation from us activityuntil you apologise for the ratting on this deal and until you are prepared to honestly enter into discussions and negotiations with us about what is important to us and what is important to you. Let me go to the issue that he refers to in terms of the TCF industries. He referred to this as his justification. Mr Reith-No, I didn't.",56
144,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"You did refer to it. He is telling another porky now, Mr Deputy Speaker. This person is shameless.",57
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! The TCF industries do not of the form part of these bills.,57
146,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with the greatest of respect, the Leader of the House to this in his justification for why this at guillotine is being moved. We even had a point of order taken by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), and you did not uphold the point order. We expect a bit of consistency in and this place-honesty there and consistency",57
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Hotham shall contain his remarks to the matter in hand. He has now mentioned textiles, clothing and footwear issue in passing. He shall proceed to continue with the is debate and address the matters in hand.",57
148,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"We sought from the Leader of the House an understanding that a matter that was important to us-which shall remain for the time being, because of this ridiculous ruling-was something we wanted opportunity to debate, not only because to we think it is important but because the Senate has actually asked this House to The concur in relation to that motion. We also have a number of government backbenchersdare I say the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) Mr Leo MCLeay-Is that the member in the chair?",57
149,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I refer not to the chair but to the member for Bendigo. A number of government backbenchers are going around this country telling workers in a particular Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I put it to you that the honourable member for Hotham is entitled to say that they demanded a debate today on the TCF industries. He is quite entitled to say that-he must be, because you ruled it to be within order when I made those remarks. However, he is not entitled to debate the substance of the policy issue at the heart of the TCF matter-which is clearly what he is now getting on to-which is, as he has made quite clear, the debate that he wanted to have and which he helped the govemment",57
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,There is no point of order.,58
151,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Not only is the Leader of the House incapable of running the House, but he gets up here and lectures us in question time about the frivolity of our point of orders. He has just taken three minutes of my time, and you have ruled him out of order. Where do you get off? What have you learnt in this place? What are you capable of running, except cocktail parties in the discounted penthouse in St Kilda? Mr Reith-What a shocking irrelevance!",58
152,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Oh, he's got a glass jaw. What I put to the Leader of the House, in the nicest possible way, was the proposition that went something like this: we would like a debate on the issue that we have been referring toMr Reith-No, you're not getting it.",58
153,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"That is, the TCF matter, and if we get agreement to that Mr Reith-You're not getting it.",58
154,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,Then we will continue to cooperate with what we have done and what we have said in tonight's debate. Mr Reith-You're not getting it.,58
155,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I can hear you. Can I get him to stop, to shut up? Can I get that, Mr Deputy Speaker? It is the sort of thing that you would call me to order on. I just ask for a bit of equanimity in this place.",58
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Without result.,58
157,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"It is fair enough that I might have put that request in stronger terms, but hasn't the Leader of the House, dealing with all the trade unions in his time, heard of opening gambits? Hasn'the heard of negotiating positions? Doesn'the understand that negotiation means that you put a strong proposition and that you are prepared to negotiate on it? You fool! You dope! Where do you get off? Who have you been dealing with? All I am saying to you is that we had an understanding-an understanding that the Leader of the Opposition would be able to move his private member's bill today. You have ratted. The reason you have ratted, you say, is that we had the temerity to put a proposition to you requesting the opportunity to bring on for debate what we did not want debated last night. Mr Reith-Yes, you did.",58
158,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"No, we did not. We went, in the spirit of cooperation, with you last night. Last night, we said, 'Don't bring this on now'-again because of the solemn circumstances surrounding yesterday-'let's have it tomorrow.' In fact, again to demonstrate the incompetence of the way this man runs the House, they even missed the call in reading the Senate's message to the House. It was supposed to have been done before the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] came on. Mr Reith-No, it wasn't. We pulled it on.",58
159,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Of COurse it was, because that is what your people told us. Go and check with them. Mr Reith-Well, they told you wrong.",58
160,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"They do not speak for you then? This office of yours is a shambles too. Not only are you hopeless, but your office is in a shambles, and you are putting them into it. No wonder this place is in a mess. What we are saying is that we have sought cooperation in this regard, but we cannot get common sense out of the Leader of the House. If this government wants cooperation in its legislative program, you ought to change your approach or they ought to change you. It is as simple as that. What you have done is debase the currency in this place. You have ratted on a deal, and there is no worse crime than that-not only on the Labor side of politics but across politics. Rats are not liked. As the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) has said, they should have cheese across the front of your table all the time you are in the House. We do not accept this proposition to guillotine, because we say that the government has mucked up this process and ratted on a deal.",58
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Hotham's time for this debate has expired. I call the honourable member for Moore.,59
162,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Frankly, after listening to both of those presentations, one can well understand why many people hold our activities in such utter contempt. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. You just said that the time for the debate had expired and then called the member for Moore.",59
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The time for his contribution to the debate. Mr Leo MCLeay-No, you said that the time for the debate had expired. Mr Reith-Well, it hasn't. Mr Leo MCLeay-1 know that, and it seems even you know that, Stupid. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are going to declare the debate closed, then it is closed. If it is not declared closed, I do not know why you did not call the member for Cunningham, who was standing at the dispatch box for a couple of minutes.",59
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! There is no point of order.,59
165,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"As I was saying-and the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) has proved my point QED-it is little wonder why people hold our activities in such utter contempt. I agree with opposing this motion. The Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has a good case if there has been a break down in an agreement. . If one were to consult House of Representatives Practice, one would see the agreement or trade-off of time reached between the government and opposition is cited as being one of the elements that may well influence the passage of the bills and bring on a guillotine motion. However, one of the other reasons is the heaviness of the government's legislative program. Given that we are at the commencement of the government's spring program, what on earth makes this set of tax bills so urgent that one is not able to have a full and frank debate without the imposition of a guillotine? Mr Reith-Don't you read the papers? Mrs Crosio-It is sort of the states' budgets; the states' money.",59
166,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I understand entirely why, but let me make the observation that this has been coming for some time. We all knowMr Reith-The decision was only a couple of weeks ago.",59
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member shall direct his remarks through the chair.,59
168,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We all know that, in essence, most people understood that the High Court was going to make a decision of the type it made and that the states in particular had been prepared for it, as had, I would imagine, the Commonwealth government. I make the observation that a number of us who represent our constituencies want to make a contribution in relation to the interests of our constituents-no party interest involved-and, therefore, whatever sort of deal has been arranged between the opposition and the government is mostly irrelevant. What we are interested in is finding out what exactly is in the best interests of our constituents. Given that we have a cognate debate on nine separate bills and that you are now in the process of applying the guillotine to them, I consider that to be a gross infringement on the opportunity for members to make a contribution on behalf of their constituents. Mr Reith-They will still be able to make a contribution .",59
169,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Yes, but you know very well what I am talking about. By making that sort of interjection and some of the silly comments you made in your speech, you give good cause for people to become exasperated with this process. Why would you bother? You do not even believe the debate is necessary, do you? In essence, debate to you is an unnecessary waste of time. Debate to the government and to the executive is an unnecessary waste of time before getting the legislation implemented. In actual fact the contributions of all Anthony, L. J. of the people in this chamber, including the government members, are irrelevant because all the government is interested in is getting its legislation rammed through the legislature, Brough, M. T. through both houses. It is little wonder why people feel cut off Cobb, M. R. and divorced from the process when they can see their own representatives sitting almost impotent when involved in a serious set of legislative debates, as we are to be involved with this afternoon and this evening. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No.2] is another important bill. At least two members of the government have indicated that they intend to cross the floor. I, for one, would be very interested in hearing their contributions. We know that the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) have both indicated their serious concerns with this bill. Nehl, G. B. I, for one, as a member involved in listening to debate would like to know exactly what is causing these troubles. I would like to hear in depth the reasons for the positions that they have taken. In essence, we are being asked with this guillotine motion to cut back the time for debate on a very important set of bills. As a member of this place, I want to indicate my opposition to the motion. I am very disappointed that the government has chosen to move such a motion at this early stage in the spring sitting.",59

I move this motion so that those members who had indicated their intention to speak on these bills will have some opportunity to do so. Members should be aware that the only reason that this guillotine motion has been moved today is that the opposition advised that, unless we had a debate and a motion and a vote on the TCF matter, they would not * allow us to obtain passage of the tax billswhich is one of the more absurd and feral and stupid things that they have done in the time that they have been in opposition. NA Yesterday the opposition said that they felt that it was an inappropriate time for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to move a motion introducing his republic plebiscite bill, so we said that we were happy to have it moved today. We were happy to have it moved today, but when the opposition takes the view that they are going to do all in their power to prevent the passage of the tax bills, which forces us to the guillotine motion, obviously we are not going then to say, 'Not only will we allow you to waste our time, we will give you more time simply at your beck and call.' This is one of the more absurd and extreme cases of the opposition being unprepared to sensibly manage the business of the House. We do not and have not moved guillotine motions, except in the most onerous circumstances. These nine bills are obviously important. Maybe members of the opposition have failed to notice a recent High Court decision. Maybe they are of the opinion that we can just let time go by. If we were to play your silly games, you would not have us ringing you; you would have Bob Carr ringing to complain that you, by your absurd and juvenile tactics, were preventing the sensible passage of important legislation to undermine the revenue of the state of New South Wales. We have had fine entertainment this afternoon. The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has accused the government of the most dastardly motives. I have been called a rat, I have been called incompetent, I have been called all my favourite nicknames. I have been called everything under the sun. I must say that we enjoy the banter, we enjoy the to and fro. We enjoy seeing the struggle of opposition. What those opposite have to understand is that in March 1996, the Australian people went to the polls and voted for the coalition to manage the affairs of this country. When they so voted, they invited us to manage the affairs of the House. We have the Manager of Opposition Business on a long leash. Today he is struggling and straining a bit. Ultimately, it is the government that determines the program and management of business in the House. We will therefore determine that today we will do the tax bills which need to be done. I commend this final motion to the House. With a bit of luck, this will be the last one for the day.",62
175,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Cunningham) (5.58 p.m.)There are actually two elements of this motion that has been put forward today. The first is that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has suggested that the legislation before us is critical legislation that requires a guillotine be applied. It is so critical that a High Court decision handed down two weeks ago requires that this legislation be put in place, that the financial relationships between the states and the Commonwealth",63
176,Unknown,PAIRS,Honourable members interjecting,63
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Hollis)Are the microphones turned on?,63
178,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,There are two elements to the motion before us tonight. ,63
179,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,Only because you are bit slow. The first is that the Leader of the House claims that these are the most significant pieces of legislation dealing with stateCommonwealth financial relations arising out of a High Court decision that have come before this parliament for a long time. He is right.,63
180,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,It was a great decision.,63
181,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Because that decision was taken by the High Court-and, as my colleague the member for Banks says, it was the right decision-they are going to allow debate only until 9.30 p.m. tonight on one of the most important matters touching on tax and customs to come before this parliament. The second element of what the opposition is proposing is that there was a deal done with the Leader of the House whereby the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)-not a backbencher, not a frontbencher--could come forward and in five minutes put forward a private member's bill. I cannot recall--certainly not in my tenure in the seat that you now occupy, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis-an occasion when a Leader of the Opposition was denied an opportunity to bring a private member's bill before the House. As the member for Hotham has already outlined, the deal was done because of the circumstances of yesterday. It was considered inappropriate that a bill dealing with referendums and constitutional change with respect to a republic should come forward on such a day. We agreed. The Leader of the Opposition agreed to come in today and put his private member's bill before the House. The member for Flinders, the Minister to for Workplace Relations and Small Business, agreed to that. He said that that deal would be done-it was a core deal-and that the Leader of the Opposition could come in here today and present his bill. Now he has turned around and it is not a core deal anymore. It is not even a non-core deal. There is no deal. It is a deal that the Leader of the House can quite obviously rat on with no afterthought, no compassionMr Reith-No guilt.",63
182,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"or no guilt, as he says, because he believes that these pieces of legislation, significant as they are, need to be brought in quickly-yet he is only allowing a couple of hours debate. I say to Leader of the House, 'Have a look at the clock. If you had let the Leader of the Opposition come in here this afternoon and make a five minute speech on his bill, my guess is that we would have been up to the third or fourth speaker in the debate on this legislation.' We were quite happy to allow that to happen. The deal had been done-a five-minute contribution by the Leader of the Opposition and then we would go on to this legislation. You wanted it through tonight. We said we would agree to that. We had no problem with that at all. We had come to an arrangement to limit the speaking time of members on our side. Mr Leo MCLeay-Not any more.",63
183,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Not any more, as my good friend the member for Watson says. There will be no more deals on this because you broke the deal. The five-minute speech by the Leader of the Opposition should have been on nearly two hours ago. This has all happened because of your inability to manage the government's business. This is only the second week in this sitting of parliament. We have another six weeks to go and you are putting guillotine motions Prime Minister (Mr Howard) meant when he said he was going to improve standards in the parliament? You have to be kidding. The Leader of the House should know better. He sat in here in the past and did exactly the same. (Time expired)",64
184,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Let us first get the facts straight. The issue causstituency ing conflict between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) is not whether or not the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) could put before this House his bill on a plebiscite for a referendum on a republic but that the Manager of Opposition Business also wanted a debate and a vote on TCF tariffs which, of course, is an issue still in the hands of the Productivity Commission. Demands were made on both. Mr Kerr interjecting",64
185,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"The member for Denison chooses to interject, as he frequently does, in an inane fashion forgetting the fact that he is in opposition. I will quote the Leader of the Opposition when he was the manager of government business. He said in this placeand this is on the record- 'If you have got the numbers, you may as well use them.' From time to time, but not often, we are prepared to learn from you. We have the numbers and you know it. You may as well cop the medicine when you are so silly. What have you done? Over there you are still telling yourselves that you have taught us a big lesson, but I see that you have more people listed for this debate than we have so you have lost more speakers. I presume you had something to say, but there is some doubt about that because this is a matter of substance and you get into a bit of difficulty on matters of substance. Mr Crean interjecting",64
186,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"The member for Hotham got all his training at the factory gate and he has never forgotten it. When in government and now in opposition he has never been able to stand up in here and do anything but rave and shout. He also thinks he is dealing with a group of people of similar intelligence-it does not matter what they are told, they will on. Is this what the believe it. On this side we tend to analyse what you have to say. We know what you say is mostly rubbish. We also know that everything you get up and say is in direct contradiction to what you used to say on this side of the House. We know all about your TCF debate. You want to try to convince your own conthat you did not let them down with your tariff policies. Why did you introduce tariff cuts? You did it because you did not have the courage to confront your bosses in the ACTU and bring in some sensible labour reform that might have allowed employers and employees to combine to save their jobs and protect Australian industry in a truly competitive way. You chose the blunt instrument of tariffs because you did not have the guts or the capacity to make the changes where they were needed. Mr Crean-You'd know all about the blunt instrument, Iron Bar.",64
187,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"You were the blunt instrument of tariffs. We have been through that argument so many times. If I thought you were in much trouble in your electorate, I would actually give you an authentic Wilson Tuckey iron bar to auction. So do not think you could ever worry me with those comments. I got $2,000 for the Eagles by giving them one. Try some other interjections that have some strength. Mr Crean-That one gets you in every time.",64
188,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Well, I have given you the answer. The reality is that you are worried about the debating time when you have never used it to good value in this place. You are misrepresenting your position because you did a deal with the Leader of the House and then you broke it because you wanted to add a bit to it. You thought you were back at the union table. You had a small victory and you thought, 'While we're there, we'll add a bit more.' That will not work in here because you have not got the votes. You have not got the votes and you look weak and silly because all you have done with your little tactic and caper is deny your own people the opportunity to speak on this issue. But that is probably not too much of a loss to the parliament, because most of you would not have had anything to say anyway. I would like to say that I totally support the move to guillotine these issues on the simple grounds that they are important to guarantee the revenues of the state governments because of the High Court decision. The reality is that the discussion of this legislation has got to finish today. The opposition thought they could do a bit of a deal on this important issue because they thought they had a little bit of strength. The reality is that they have lost for themselves, but they are not going to be entitled to deny the passage of this legislation-legislation that is so important to the revenues of the state governments. (Time expired)",65
189,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The iron bar man has joined the axe man. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is the seconder for the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). Here we have the complete thug of the House, the person who has never known any protocol, the person who has breached confidences. He has come in here to support the Leader of the House ratting on a deal that would have seen the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) move a motion. The member for O'Connor actually asked us to get the facts right. Let me, because I have got a more reasonable Deputy Speaker in the chair, talk about what this issue is about. The Leader of the House said that this has been caused because we want to debate the TCF issue. Too right we do. You have got it in one, but we are not the only ones who want to debate the TCF issue in this House. I will tell you who else wants to debate it. The member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) wants to debate it. Remember her? She was heralded into this placeMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: politeness would require of me that I first thank the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham, for admitting the whole basis for this afternoon, but he is not therefore entitled to debate the substance of the TCF matter. On that basis, Mr Deputy Speaker, you should rule him out of order.",65
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Hollis)There is no point of order. The debate will continue.,65
191,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Here she is, the member for Lindsay. Speaking in the chamber yesterday, she said: Mr Speaker, do you like my suit? It actually cost $60 down at Spring fields in Penrith. This is the person who gets a $60 suit and a $3,000 computer. This is the person who says that the price of tariffs does not matter to the Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. This is totally unrelated to the motion before the House. It is a complete diversion. All the member for Hotham is doing is wasting the time of the House in this debate. He is continuing with a line of argument that is absolutely unrelated to the motion. Therefore, I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to rule him out of order.",65
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is no point of order. As I understand it, this motion deals with a whole range of customs, taxation and excise duties legislation. I call the member for Hotham. Mr Reith- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",65
193,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"That point of order has been ruled on, Mr Deputy Speaker. Sit him down. They do not know what I am going to tell them next. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker",66
194,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,No.,66
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I call the Leader of the House on a point of order. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order, in response to the ruling that you have just given, is to say that nowhere within any of these tax bills before the chamberwhich are the subject of this motion-is the question of tariffs in respect of textiles, clothing and footwear impacted upon. All of these bills, Mr Deputy Speaker, relate to the recent High Court case.",66
196,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Come on, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have ruled on this. With the greatest of respect, I am entitled to a say in this place, Bradford, 1. W. even if they do not like to hear it.",66
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"It has been quite a wide-ranging debate. There is some substance in what the Leader of the House has said. Nevertheless, if the honourable member for Hotham can bring his comments more into line with the legislation in the motion, he can continue.",66
198,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I take your point. The simple fact of the matter is that we have got this motion before us in the House because they ratted on a deal. It is as simple as that. They said today that the Leader of the Opposition would be able to move a private member's bill on the republic, and they broke that deal. Now they want cooperation from us for the rest of the session. Well, they ain't going to get it. It is as simple as that. Unless the Leader of the House changes his attitude and apologises for ratting on this deal-unless he changes his position or they change him-there will be no further cooperation in the way we conduct the affairs of this place. He has a responsibility not just to govern for his side but to get cooperation from us-whether he likes it or not. What we have got is the ridiculous position where what would have taken five minutes and been finished at 10 to five is still being discussed an hour and a half later-all because of your stupidity, all because of your stubbornness, all because of your arrogance and all because of your preparedness not to get us to cooperate.

200,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is a great pity that we have spent two hours getting to this point because we could have had an adequate debate on this legislation as well as on other important matters to do with textiles, clothing and footwear and the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) concerning the republic. PAIRS The House is considering a very complex and important series of bills in this debate. They are the Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (General) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, as well as the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 and three franchise fees bills-the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1997, the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1997 and the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. We are critical of the handling of these issues by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I will come to that a bit later. The opposition intends to take a constructive and responsible attitude to this legislation. Indeed, the government's guillotine was entirely unnecessary. We have always intend1997 ed to, and still intend to, support its quick passage through this House. It is Labor's intention to support relaxation of the cut-off rules in the Senate to allow swift consideration of this legislation in the other place. As members may be aware, this package of 1997 bills has been made necessary as a result of the High Court's decision. We are proposing to implement the temporary Commonwealth safety net taxation arrangements which were announced by the Treasurer on 6 August. The need for these proposed new arrangements has arisen from the decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases which were handed down by the High Court on 5 August. Those cases considered the constitutional validity of the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987, a New South Wales piece of legislation, which prohibited persons, under penalty, from selling tobacco, whether by wholesale or retail, without a licence. These licences are issued on application for periods of up to one month. The licence fees, payable prior to the licence period, were $10 plus 100 per cent of the value of the tobacco sold in the month two months prior to the period of the licence. For example, the fee for the month of August 1997 was payable at the end of July 1997 and was based on sales which occurred in June 1997. The question at issue in the cases was: does the licence fee constitute an excise for the purposes of section 90 of the Australian constitution? The first part of section 90 states: On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive. The first condition of section 90-that is, the imposition of uniform duties of customs-was achieved back in 1901. From that time onwards, the Commonwealth has had the exclusi ve right to levy customs and excise duties. The plaintiffs in these cases claim that the New South Wales statute breached section 90. New South Wales, which, in tum, had the support of all the other states and territories, submitted that the licence fees were not duties of customs or of excise within the meaning of section 90. The specific argument which the states put forward was that the term 'duties of customs or of excise' does not cover all taxes on goods but merely duties imposed respectively on the importation or the local production or manufacture of goods. That submission sought to reopen issues which had been decided in previous cases on the basis that incorrect reasoning had been used and that that reasoning had then been followed in later cases. Specifically, what the states were arguing was that the extension of the definition of excise to include taxes on the distribution or the sale of goods was incorrect and that that ought to be reviewed by the High Court. The High Court did agree to reopen the issues. However, four of the seven justices found for the plaintiffs and therefore against the states, thereby invalidating the New South Wales legislation and, by extension, the legislation of the other states and territories concerning licence fees for tobacco. Whilst not certain, that decision probably meant that the court would strike down the licence fees on petroleum and alcohol as well. The revenue threat to the states and territories from these decisions is estimated at around $5 billion in 1997-98, which is around onesixth of the state's own source revenue. So we are obviously talking about a lot of money here. The only options for the states were to either recoup the threatened revenue from other tax bases or request that the Commonwealth use its power under section 90 to collect the moneys, effectively as an agent for the states, and to pass on that revenue to the states. In relation to the Commonwealth's temporary response, state and territory leaders unanimously requested the Commonwealth to utilise Commonwealth tax bases to collect the revenue that was formerly raised by the business franchise fees and to remit that money to the states and territories. The Commonwealth agreed to do so. The issue of the Commonwealth stepping into the breach is complicated by the fact that the states and territories have imposed their own business franchise fees on differing bases and on differing rates. That is something that the Commonwealth cannot do, of course. The constitution limits the Commonwealth to imposing identical taxes across the whole nation. As a result, compromise rates have to be struck and a complicated formula devised to equitably share the revenue. The Commonwealth has announced increases, firstly, in the level of customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.lc per litre; secondly, in the level of customs and excise duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram; and, thirdly, in the rates of wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent except for low alcohol wine which will not be affected. These bills are seeking to implement the announced increases. The Commonwealth has stated that these measures will be reviewed within a six-month period prior to permanent measures being decided upon. In the area of small business, to ensure that the increase in the wholesale sales tax rates does not detrimentally affect small business, the small business exemption and the quarterly remittance regime, which both provide greater assistance to small business than the normal administrative arrangements, will be calculated with the additional tax on alcohol being excluded. The opposition's position is that these small business adjustments are appropriate, and we will be supporting them. In relation to revenue collected, the total revenue raised is estimated to be around $6 billion. This is obviously substantially more than the lost revenue for this financial year of $5 billion. We have not seen details provided of the revenue from each of the increased tax measures on the basis that the financial impact on the Commonwealth will be nil. This is not sufficient reason to not inform the House of the amounts estimated to be raised.",67
201,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m to (Quorum formed),69
202,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The government, in bringing in this legislation, has actually said that the High Court's decision on business franchise fees means that we need to have a GST. They say, 'This legislation isn't enough to fix up the problem. What we actually need is a GST.' Let us have a look at their credibility on that. We go back to a doorstop of John Howard, when he was Leader of the Opposition, in Tweed Heads. The transcript of the interview reads as follows: JOURNALIST: So you've left the door open for a GST now, haven't you? HOWARD: No, there's no way a GST will ever be part of our policy. JOURNALIST: Never ever? HOWARD: Never ever. It's dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election. JOURNALIST: Were you misquoted in today's Australian newspaper, then? HOWARD: Well, any suggestion that I left the door open is absolute nonsense. I didn't. I never will. The last election killed the GST. It's not part of our policy and it won't be part of our policy at any time in the future. JOURNALIST: If the concept of the GST comes up in the polls ... would you go back and revisit that area, or look at it again? HOWARD: No ... No, because we are against it. ... It is absolutely out of the question. Mr O'Keefe-He couldn't have said that.",69
203,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No, that is what he said back in May 1995. He did not think that doorstop interview on 2 May 1995 was enough. On the same day he put out a press release which said: A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australia. The Treasurer, who has introduced these bills, said in the Weekend Australian in November last year: What I don't agree with is the view that's been put in some circles that tax reform means GST. I honestly think now it's receded from consciousness it's been invested with some snake oil qualities. It has certain advantages but you wouldn't want to 8 p.m. over claim it. They're at the margin. As recently as January this year, the Treasurer said at a press conference: When you say ""chorus of calls"", a chorus of calls mostly from people who were chorusing the calls in 1993, when they included us, and when the Australian people said no. The many business organisations that were supporting this in 1993 are supporting it today. This is not a sea change. I've stood in RSLs and bowling halls all across the country when I was part of the chorus and the Australian people made their decision. What you saw in relation to that was when people think about it carefully, and when they had the opportunity to think about it in 1993, they made their decision. Mr Ross Cameron-What's the point, Kelvin? Let's get to the point. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio}-Order! I remind the honourable member for Parramatta that you are not in your seat. You cannot interject unless you take your allocated seat.",69
204,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Treasurer continued: The punters, when they were asked in an - pen - n? fair election said no. We Said we wouldn t revISIt that area: we won't. What more can you say? Yet they come back to the parliament suggesting that what we need now is a GST and that this High Court decision has thrown the nation into chaos, it has thrown federal-state relations into chaos and that the only way of fixing it is via a GST. What we have here are bills that propose a great increase in Commonwealth receipts-in excess of one per cent of GDP per year-and there needs to be a full accounting of the estimates of the revenue effects of each decision. I would ask that the Treasurer or the parliamentary secretary provide details to the House of the estimated receipts flowing from each of the measures. All revenue raised, less the Commonwealth's administrative costs, will be passed on to the states and territories. The opposition supports this approach as there is no j-st-fica­ tion for the Commonwealth to benefIt fmancially from the High Court decisions. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 was amended in this House last week, with opposition support, to facilitate the passing on of the revenue to the other jurisdictions. Identified proportions of the separate revenue streams are to be handed back to each jurisdiction. In turn, the states and territories have the responsibility of making payments back to producers and distributors to ensure that businesses and consumers are not detrimentally affected and so no windfall profits are made by the governments. It is in this final phase-the reimbursement of businesses-that the whole response to the decisions has been badly mismanaged. The High Court decisions did not come out of the blue. Everyone knew the potential gravity of the decisions and the timing of the judgments. Accordingly, there is no excuse for the chaos that reigned after the temporary Commonwealth arrangements came into effect. The potential for this result had been known years earlier. Indeed, the former government had considered the issue back in 1993. There is no doubt that the Treasurer should have formulated detailed contingency plans with the other jurisdictions prior to the decisions and those plans should have been capable of immediate implementation. Apparently, little if anything was done beforehand, which is a damning indictment of the judgment of the Commonwealth Treasurer. The issues are apparently still not resolved. In the area of tobacco, there is the likelihood of a significant hike in the price of a packet of cigarettes in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The Financial Review of 27 August reports that these three conservative state governments had boycotted a recent meeting between the Commonwealth Treasury officials and industry representatives to try to sort out the confusion. What a fantastic vote of confidence that is! The industry estimates that the new regime could result in increases in cigarette prices of between 84c and $l.75 per packet. Consumers are entitled to ask: why on earth has this happened? The Commonwealth Treasurer has assured the public that they will not be detrimentally affected, yet there may be substantial price hikes in some or all of the three commodities affected. Something has gone very wrong. That something is the lack a preparedness of the Commonwealth Treasurer. The Prime Minister has used the High Court decisions as a reason to introduce a GST. The opposition absolutely rejects this proposition. We believe that the botched implementation of what is a relatively minor change, compared with that if there were to be a GST introduced, is an indication of the absolute chaos that a GST would involve. We have already had the Victorian Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, reported in the Age on 14 August as complaining that profiteering was occurring and that the liquor industry was using the High Court decisions to rip people off. If a very conservative state Treasurer is prepared to attack business in thi.s way, it indicates that the huge changes which would be inevitable under a GST would involve enormous costs to consumers over and above those which flow automatically from the imposition of a new tax. Some businesses will attempt to profit from confusion. The temporary package before the House involves only three goods and involves a situation where the taxpayers are already in the system. Where the confusion affects every good and service in the economy, it is obvious that consumers are going to be vulnerable in a huge way. In addition to affecting the current and future revenue of the states and territories, the High Court decisions have opened up the possibility of past licence fee payments being reclaimed by taxpayers. This would severely damage the fiscal position of the states and territories. (Quorum formed) The Commonwealth's management of this High Court decision, which they should and could have seen coming, was absolutely appalling. The states had a dreadful time trying to get the issue resolved. For example, the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, wrote to Prime Minister Howard asking him to take over the negotiations on federal-state tax reform from Mr Costello. Premier Borbidge said, 'As usual, Mr Costello is not being much help. He can't help himself-it's a personality problem.' It was so serious that the Queensland Premier wrote to the Prime Minister seeking his intervention to try to get the issue resolved. Mr Martin-Didn't the Prime Minister ring him about that?",70
205,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I think the Prime Minister was somewhat less than impressed. The situation on Friday, 8 August was such that alcohol retailers had to warn of big price rises, and cigarette manufacturers had to suspend trading as, to quote the Financial Review: . . . confusion escalated about the Federal Government's plan to bailout the States after High Court struck down $5 billion in State franchise fees. Both the hotel and tobacco industries were seeking urgent meetings with the Federal Government last night about how the plan could work. Victorian retailers were concerned about it. The National President of the Australian Hotels Association said: ""There is an immediate need for the Federal Government to revisit ... their taxation plan as State governments are utilising the new measures to increase taxation by stealth."" CUB said they had 'reluctantly adopted the federal government directive to increase the wholesale cost of beer by 15 per cent'. They expressed concern that, unless systems were quickly in place to reimburse retailers, many would be forced out of business. Both W.D. & H.O. Wills and Philip Morris suspended sales. That happened on Friday, 8 August. A few days later a Sydney crisis meeting of state officials ended in deadlock with the Premiers forced to make the kinds of remarks that Premier Borbidge made about the Treasurer. The issue was appallingly handled and it was one the federal government had plenty of time to see coming. The situation with this legislation is such that the High Court decisions could result in past licence fee payments being reclaimed by taxpayers. This would both severely damage the fiscal position of the states and territories and provide a windfall gain to the taxpayers as the licence fees have already been passed on to consumers. To overcome what would be a manifestly unfair result, the three windfall tax bills in the package will impose a 100 per cent tax on any refunds of tobacco, alcohol or petroleum licence fees originally paid before 5 August where the refund arises because the licence fee is unconstitutional. There is also the question of commercial distortions. Apart from the other issues that I have identified, this is a significant commercial issue arising from these bills. The use by the Commonwealth of the excise tax base instead of the wholesale sales tax base is expected to significantly affect the profitability of the three tobacco producers. Estimates the that the opposition has received from an analysis by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and the Allen Consulting Group indicate that moving from an ad valorem or value based system to a weight based system of taxation for tobacco will change profits significantly for the three domestic manufacturers. Estimates in fact are that Philip Morris will lose around $5 million per annum in profits, Wills will lose over $31 million and Rothmans will gain around $36 million per annum. The actual effect will probably be greater now, given that the total amount of taxation being imposed on tobacco is being increased by around $500 million per annum. The Treasurer acknowledged this issue in his press release of 6 August. However, the government has done nothing to ameliorate the effects of the decision. The opposition seeks an assurance from the government during this debate that the switch to excise will not result in job losses in this industry. In our response to the High Court decisions, the opposition indicated that there are four principles which we need to be assured of to facilitate the passage of this legislation-the revenue package. We need to be assured that it has the agreement of the states and territories, that it fairly distributes the revenue states and territories, that it does not involve extra taxes being imposed on Australians and that it is equitable in its impact on the businesses immediately affected. The first two conditions have been met by the temporary Commonwealth response. We are concerned, however, that the Commonwealth has been less than competent in ensuring that consumers and businesses are not detrimentally affected. I made some remarks earlier on about the fact that the government wanted to use this High Court decision as justification for its proposal to introduce a GST. Setting aside the remarks made in the past by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer categorically ruling out a GST and saying, 'We will never ever have a GST' - the Treasurer described it as snake oil-nevertheless, the opposition is now required to participate in a debate over the introduction of a GST. Our position is simple: we believe that there are fundamental equity problems with a GST and that imposing such a tax on all items of consumption is inherently regressive. The higher the GST, the more unfair it is. A flat rate GST is unfair. The situation with existing wholesale sales taxes is that luxury goods, such as furs and jewellery, are taxed at a higher rate of 32 per cent and luxury cars are taxed at 45 per cent. What the coalition wants to do with a GST is to introduce a single rate of tax so that the furs become cheaper while school uniforms become dearer. It is inherently regressive to have a GST and the equity problem is not capable of being solved. You have a 'compensation now' problem in that no-one can be guaranteed that he or she wilI not be worse off at the outset. You have a compensation in the future problem in that no-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off down the track. You also have massive problems for small business. This government promised small business that they would have red tape reduced by 50 per cent. Instead, with a GST, they will become unpaid tax collectors and the amount of red tape will escalate dramatically. With wholesale sales tax, there are only around 75,000 registered tax collection points; to the with a GST you would have one million additional taxpayers registering and having to remit GST on a regular basis. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (8.24 p.m.)-I rise tonight in support of these franchise bills made necessary by the High Court decision on 5 August in two cases where the states' right to levy a tobacco business franchise fee was found to be invalid. Discussion of the customs and excise power has had a long history in the High Court. Contrary to what the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) was saying, the answer is probably to be found in the constitutional convention which has been proposed by this government and opposed by the opposition in the Senate. Certainly in 1901, when the Federation was first proposed, section 90 of the constitution gave the Commonwealth exclusive power over customs and excise taxes. This section has been disputed a number of times in the High Court. First was in 1904 in Peterswald v. Bartley. This was the first time the High Court examined the constitution's prohibitions on the states imposing an excise duty. In that case the High Court adopted a narrow interpretation of excise duty by deciding that licence fees imposed by states on breweries were not actually excise duties. Under that narrow interpretation, excise duty was a tax specifically on the quantity or value of goods produced in the states. States could therefore apply a tax on goods which did not discriminate between goods produced within the state and goods produced outside the state. In 1926 was the petrol tax case, Commonwealth v. South Australia. In that case the High Court ruled that a South Australian tax of 2.5c per gallon on sellers of petrol was invalid, despite the fact that some of the petrol came from overseas, some from Victoria and some was produced within South Australia. Again, under section 90, which prohibited the states levying customs and excise duty, that was disallowed. In 1927 there was a newspaper case where the High Court ruled that a New South Wales tax on newspapers published and sold in that state was invalid on the grounds that it was an excise duty. In 1938, in Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board, the High Court ruled that a levy of $2 per half acre on land planted with chicory was invalid. In 1949, in Parton v. Milk Board (Vic), a levy of O.lc per gallon imposed by the Victorian Milk Board on sellers of milk who were not the original producers was declared to be an excise and therefore invalid. Gradually over time you can see that the definition of excise was expanded to not just the production of goods but every stage of the distribution as well. Then in 1958, in Dennis Hotels v. Victoria, the High Court ruled that the temporary licence fee based on sales during a permit's duration was invalid. But they did allow a slight loophole, if you like, in that the annual licence fee based on sales during the previous 12 months was held not to be an excise fee and therefore was held to be valid. A number of cases, including State of Western Australia v. Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd and Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v. Tasmania, followed that. In the Dickenson's Arcade case, the High Court upheld tobacco franchise fees, as it had upheld the liquor franchise fees in the Dennis Hotels case. Finally, we come to the case of Ha and Hammond v. NSW, the decision that was handed down on 5 August from the High Court. In this case they went back and reassessed the Dennis Hotels case. They found the licence fee, which includes a set amount plus an amount calculated by reference to the value of tobacco sold during the relevant period-and 'relevant period' was defined as the month commencing two months before the commencement of the period in which the licence expires-to actually be an excise and therefore invalid. In the majority decision, their Honours stated: Duties of excise are taxes on the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods, whether of foreign or domestic origin. Duties of excise are inland taxes in contradistinction from duties of customs which are taxes on the importation of goods. Both are taxes on goods, that is to say, they are taxes on some step taken in dealing with goods. This decision has severely hampered the ability of the states to raise funds. An enormous amount of the states' revenue did come from what have now been defined as excise duties which for a number of years states imposed. It raises the problem of whether states that have previously imposed taxes in this fashion may be-quite validly-requested to refund those funds to the franchisees. The development of federation is interesting in that the situation we have today requires a constitutional convention. It really is not so much a discussion about whether we will have an Australian head of state or not but a discussion on such things as section 52, the powers which were given to the Commonwealth. Richard Court, in his paper 'Rebuilding the Federation', is certainly opposed to any further attachment of powers to the Commonwealth over and above what was given to them in federation. The reality is that that has not happened. Since World War II, the High Court has consistently expanded the Commonwealth's powers. With the Fraser Island mining case, the Franklin Dam and now Mabo, the powers of the Commonwealth have expanded, and the definitions in the constitution have certainly brought a lot of things to bear within the Commonwealth's legislative jurisdiction. One key element underlying our constitution is the separation of powers-judicial power, legislative power and executive power. It is something that anyone attending this constitutional convention should bear in mind in the very fine balance that is given to our legislative process in these interpretations by the High Court. If that is to be disturbed in any fashion, it does require very considerable and in-depth thought, because it has these sorts of consequences that we are trying to amend today. When the Capital Duplicators case was being heard in 1993 it was felt that the High Court might disallow all business franchise fees in that case. Some emergency legislation was put into place. In fact, that legislation has just been resurrected and put into place here. Certainly it is something that you could have done with a bit of cooperation from the state governments. You would note that it was the Labor government in New South Wales that actually had the greatest difficulty in coming to any agreement with the Commonwealth on how to remedy the situation. In fact, the Carr government in New South Wales had been paid over $130 million in business franchise fees that they expected to pay from 6 August when this legislation comes into effect to the end of the year. It was going to be not only a windfall gain but a double whammy for the hoteliers in New South Wales. After much protesting, Bob Carr very reluctantly agreed to refund that money. The reason he was so reluctant to do that was that he had blown out the New South Wales budget enormously. New South Wales, of all the states, is heading for fiscal crisis by the mismanagement of a-wait for it-Labor government. It is quite amazing that he can willy-nilly increase his current expenditure and throw away any responsibility for fiscal balance or any of those pre-election promises that they so graciously make but disregard and do not keep. I have had experience of the way that they look after minor interests. Shortly before the by-election in my electorate they miraculously found money which had not been budgeted for, for a tollway promise, to refund a couple of million dollars to the tollway users of Sydney. It was not to lift the tolls, mind you, but to give them an incredibly complex paperwork exercise that they could go through in order to get the votes in Western Sydney. Fortunately, that did not work. Obviously, since it was not budgeted for, it was a recurrent expenditure. The people of Western Sydney could see that it was just adding to the budget deficit. They realised that eventually they would have to pay for that, and they have paid. They have paid for it with a pokies tax. They have paid for it with a bed tax. They have paid for it with a new land tax. They have paid for it with a jump in the stamp duty on car and home insurance. They have paid for it with the doubling of parking taxes. Mr Eoin Cameron-And by death tax. Miss JACKIE KELLY-And, as the member for Stirling quite rightly interjects, death taxes. There has been a suggestion that we should even have death taxes. So they are here just raising the taxes on the people of Western Sydney willy-nilly as they go around the countryside spending money. Then, 'Whoops-a-daisy, we have to pay back $130 million because we did not get it quite right in the High Court. We are terribly sorry, but you cannot have that back.' It is absolutely ludicrous. The member for Wills is worried about the extra money that might be raised by putting an even tax right across all of the states and territories. He wants to be assured that of the $4.9 billion raised by these fees amongst the states-when an equal tax right across all of the states will raise $6 billion for the Commonwealth-$l billion will go back to the states. Between six states and two territories, I suggest that the amount would be something close to that $130 million that Bob Carr wants to rip off the hotel and liquor licensing bodies. The member for Wills also seemed to suggest that-guess what?-the GST might be an answer to this problem. When you look at that, between 1993 and 1996 the Keating government increased the indirect taxes in wholesale sales tax by 60 per cent. He mentioned a 32 per cent wholesale sales tax on luxury items. Do you want to know what those luxury items are, Madam Deputy Speaker? They are colour television sets, clock radios, wall clocks, wristwatches, cameras and film, poker machines and pinball machines. They are basically staple, ordinary, standard of living items for the people in Western Sydney. That is the standard we aspire to in Australia. We do not expect that sort of provision to be called a luxury tax, but we will pay 32 per cent wholesale sales tax on that. The other great joke is the other level of tax-the 22 per cent level of wholesale sales tax. We are paying that on our laundry powder, soap and liquid, pre-wash, fabric softener, soaker, stationery-writing pads, school exercise ruled pads, paper and pens-hand tools, power tools, garden hoses, paintbrushes, lawn-mowers and batteries. Hang on a minute: that is a tax at 22 per cent on the people of Western Sydney. Thank you very much, Mr Keating. The 12 per cent wholesale sales tax is put on food, which a majority of people in my electorate spend a substantial proportion of their salary on, such as ice-cream, biscuits, lollies, fruit juice, cordial, flavoured milk and instant flavoured milk. Other items taxed at this rate include garbage cans and bags, paper plates, dishwashers, driers, stoves, airconditioners, toasters, electric jugs and kettlesluxury items, are they?-baby baths, baby bottles and cleaning sponges. Indirect tax has been a Labor favourite. They love it. They have used it not only in federal government but also in state governments. They do it all the time and they wish to say, 'But we don't do that sort of thing. Vote for us. Trust us. We don't do that.' And what do you know, when they get into power, bingo, there is an indirect tax. Check it out. It is a bit like the Labor Party saying, 'We don't sell things. We oppose the sale of Telstra. We will not sell that.' We go to the electorate and say that we will sell Telstra, but the Labor Party say, 'No, we oppose privatisation. We will not do that,' and they propose the $25 billion sale of Prospect Electricity. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-I remind the member for Lindsay that I have allowed a wide-ranging debate because there are nine pieces of legislation here. Telstra is not here. You must come back to the debate before the chamber. Miss JACKIE KELLY-It is very important to realise why this legislation has been necessary. The reason comes back to the constitution and to how these taxes were invalidated in the first place. It is something that we must remedy by looking at a constitutional convention convened with people who are acceptable to the Australian parliament. They must be convened in a way which does not cost more than what a fully-fledged compulsory poll would cost. We have got a very balanced team going into this constitutional convention. These are some of the things they need to consider. Certainly looking at who mayor may not raise taxes, be it Commonwealth or state, is very relevant to this debate. It is crucial to this debate. The people of western Sydney have experienced a number of broken promises in previous elections by Labor governments. They said that they would not act in a certain way and they said, 'No, it is only the Liberal governments that would do that.' Well the Liberal governments come with clean hands to the people and say, 'We will. We will. We will,' and do directly. Quite regularly, Labor say, 'We will not privatise,' and they sell Qantas, Prospect Electricity and an enormous number of things. They also say, 'We won't implement indirect taxation,' and, 10 and behold, there is an enormous amount of indirect taxation going on. We are basically saying, 'We will crystallise it for you.' We have this enormously complex set of legislation before the House at the moment which is trying to find a balance for taxation. It is quite extraordinary that New South Wales raises $539 million from petroleum franchise fees and Queensland raises nothing. If that is not a preponderance of evidence as to why people would rather do business in Queensland, then I do not know what is. New South Wales raises $871 million from tobacco business franchise fees and Queensland raises $501 million. New South Wales raises $282 million from liquor and Queensland raises $131 million. New South Wales also raises $8 million from gas and Queensland raises nothing. The distinction between the states in terms of these indirect taxes is quite noticeable, especially between Labor and Liberal states. This legislation unifies those taxes. It applies them levelly across all of Australia. That tends to be the way that the High Court has been directing and the federal government has been heading over the past decades in terms of federation and where our federation is heading. There is a definite advantage in having this taxing power in the hands of a Liberal federal government, where you are assured that things will not be raised surreptitiously at two o'clock in the morning. It is here in the of a responsible government, not in the hands of Bob Carr's government where he could, willy-nilly, whenever he finds himself of money to pander to minority groups slip an extra tax on tobacco, liquor or petroleum. By and large those taxes are the ones hit the people of western Sydney the most. about that. Per capita we have more smokers. Per capita we drink more. Per capita we use more leaded fuel, whilst the wealthier suburbs can afford unleaded cars. Guess what? The western suburbs get it again. I think this is a very important package of legislation. I think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has done an excellent job in circumstances with the New South Wales Premier. I commend the bills to the House.",71
206,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (8.42 p.m.)Like you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I had a little difficulty following exactly what the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) was covering in her contribution and how it related to the package of franchise bills that are before the House. She should remember that the opposition has signalled intention to support the legislation for simple fact that we too understand the constiCommonwealth tution, we understand the decision handed down by the High Court a couple of weeks ago and we understand that there is need to redress the problem that emanated a result of these decisions. I accept that she has every right to defend her own constituency of the western suburbs of Sydney, but I think she should also reflect upon the simple fact that the Commonwealth government also takes its fair share of those tobacco taxes, excises on fuel and so on that she claims hit her constituents. She also should reflect on the fact that, in successive budgets levied by her own government, we have seen $1.5 billion slashed out of the health budget in Australia and a pretty sizeable proportion of that in New South Wales. We have seen the cost of pharmaceutical benefits increased by this government. We have also seen a decision taken by this government to cut out completely the allocation of funds under capital works programs for public housing. As I recall, having been hands to the honourable member's electorate of western Sydney, there is a fairly substantial number of people who live in that sort of short accommodation. She should talk to them in about this government's proposals to ensure that market rents are levied on housing that commission homes and see how they feel When it then comes down to the discretionary income that they might have for the cigarettes, the alcohol or going to the Panthers club and pulling the old one-armed bandit or pushing the buttons, then come back here and talk to us about the effect that these sorts of decisions are having on the people of the very difficult western suburbs. The sorts of constituents that the honourable member for Lindsay represents in western Sydney are exactly the sorts of constituents that I represent in Wollongong. I know that their reaction to the Howard-Costello budgets of the last 18 months is one of absolute horror. They know that decisions like the ones fee we are debating tonight in this package of bills have been brought about because of the its simple fact that for a long period of time the there have been arguments raging between and state governments about that was the distribution of funds. During the contribution by the last speaker, a the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is as at the table, and I were having a small chat about its not mattering which government happens to be in power in Canberra, because, irrespective of that, every time a Premiers Conference is held or every time there are conferences to discuss matters dealing with vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth in terms of the distribution of revenues gathered by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states, the states of New South Wales and Victoria often complain the loudest. They maintain that the distribution of funds to their states is absolutely out of kilter and out of balance with the population and the requirements of those states and that there is overcompensation for the less populous states of this country. To be fair to the Attorney-General, that was not his view and he provided me with some statistics about his own state of Western Australia. I respect the comment he made in respect of his own state, but I think it is important to remember that one of the elements which should emerge as a consequence of this decision of the High Court, as a consequence of the need to bring this package of legislation before the parliament tonight and as a consequence of both sides of the House agreeing to give it swift passage, is the simple fact that it is time for an examination of the issues surrounding Commonwealth-state financial relations. The Labor Party is not afraid to do that. Much has been said about taxation reform and my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) talked about the implementation of a GST or consumption taxes of some sort-because at the end of the day the sorts of taxes we are embracing in this legislation are consumption taxes. The Labor Party has never been afraid of embracing the concept of taxation reform. I have got to say that in 13 years we did a little bit of it. We did a touch of it. When we came into government in 1983 the top marginal income tax rate was 60c in the dollar. We dropped it to 47c. The bottom marginal tax rate was 30c in the dollar-for the sort of people that my friend the member for Lindsay purports to represent-and we dropped it to 20c in the dollar. We did a little bit more in terms of taxation reform on the way through as well. Yet she comes into this place and stands up and claims that all we have ever been concerned about is broadening the income tax base by increasing, in some way, some of those indirect taxes which exist through the sales tax mechanism or the wholesale sales tax mechanism. Indeed, some of that may well be right, but in terms of an equity argument we maintain that that sort of approach has been fair and reasonable. As I said, the legislation which is with us today is something which touches not only questions of sales tax, but also two customs bills: the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997. The purpose of both of these is to increase the rate of customs and excise duty on certain tobacco and petroleum products. As indicated, it has arisen because of the decision taken in the High Court in the matter of Ha and Hammond and Others v. State of New South Wales. This was a High Court case, of course, that people saw coming for quite some time. The member for Lindsay, using her legal background, traced some of the previous constitutional law issues which had arisen in respect of this. So it should not have come as a surprise that, when the High Court finally did hand down its judgment in respect of these matters, the Commonwealth was going to have to bring legislation into fix up the particular issue which had subsequently evolved. As we have indicated, that is not an issue that we have a problem with. We are quite happy to support that. There are a couple of matters of a very minor nature, I think, that are going to be suggested as an amendment, but I think that will not prove to be a difficult issue for either side of the House to deal with. I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has come in and applied a gag to this legislation-probably some of the most important legislation we will deal with in the parliament this year. This government has decided to gag any discussion on it and not to give the opportunity for a full, frank and thorough examination, whether by those on this side of the House, by government members who might want to speak, or indeed by some of the Independents who have an abiding and ongoing interest in taxation issues, particularly my good friend the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). But I did want to conclude by saying that the honourable member for Lindsay should be reminded of the fact that the government of New South Wales that she complains so much about was forced to introduce the HAC tax amendment back in 1996-that was the Howard-Costello tax amendment-because of the problems created for that state by this government's approach to taxation issues. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J. A. Crosio)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the bill has expired. The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

NA (IMPOSITION) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 August, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",76
207,Mr ROCHER,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"One of the more significant implications of the recent High Court decision, aside from the obvious one of guaranteeing an even greater degree of vertical fiscal imbalance in our federation, is the removal of yet another safeguard to responsible state government. I have said in this place on many occasions that there can be no real fiscal responsibility in Australia unless governments are made accountable for the taxpayers' money which they have responsibility for and which they spend. In removing the states' responsibility to impose franchise fees on tobacco, and by association fees on petroleum and liquor, the High Court has eroded further the checks and balances on the power of both the state and federal executive governments that are necessary to maintain their accountability. The decision to impose a national uniform income tax during the 1940s signalled the beginning of the end, and the dominance, as it turned out, of the Commonwealth in revenue raising ability. Since then federal governments have continued to become increasingly prescriptive in state activities through resort to tied grants, despite having no constitutional responsibility for the state programs. The High Court decision of 5 August 1997 has provided the state Premiers with the opportunity to now push for a thorough recalibration of the federal-state compact. The Western Australian state government alone stands to lose something like $600 million or 20 per cent of its annual revenue because of the ruling on the franchise fees. While there appears to be agreement on the part of all governments that the states will not lose out in pure revenue terms, they will unarguably become more dependent on the Commonwealth for funding. Amendments to the relevant state sales tax bills will see wholesale sales tax on alcohol rise by a uniform 15 per cent. The existing Commonwealth sales tax of 22 per cent on beer will therefore increase to 37 per cent, while wine will now be subject to a wholesale sales tax rate of 41 per cent, rather than the current levy federally of 26 per cent. This will bring all states into line with New South Wales, which presently has the highest rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages. Increases to the rates of customs duty on tobacco and specified petroleum products will be brought about by changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments will see the duty on petrol increase by 8.1c per litre to a standard 42.7c per litre in all states and territories. The most significant price increase will be on tobacco, with customs duty increasing from $84.27 per kilogram to $251.27 per kilogram. Overall, however, Treasury has given a commitment that no state's revenue will be worse off. Furthermore, the coalition has taken steps to ensure that the increases in wholesale sales tax will not have a detrimental impact on current small business exemptions from sales tax. Presently, if a small business has a sales tax liability that is less than $10,000, then it is exempt from this impost. Many of these small businesses will in future find themselves exceeding this threshold due to the 15 per cent hike in the rate of sales tax on alcohol. The government is right to exclude the additional sales tax when calculating the total tax liability of these small businesses. Similarly, I support the move to ensure that the increase in sales tax on liquor does not force small business over the quarterly remittance threshold. To oblige small businesses to pay monthly would create additional compliance pressures for the very group to which the government has promised relief. The final safeguard for taxpayers in this bill is the amendment that has been moved by the government in relation to the credits on alcoholic beverages. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of this bill has expired. The question is that the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 August, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Rocher-Madam Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Standing orders require that you do call a non-government member on a second reading debate; I respectfully put that to you for consideration. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-The honourable member for Stirling had indicated that he wished to speak on the bill; his name was down. I am well aware of the standing orders and I will call the honourable member for Stirling after the honourable member for Curtin.",78
208,Mr ROCHER,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"It has been suggested that business might be hit by additional compliance costs due to the originally proposed credit restriction, to which I referred just a while ago, and the government has moved quickly and properly to eliminate this restriction. While it is becoming increasingly unlikely that the government will fulfil its promise to reduce the paperwork burden on small businesses by 50 per cent in its first term, at least it will not add to the regulatory nightmare in this instance. Another protective measure in this legislation relates to the taxable value of goods. Schedule 1 of the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 sets out what appears to be a fairly straightforward calculation to ensure that the taxable value of alcoholic beverages does not change. As a result, any rebate or refund made by the states to a sales tax payer on alcohol will not diminish the taxable value of the goods. This is an important measure, because it will prevent a loss of revenue to the states and territories and is therefore supportable. The Premiers have cried foul about the recent High Court decision, but the states have been complicit in the development of the vertical fiscal imbalance that now pervades our federation. They too must shoulder some of the responsibility for the unenviable situation in which they now find themselves. BILL 1997 The Fraser government's Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Bill 1978 empowered the states to increase their revenue from personal income tax or to give a rebate on personal income tax to residents of a particular state. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was then Treasurer, had this to say during the debate on the new taxing arrangements back in 1978: This bill ... (aims) at restoring a proper distribuquestion tion of powers and functions between the federal, state and local spheres of government, with governments more responsive to the needs and preferences of the community. The government believes that this approach offers the best protection against concentration of power in Canberra. He went on to note: These arrangements (will) replace the old system of handouts with one in which the concept is sharing of tax revenues. ... The states have received what they have been seeking for many years-a share of income tax revenues. In short, the legislation would have given and enabled the states more authority over their own revenue and expenditure-the very thing that commentators, and the states themselves, today lament they do not have. It is worth remembering that not one of the state premiers took up the opportunity. Not one of them by Mr Miles: was prepared to take on the responsibility of appropriating by income taxation more of the money they were spending. Opponents of the 1978 bill suggested that they were precluded from introducing state income taxes because of already high levels of personal income tax. It is true that taxation burden imposed then by the Commonwealth on ordinary PA YE taxpayers had grown well beyond the role envisaged for it by those who drafted the constitution. However, it is equally true that the states opted not to commit to fiscal restraint and budgetary reform by becoming increasingly on the basis ofresponsible for raising the revenue that was required to cover their expenses. Concern is now apparently being expressed that certain states are dragging their feet putting in place the framework for the form reimbursement of money from franchise fees. The Commonwealth has sought to occasion. expedite this legislation and to help the states come to terms with their undesirable predicaorder. ment. However, the states now have to help themselves. The ball is clearly in their and I mean no pun in referring to the Western Australian Premier.

209,Mr FILING,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"How did we get into this revenue mess? The states were acting unconstitutionally, the Commonwealth knew of the dangers and everyone waited until the High Court made the decision the and then threw their hands in the air. Mr Williams-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are in a situation where, applying the practice of the House, the non-government side of the House will speak. The previous treatment of the bill having been Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Corsio)-I remind the Attorney-General that the honourable member for Stirling did not in jump.

210,Mr FILING,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"In 1995, I listened with great courtinterest to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) talking about the problem of vertical catafiscal imbalance faced by the states. She of showed then that the past decade had witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by Commonwealth to the state and territory the governments. Commonwealth own purpose The outlays rose by 11 per cent from 1983 to 1996 whilst total payments to the states and territories dropped 22 per cent as a proportion of government outlays. This cut in revenue share was exacerbated by an increase in the proportion of tied grants. The member for Mackellar termed it as an abuse of section 96 tied grants, and I agree. Labor reduced the states' share of funding and simultaneously removed their flexibility in determining how their funds would be spent. In supporting the member for Mackellar at the time, another current coalition minister, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), reminded the Keating government that: The Commonwealth Government has long forgotten that it is merely the trustee of income tax and excise revenues paid by Australians and that it is not giving to the States its own bounty. It is the trustee of this money. The States have responded to the challenge by increasing their own revenue sources from 39 per cent in 1982-83 to 49 per cent a decade later. The states saw themselves with little option other than to try to escape section 90 of the constitution, maintain their dependence on state charges and licence fees and a share of revenue from casino gambling. As a former member of the coalition I moved a motion on Commonwealth-state revenue sharing in 1994. At that time, I asked the simple question of the then Labor government: who is fiscally more responsible and better able to spend the hard-earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services-the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend towards centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services. This country needs governments to get closer to the people of Australia not further away. It needs to get closer to the people that governments are supposed to serve. States like Western Australia, which have led the way in micro-economic reform in this country, have consistently adopted tight fiscal policy in recent years and yet they are not able to get the services which they require funded by the central government. This should be extremely worrying when you consider that the services that state funds are targeted at are real community services such as health, education and law and order. The unfortunate thing is that the coalition are also culpable because they have had 18 months in government in which to start the reform process and have done nothing but make it worse. What we are seeing from the Howard government is a transition from Keating to more of the same. Despite the promise of the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), on revenue sharing, the states have been further punished for fiscal responsibility in light of the Labor government's deficit. The coalition have increased the conditional nature of states grants. We now see that revenue is dependent upon meeting national competition policy merely guidelines and making a contribution to the federal government's coffers to help recover from Labor's mismanagement. I think that the coalition should seriously question this approach, as the people of the Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria will. They have all done their part by struggling to overcome Labor's fiscal vandalism to return their states to productive membership of the Commonwealth and for their troubles they get less federal funding. Unless the states can be given a reliable expectation that their revenue base is reliable and will expand adequately to meet the legitimate expectation of Australians who live within their boundaries, they will continue to be driven to raise more and more of their own income. This will not help the issue of tax reform in this country, rather it will further complicate it. I am concerned that this central situation",80

213,Mr ROCHER,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"Any reform of the Commonwealth-state fiscal relations must be dealt with thoroughly. There were five principles that characterised the make-up of the Fraser government's 1978 bill, to which I have referred earlier. This first stipulated the need for uniformity in taxation rates between the states and a system that was administratively simple and cost effective. The government of the day also indicated the need for a system that minimised the opportunity for tax minimisation and evasion and one that would be convenient for all taxpayers. The final consideration sought to give legislated arrangements that were free of any significant constitutional doubt. It seems to me that everyone of those standards remains valid and should be pursued by government in the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-state agreement. In 1989, the former Labor government repealed the Income Tax Arrangements with the States Act 1978. During the debate the then Treasurer, a well-known centralist, Mr Keating, said: The opposition's proposal to give the states taxing powers would put all that achievement at risk. He went on to say: Handing the states taxing powers would merely provide them with the wherewithal to fund increased expenditures, claiming back to the public sector the area vacated by the Commonwealth. Australia just cannot risk leaving this act on the books. I rejected the then Treasurer's comments at the time, and I reject them now. If we have states, we should give them proper power over their own finances and they should accept the responsibility that goes with that, but they have been loath to do that on the few occasions they have had to correct the imbalance. At the same time, the states must demonstrate a level of financial responsibility and political accountability that is commensurate with the powers which I have referred to and which they should have. In closing, I wish to make clear my understanding that neither the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia nor the Retail Traders Association in Western Australia has a concern about the content of this bill. However, it is often the way that deficiencies in legislation are not uncovered until they are operational. I will be monitoring carefully the implementation of these amendments and will certainly pursue any related matters if the need arises.",82
214,Mr FILING,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"Moore) (9.08 p.m.)Obviously, the aim of this legislation is to protect the current revenue base of the states and territories. Its concept is to replace state taxes declared invalid by the High Court with Commonwealth equivalents and to prevent people claiming back what was gathered illegally by the states. The aim of the Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill is to protect an estimated $5 billion worth of revenue which has already been allocated in various state budgets; otherwise, significant supplementary funding would be required from the Commonwealth if the massive failure of state programs were to be avoided. The limitation on the Commonwealth rescue of state revenue is that the Commonwealth cannot levy different rates of tax across the states. This means that states would levy greater differing rates of excise tax for the same goods. The Commonwealth is obliged to tax all states at the top rate for each commodity and attempt a system of refunds for those commodities whose tax rate has increased from the particular state rate to the top rate. This relies on the states participating in the refund. It makes the scheme more complicated and unwieldy and would attract management costs for both the Commonwealth and the states. The effect is that the Commonwealth will have to impose Commonwealth taxes at specific rates, and we have discussed them already. This is a short-term fix with a caveat that the government intends reviewing it in six months. There is no sundown clause. The government does not want one because it is happier with an open-ended situation which may compensate for delays in obtaining state cooperation or other unforeseen difficulties. There are problems with the concept behind this legislation because of the retrospective effect of the windfall tax and the complication of the arrangement arising from the requirement to levy equal rates across the states but also ensure that no taxpayers are worse off. The federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been placed in a position where he accepts and announced that, 'Constitutionally, they'meaning the people who paid these taxes'are entitled to their money back from the state government.'",82

217,Mr FILING,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"As I said earlier, this legislation is a short-term fix. There are problems in the concept behind this legislation because of the retrospective effect of the windfall tax and the complication of the arrangement arising from the requirement to levy equal rates across the states but also to ensure that no taxpayers are worse off. The federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been placed in a position where he accepts and announced that, 'Constitutionally, they'meaning the people who paid these taxes'are entitled to their money back from the state government,' but in the next breath he announced that he would legislate to deny them their constitutional rights. This has been coming a long time, yet we still seem ill-prepared for it. I can remember advice to members in 1993 in the wake of the decision in the High Court over the ACT trying to tax X-rated videos. We were told then that these state excises on alcohol, tobacco and petroleum were in trouble and were likely to be struck down. I accept that the government must act quickly and I understand that its view is that this course is necessary as a short-term solution. But even the thought that it will be in place for as long as six months should be of great concern to all members of parliament and all Australians generally. The decision by the High Court is a dramatic confirmation that the taxation and revenue raising system supporting government and the manner in which it is disbursed is totally out of control and operating in a fashion that was never intended by the framers of our constitution or those of us who have had the opportunity to amend it through referendum. I have listened to people saying that this legislation is necessary because of a ruling by the High Court. It is clearly not the case. This legislation is necessary because the states have been acting unconstitutionally and the 1997 High Court has acted in accord with its duty. What worries me is that the Commonwealth sees no problem in introducing legislation to circumvent the constitution. What I would have expected to see in the government's response to this crisis in state revenue raising was a statement of its objectives on a restructuring of the revenue sharing relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. After all, I recollect the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing on 6 June 1995: . . . a Coalition government will allocate a fixed percentage of tax revenue to the States and wind back the proportion of disbursements taking the form of tied grants so that the States will be able to decide their own priorities and stand accountable for them by the people of those States. . The coalition has a policy to reform the Commonwealth-state revenue sharing arrangements and announced it over two years ago. I would have expected that some inkling of its objectives, in light of this revenue crisis, would be announced now. This would take pressure off the government, which sees as its only answer to legislate a loophole to overcome the intent of the Australian constitution. Such a statement would also give the states an indication of their future revenue base and the manner in which they should plan to appropriate funds for the future. Instead we have in front of us a set of bills which sets a process in place to perpetuate something which was found to be illegal. We are told it will be reviewed in six months, but we see no leadership displayed on the matter of where we are going with this. I mentioned earlier the problem of states revenue and in particular the greater and greater reliance on casino gambling incomea matter that is of particular concern to me. I notice at the table the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is a member of the Lyons Forum and would share my view that the burgeoning of casino gambling as a source of revenue for the states is a matter of grave concern to all Australians, and it is a matter that is exacerbated by this sort of legislation. When you speak to ministers in the state governments-as I have spoken to ministers in the Western Australian government-you find that they now see revenue from casino gambling as an integral part of state revenue. Of course, they see it translated almost directly into the sorts of services that states are obliged to provide to their citizens-the core, fundamental services that states view as being integral to their duty and service to the community. It is a matter of grave concern that, on the one hand, the states are providing these services and, on the other, they are relying more and more on revenue from casino gambling, which generates the sorts of social problems such as gambling dependence, bankruptcy, crime, drug trafficking, money laundering and even the withdrawal of money from the legitimate economy of the state.",83

221,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"The bill before the House proposes restricting credit claims on alcoholic beverages to the extent that credit relates to money which the Commonwealth would have passed to the states and territories. That is done to prevent the Commonwealth from being out of pocket. It is noted in the explanatory memorandum that concerns have been raised about the compliance cost impact of the proposed credit restriction in that it may leave some taxpayers out of pocket in some circumstances-for example, where damaged goods are returned to the supplier and a refund is given. In light of these concerns, the government has indicated that it intends to remove the restriction on credits and that is in the amendment before the House. The government will be relying instead on the states grants mechanism to ensure that only net amounts of additional sales tax on alcoholic beverages are passed to the states. The opposition would regard that as a sensible amendment in all the circumstances and will not be opposing it. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, be agreed to.

223,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (9.22 p.m.)The debate on Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] is a continuation from last night. Many of us, certainly on our side of the parliament, wanted to see the sitting time extended because the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) was going to contribute. We were all very interested to hear what he was going to say, particularly about schedule 3 of this bill, which deals with the sugar industry . We all know that the honourable member for Kennedy has a particular interest in sugar. We know that the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) similarly has an interest in sugar. We would like to hear from both of those honourable members on their position. As I mentioned, the legislation goes more broadly than simply talking about sugar. Last evening my friend and colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) put the opposition's view very clearly in respect of that particular issue. What he said was that there was a belief, and I think a justifiable belief, that the issues surrounding the passage of this element of the legislation were in fact contrary to what the government had previously said. It was contrary to what the government believed was necessary and probably, dare I say, contrary to what they had taken to the people of Australia, particularly in sugar seats, when they told them what was going to happen should they be elected. What we have seen for Queensland sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen for northern New South Wales sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen generally is an unhappy mix as a result of the decision taken by this government in respect of this matter. It more broadly fits into the whole issue that is raging in Australia at the moment about industry assistance. It goes more broadly to the way in which tariffs and customs schedules might be applied to industries where it is considered that a particular status should continue to be enjoyed by those industries in the hope that we will not see massive job losses. We on this side of the parliament embrace those issues. We believe that whilst economic issues need to be considered when examining these matters so too must social consequences of decisions that are taken. I again cannot help but reflect upon decisions taken by the present government when forced to adopt Labor Party policies and principles in respect of the car industry. We all wait with bated breath to see what they are going to do next in terms of textiles, clothing and footwear. They have nailed their colours well and truly to the mast in respect of this element of the bill tonight, and I am talking of course about sugar. The member for Kennedy has indicated he supports Labor. He has indicated he supports this element ofMr Katter-That's going a bit far, Steve.",85
224,Mr FILING,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,That's drawing a long bow.,86
225,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No; I can remember being in an ABC radio studio in Sydney one day with the honourable member for Kennedy. He rode in on his horse. He had the big tengallon hat on. We sat in the comer while we waited to go in and talk to Mike Carlton. We talked about economic rationalism, but he convinced me that he was certainly not an economic rationalist. He said that he was in support of what Labor had been talking about in relation to the protection of those industries on which it was considered a social emphasis needed to be placed whilst at the same time ensuring that economic efficiency principles were applied. What the member for Kennedy said to me was that Labor was embracing this very thrust of policy. He thought that he was very close to the Labor Party on this. In fact, the conversation was so animated with my friend that Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I must take a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented. The honourable member is stretching the bow a long, long way. I was addressing the policies, not the party.",86
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)The honourable member for Kennedy will get the call next. I am sure he can rebuff anything the honourable member for Cunningham has said, and I am sure he will do so. There is no point of order. The honourable member for Cunningham should not provoke the honourable member for Kennedy.",86
227,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No, indeed I will not. In fact, the last comment I wish to make about the honourable member was in respect of the final part of the conversation we had. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested in this coming as you do from the mighty Illawarra, like me, and representing coal mining constituencies. The honourable member for Kennedy was recounting tales of glory when he played football against John Maitland, the national president of the miners federation, and what a close camaraderie they had and the sorts of political dialogue and discussions they would sit around and have, and he said that even to this day they do much the same thing. Again, on issues like coal mining and sugar the honourable member for Kennedy has very similar views to Mr Maitland, the president of the miners federation. I know Mr Maitland. If your views are close to Mr Maitland's, then you will certainly be voting with the Labor Party tonight or tomorrow or whenever this legislation comes to a vote because his views are the views that we are espousing. There are a couple of other matters I want to raise associated with this customs legislation. I refer particularly to a couple of the schedules dealing with our relationship with Canada. I am referring as well to information technology agreements, which my good friend the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) would be vitally interested in, and also tariff changes due to AAT decisions. I very quickly would like to comment on each of those. The opposition is not opposed to those amendments and will not be prolonging any debate or division in this place in respect of those issues. But we will be prolonging the debate on the issue of sugar, and we flag now that the issue of the sugar tariffs will be subject to our opposition. Schedule I of the legislation before us is an administrative change. When the Customs Tariff Act was rewritten in 1995, a small number of editorial errors were revealed. As a consequence, there are some changes that are necessary there. All Customs documentation used since the commencement date of the new act-that is, 1 July 1996-quoted and used incorrect listing and rates of duties in a particular area, and as a consequence these changes will be put in place. Schedule 2 of the legislation goes to the bilateral trade agreement to which Canada and Australia are parties. It is called CANATA. Under this agreement, both countries allocate each other certain trade benefits. In 1995, Canada gave sugar from certain developing countries similar benefits to those received by Australian exporters. As sugar accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's exports to Canada, this decision had a serious impact on our trade. I am sure honourable members would reflect upon that very carefully. The then Minister for Trade, my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), advised the Canadian government that Australia intended to remove the CANATA rates of duty from Canadian imports of petrochemicals, namely, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters. In 1996, the incoming government reviewed the previous government's decision, and ministers Fischer and Moore decided to implement the withdrawal of the concession. The five per cent margin of preference has been withdrawn since I January 1997. Again, this is a sensible move. It is part of the bilateral trade arrangement between the two countries and, as I have indicated, the opposition will not be opposing that. I have referred already to the issue of sugar. The member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson will, I am sure, both be made welcome on the opposition side of this chamber when the vote is taken on this bill, as will, probably, a number of their colleagues. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) was also reasonably vocal. I can recall seeing a document that the honourable member for Richmond signed up to in the election campaign. He said that he would never ever support reductions of the sugar tariffs. A funny thing, that-the words sound a bit like the sort of spiel of our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with respect to a GST, 'Not ever. Never. No new taxes.' The honourable member for Richmond signed up to that. We have seen the documentation, we have seen the signature and we believe it is his. Accordingly, we would like to see him join the member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson on the opposition side when this issue is put to the test. Of course, it is all subject to the pressure that people like the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), and others will be trying to bring to bear on these people of conscience as they vote to support something which is right. People like the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) will also have a hand in that, I am sure. Mr Andrew-Free spirits?",86
228,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Free spirits in the National Party? Are you kidding? The Information Technology Agreement is another element of this. As I indicated, the member for Bonython has a great interest in this. This agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by 1 January 2000. The agreement was signed by Australia on 13 March 1997 and has 41 signatories, which account for 92 per cent of world trade in these products. Australia stands to gain substantially from the ITA. Exporters of electronic components, office machines and telecommunications equipment to the European Union, Canada, the United States and Asia will benefit from the tariff eliminations. It will ensure greater certainty of access through commitments to bind tariffs. The ITA will boost employment in this industry sector, which currently employs 30,000 Australian workers. The tables of tariff subheadings detail the tariff subheadings and goods which are affected by this legislation. It is worth pausing at this time to reflect on the fact that the Goldsworthy report was handed to the government in recent weeks and talks about the technology industry in this country. It talks about a whole variety of matters associated with government incentives to try to give substance to and support for industry. Most members would probably not attitude be aware that, in terms of technology, tralia is the second highest technologically advanced economy in our region; second only to Japan. As we look to the next century, as we look to job opportunities that might be provided for Australians, as we look at age and see where it is going to take us and as we see technology supplanting manual labour in so many other industries in this country, I think it is instructional that we should give some credence to and considerthe ation of the Goldsworthy report. As a consenext quence of that, of course, any agreements that are going to be signed between Australia, European Union and other countries will allow us to take a great deal of economic benefit from any trade arrangements that are put in place. put in place. I mentioned also that tariff changes due AAT decisions are included in this bill. They go to the issue of surgical drapes, lamps in chapter 85, power supply units for computers and, in each one of these cases, certain classithe fications and duties applying are reviewed a result of AAT decisions in respect each of those matters should be classified. Again, the opposition signals that it has no problem with this at all and wishes it speedy passage through the parliament. Finally, schedule 5 reviews the international model of the WCO, which has a six-digit tariff. The difficulty is that Australia has added a seventh digit and an eighth digit to enable the application of different rates of duty to different goods within the international six-figure tariff. On 1 July 1998, the duty rate on some of these sevenand eight-digit tariff subheadings in the textile, clothing and footwear section of the tariff will phase down to the same level, making the need for these subheadings redundant. The amendments in this schedule amalgamate them and this will simplify the tariff and make classification of goods easier. Where separate trade statistics are required by industry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will provide statistical splits to gather the data. On that specific matter, dealing with TCF, this we signal that we would like to reserve our at some time in the future if, in fact, Austhis government decides to implement the recommendations on overturning some of the proposals contained in the Industry Commission's report on phasing down tariff support for TCF. We will have to wait to see how that will work. I know that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) will be watching that the computer with some interest. We have signalled our intention to support the TCF industry. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) met with representatives of TCF industries the· other day. Over the three days there will be representations by a number of representatives of cities right the around this country, whose TCF industries will be in dire straits should the decisions recommended by the Industry Commission be We are urging the government not to allow that to happen. We are urging the government to to continue its support for the Labor Party's principles and objectives in respect of industry policy. They did it for the car industry. We are giving the lead now when it comes to issue of textile, clothing and footwear. as And, of course, we will continue to give the of where lead, combined withMr Crean-Will they combine on sugar?",87
229,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"You are pre-empting what I am going to say. We will continue to give the lead, along with the member for Kennedy, in respect of sugar. I come back to where I started in this debate to indicate that we oppose this schedule in respect of sugar. We know the member for Kennedy opposes this because he has been to his constituency and told the sugar producers, 'In no way, Jose, are we going to support this. No way will I, as an upstanding member of the National Party, allow this to go through.' I know he has been here talking to a number of his colleagues. The member for Dawson was here last night. She came to give comfort to the member for Kennedy as he was preparing his great speech on this, which is about to be delivered in the next four minutes. We are all waiting to hear that. I am not sure whether the member for Dawson is on the speakers list. If she is not, we will give her a spot so that she can explain to the sugar producers of DawsonMrs De-Anne Kelly-Check the list, Stephen.",88
230,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"You are on the list. That is good. We do not have to give up one of ours for you. You can tell the people of Dawson, just like you did on phase I of the reef tax, how you are going to support this issue. This will be an interesting and instructive example because, as I mentioned to the member for Dawson last night, phase 2 of the reef tax is going to be coming in towards the end of this year. The electorate of Dawson is vitally affected by this government decision, just as it is by sugar. She will have an opportunity to practise her response on the reef tax later tonight in the debate on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill because she will be able to tell us about the sugar industry. Let me conclude where I started. I indicated that the opposition does not oppose schedules I, 2 and 5. We certainly oppose schedule 3 in respect of sugar but not in respect of information technology tariff changes due to AA T decisions. The legislation before this parliament tonight is important, as it was last night. As I indicated, the honourable member for Burke went to a great deal of trouble to clearly set out why our party's position in respect of sugar is what it is. We simply say again to the government: we have laid out on this occasion, as we have in the past, a direction to be followed in industry policy. Do not let down those people whom you purport to represent. The member for Richmond has signed a declaration in his own blood that he will support the sugar growers in his own electorate. We would like to think that that is going to be adhered to when he gets an opportunity to speak, as he will just before the member for Dawson. We look forward to the contribution by the member for Kennedy. It is probably worthwhile getting an audience for him at some stage. I commend to the House those elements of the legislation which the opposition will support. Debate interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Defence Personnel: Northern Territory Elections",89

251,Mr KATTER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Kennedy) (9.49 p.m.)Although there are a number of reasons why a country has a tariff and why a country keeps a tariff, there are two outstanding reasons. The first is when you are competing against product that is subsidised. Sugar is a product that for various reasons is heavily subsidised throughout the world. If you are looking for the base reason to have a tariff, it is because you are competing against highly subsidised product which can come in from other countries. I believe profoundly the second reason that a country has to have a tariff is when it is competing against countries that pay slave labour wage levels to their employees. I will read from the Report to the President Publication 2276 by the US International Trade Commission in 1990. The US International Trade Commission 1990 Estimated Tariff Equivalents of US Quotas on Agricultural Imports and Analysis of Competitive Conditions in US and Foreign Markets for Sugar, Meat, Peanuts, Cotton and Dairy Products. The average subsidy for sugar in Japan for the years from 1986 to 1988 was 481 per cent. In the European Community the average is 193 per cent. The average for the United States-and I must pay them some tribute for honesty because this is a United States publication-is 175 per cent. In the international marketplace we find ourselves competing against countries such as Japan, that has a subsidy level of 481 per cent; the European Community, 193 per cent; and the United States, 175 per cent. None of these countries are exporters, with the exception of the European Community. The European Community is not only the biggest producer of sugar in the world but he also the biggest exporter of sugar in the world-at 7.2 million tonnes, with Australia second at 4.2 million tonnes. They are dumping a product with a subsidy tariff equivalent of 193 per cent onto the world's market. Tonight many of the members of this parliament are moving to allow that product, subsidised at 193 per cent, into this country completely unsanctioned. All I can say is that the rest of the trading nations of the world must simply laugh at Australia. I am deeply disappointed because, like so many people, I have such high hopes for the coalition government. When I heard our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say, 'No more nothing for nothing,' I thought at long last we were going to become, as we once were, a very aggressive trading nation. But, clearly, with decisions such as this, that is not to be. Let us look at the way other countries treat the World Trade Organisation. We recently gave $1,000 million to Thailand. As a result of the WTO, Thailand, which has had a complete ban on the importation of sugar, has decided that they will shift down to a quota, and they are allowing some 13,150 tonnes of sugar into the country. To put that into context, we produce some 20 million tonnes of sugar in Australia. So their idea of free trade is a quota of 13,150 tonnes of sugar. I do not know, nor do I understand, how Thailand can afford to have a subsidy level of between 80 and 110 per cent, but that is the figure quoted by the Sugar Corporation of Australia and various other bodies. I have no doubt that it is true. Thailand is one of the major players in the world export market today and will probably become a very strong competitor for Australia in the international marketplace. The other sugar producing countries of the world are based in Central and South America where wage levels are commonly around $4 or $5 a day . We are asked to compete against such wage levels of $4 or $5 a day. It is with great pride that I reflect upon the fact that, the main, the former Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland has been responsiblealong, of course, with the industry which deserves 90 per cent of the credit-for producing an industry that is competing on the world market against the tariff subsidy of 193 per cent. The sugar industry is set up in such an efficient way on economies of scale which are unrivalled anywhere in the world that we are able to produce this product. Recently in an article in the Australian newspaper, Malcolm Fraser, a former Prime Minister of Australia, singled out sugar and said, 'Europe is a country that should not be growing sugar. It is so totally non-competitive that it should not he growing sugar.' Yet, far from accepting or listening to the advice of a former Prime Minister of Australia, whom I think is writing very sensible stuff at present, we are going in the complete opposite direction. Those are the reasons for having a tariff. The reason for removing a tariff which we hear constantly from the economic rationalists in this place and in other places is to reduce the cost structures of Australian industry. I was a very strong supporter of that point of view until I saw how it had worked out in the petrol industry. We deregulated that industry and removed all the restrictions on the importation of petrol into this country. The net result was not a lowering of the price of petrol in Australia. In fact, what happened was that the price of petrol in Australia doubled. The price we paid the oil companies went from 121f2c a litre to 22Y2C a litre in exactly the same period of time that the world price of petrol, as all of us are well aware, dropped clean in half. So that was a magnificent success story! The oil companies were able to get away with 20c a litre which they were not entitled to. Their take doubled in exactly the same period of time as the world's price for oil dropped clean in half. If you multiply 20c a litre by the litreage in Australia, you come up with a very interesting figure of $6,000 million a year that that little economic rationalist initiative cost this country. One of the highly controversial areas at the present moment is the motor vehicle industry. in The very wise people who advise governments in Australia came out with the ORANI model. The ORANI model said that, over a 10-year period, there would be a 20 per cent intrusion of imports of motor vehicle and motor vehicle components into Australia. They were not far out! There was a 63 per cent intrusion over five years. That was just how staggeringly wrong the economic models upon which decision making in this country was based and is based right at this very moment. Not only is the philosophy and the implementation of that philosophy flawed but also the programming, figures and information that is flowing from the public servants who are responsible for advising the government are dreadfully and fundamentally flawed, the motor vehicle industry being a classic example. A 63 per cent intrusion over five years is an easy statistic to reel off, but that translates into a cost of $5,000 million a year to the Australian economy. At 30 jobs per $1 million, we have 150,000 jobs which have gone up in smoke as a result of that decision. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has come into the House. He is a great advocate of economic rationalism. He is one of the great architects of the philosophy which has done so much damage to this country. He should sit and listen. He might well get an education because, after listening to his speeches, I can assure him that he desperately needs it. The arguments for having a tariff in the sugar industry could never be stronger. The major world exporter has a 193 per cent subsidy. I emphasise they are not my figures; they are the figures of the United States government. The United States government freely admit that they have a tariff subsidy equivalent of 175 per cent. So I do not think we can accuse them of dishonesty in this case. There could not be a more cogent reason than the fact that we are up against slave labour wage levels from South America. The reason for removing the tariff is to reduce costs. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is also with us. I was very interested to hear him go into some detail on this tariff in one of his speeches. The ALP removed 60 per cent of this tariff; there is only 40 per cent of the tariff left the government is attempting to remove this evening. The member for Richmond produced figures to indicate that, when the tariff of some $60 a tonne was removed on a product of some $350 a tonne-so it was a very hefty reduction in the price of sugar-the retail price of sugar for the consumers in this country did not go down but went up. We should pay tribute to the honourable member for Richmond for pointing out that to the House and to the people of Australia. Let me move on: the reason that we are sitting here tonight allegedly is because the sugar cane growers of Australia want the tariff to be removed. All I can say is, 'Please do not go to a sugar meeting and vent that sort of viewpoint.' I did hear a senator from this place put that viewpoint forward at a meeting in Ingham. I spent most of the meeting looking for a telephone because I thought I would have to get a police escort to get him out of the meeting in one piece. Sometimes we people from North Queensland may not be regarded as particularly clever, but I can assure you that we are not such big mugs as to voluntarily go out and ask for a pay reduction of $4,000 per man per year. That is what this translates to-a reduction in our incomes of some $4,000. I understand it is much higher in New South Wales, where all of their sugar goes onto the home market. It is probably some $14,000 per year there. The sugar cane growers did not ask for the abolition of the tariff for any reason other than that the Hilmer gun was held at our heads. Whilst I do not wish to be churlish to the ALP-I am very appreciative of the fact that they are going to oppose this proposal-I must point out to the House that the reason we were placed in this invidious situation of a choice between deregulation or the abolition of the tariff was that the ALP passed the infamous Hilmer legislation and imposed that upon this industry and put the industry under great threat. It must be pointed out to the House why the sugar industry is placed under such great threat by deregulation. Unlike other products, sugar is a very cheap commodity per tonne. that In fact, growers get paid only around $30 per tonne for the product. If a grower is paid $30 a tonne for the product and the cost of producing that product is $22 a tonne-I think that would be correct-to cart the product 100 kilometres would cost $10 a tonne. I know this because we cart from Mareeba to Mossman at the moment, and that is the figure that is quoted there. So, if you add $22 a tonne for the cost of production and $10 a tonne for the cost of moving it 100 kilometres, you make no profit at all; in fact, you make a loss on the product. In other words, you cannot afford to put it in the truck and take it to the next mill. If we are deregulated, therefore we are placed in a monopolistic pricing regime because Australian farmers must take the price that is offered to us by the mill. No sane or intelligent person can impose upon an industry a monopolistic pricing regime. Yet that was the gun that was held at the industry's head and, on the basis of that gun being held at its head, many official representatives of the industry said they would prefer the tariff removal to deregulation, which would destroy the industry and most certainly place it under the control of a couple of big foreign companies very swiftly and we would be working for virtually nothing, as we have in days past. There is an argument against the position that people like me are taking here tonight from those who say that we are placing them in jeopardy because we could be forced up before the National Competition Council. I still have some belief that all politicians do not lie and that governments do not lie. The ALP in this House has said that regulation or deregulation of the industry is a matter for Queensland. The coalition in this House has said that it is a matter for the Queensland government. The ALP and the National Party and the Liberal Party in the state house in Queensland have said, 'No deregulation.' So deregulation is not on the table. As Senator Boswell has said on a number of occasions in the other place, we should never have made any decision to ask for the abolition of the tariff because deregulation was never on the table. I think Senator Boswell is correct, and I think deregulation has never been on the table. It is not on the table at the moment, so there is absolutely no necessity for us to abolish this tariff. Even if I were to accept that argument, it is history now that the Queensland Sugar Corporation is already charging on the home market only the world price of sugar. So the tariff value to the sugar cane farmers has already been removed. Whatever so-called benefits will flow on to the consumers-and, listening to the honourable member for Richmond, I think they are negligible-they have already flowed. That is past tense. All we are talking about here with this tariff is keeping foreign product, which is subsidised and produced at slave labour wage levels, from coming into this country. That is all we are talking about here tonight, because the value to the consumers is past tense. I do not think there is any value to the consumer but, if there is, it is already there because Australian farmers are no longer getting the benefit of the tariff. The Queensland Sugar Corporation, which sells more than 90 per cent of our sugar, arguably is already selling that sugar to the Australian refineries at the world parity price. So the benefit has already flowed. So the other reason for doing this tonight has been removed. Both reasons have been totally and completely removed and do not exist. I will move on and quickly recap the decisions taken by the economic rationalists in this place-whether it be the removal of tariff or the deregulation of industries. In the wool industry, we were enjoying an income of $6,000 million. It was the biggest export earning item. It was one-tenth of our entire exports. After it was deregulated, we were receiving under $3,000 million a year. So that decision cost this country, and is costing this country, $3,000 million a year. I do not want to heap too much praise upon the member for RichmondMr Latham-Oh rubbish! What sort of argument is that?",91
252,Mr KA TTER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I want on record that the honourable member for Werriwa, Mr Latham, has said that that is rubbish. If anyone wants to question his credibility, I suggest they go to the library and ask for the figures on wool. Then we will see how desperately inaccurate his interjections and hi's speeches are in this House. With the Hilmer reforms, the coal profits in Queensland accruing to the Queensland government will be removed. Those coal profits on the railway lines are over $1,000 million a year. I am sure that we will get a letter of thanks from the Japanese coal miners and the American coalminers, who are now going to make an extra $1,000 million in profit while the Australian people are going to lose $1,000 million. So there are two major export earning items. We have given $3,000 million to the world buyers of wool. We are about to hand over more than $1,000 million a year to the world's coalminers. In the field of gold, we thought it was a good idea to allow the free interplay of market forces-let them all have their play. Gold is going down in price; therefore, we will flog off all the gold. Don't worry about an aggressive trading stance on our second biggest export. Don't worry about this nation protecting itself and trading aggressively. Chalmers Johnson, in his very definitive work on the Japanese economy and why it has leapt ahead of the rest of the world such a huge margin, said that in Japan the industry department is not there the industry department is there to create production. About $2,000 million has gone in the gold industry because we believe we should have a level playing field that should be taxed as well. So those two little items cost us $2,000 million a year in that industry. The motor vehicle industry, I have already said, cost $5,000 million a year. The petrol industry cost us $6,000 million a year. So the likes Mr Latham have created for this country 26,000 indirectly. losses in five industries of $17,000 million a year, yet they still sit in this place and preach the same gospel to us. It has been a very sad day for me and the tobacco industry as a result of it being regulated. We had 340 farmers and we will soon have only 150 farmers. We had $50 is. million of income coming to Australia, now we will have only $30 million of income. Finally, I have an old-fashioned notion when you go into an election and make a promise then it is your duty to keep that promise. It is not with a great deal of pride that I read from page 32 of Reviving the sugar. heartland of 5 February 1996: A Liberal-National Government will: not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne as we have already met obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT '94) agreements. I deeply regret that those promises will not kept, and I gave them personally. I, anyway, have to keep that promise. How we can keep the tariffs in the car industry and take them away in the sugar industry and ask to have credibility with rural electors, I not know. (Time expired)",94
253,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Wide Bay) (10.09 p.m.)Australia's sugar industry is one of our great national industries. It has been a great contributor to our export income. It has been the fundamental lifeblood of much of coastal Queensland. Australia is the world's seventh largest sugar producing nation and one of the largest exporters of raw sugar. Australia produces in excess of five million tonnes of by sugar annually, with approximately 85 per cent of this being exported-and the proporto regulate; tion is growing. Queensland is by far Australia's largest sugar producing state, producing approximately 95 per cent of Australia's raw sugar and virtually all of our exports. New South Wales has a small industry and there is an emerging sugar industry now also in Western Australia. Queensland has about 6,400 cane farms, with us an average farm size of around 75 hectares. The Queensland industry employs approxiof mately 19,000 people directly and a further So it is an important industry. Any legislation that comes before this House that affects this industry is very important to Queensland, is very important to electorates such as my deown and is very important to Australia. The tariff affects only imports into AustralThere is very little sugar that comes into this country. I am advised that only $70,000 of tariff was paid last year. That fact was that reinforced in a recent letter from Mr Tony Gentile of the Australasian Soft Drink Association when he said: What they fail to mention is that the Australian food industry does not import either raw or refined The reality is that sugar imports are very limited at the present time. Perhaps the fundamental reason for that has been that our there is such vigorous domestic competition between the Australian refiners that the domestic price has slumped so low that nobe one would contemplate importing sugar into I think that this country. So, for that reason, the tariff has been largely academic. It has not come into play in then any significant way in the industry over do recent times. It is unlikely that it will do so in the future. It provides a comfort to the industry, but it has not in recent years had a significant impact on the domestic market. I find the Labor Party's attitude on this matter to be monumental hypocrisy. I cannot believe that we have Labor spokesmen, most of whom know absolutely nothing about sugar, coming into this House and feigning interest in the industry. If we look over Labor's record in the sugar industry, particularly their record in relation to tariffs, how can they come into this House with a straight face and pretend to be interested in protecting tariffs? Mr Deputy Speaker, are you aware of the fact that every single tariff reduction in the history of the sugar industry up until tonight has been made by the Labor Party? It is the Labor Party that abolished the sugar embargo. Prior to May 1988, sugar imports were totally banned in Australia. It was the Labor Party that lifted that embargo. At the time, they announced that they would introduce an ad valorem tariff of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar, both phasing to 15 per cent by mid-1992. The industry was appalled by this shock announcement by the Labor government. It was clear that the legislation was not going to pass the Senate, so eventually a compromise was reached and the government introduced a specific rate of tariff on imports of both raw and refined sugar of $115 per tonne from July 1989, falling to $95 per tonne in July 1991 and $70 per tonne in July 1992. The Labor Party were not satisfied with that. They did not even honour that promise. In March 1991, in their economic statement, they reneged on that deal and announced further reductions. The scheduled $95 per tonne in July 1991 became $76, and the $70 per tonne went to $55. That is Labor's record. They are the ones who have cut tariffs. How can they now possibly stand in this House and pretend to be the defenders of tariffs? But that is not all. Who was it that set up the sugar industry review working party that was required to look into the future of the industry? Yes, it was the Labor Party at federal level, and at that stage Queensland was unfortunate enough to also have a Labor government. They set up the review party. They chose the people to undertake the review. Then, one of the conditions of that review was that they had to look at the industry in the light of the national competition policy. Let me ask you: who invented the national competition policy? Who commissioned the Hilmer report? It was the Labor Party: Prime Minister Keating, Premier Goss and the other premiers, most of whom were Labor at the time. And who was it that accepted the recommendations and endorsed them? Prime Minister Keating, Premier Goss and the Labor Party. They were the people who endorsed the national competition policy.",95
254,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Honourable members interjecting,96
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The member for Wide Bay does not need the help of his colleagues. They will be silent.,96
256,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It was the Labor Party that commissioned the report. It was the Labor Party that appointed people to serve on that committee. Let us look at whom they chose. They chose people, I think, genuinely representative of the industry, initially under the leadership of Sir Eric Neal, who later went on to become Governor of South Australia and so could not complete the task, and Mr Bruce Vaughan was chosen to take his place. But on the committee were Ron Verri, chairman of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, and Harry Bonanno, chairman of the Cane Growers Association. Between them they represent every cane grower in Queensland. Farmers are all members of those organisations. Also, there were representatives of the Australian Sugar Milling Council, the Australian Soft Drink Association Ltd, the sugar industry review coordinator, and some public servants and the like-all people appointed by the Labor Party. But, when the report came in, it was a unanimous report. There were 74 recommendations, all of which were approved unanimously by the committee. The committee's recommendations were wide ranging and included some very significant matters of vital importance to the industry, such as the retention of the single desk arrangements on the domestic market. There are no other primary industries which enjoy that privilege, so that was a very substantial recommendation of the committee. They also recommended the retention of pooling and the assignment system-again, unique to the sugar industry and not generally approved of in other industries. Those are considered by the sugar industry to be fundamental planks to the future of their industry. But the committee, in one of its very early recommendations, also recommended that the tariff should be abolished from 1 July. The industry-those on the review committeeunanimously recommended that the tariff should go. I think that the sugar industry dealt itself a pretty tough card. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), said, the coalition went to the last election promising to retain the sugar tariff. I believe that promise could have been sustained, and would have been honoured, had it not been for the fact that the working party and the industry unanimously recommended that the tariff should go. What responsible government could talk to the industry leaders, listen to what they had to say, and then not do precisely what they had asked it to do? I know, and it is beyond dispute, that there are many farmers who do not understand the recommendations of their presidents and their leaders. There are many farmers who would like to retain the tariff. They see its comfort element as being important. They believe that it is a part of the protection that their industry would like to have. But the reality is that their elected leaders made a recommendation to the government, and it is therefore my view that the government has little option but to endorse that recommendation. To be fair to those leaders, they believed that they were delivering a comprehensive package of 74 recommendations. They made it clear that they did not want some adopted and not the others. They wanted the package adopted lock, stock and barrel. The Queensland government was quick to accept the working party's recommendations and to agree to the proposals that were put forward. The Commonwealth government has been much slower to respond and I have to acknowledge that I, and some of my National Party colleagues, were amongst those who urged the government to be cautious. We were conscious of the fact that there were ordinary growers who felt they wanted to keep the tariff and we needed to work through these sorts of issues to ensure that we were taking the industry with us in our dealings on these particular matters. So I do not believe the government and the parliament has any option other than to accept the recommendations of the working partythe committee that was established to look at just these sorts of measures. I have to say that there are a number of the other recommendations which will have a much bigger impact on my electorate than the abolition of the sugar tariff. For instance, the decision to get rid of the two-pooling system will benefit sugar growers in electorates such as that of the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) but will cause significant disadvantage in my own area where most of the growers have been long-term growers and therefore suppliers to pool No. 1. They are going to lose some returns as a result of that and I believe they will lose more from that decision than they will lose from the loss of the tariff. But perhaps most important of all was the quite curious recommendation of the working party that the domestic price should be set at export parity level. Export parity pricing means that Australian sugar users will get the advantage of buying sugar at a price cheaper than it can come into this country by the equivalent of the freight. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the review working party to have recommended that the price should have been set at import parity. It would certainly have had a significant benefit to growers in real returns. But they took the tough decision. They decided that they were prepared to lay their industry level with the rest of the world and to compete against them on the domestic market. I think that was a very courageous decision. But those two recommendations alone will have a much more significant effect on the welfare of the growers of sugar in my electorate, and indeed in many of the other parts of Queensland, than the decision to abolish the tariff. I can understand as well why the sugar growers of my electorate are concerned that their tariff is going, only weeks after the government has announced a package that will sustain a tariff regime for the motor vehicle industry. Naturally, they have got a right to feel upset that they are losing their tariff while they are still going to have to pay $2,000 to $3,000 extra to buy a car because of the tariff protection for that industry. They will be particularly annoyed because, just weeks after the government announced its tariff package for the motor vehicle industry, the car companies turned around and gave an industry leading pay rise to their workers. They were bleating about how the industry could not survive, yet they could afford, immediately after the tariffs were announced, major pay rises for their workers. This naturally concerns the growers in my area. They are also noticing the lobbying from the textiles, clothing and footwear industries to protect their tariff. I was interested to read the submission of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, in which they were arguing for the retention of the tariff in their industries. On page 20 of the submission is an extraordinary confession. While they are talking about a loss of jobs in Victoria and, to some extent, New South Wales if the TCF tariff goes, they say: Queensland, Western Australia and the two territories experience only small job losses in TCF industriesThat is assuming the tariff goes. They go on to say: This is more than offset by the benefit to them of job increases in other traded industries, together with the regional multiplier effects of this traded industries. Queensland has a jobs gain of about 4,000, Western Australia, 2,600, and the two territories 1,000. The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are themselves arguing that there will be job gains in Queensland, Western Australia and the territories if the tariff goes. So these stories are not simply one way. The facts are that Australia has been active in fora such as the World Trade Organisation in seeking tv liberalise trade barriers, to work towards a situation where there is fairer trade around the world. We have only a very small domestic market. For sugar, it is around 10 per cent of our production. So we have a vested interest in having freer trade around the world. As an efficient producer of primary products in particular, with an educated and skilled work force, we can expect to expand our markets enormously if barriers to our products are eliminated by other countries around the world. It only requires about a third of our existing farmers to produce the food that is necessary to feed our population. So our farmers are particularly dependent on having access to world markets. I believe that Australia is therefore right to be pursuing freer trading rules, but of course we should not pointlessly sacrifice Australian industries unless there is a clear indication that other countries are also relaxing their trading rules. The Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who I note is at the table now, made the point again just recently that Australia is not prepared to unilaterally reduce its tariffs unless other countries act likewise. It is pleasing to note that there has been considerable progress in breaking down barriers. Let us look at some of the recent events. Over recent months Mexico has reduced the tariff on Australian wool. Malaysia and Thailand have eliminated tariffs on a range of dairy products. Korea has lifted artificial barriers on Australian meats and is taking our poultry. Taiwan will be accepting Australian fruit. The United States is taking another 85,000 tonnes of Australian sugar. So the sugar industry as well-indeed, all farmersstand to benefit significantly from genuinely on nonfree and fairer trade around the world. We should not unilaterally disarm, but we should certainly be active in building new markets wherever we can. I emphasise again that in this regard the government is acting in accord with the expressed wishes of the working party report and, in particular, with the elected leadership of the industry. I wish to quote a couple of comments made by the Sugar Milling Council. You would probably expect them to want the tariff to go. Mr Graham Davies, Chairman of the Australian Sugar Milling Council said: The report recognises that the sugar industry is fundamentally export-oriented, and recommends strategies that will improve the industry's competitive advantage. He also said: The Working Party has proposed a balanced set of recommendations which will facilitate the development of an internationally competitive exportoriented industry. It is important that these recommendations be adopted as a comprehensive package. Dr David Rutledge of the Queensland Sugar Corporation said that 'the implementation of the recommendations in the unanimous report to the state and Commonwealth governments would ensure an export-oriented raw sugar industry which would benefit both sugar industry participants and the wider community'. Mr Allison, the General Manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, said: I believe we have before us a report that is a balanced package, which addresses commercial realism and competitiveness; a base to an economically, environmentally sustainable industry. In today's language, the report is a proactive statement designed to promote the well-being of the sugar industry. Harry Bonanno, Chairman of the Cane Growers, said: As well as satisfying National Competition Policy principles, the package transfers substantial benefits to the Australian community from the sugar industry. The good news for growers is that it retains the strengths of our current production and marketing arrangements which have made us one of the world's most efficient, productive and least assisted sugar industries, while providing opportunities for greater flexibility, innovation and local control. Mr Tim Fischer-Who said that?",96
257,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That was Harry Bonanno. The leaders of the industry have certainly made their position clear on this matter. The tariff has indeed had some degree of symbolic presence for the industry. It has been a comfort it has liked to have, particularly in the corrupt world market which still besieges the sugar industry. Let us remember as well that currency movements, sometimes just in a week, are enough to wipe out the equivalent of the tariffs that we might have in place. Indeed, the slide in the Thai baht in just one week would have so substantially reduced the price of Thai sugar as to make the effect of our tariff almost useless. These factors need to be taken into account in assessing the real value of the tariff compared with what the industry has chosen to give its highest priority to; namely, retaining single desk status, retaining its organised marketing structure, and retaining the real strengths of the industry. A few years ago, I stood proudly with my colleague at the time Ray Braithwaite when he opposed the Labor government's decision in 1992 to reduce the tariffs, and the opposition parties of the day did not vigorously oppose it. I stood with him at that time because the government and, for that matter, the opposition parties, were acting against the wishes of the industry. This time, the government is acting in accord with the industry, and so I will be supporting the bill. Debate interrupted. NA",99
258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being almost 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Missions to Seamen",99
259,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"In this short adjournment speech I wish to pay tribute to the work of Missions to Seamen nationally and internationally. But particularly I wish to pay a special tribute to the work of the Missions to Seamen at Port Kembla, to Lance Puckeridge, the chaplain, and his wife, Merle, who very much work as a partnership and are the mission at Port Kembla. As a member of the committee of the Missions to Seamen at Port Kembla I have seen at first hand the work that Lance and Merle do in providing comfort, support, advice, counselling and spiritual help to seafarers from all over the world. On Saturday, 23 August 1997 there was a rededication of the mission at Port Kembla. Port Kembla is no longer part of the Sydney mission but is now on its own. This is a challenge to us at Port Kembla, but a challenge we will meet as it is vitally important that we continue the presence of the mission at Port Kembla. But what happens at Port Kembla-the care, the assistance and the concern for seafarers-is repeated throughout the world. In ports in diverse and inhospitable places there is always warmth and fellowship at the missions. From the tropics to the icy north, the flying angel is a sign of fellowship, comfort and understanding. Missions to Seamen was started by the Anglican Church in England in 1835. It is a voluntary society which provides support and counselling services to seafarers in over 300 ports around the world. In an average year, the mission makes over 57,000 ship visits, welcomes 800,000 seafarers to its centres, responds to some 400 requests for help in justice cases and visits over 1,000 seafarers in hospitals. The Port Kembla Missions to Seamen was established in 1942. Lance Puckeridge has been the longest serving chaplain on the Australian east coast and just last year over 7,800 people passed through the Port Kembla mission. I personally believe that in coming years the work of the missions will become even more important as it appears the Australian coast run is about to be open to the rust buckets of the world. The world's shipping t1eet is ageing. Shipping is a very competitive business. Pressures are exerted to cut costs. It seems that it is usually the wages and conditions of the crews that are the first to suffer. This is not the main cost of shipping, but they are always the first things to suffer. Many of these crews are from Third World countries. They have no-one to defend them or depend on but the missions or the International Transport Federation. Chaplains at all missions can tell you horrific stories of mistreatment or malnutrition of crews. In Australia, we have seen the murder of Third World seafarers, such as the incident at Glory Cape off Port Hedland last year-and very little has been done about that even to this day-and many instances of seafarers disappearing off the coast of Australia if they dare to complain. I have been told many times, as other people have been, that if seafarers come into one of Australia's ports and make contact with the International Transport Federation and complain they often, not always, disappear off the Australian coastline. This could be on a trip from Sydney up to Brisbane. There have been examples of beatings and mistreatment. People who think that people like myself and the honourable member for  we speak on such topics only need to talk to the chaplains, like Lance Puckeridge, from the many missions around Australia and they will find that they all tell the same stories of the mistreatment and malnutrition of many seafarers, especially those from Third World countries. Yet through all this the missions serve as a beacon to seafarers of whatever race, creed or wherever they come from. In Port Kembla, as in missions throughout the world, they find a safe haven, comfort, fellowship and spiritual assistance. The seafarer's life means isolation and long absences from family, home and friends which create a host of special problems. The missions are always there at the dock to offer a welcome, to help with problems, to arrange contact at home and to provide care and fellowship. Long may the work of the missions' chaplains such as Lance Puckeridge continue. Long may it be a beacon throughout the world. Long may the t1ying angel be a sign of fellowship, comfort and understanding to seafarers throughout the world. Diana, Princess of Wales: Death",99
260,Mr MAREK,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express, on behalf of the people of Capricornia, distress and extreme sorrow at the loss of Diana, Princess of Wales. I, like many people, like someone special in the royal family. Princess Diana and the Queen Mother are the two that I consider to be great role models and if I hear their names mentioned I always listen with great interest. This is not to say that I am not fond of the others, but we are all individuals and they are my choice. Princess Diana was the fairy tale princess. She entered the royal family through marriage and, in my opinion, fulfilled her role as princess without fault. Time passed and we saw the end of her marriage. This was the point when I considered her to be one with the most to lose so I felt sorry for her and decided to watch where she ended up. I felt Charles would be alright. What happens to a lady when she is brought into the royal family and then suddenly is out of the inner circle, especially when she has two young children? I have never been a purchaser of magazines of the type that print photos and gutter stories about people because so many of them are purposely produced to be controversial-I would not waste my time to read them. In the past years the paparazzi have become very well known for the trouble that they will go to to get that photograph of an individual. I hate it. These people are what I consider to be legal stalkers. Action must be taken to outlaw their acts of intrusion before they cause any further distress to the public or their subjects. As I said at the start of this address, I feel that we have suffered a great loss. I am also angered that the chase to make a buck for some may have been the cause of these deaths. This is tragic and I hope the law has the ability to bring these perpetrators to justice, should they be found to have played a role in this accident. This afternoon I received a fax from young lady in Capricornia, Vanessa Tailor. The thrust of her letter was that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should go to the an funeral of the princess as it would, I am sure, help all Australians to say goodbye in our time of grief. Princess Diana gave her life to help so many, and she touched the lives of so many throughout the world. Her fight was to help people suffering from AIDS and leprosy, help those who were disadvantaged and to stop the use of landmines-all issues that normal, everyday person would most probably shy away from. This lady was and we are right to grieve her loss. My prayers and the occasional tear flowed to her children, Prince William and Prince Harry. These boys will feel the pain of the loss of their mother for some time. I know what it is like to lose your mother, as I lost mine when I was 11 years of age. It hurts. The hardest part for me was accepting what had happened and then at the time looking for someone to blame. I know that children handle grief differently to adults, as they are too young to understand what has happened and to accept the explanations. I know that it took me about four years to accept what had happened, and then I started to grieve my loss. I pray that the boys have their father to be close to, as I would have been lost without mine. I also hope people are patient with Prince Charles, as his love and the time he will need to spend with his children will take time from his normal daily schedule for quite some time. He has his family around him and the boys will need their dad now more than ever. In closing, I say once again that we have suffered a great loss. I hope that the legacy of the princess is always remembered and her work is not forgotten. The people of Capricornia and the parliament send our prayers of support to her family. The Queen of people's hearts was a saint and her name will touch people forever. Royal Australian Navy: Malayan Veterans",100
261,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"Many members of this House are aware of the continuing denial of justice to Royal Australian Navy veterans of the Malayemergency. I understand, Mr Speaker, that you are one who, in your capacity as a member of this place, has lent a sympathetic ear to the case of the veterans. Whilst the 1997 budget has provided some partial and very much belated recognition of 'operational service' for those veterans, an to 'active service' role for the RAN has continued to be denied by the government. They the are also unjustly denied the campaign medal-that is, the Naval General Service one of a kind Medal, Clasp Malaya. Many members of this House are aware of the arguments about this. The Royal Australian Navy was allotted as a component of the Strategic Reserve on 1 July 1955. In recent times, the argument from the boffins in the bureaucracy has tended to relate to denying that RAN personnel in that campaign were exposed to real danger. I would like to tell, perhaps over several adjournment debates, some real tales as told to me by those veterans to expose the nonsense of that proposition. I apologise for some of the graphic detail in the tale I will tell tonight. It was told to me by Keith Davidson, who was in the gunnery division on HMAS ANZAC. His story is as follows: On the 26th April, 1957 whilst serving onboard ANZAC in FESR during the Malayan Emergency and in the company of our sister ship HMAS TOBRUK the following incident occurred. ANZAC and Tobruk were part of a night operational gunfire encounter exercise with two Royal Navy destroyers and a cruiser ... During this exercise both RAN ships were the target of illumination by star shell fire. My duties on that night were C.O. of ""B"" gun bay. During the star shell firing an announcement was made that the exercise had been terminated and for all ships to undarken ship due to the Tobruk having been hit by gunfire (star shell) from a RN ship. The projectile passed through the forward mess deck and into Tobruk's ""B"" gun bay where the projectile ricocheted inside. Killed was Able Seaman Robert Spooner 21 years of age and critically injuring Able Seaman J.R. Stevenson who was transferred to the British Military Hospital in Singapore. Able Seaman Spooner was buried at sea the next day the 27th April, 1957. On the 7th May, 1957 both ANZAC and Tobruk arrived in Hong Kong. I went ashore to the Fleet Canteen and met up with my mate Able Seaman Lance Spurway who was also a gunnery Quarters Armourer and was my opposite number on Tobruk's ""B"" gun bay. Our conversation centred around the incident of the 26th April. Lance told me that Bob Spooner's leg was off at the hip and that he was in three pieces in the gun bay and that Stevenson's right leg was broken and really smashed about. Lance said that the ship's surgeon Lt. Clark did as much as he could under the circumstances. Lance then went on to tell me that three days after the incident he was cleaning up the gun bay and working behind a servo pump when a string of Bob Spooners intestines stuck to his hand. After this occurrence he was moved from ""B"" gun bay to duty on the bofor anti aircraft guns at the rear of the ship. During our conversation I could see that Lance was very upset at having to recall the incident so I changed the subject to our happier times and proceeded to drown our sorrows. This incident was most distressing for Tobruk as well as the ANZAC's ships company and demonstrates how vulnerable we were in the service of our country far from home. Bob Spooner was not as lucky as we were he did not return, his remains committed to the deep with a simple prayer This is one example-and I intend to give plenty more-of real tales told by Australian veterans of the Royal Australian Navy in the service of this country. The boffins in the bureaucracy-unfortunately supported by their ministers-continue to deny that these people provided active service for this country. That is a disgrace and this House has an obligation to ensure that they are given justice. Medicare Offices",101
262,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In the budget earlier this year, the government announced the closure of 43 Medicare offices across the country. They were closing them predominantly in city areas, wishing to keep them open in regional and rural Australia where the country towns are literally dying. One of the Medicare offices that was closed was in my electorate in the suburb of St Ives at the St Ives Village Shopping Centre. I received from my constituents some 9,000 signatures to a petition which they wished for me to present to the House, but it was not in accordance with the protocols of the House. In fact, it had been addressed to the Mayor of the Ku-ring-gai Council. I also received in my electorate office about 300 letters from constituents who were somewhat critical of the decision of the government to do this. As the representative for the electorate, quite naturally, I have brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, the fact that there is significant opposition in my electorate to the closure of this Medicare office. I have also pointed out to my constituents that, whilst this is irritatingly inconvenient for us, eight kilometres from this particular Medicare office is a Medicare office at Hornsby and 12 kilometres south of this office is an office at Chats wood. Within several months there will also be available electronic processing of Medicare claims from doctors' surgeries and constituents continue to have the right to mail a claim form available from any doctor's surgery to the Health Insurance Commission and receive a refund cheque in about three weeks time. This issue, however, raises perhaps a bigger one, that is, what is the role of a representative? I have pointed out to my constituents that, whilst this is understandably something about which we in Bradfield are concerned, when I surveyed the electorate last year the issue of greatest concern to them was Australia's national debt. The government, having inherited a $10.3 billion deficit, set about returning the finances of the nation to a surplus. Of course we will be running a $1.6 billion surplus next year and a $10.6 billion surplus in 2000-2001. In other parts of Australia, low income people have lost funding for dental health care. They have lost in areas of relatively high unemployment labour market programs. Commonwealth Employment Service offices have been closed. There is a significant human toll being paid by those who are suffering the effects of industrial readjustment, particularly in regional Australia. We hear of, and I know of, Australians who are working in areas where they have relied on forestry, for example, where there is significant unemployment as we reconcile the needs for environmental preservation with the needs to develop Australia's forestry and timber industries. I say to my constituents that, whilst it is my duty, as I have, to represent their concerns and their views to the government of the day, the national interest cannot always be divorced from what individual constituents want in any electorate. If the greatest price my constituents pay for returning Australia's national accounts to a surplus is to have a Medicare office close in an area that is relatively well serviced, in an area that is relativehave ly well off compared with other parts of Australia, then perhaps the sacrifice we are making is not that great. If I pay an electoral or political price for what I am saying and what I have said to my constituents, then so be it. At least I know that I have come to the federal parliament to serve not only the interests of my own constituents but indeed the interests of the nation. It is very important that all of us remember that in the end we are not always going to get what we want, and that what is popular in any individual electorate is not always consistent with the best interests of other people. Whilst I am naturally aggrieved by the fact we are losing a Medicare office in my electorate, when I think of people, for example, in the electorate of Mallee and the electorate of Kennedy and in many of the National Party and Liberal Party held regional seats, I say to my constituents in the electorate of Bradfield that, if we lose a Medicare office to keep others open where country and regional Australians desperately need them, then I, for one, am prepared to accept that price. Diana, Princess of Wales: Death Media Intrusion",102
263,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Sunday's death of Princess Diana must, when the grieving has stopped, warn us of the presence of an insidious sickness in our society-voyeurism. Those paparazzi whom Diana was fleeing when she died were acting as agents for all of us who buy the magazines, buy the newspapers and watch the TV footage for the latest bit of scandal. Diana's brother was right when he said that the media has blood on its hands. But I do not think the blood stops there. We need to realise what kind of society we have become and just how low we have sunk. Clearly Diana's car was travelling way too fast, but that misses the real point. People who draw attention to this are really saying that Diana could not escape the paparazzi, that they could record and photograph her every move. Does anyone here seriously think the paparazzi or the media who buy their pictures have any standards, that they would drawn the line, for example, at photographing Diana and Dodi in the cot? I don't. I think that is precisely the picture they were after. How is Diana supposed to survive this? Join a convent? Don't think for one minute that the culture of voyeurism and a media with no sense of personal dignity is confined to the feral tabloids of Britain or France, where Princess Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed died. Let me give the House a few homegrown atrocities. Only a week ago a small businessman committed suicide after being accused by A Current Affair of being a rip-off merchant. If we go back a bit, a Mr Graham Glisson was woken between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. one morning by 'two Rambos, one with a tape recorder and one with a camera', who wanted to interview him about the death of his daughter at 4 p.m. the previous day. He was still in a state of shock and his brother sent them away, but an hour later they woke them from their beds again to get the story. In 1986, 12 men were entombed by a coalmine explosion in Moura, Queensland. The pregnant widow of one of the trapped miners was approached by a journalist at 1.30 a.m. and offered money for her story. On another occasion a photographer posed as a doctor to gain unauthorised entry to a hospital where he took pictures of an actress suffering from a drug overdose. One Melbourne paper published a photograph of two grief-stricken women who had just heard that their husbands' bodies had been found in a blizzard at Mount Hotham in Victoria. The picture was taken without the women's consent by a photographer using a long-distance lens. The Press Council, joke that it is, did not even uphold the women's complaint of invasion of privacy. Two different Melbourne papers, in a foretaste of the nightmare that would engulf Diana, published in 1981 transcripts of alleged tape recorded conversations between Prince Charles and his then wife to be, Lady Diana Spencer, even though the tapes were almost certainly fakes. One TV station sifted through Ita Buttrose's rubbish bin for cheap laughs on Terry Willesee's Eye on Australia program. Reporters here are said to steal photographs off the mantelpieces of bereaved relatives. Over the years work has been done by committees and commissions on privacy protection, but very little has ever come of them. We did have an election commitment from the coalition to extend privacy laws to the private sector, but that was abandoned in March by Prime Minister Howard. But no government has ever tackled this sickness head on. The truth is that politicians and political parties are terrified of the media. We could kill this paparazzi thing stone dead simply by banning the publication of photographs taken without the subject's consent. Why should someone be able to take photographs of us without getting our consent and sell them for personal gain? There would need to be exemptions of course. The police could approve the publication of photos for persons wanted for criminal offences. Consent could not be given selectively or subsequently withdrawn. You would need to arrange prior approvals for sports events, broadcasts of parliament and all sorts of things. Last year the Prime Minister acted decisivelyon guns and won the support of a nation for his strong stand which created something good from the national tragedy at Port Arthur and turned us away from a descent into a violent gun culture. The death of the Princess of Wales is a world tragedy. Is it not once more time for the Prime Minister to act decisively to rid us of another scourge-the incessant invasions of privacy which come, it must be acknowledged, from the voyeur in us all but also from a media which has lost its way and is caught in a vicious, ever downward spiral with standards falling, falling, falling in the incessant drive for sales and profits and an edge on the competition? Media Intrusion",103
264,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I endorse fully the comments of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). Noone who has witnessed recent events could fail to be shocked by the excesses of the media. But what is the media? It is a group of multimillionaire and billionaire publishers, select and small of number, whose defence relies on the importance of the public's right to know. How abused is the phrase 'right to know'? How its application leads to the grossest abuses of human rights. I have not been a great fan of royalty or indeed the circus surrounding the late princess. I grieve enormously for her two sons, as I grieve for my own children and my former wives and dear friend who were subject to the grossest intrusions into their privacy. I have admitted to my indiscretion and acknowledged my guilt. The great majority have said, 'It is your business and none of theirs.' I do not mind the debate on either side of that question. What I do mind is the collateral damage that the media barons, by their nasty paparazzi and unethical reporters and editors at the Courier-Mail and Sunday Mail and elsewhere, choose to inflict. Mr Chris Griffith of the Sunday Mail illegally entered my home when I was not there. He was ordered out by my son. The process was captured on film. A very dear friend had the Courier-Mail paparazzi illegally entering her property. Illegally, after being warned not to do so, they opened a private letter sent by me to her. They photographed her front door with the flowers. They published her name and former occupation to insinuate some previous liaison. They bribed her neighbours in order to get reports of whether I visit her. They disclosed to the world where she lives. They photographed and harassed my first wife, a lovely person who has nothing to do with this matter. They photographed and harassed my form-r wif-, who equally has nothing to do With this matter. Both are innocent yet portrayed as guilty by association with me. They hounded and harassed my legal colleagues, threatening and demanding comments in order to promote a distortion of truth. They hounded and harassed me and deliberately published misinformation and distortion in order to provoke a reaction from me to create another story. They inveigled me into 'cooperating' when possessing no ethics. I mention Tony Koch. Tony Koch said to me, 'I won't be the messenger for an arsehole.' Well, Mr Koch, you went one better-when publishing the performance of a particular individual who I will not go into. Yes this is the media who are blaming the papar-zi who want to continue. I complained to the deputy editor of the Courier-Mail, who agreed it was outrageous and left it there. These people have gone too far. These people are the 1997 SS of society, determined to bring people down, determined to bring government down, determined to run the agenda. No person should have to endure what I or my family endured recently. I paid a price for public life. I wanted to get this country moving. I had a mission. Those barons who run newspapers in this country have decided otherwise. Do we succumb or do we strike back and say, 'We've had enough'? I fully endorse the comments of the member for Wills. Sugar Industry: Tariffs",104
265,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to disagree with some of the things said by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) when he said that the sugar industry is in favour of this removal. I represent about a quarter of the Australian industry. My colleague the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) and I represent more than half of the industry in Australia. Both of us are opposing these moves tonight. Clearly we would not be doing that if the industry was in favour of these moves. So I must disagree with his statements. He said that there were two grower representatives on the review. One of those grower representatives has changed his position in the meantime. What is more, those growers only made that decision because they had the gun of deregulation at their head. That is a point that cannot be overemphasised in this place. Adding to what I said previously this evening, there are two models-the Australian economic model and the Japanese economy model. In Japan, the trade balance last year was a $131,000 million surplus, the biggest trade surplus recorded in world history. Japan is a country that does not work on the policy of abolishing tariffs. It is a country that works on just the opposite policy of doing everything humanly possible to defend and develop industries. It seems to me that we have a policy that is just the opposite. To put a $131,000 million trade surplus into perspective, the United States last year recorded a $106,000 million deficit. The average income for Japan working on a policy of aggressive trade policies-the non-removal of tariffs and doing everything humanly possible to protect and defend their workers and the workers' industries-is $37,050 per year. The average income in the United States is $26,590 per year. I would be embarrassed to tell the House what this country's average income is. Let us go back in Australian history. The honourable member for Dawson has a very large picture of John MCEwan up in her office and I most certainly will be getting one myself shortly. In 1972, unemployment in this country-the last year of John MCEwan-was 2.2 per cent. In 1996, it was 8.9 per cent. current account deficit was a $403 million surplus. It is now a deficit of over $20,200,000. (Time expired)",105

The Calendar (for the current year) is also available on the Internet (http://www.un.org/Conferences/Caiendar/). The honourable member will note that-more than 100 conferences and meetings were scheduled to be held in these cities during each of these years.

Australian Securities Commission: Fees (Question No. 1307) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 12 February 1997: Was his Department late to advise the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) of the level of increase in the ASC's schedule of fees for business; if so, (a) why, (b) has his attention been drawn to the inconvenience the delay caused business and accountancy firms and (c) what steps will he take to ensure that (i) a delay does not occur again and (ii) businesses and accountants are given sufficient time to incorporate ASC fee changes in their endof-year accounts. Mr Costello-The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows: November and were formally notified later that day in the Gazette. The ASC issued a media release about the increases on 21 November and placed public notices in The Australian Financial Review and The Australian on 26 November. Treasury: Office Closures and Abolition of Positions (Question No. 1483) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Minister's Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No positions in the Department of the Treasury have been formally abolished, nor have any offices been closed since 2 March 1996. However, some staff reductions have been achieved since that time, as outlined below. ' The Treasury's operative staffing level at 2 March 1996 was 506. This included 12 from the National Competition Council, which has reported separately from 1 july 1996. The honourable member would be aware that, following the election, the government made a number of changes to the Administrative Arrangements Orders. One of those affecting the Department of the Treasury was the transfer of the bulk of the Business Law Division from the Attorney General's Department, involving a total of 45 staff, plus six from the corporate support areas. The Treasury's operative staffing level at 30 April 1997 was 532. This indicates a net reduction, since March 1996, in the order of 13 staff. for Business Refugee Status: Primary Decisions (Question No. 1505) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) How many primary decisions for refugee status have been determined on the basis of a written application alone without the opportunity for a formal hearing since his appointment as Minister. (2) How many of the cases referred to in part (1) involved (a) Sri Lankan Tamils and (b) single women from (i) Somalia, (ii) Iraq, (iii) Sudan and (iv) Iran. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The first part of the answer is an estimate as precise data for the entire period is not available. The second part of the answer is specific as the data was collected manually. (1) Since my appointment as Minister, for the period 11 March 1996 to 31 March 1997, there have been 10,100 primary determinations made on protection visa applications. Departmental estimates are that approximately 40% of these determinations were made on the application alone (no interview). Case officers are instructed to make a strategic decision about whether or not an interview is required to clarify gaps or inconsistencies presented in the claims. Although there are fewer applicants currently being interviewed, the Department is still interviewing a substantial proportion of the caseload. As illustrated in the specific examples at (2), not interviewing does not presage a negative outcome. (2) Of these cases with primary determinations without interview there were (a) 124 Sri Lankans, and of these 25 were granted a Protection Visa Office Treasurer Assistant Treasurer Parliamentary Secretary The numbers of lap top computers supplied Office Treasurer Assistant Treasurer Parliamentary Secretary (2) Office Treasurer Assistant Treasurer Parliamentary Secretary (statistics on the ethnic background of Sri Lankan nationals are not kept by the Department), and (b) of the single women, there were (i) 3 from Somalia, and of these 1 was granted a Protection Visa, (ii) 3 from Iraq, (iii) I from Sudan, and (iv) 10 from Iran, and of these 4 were granted a Protection Visa. 20.2% of Sri Lankans determined without interview were approved at the primary stage. 21.7% of Sri Lankans determined with interview were approved at the primary stage. This consistent approval rate indicates that people were not disadvantaged through not being interviewed. Treasury: Office Equipment (Question No. 1510) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) How many mobile phones, lap top computers and similar equipment have been provided to the Minister, Parliamentary Secretary and ministerial officers. (2) What has been the cost of providing the equipment referred to in part (1). Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The numbers of mobile phones supplied to the ministerial offices are as follows: Transferred From Previous Government New Phones Total 9 I 10 5 2 7 4 5 9 to the ministerial offices are as follows: Transferred From Previous Government New LapTops Total 1 1 2 1 2 3 o 2 2 Mobile Phones Lap Top Computers $866 $5,786 $1,341 $13,744 $2,524 $12,289 The number and costs of the above equipment is only for that of new equipment supplied to the new Government. It does not include existing equipment which was transferred from the previous Government, or the ongoing cost of mobile phone calls. Refugee Review Tribunal (Question No. 1634) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) How many cases does his Department have before it concerning an approach to him to exercise his discretion and substitute a more favourable decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal under s.417 of the Migration Act 1958. (2) How many cases did his Department have before it on 2 March 1996. (3) For how many persons has he exercised his discretion in favour of and allowed to remain on humanitarian grounds under s.417 of the Migration Act 1958 since 2 March 1996. (4) In how many of those cases remaining outstanding have departmental officers recommended that he exercise his discretion in favour of the person and allow them to remain in Australia on humanitarian grounds. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As at 30 June 1997 there were 1129 cases before the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) conceming an approach for me to exercise my discretion under s.417 of the Migration Act 1958 and substitute for a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, a decision which is more favourable to the applicant if I think it is in the public interest to do so. (2) On 2 March 1996 DIMA had before it 31 cases. The reason for the increase to the 1996 Federal election every effort was made to finalise outstanding requests for Ministerial intervention. Secondly, on 14 May 1996, Justice Merkel of the Federal Court handed down a decision in the Ozmanian case. The findings in this case went to the heart of the administration of my public interest powers. I appealed this decision. Further action on requests was deferred until the impact on administrative procedures was examined and further procedures were developed. Processing of cases did not recommence until 19 September 1996. During this period a large backlog of developed. In addition, there has been a significant rise in the number of requests for Ministerial intervention received in the last 12 to 18 months. This is probably, in part, because of the delay in processing requests which occurred as a result of Ozmanian, including dealing with the backlog. All requests seeking my intervention are now personally-seen by me. (3) Since 2 March 1996 until 30 June 1997 I have exercised my discretion under s.417 of the Migration Act 1958 in 79 cases (107 persons). (4) Cases are referred to me by DIMA for consideration of whether I will exercise my discretion in favour of the person and allow them to remain in Australia on humanitarian grounds. Departmental officers do not recommend whether or how I should exercise my discretion. International Convention Against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries (Question No. 1684) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Did the UN General Assembly adopt an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries on 4 December 1989 without a vote. (2) Was the Convention open for signature by all states at the UN Headquarters in New York until 31 December 1990. (3) Which states have (a) signed, (b) ratified and (c) acceded to the Convention and when did they do so. (4) Has Australia taken steps to accede to the Convention; if so, what. (5) Has Australia taken steps to place the Convention on the agenda of the (a) Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings and (b) South Pacific Forum; if so, what. (6) Has Australia discussed the implementation of the Convention with other states; if so, (a) on what occasions, (b) in what circumstances and (c) is twofold. Prior by what means. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes (3) (a) The following eleven States have signed but not ratified the Convention: Angola-28 December 1990; Belarus-13 December 1990; Congo-20 June 1990; Gerrequests many-20 December 1990; Morocco-5 October 1990; Nigeria--4 April 1990; Poland-28 December 1990; Romania-17 December 1990; Uruguay-20 November 1990; (former) Yugoslavia12 December 1990; Zaire-20 March 1990. (3) (b) The following five States have signed and ratified the Convention: Cameroon-26 January 1996-(signed 21 December 1990); Italy-21 August 1995-(signed 5 February 1990); Maldives-II September 1991(signed 17 July 1990); Suriname-lO August 1990-(signed 27 February 1990); Ukraine-13 September 1993-(signed 21 September 1990). (3) (c) The following seven States have acceded to the Convention: Barbados-lO July 1992; Cyprus-8 July 1993; Georgia-8 June 1995; Saudi Arabia-14 April 1997; Seychelles-12 March 1990; Togo-25 February 1991; Turkmenistan-18 September 1996. (4) The Attorney-General and I announced on 14 July that the Government was taking steps to accede to the Mercenaries Convention. In accordance with our normal treaty action procedures, the Attorney-General has written to the State and Territory Attorneys-General informing them of the consideration being given to the Mercenaries Convention and inviting their views on the question of acceding to the Convention. The Mercenaries Convention has been listed on the Commonwealth State Standing Committee of Treaties' (SCOT) Schedule of Treaty Action since December 1995. (5) The next meeting of the South Pacific Forum will be held in Rarotonga (Cook Islands) from 1820 September 1997 and the next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting will be held in Edinburgh from 24-27 October 1997. As stated in our 14 July announcement, the Government is looking at ways to develop and encourage international and regional support for the Mercenaries Convention so that it may soon gain effect under international law and enable the international community to cooperate to prevent the activities of mercenaries. We will therefore be using appropriate opportunities to raise this issue. (6) The Mercenaries Convention is, like all other international treaties, discussed by states with an interest in it when opportunities arise. In the of this Convention, discussions of an informal nature often take place during the annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Work for the Dole Program (Question No. 1703) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Will a training component be included in the Work for the Dole program; if not, what long term value will the program provide for participants. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a report produced by the Minister for Family and Social Services in Alberta, Canada, entitled ""A chronology of Alberta welfare reform"", which details the successes of a program called ""Alberta Job Corps"" in improving the employment prospects of the long term unemployed and reducing their dependence on social security; if so, does the Government expect its program to be as successful as the Alberta program; if so, why; if not, why not. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Work for the Dole projects will not require participants to undergo a significant amount of vocational training. To make sure participants are working safely some project sponsors may need to provide training in the areas of occupational health and safety. Of course, sponsors will provide any training that participants need to undertake the duties of the project. The initiative will provide long term benefits to participants. Participating in Work for the Dole projects will help young people to maintain and develop their work ethic and reduce the impact unemployment has on self esteem and confidence. The initiative will provide participants with a valuable link to the community that supports them and will provide individuals with continuing assistance from the community. The work experience gained on the projects should foster a stronger attachment to the labour force. (2) I have received some information about the Alberta Job Corps. The objectives of Work for the Dole and the Alberta Job Corps are different. The Alberta scheme aims to reduce participants' dependence on welfare by providing job training and life skills instruction. Work for the Dole offers young people a chance to participate in community projects and thus contribute to their communities in return for their unemployment allowances. By doing this Work for the Dole aims to bring young people back to a work culture and help to develop a work ethic, self esteem and confidence. The initiative aims to case engage young unemployed people and their communities and offers benefits to both. Work for the Dole, is not designed to reduce social security outlays nor create employment. I expect the initiative to be successful in benefiting both young unemployed people and their communities. The Government will conduct an evaluation of the success of the Work for the Dole pilot projects in meeting these objectives. Child-Care Centres: Electoral Division of Namadgi (Question No. 1720) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) How many community based child care centres are there in the electoral division of Namadgi.

(2) Did he seek or receive advice from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, or the Minister's office, before writing to the Keep Essendon Airport Committee: if so, what was that advice. (3) Is his support for Essendon Airport based on a belief that safety procedures at the airport are adequate; if so, on what information is his view based. (4) Did he inform the House of Representatives in 1985 (Hansard, 23 August 1985, page 303) that in the preceding 8 years there had been 10 cases of large passenger aircraft attempting to land at Essendon Airport instead of Tullamarine Airport; if so, how does this reconcile with his recent support for the airport. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) This aspect of the matter is internal to Government. (3) a. Yes b. Its continuing official clearance for operations. (4) Yes, but this is not a problem created by the existence of the original airport at Essendon. income tested living allowance for dependent secondary students aged 16-18 years and for approved secondary school boarding students school term allowance for under 16 year old students whose parents are beneficiaries of specified pensions or hold a health care card school fees allowance for under 16 year old students fares allowance for students approved to board away from home to attend school rent assistance for eligible homeless students Aboriginal Schoolchildren: Funding (Question No. 1762) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: (I) What allowances are paid to Aboriginal children attending school.

(4) In instances where non-Aboriginal students are eligible for financial assistance at primary school level, is the sum paid to the parent or the school. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) No allowances are automatically paid direct to dependent Aboriginal children. There are three schemes under which their parents or guardians may be entitled to receive allowances. Claims cannot be made on more than one scheme concurrently and not all applicants will be eligible for all allowances payable through any scheme. Applicants are free to choose the scheme which they consider best meets their needs. Details of allowances payable under ABSTUDY, Austudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme follow. NA ABSTUDY Schooling Award aims to assist primary school students aged 14 or more on I January in the year of study and secondary school students.

268,Mr HOWARD,ABSTUDY,"The answer to the honourstudents able member's question is as follows: I have met, and attended many events, with Ministers, their staff members and government backbenchers since March 1996. In order to answer the question it would be necessary to attempt to establish retrospectively whether the primary purpose of their travel in each case was to meet me, or attend an event with me. I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of resources for that purpose. World Heritage Sites: Sydney Opera House Nomination (Question No. 1807) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (I) Did the World Heritage Committee, at its 20th session at Merida, Mexico, on 2 to 7 December 1996, adopt a revised format for nomination documentation. (2) If so, would the revised format require changes in the nomination of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting; if so, when did he or his Department bring the necessary changes to the attention of relevant New South Wales authorities.

Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The revised format will take effect on I July 1998. Hence the changes would not affect any Australian nominations proposed in 1997 or submitted before I July 1998 (for consideration in 1998 or 1999 respectively). (2) The assessment of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting was undertaken in close collaboration between the Commonwealth and New South Wales officials. The nomination documentation was prepared in line with the then anticipated Australia Austria Azerbaijan* Belgium Bulgaria* Canada Croatia* Czech Republic* Cyprus Denmark* Estonia* new format and would not require substantive amendment. (3) Ms Sharon Sullivan, Head, Australian and World Heritage Group, Environment Australia; Dr Warren Nicholls, Director, World Heritage Unit, Environment Australia and Ms Roni Ellis, Alternate Permanent Delegate of Australia to UNESCO attended the World Heritage Bureau meeting (Paris, 23 to 28 June 1997).

UNESCO Conference: Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education in the European Region (Question No. 1808) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 928 (Hansard, 13 February 1997, page 1016) is he able to say whether an international conference held under UNESCO's auspices in Lisbon on 8 to II April 1997 finalised a Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region; if so, which states (a) attended the conference and (b) signed the Convention. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The international conference held in Lisbon adopted the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region on 11 April 1997. a. The following delegations attended the conference: Liechtenstein Lithuania* Luxembourg* Malta* Moldova Netherlands Norway * Poland* Portugal* Romania Russia Finland France* Georgia* Germany* Greece Holy See* Hungary * Iceland* Italy Republic of Kazakstan * Latvia* (b) The countries marked with an asterisk in de Robillard, Mr Roger (Question No. 1821) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the circumstances of the arrest of an Australian barrister, Mr R. de Robillard, when Mr de Robillard returned to Vanuatu on 26 March 1997. (2) Is he able to say whether Mr de Robillard's request to contact a person of his choosing was denied. (3) What assistance was provided to Mr de Robillard by the Australian High Commissioner. (4) Has Mr de Robillard been charged; if so, what charges is Mr de Robillard facing and will Mr de Robillard receive assistance from the Australian Government. (5) Has Mr de Robillard been allowed independent legal representation. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I have taken a close interest in Mr de Robillard's case. On 27 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was sentenced to two months imprisonment in Vanuatu for contempt of court. He subsequently lodged an appeal against his sentence, which was heard by a specially convened Appeal Court on 5 and 6 May. That Court quashed Mr de Robillard's conviction. (2) When an Australian citizen is arrested overseas my Department undertakes as an established consular practice to inform next-of-kin of the arrest, or else another nominated person if the citizen in question does not wish his next-of-kin to be informed. Following his arrest on 26 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was provided with the Department's standard consular advice letter, which included that advice, by the Consul in Port Vila. Mr de Robillard informed the Consul that his nextSlovakia* Slovenia* Spain Sweden* Switzerland The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* Turkey Ukraine* United Kingdom United States* European Community (a.) above signed the Convention on II April 1997. of-kin were already aware of his situation, but requested that a legal colleague in Australia be notified in order to arrange his legal representation. It was explained to Mr de Robillard that in circumstances where next-of-kin had been informed of an arrest, the Department would not normally contact other parties. The Department considers next-of-kin better placed than itself in notifying other nonfamily members of information relating to a person arrested overseas. Next-of-kin can better judge whom the individual overseas would want contacted beyond the immediate family, and similarly, how much information to disseminate. Accordingly, the Department treats next-of-kin as a central point for dissemination of information about an Australian overseas. Mr de Robillard noted that he had instructed his secretary in Australia to advise his lawyers of his arrest, but took the view that the terms of the consular letter, strictly construed, entitled him to ask that the Consul contact·someone other than his next-of-kin. The Consul agreed to pass Mr de Robillard's request to the Department in Canberra. Later that day-the day immediately before the Easter break--{)fficers of my Department attempted to telephone the person nominated by Mr de Robillard, but there was no answer. The Department made contact with the person on the morning immediately following the Easter break. (3) The High Commissioner, Mr Edwards, his staff in Vanuatu and the Department in Canberra were extremely active in their efforts to assist Mr de Robillard. The High Commissioner was informed of Mr de Robillard's arrest at approximately \0 p.m. on 26 March 1997. The High Commissioner in turn advised the Australian Consul, Mr Brims. Subsequent to the phonecall from Mr Edwards, Mr Brims contacted the Central Police Station and spoke to the Deputy Police Officer, who confirmed that Mr de Robillard had been arrested and was being held there. The officer refused to allow the Consul to speak with Mr de Robillard on the telephone, noting the late hour, and advised Mr Brims that he should visit in person the next morning and speak to the Inspector in Charge. Mr Brims agreed to do so, and the officer agreed to pass a message to Mr de Robillard that Mr Brims would visit him early the next morning. Mr Brims visited Mr de Robillard at the Central Police Station in Port Vila at 9:00 a.m. the next morning, 27 March 1997. Following Mr de Robillard's arrest, the staff of the High Commission made a number of representations to the relevant authorities, to express consular interest in his case, to encourage the holding of an early appeal, and to raise the question of a possible early release to facilitate the tion of his case for the appeal hearing. Those contacted included the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney-General, and a number of senior officials. In addition, officers of the Department in Canberra spoke directly with Mr de Robillard on a number of occasions concerning the handling of the case. The Head of the Consular Response Group was sent to Port Vila from 19 to 23 April to assist the High Commission with the handling of the case. While there, this officer called twice on Mr de Robillard, spending a total of nearly three hours with him. Further, when the prison authorities sought to impose conditions more in keeping with those applicable to his fellow NiVanuatu prisoners, the Mission interceded and assisted in restoring the food and telephone access privileges previously enjoyed by Mr de Robillard. (4) As far as my Department is aware there are no outstanding charges against Mr de Robillard. As noted earlier, the charges relating to contempt of court were quashed. (5) Mr de Robillard was allowed independent legal representation and a team of lawyers travelled to Vanuatu from Australia to represent Mr de Robillard at the appeal hearing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought advice from the Vanuatu Supreme Court regarding the necessary procedures for Mr de Robillard's counsel to obtain a temporary practising certificate for the appeal hearing. This advice was passed to Mr de Robillard's counsel. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Jettisoned Fuel (Question No. 1822) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: Have planes jettisoned fuel prior to landing at Sydne- (Kingsford-Smith) Airport since January 1995; If so, (a) on how many occasions and (b) what are the details. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes.(a) I am advised by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation that there have been seven reported occasions where aircraft dumped fuel prior to landing at Sydney Airport. (b) In all cases the fuel was dumped by aircraft returning to Sydney Airport as a result of engine related and/or other aircraft system problems in order to reduce the landing weight to an acceptable level.

269,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ABSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Private Health Insurance Incentives do differentiate between couples and families. Couples will receive $200 towards hospital cover and $50 towards ancillary cover. Families will receive $350 towards hospital cover and $100 towards ancillary cover. Single memberships cover one person. A couple membership consists of two adults. All other memberships are classified as families. Minister for Health and Family Services: Standing Committee on Family and Community Services (Question No. 1828) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (I) How were the terms of reference decided for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Services inquiry into welfare service delivery. (2) With whom did he consult in determining the terms of reference. (3) Did he consult with agencies, bodies, organisations or persons engaged in the delivery of welfare services to the community; if so, who.",121

(3) See answer to Question 1. Convention on the Rights of the Child: Optional Protocols (Question No. 1865) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June: What steps have been taken to draft optional protocols to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Two draft Optional Protocols to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) are currently being negotiated by Working Groups of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (CHR). The first Protocol will cover the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. At its 1994 session. CHR established a Working Group to develop this draft Optional Protocol. The Protocol aims to give greater definition to the obligations contained in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention, which require States parties to protect children from sexual exploitation (including prostitution and pornography), sale, trafficking and abduction. The Protocol would also aim to strengthen international mechanisms for cooperation in dealing with these Issues. Australia has been a strong supporter of this Protocol, and has actively participated at the drafting sessions of the Working Group. A third session of the Working Group was held in Geneva in February 1997. Although the negotiations were given significant political impetus following the August 1996 Stockholm World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, disagreement persists about the scope of the Protocol, with a small number of countries wishing to broaden the scope to include the sale of children for other purposes, such as for organ use or for illegal adoption. The second protocol focuses on Children in Armed Conflict. A Working Group to develop this draft Optional Protocol was also established at the 1994 session of CHR. The Protocol aims to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces, and for participation in hostilities, from the age of 15 in Article 38(2) of the Convention. Australia strongly supports this draft Optional Protocol, and has been an active participant at the drafting sessions of the Working Group. A third session of the Working Group was held in Geneva in January 1997, where discussions focused in particular on two unresolved issues: the age for voluntary recruitment into the armed forces, and recruitment by non-governmental armed forces. Further sessions of both Working Groups will take place in 1998. Once the texts of the two protocols have been finalised and are adopted, they will be open to signature and ratification by States Parties to the Convention.",121
