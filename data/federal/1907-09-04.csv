Mr. JOSEPH COOK presented a petition from the Child Study Association of Australasia, praying the House to remove all Customs duties from food and clothing necessary for the health, comfort, and decency of the people of Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE presented a petition from certain persons at Wagga and the surrounding districts, Sydney, and other places, praying the House to reject or greatly modify the proposed Customs duties. Petitions received, and read.",14
1,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The Clerk has not read the signatures to the petitions.,15
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"We have many times resolved that petitions be read, but in no case has it been thought worthwhile to have read long lists of the names of the signatories, though, of course, if the House desires to hear them, the Clerk will read them. Honorable MEMBERS - No . NA MAKERS: SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",15
3,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,Has the Minister of Trade and Customs the return which he promised to furnish in connection with the administration of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act j and will he explain why Excise has not been collected from firms which have not been working .under the award of the Fresident of the Arbitration Court?,15
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I have .been supplied with the following information1. On the 30th July, 1907, Mr Hutchison, M.P., moved, with regard to agricultural implement makers and employees in South Australiaexemptions under Excise Tariff 1906-that a return be laid upon the table of the House showing1. The number and names of all South Australian firms of agricultural implement makers who have secured exemption under the Excise Tariff 1906. 2. The number of labourers employed in making 'agricultural implements by each of* said firms, ns "" used to the trade,"" and the number classified as "" not used to the trade,"" and the wages paid to each. 3. The number of employees, other than labourers, employed in .making agri* cultural implements by each of said firms, who are classified as "" of average capacity,"" "" slow, under average capacity,"" and average capacity,"" setting out the various occupations. 2. On the same day, the Collector, South Australia, was requested to furnish the desired in* formation, and, in reply, he stated that(a) No information could be supplied by the Deputy Industrial Registrar with regard to numbers 2 and 3, as none of the particulars had been' furnished by the manufacturers, when making application for exemption, nor are they required in that connection. . (i ) It had been suggested that the manufacturers would probably decline to help the Department to obtain the information sought by Mr Hutchison, because it is alleged that they view the provisions of the Act with disfavour. 3. On the 6th instant the Collector was in structed to ask the manufacturers to be good enough to supply the desired information, and he reported, on the 9th instant, that action was being taken accordingly. 4. Since that date, no further communicationon the subject has been received, and it will probably take some time to obtain replies from those interested. I may say that the position is very unsatisfactory.",15
5,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,Then the new protection is a failure.,15
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"It seems that we shall have to do something more to enable the intention of Parliament to be carried out.. We are giving further consideration to the matter, and - I hope to have available tomorrow .some additional information, which I shall be prepared to put before the honourable member if he will call at the Department. As soon as I am in a position to inform the House of what further steps are being taken in the matter, I shall be glad to do so. I am advised' that there appears to be a certain degree of collusion between employers and employees to prevent the intention of Parliament being carried out, and it is difficult to safeguard ourselves against such tactics'. .This scheme represents, to a certain' extent, what is known as the policy of new protection. . It provides for Australian conditions",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,I am afraid that the Minister is proceeding to discuss the matter.,15
8,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,We do not understand what the honourable gentleman is doing in who nre classified this matter.,15
9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"There are some things which honourable members opposite dp not wish to understand. I hope that before we have dealt finally with this question, we shall have shown them that the intention of the Government is that under Australian rates.of. wages shall be paid in industries which are given protection.",15
10,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"As certificates, of exemption under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act were granted to a large number of manufacturers of agricultural implements in South Australia, subject to the condition that they should obey the award of the Arbitration Court, I should like the Minister'of Trade and Customs to explainwhy' Excise has not beeA collected on implements made iby firms that are not obeying that award?",15
11,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I shall be glad to look further into the matter. The honourable member will recognise that we might do an injustice if we insisted on the award of a Court in one State being observed, while .manufacturers in other States were subject to no such order. Our desire is to do that which the honourable member suggests, and, as far as possible, I shall see that the law is carried out.",16
12,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"A m I to understand that the Department of Trade and Customs is unable to administer the Act? If not, will the Minister be good enough to explain why the Excise duty has not been collected from those who have not been granted an exemption, and are not carrying out the award of the Court?",16
13,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I do not say that we are unable to administer the Act. We certainly are not unwilling to do so, but there are many difficulties to overcome.",16
14,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,Are they legal difficulties ? M T. AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The r e are legal and other difficulties which we are endeavouring to overcome. As soon as I have further information on the subject. I shall foe glad to submit it to the honourable member.,16
15,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I wish again to call the attention of the Minister to the very important fact that firms in South Australia that are obeying the award of the Arbitration Court have to compete with those who are not. In the circumstances, what action does he intend to take in the interests of those who are paying fair rates of wages?",16
16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I intend, as far as I can, at the earliest possible moment, to put all on the one footing. BRITISH PREFERENCE : DEPARTURE FROM SCHEDULE - ALLEGED INACCURACY OF COMPARATIVE TABLE-ORDE R OF DEALING WITH SCHEDULE-DUT Y ON PRINTING PAPER-INCREASE D CHARGES BY SYDNEY FIRMS - WIRE NETTING : RE FUND OF DUTY - TWEED : INCREASED PRICE INNEW SOUTH WALES .",16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister, without notice, whether it is true, as reported, that the Government, pending the passing of the ordinary rates of duty, contemplate abandoning the preferential trade proposals in the schedule to the Tariff. Is it the intention of the Government to persevere with their preferential proposals in the order iri which they stand in the schedule?",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I do not know from what source the honourable member has obtained the information to which he refers, but I may say at once that we have no such intention as he ascribes to us.",16
19,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he has inquired into the complaint made last week by the honourable member for Perth that the departmental comparative table of rates of Customs duties which has been laid upon the table of the House is incorrect?,16
20,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I am having prepared a paper to. lay on the table of the House. I anticipated that it would have been ready to present this afternoon, but unfortunately some delay has taken place. I hope to be able to put it before honourable members tomorrow, and think it will show that the table in question was very carefully prepared. We are at a loss to understand the contention that it contains many incorrect statementsMy desire is that the paper which I shall' lay on the table tomorrow shall include the 70 or 80 items which the free-trade section of the Commission recommended should be dutiable, and which the Government, in accordance with'the recommenda: tion of the protectionist section of the Commission, have placed on the free list.",16
21,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"Will the Acting Prime Minister inform, the House whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the consideration of the items in the Tariff in the order in which they appear?",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,Yes .,16
23,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"In reply to a complaint by a representative of Messrs. Geo. TARIFF. Robertson and Co. L d . , that a duty of 20 per cent, on high-class paper was operating detrimentally to local employment in the book printing industry, the Minister of Trade and Customs said recently that he did not think it would be right to favour importers as against local manufacturers. I wish to know whether his consideration of the matter is directed merely to a reduction of the duty on the raw material or to a proposal to put a duty upon imported books?",16
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,The deputation which waited upon me pointed out that the duty on printing paper operated detrimentally to those who imported paper and used it for printing purposes. I stated in reply that we had no desire to place on the raw material a higher tax than was levied on the finished product.,16
25,Mr CROUCH,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,What about the Geelong paper mills?,17
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"They receive every consideration. I think the honourable member will recognise that it would be unfair to propose to place on the raw material a higher tax than that levied on the finished article. I promised the deputation that I would inquire very carefully into the statements made. I would remind the House that we have to look into both sides of the question, since assertions made by deputations are necessarily ex parte.",17
27,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,That is what is said about the reports of the Tariff. Commission.,17
28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"The fact that we have the views of various deputations put before u.s places us in a' very much better position than we should otherwise be to deal with the Tariff. The Tariff had largely to be prepared in secret, and the members of the Commission, as well as the Ministry, had to guard against any disclosure of information. The consequence of this is that many anomalies are being pointed out to us. We intend to give every consideration to such representations. shall be very glad to give consideration to every complaint that is brought under the notice of the Government, but I may say at once to the honourable member for Angas that it is not our intention to raise the duty on the finished article. It is only a question of whether or not the duty on the raw material should be reduced.",17
29,Mr MATHEWS,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that certain firms in Sydney have increased the prices of certain goods to the extent of the difference between the duties in the old Tariff and those now in operation, and that this step has been taken notwithstanding that the goods in question were imported prior to 8th August last?",17
30,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,The honourable member was good enough to give me notice that he intended to ask this question.,17
31,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,O r did the Minister give the honourable member notice?,17
32,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"We do not conduct business on the lines adopted when the honourable member's party was in power. The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsI am credibly informed that all the merchants in Sydney have entered into an agreement binding themselves to add the extra amount of duty on orders for all goods received by them on and after 12th August. It is presumed that this increase in price is being made on goods which were imported under the old Tariff at will lower duties than those now in ""force.",17
33,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will refund duty collected upon wire netting if the item in the schedule be struck out?,17
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"That is a question which, to a very large extent, must be answered by the States Governments, since they receive nearly all the revenue. It has been decided that no duties shall be refunded, and that decision will be adhered to unless the House determines otherwise. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he is aware that a certain tweed factory in New South Wales sent to its customers all over that State two days before the new Tariff was introduced a circular stating that their prices would be increased by 25 per cent, in consequence of the rise in wool- a rise which I may say had not taken place-and that two days after the introduction of the Tariff the firm in question published a large advertisement to the effect that they were I not going to raise their prices in consequence of the new Tariff ?",17
35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I am not aware of the incident to which the honourable member has referred, but if he will give me the particulars",17
36,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,I shall give the honourable member the original correspondence.,17
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,Then I shall be glad to make inquiries into the matter. If the honourable member wishes to infer that in some way or other a leakage of information has occurred,17
38,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I shall give the Minister the facts, and he may draw from them whatever inference he pleases.",17
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"If the honourable member wishes to suggest that there has been a leakage of information from the Department, I shall be glad to be furnished with all the factson which he bases his statement. Having regard to the number of men who knew what the Tariff was to be-considerin g that the Tariff Commission, and others whom they had tt> take into their confidence, knew what the Tariff was likely to be- I think it reflects the greatest credit upon all concerned that, stateso far as we have been able to discover, no leakage of information has occurred. ESTIMATES: MILITARY AND LIGHTHOUSE ENGINEERS.",17
40,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT,"I should like the Postmaster-General, as representing the Afinister of Home Affairs to explain what are the proposed functions of two new officers for whom provision is made in the Estimates of the Department of Home up Affairs. I refer to the officers described as "" military engineer "" and "" lighthouse March last? engineer.""",18

42,Mr LIDDELL,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"I have just received reply to a communication which I addressed lowson 19th March last to the Postmaster General's Department, and I should like the Postmaster-General to say whether he Library, will inquire why this unprecedented of 198 days has occurred? Will he also endeavour to facilitate the work of the Department ?",18
43,Mr MAUGER,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"If the honourable member-will see me at the Department, be able very quickly to furnish him with an answer, andpublic time will thus be conableness served. TARIFF. SEIZURE OF WIRE NETTING : CANCELLATION OF CARRIERS' LICENCES.",18
44,Mr JOHNSON,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"the Acting Prime Minister, upoti notice I. Is it a fact, as reported in the Sydney newspapers of Friday last, 30th August, that three carriers employed by a Government contractor named Sutton to assist in removing wire netting, under instructions from the New South Wales Government, have been peremptorily ordered by Mr Baxter, Acting Comptroller for Customs, to return their licences and show cause why they should not be cancelled ? 2. Was this drastic proceeding authorized or approved by the Minister? 3. As the carriers referred to were (according to the report) in no sense principals tract with the State Government, and the withdrawal of their licences must seriously injure them in their carrying business, will the Minister recall the order issued by Mr Baxter until an inquiry has been held, and an offence has been proven?",18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I have to I do not think it wise at the present moment to discuss the propriety of any action which the Government, upon the advice of its legal advisers, proposes to take, to insure the observance of the law in regard to the case under notice. MR. BRUCE HART.",18

Also the papers containing the evidence taken at the Board of Inquiry held in connection to with Mr Hart's suspension? 3. Also the finding of the Board of Inquiry and any subsequent papers connected therewith? 4. If there are no objections, will he cause those papers to be placed on the table of the House ?",18

I have no objection to placing the papers in question on the table of the and will have this done as soon as they delay can be obtained from Sydney. TELEPHONE RATES. WEST MAITLAND AND SYDNEY.",18
48,Mr LIDDELL,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"the PostmasterI shall General, upon notice Whether he will seriously consider the advisof reducing the telephone rates between West Maitland and Sydney, seeing that although a reduction of 50 per cent, has been made in the rate between Newcastle and Maitland, no reduction whatever has been made for the Sydney-Maitland service, while practically all other lines have received consideration?",18
49,Mr MAUGER,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsThe basis on which ordinary trunk-line charges are made must be such as to be of general application, and I regret that I am therefore unable to recommend a special rate in any particular case. The present trunk line charges are substantially less than those charged in New South Wales prior to Federation, and no further reduction could be made without involving a loss of revenue, which the circumstances do not warrant. in the conDECORATION OF DIVER HUGHES.",18
50,Mr MAHON,DELAYS IN THE POST AND,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeHas he any objection to lay upon the Library table the papers in connection with the granting of the Albert medal to Diver Hughes, of Western Australia, or, in the alternative, will he be good enough to state the facts in connection with the matter?",18

Is it a fact that eligible officers engaged in the electrical and mechanical branch of the General Post Office, Sydney, do not advance by annual increments from the minimum to the of maximum salary in common with officers in other branches of the service ? 2. If so, what is the reason of the differentia",19
53,Mr MAUGER,GENERAL POST,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1 and 2. The Public Service Commissioner adand Curtis, and vises as followsThe work and responsibility in the Electrical and Mechanical branches differ in each State, and to provide for this, certain positions such as line inspector and mechanician are divided into grades, with an appropriate salary to each. In the latter position there is a range of seven different salaries according to the value and importance of the work - The officers are moved from grade to grade as the importance of the work justifies, The same system is followed in' regard to positions in other branches of the service.

Is he aware that, in consequence, one officer has, after ten years' service, resigned his position ? 4.

NA BUSINESS.",20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Trea surer) [3.5] - I move That on each sitting day, until otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of General business. In submitting the motion,. I desire to say I take this course purely for the puro pose of facilitating the transaction of pubme lic business, so that as soon as possible we Telemay have an opportunity of dealing with I was have under the impression that-, all honourable inmembers understood what was the intention to inof the Government in this connection, but, apparently, the honourable member who took to the course we proposed to adopt last evening was not present at the time that intention was announced. I regret that I am he was absent, because I wished honourable that members to understand exactly what was The proposed before I submitted the motion put which I desired to move last night without notice. The Government do not wish to take Thursday afternoon from private members unless the House is willing to adopt that course, but it seems to me that it would be wise to fall in with that proposal, and' to get on as quickly as possible with the real business of the session. Honourable members who have private business upon-. the notice-paper have been exceedingly considerate to the Government, in that they already voluntarily sacrificed one, if"" not two days,- which should have been deto its consideration. I do not wish to unduly deprive them of an opportunity to transact this private business, but I desire that we shall have no interruption of our ordinary business, and .that as= soon as possible we shall arrive at a determination of the great question which isfor at present so exercising the public mind.",20
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Parramatta)[3.7] - The course which, the Government to. propose is a rather unusual one to adopt at the beginning of a session. On the other hand, the circumstances are of a most urgent character. The need for conserving the time of the House and for devoting every moment that is available to the consideration of Government business, is made apparent when we recollect the short period that remains to us during the pre-* sent year to dispose of the work that is before us. I assume that in taking away from - honourable members the time which is ordinarily allocated to them for the transaction of private business,, the Government will not be averse-if the occasion should offer-to affording them an opportunity to consider that business. That has been the practice hitherto followed, and I take it that a similar course will be followed in the future. But I do think that the public business is more urgent than is any private member's business.' Therefore, I support the Government in their proposal to expedite the transaction of public business so far as is consistent with a full sideration of the urgent matters upon the notice-paper. The sooner we can settle the Tariff, the better it will be for the trading community as a whole, the better for our industrial enterprises, and, indeed, for all concerned. I do not think that any private business upon the notice-paper possesses a tithe of the importance that attaches to the Tariff. I hope, therefore, that the Government will make, good use of their opportunities, and proceed with the discussion of that matter as soon as possible with a view to facilitating its nite settlement. I shall cordially support the Government upon the present occasion.",20
67,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Wide Bay) [3.10] - I should think the honourable member for Parramatta would support the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister. At an earlier stage of the session the honourable member . went so far as to suggest that no time should be devoted to the transaction of private members' business. Upon that occasion, I raised the question of whether there was an Opposition in the House-of whether there was any body of members in this Chamber whose duty it was to conserve the rights of the minority. I entertain quite a different opinion from that of the honourable member. I go so far as to say that nearly every political reform that is worth anything has originated with a private member.",21
68,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,What are they?,21
69,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I may inform the honourable member that the principal question upon which the Tecent elections in Queensland were fought was one which was raised by' a private member some years ago. The Government went to the country upon the issue of having carried out that reform. Every great reform has originated with one or two private members. Mr T OSEPH COOK - What proposal is there of an urgent character upon our business-paper in the name of a private member?,21
70,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The proposal of the Acting Prime Minister is to take away the time which is now available for private memr bers' business, absolutely. If that be done, and an honourable member wishes to bring forward a matter which he regards as of pressing importance he will be obliged to beg the Government to allow him an opportunitv of doing so. There is no difficulty whatever in the way of getting urgent Government business disposed of. If'honorcon- able members are anxious to deal with the Tariff quickly, let us meet upon Mondays in addition to the ordinary days of sitting. The attempt to take from honourable, members the two or three hours whichi are now allotted to them for the discussion of important general business is not the best way of getting the work of the House performed. I am not one of those who believe in giving the whole of the time of Parliament to any Government. It seems to ine that an uneasy haste is being exhibited to develop a situation which is bedefiing contemplated by a number of honourable members at the present time. Believing,'as I do, that the greatest political advantages which we enjoy today are the re- , suit of efforts made by .private members, I shall oppose the motion",21
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Robertson) b - ^ ] ' - I shall-not oppose the motion, al1 though I have upon the business-paper a proposal whichi is set down for a Thursday afternoon, which is not far distant. ' But I rise chiefly to protest against the time which is at present allocated to honourable members for the transaction of private business being taken from them. I entirely agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that the discussions which' take place in this Chamber have an educative influence upon the people. If Thursday afternoon be taken from honourable members, they will not have an opportunity of proceeding with the motions of which they have given notice. I would suggest that, to overcome the difficulty, the House should meet in the mornings as well as the afternoons of the ordinalry days of sitting, especially while the Tariff is under consideration. We could then reach the details of the Tariff, and reduce the duties which have to be reduced at the earliest possible moment. A large number of honourable members come from distant States, and they are compelled to waste morning after morning when they might be doing excellent work here. If we met earlier in the day we could get away earlier in the evening; and an arrangement of the kind would be more convenient to the majority than meeting late in the day and sitting on until a late hour at night. I hope the Government will later propose that we meet in the morning as well as in the afternoon.",21
72,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Fawkner) [3.15] I rise to support the motion of the Acting Prime Minister. I hear on all sides instances of hardship owing to the present uncertain state of affairs. I hope there is nothing in the rumour that after the main discussion of the Tariff and the Budget the Acting Prime Minister intends to introduce new Bills before the discussion of the details of the Tariff is taken. arrangement would postpone the settlement of the items and prolong the state of uncertainty which is doing so much harm in the country.,22
73,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Who said that that proposal would be made ? "" Suspicion "" seems to "" haunt the guilty mind.""",22
74,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The Acting Prime Minister has just said that he would allow nothing to interfere with the rapid settlement of the Tariff.,22
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I did not say so just now.,22
76,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon; but that is what I understood him to say.,22
77,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The Acting Prime Minister now says that he is going to introduce other Bills.,22
78,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I hope the Acting Prime Minister will take this matter into serious consideration. If is of the utmost importance, in the interests of the mercantile, manufacturing and producing communities-in fact, in the interests of the whole of Australia-that the Tariff should be settled. The honourable member for Coolgardie the other night pointed out that we have been already sitting thirty days, and that between now and Christmas there remain only fifty-five or fifty-six sitting days. If we take other business, as I understood the Acting Prime Minister to suggest, a long time will elapse before the Tariff is finally settled. At present, our minds are fresh on the subject, and the business ought to be pushed through without one moment's unnecessary delay.",22
79,Mr FRAZ ER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Kalgoorlie) [3.17] - I absolutely disagree with the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister to deprive members of the little time usually devoted to their business. It is customary in assemblies of this character to see the Opposition standing up for the rights of individual members, and for the interests of the minority; but on the present occasion there is apparently a remarkable combination amongst honourable members opposite to assist the Government to get certain private business out of the road. I suppose we may reasonably infer that there is strong reason for this unanimity. There is really no justification for attempting to deprive private members of the time allotted to them. I thoroughly appreciate the necessity of settling the Tariff as soon as possible, but it is only a few days ago that honourable members opposite were suggesting an adjournment for Such an a week in order to consider the Tariff. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Who made that suggestion ?",22
80,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable. member did not ask for an adjournment, honourable members in the Opposition corner did so.",22
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The suggestion came from the honourable member for Kennedy, who sits in the Ministerial corner.",22
82,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I do not say that the suggestion of an adjournment was exclusively associated with the Opposition corner. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member makes statements without being able to substantiate them.,22
83,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Will the honourable member say,22
84,Mr SPEAKER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Will the honourable member address the Chair?,22
85,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I ask the honourable member for Flinders, through you, Mr . Speaker, whether he is prepared to say that the proposal to adjourn for a week was not supported by honourable members in the Opposition corner?",22
86,Mr WH IRVINE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I was not aware that the proposal was supported by honourable members in this corner.,22
87,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"For the honourable member's information, I shall find out what is the fact. The honourable member for Parramatta will not dispute that the proposal to adjourn for a week received consideration from the occupants of the front Opposition bench.",22
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"What is the reason for all this talk? Mr Frazer!- I am trying to show the inconsistency of honourable members who sire to waste time at one particular of the session, and subsequently endeavour to deprive private members of the time allotted to them.",23
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The suggestion an adjournment was made in order that might get ready for the discussion of Tariff.,23
90,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I have frequently tested, against proposals to adjourn over Friday, and those protests are fully justiconvinced fied by the motion now before us. I dition to the time lost by the adjournments over Friday, we are now asked to abandon the time usually devoted to private members' business. One of the distinguished memdustrial bers in the Opposition corner proposed yesterday that we should adjourn over a day in order to visit the Agricultural Show Flemington.",23
91,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member not need educating?,23
92,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If visiting Agricultural Shows will have the result of educating honourable member for Indi, I think ought to provide him with a free pass shows throughout Australia. In view of proposal to deprive us of a whole day's sit ting, where is the consistency of honourable members who now clamour to deprive have private members of the few hours a ment week usually allotted to them? On one, if not two days, during this session private Commonwealth. members have not taken full advantage of the time allotted to private business, and on no occasion do I ' think hours have been occupied in the exclusive discussion of such business. The honourable member will. member for Parramatta asks what' is the importance of any of the private bers' business on the notice-paper. In like. answer to that, I may point to the motion of the honourable member for West Sydney, as to making provision for the effective fence of our shores by training the men of Australia. In my opinion, that is one the most important proposals on the noticeposite, paper.",23
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It could be just-as effectively discussed on the Estimates. - Mr Frazer - We cannot get an expression of opinion from the House when the Estimates are before us; the only means of ascertaining the opinion of honourable members is by means of a concrete motion, such as that of the honourable member for West Sydney. Of course, if honourable members desire to shelve the question, dethere is justification' for assisting in the period plunder of time as proposed by the Government. Then, again, the honourable member for Riverina has an important motion down forconsideration. That honourable member has had the experience of a disfor puted election, and has been faced with we costs amounting to ^1,000 in order to get the justice from a Court, although he had been returned by a majority in a constituency ; proand if other honourable members had had the a similar experience, they would be firmly of the necessity of the motion of n adwhich the honourable member for Riverina has given notice. The honourable member for Barman also has a motion on the notice paper in favour of bringing all the inconditions of Australia under the only control of the Commonwealth Government.",23
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,A similar motion at has been on the business-paper for six years.,23
95,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That only proves that the limited time for private members' business is responsible for the delay in arriving the at a decision. We are at our wits' end.to we devise some scheme whereby the consumer to and the men employed in the manufactories the of Australia may receive some reasonable consideration under the protection afforded : by the proposals of the Government.

98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is the verymemthing the honourable member would not,23
99,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I can assure the honourable member that he will have an oppordetunity to vote on the question. . I am not one to raise a protest, and then, as we freof quently see amongst honourable members opnot have the moral courage to call for a division. In my judgment the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister is absolutely unjustifiable. The Fire Insurance - Bill, in which I am personally interested, is intended to make insurance companies meet their proper liabilities; and such a proposal is certainly deserving of the conisideration of honourable members.",23
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The Acting Prime ""Minister has promised to find some time Slater on for the consideration of that Bill .",24
101,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"But what prospect have fourteen different motions, all of them of great importance, of receiving consideration in Government time at the end of the session? The honourable member has had - enough experience to know that once we give away our rights there is no chance - of regaining them during the session. I do not care whether the business be considered on the Thursday, Friday, or Mon-day; I am prepared to sit on more days a - week in order that the business of the - country may be satisfactorily carried on.",24
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Nonsens e ! How could we sit more days than we do?,24
103,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not say that we could sit six days a week, but I am prepared to devote more time to the public business. The Government are apparently particularly desirous of getting the Tariff out of the way, though I do not know that they are more desirous than honourable members in the Opposition comer, who doubtless will view affairs through a different pair of spectacles as soon as the Tariff is disposed of.  mining?",24
104,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member to? for Indi has apparently been trying to placate some doubtful voters in his constituency by a suggestion which is entirely outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament.,24
105,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is the one comfort that I have one of the honourable member's leading and most intelligent leagues to support me.,24
106,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It must have been the first view that,24
107,Mr SPEAKER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I very much regret to have to call attention again to stant interruptions and passages at arms which are occurring. They ought not he. I ask honourable members to preserve such order that the speaker may be heard by the House and mvself.,24

109,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Dalley) [3-3 ]- might be excused for thinking, from the remarks of the honourable member for K a lgoorlie, that there is a great deal of important private business on the notice paper ; but as' a matter of fact, there . are set down only nineteen motions and orders of the day for the various dates up to the 24th October, and of these, fifteen are in the names of Government supporters, and only four in the names of members of the Opposition. As a rule, I should be the last a to support a proposal for taking from private members the time allotted for their business; but I wish to refresh the memory of the House as to what ha""s been the experience of this session in regard to the conduct of private members' business. Every honourable member who has a motion to move, refers to it as very important, and, having made a lengthy speech on it , looks round to get some one to move the adjournment of the debate until some date weeks ahead. If these proposals were really of such importance, It is to be assumed that those in charge of them would go on with them as long as possible, until finality was reached. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the subject matters with which the motions and orders of the day now on the business paper deal, can be referred to during the Budget and Tariff discussion which is now proceeding.",24
110,Mr SALMON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Under what heading could the Fire Insurance Bil l be referred,24
111,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The subject of fire insurance could be discussed during the general debate, or on the item "" fire hose"" in the Tariff. M.ost of the. private members' business on the paper consists of abstract propositions, the carrying of which would colhave no immediate effect. An up-to-date Government should have up-to-date measures on its programme, and would not on need the suggestions of private members as to thedesirability of this or that piece of legislation. In any case, very little can the conbe done in the four hours a week now allotted to private members' business. The to settlement of the Tariff is of paramount importance, not to the trading community only, but to the public of Australia. Four or five weeks ago, I said that it would not be settled until after Christmas, and I am a still of that opinion; but we should enitself deavour to deal as soon as possible with proposals for duty which are injuring the for public. The Acting Prime Minister, when he asked for Supply, said that it was intended to proceed with the consideration of 2 0 n e the Budget and Tariff without interruption; but, as the honourable member for Fawkner has pointed out, the honourable gentleman, although he wishes private members to forego their opportunities for pushing forward their business, with a view to expediting the consideration of the Tariff, now himself proposes, to intercept that debate. I voted against the Supply asked for, because I knew that, once the Bill was passed, the Minister could snap his fingers at the House for some time to come, and the change in the order of business which he now intends shows that I was well-advised in taking that course. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that private members have from time to time brought forward ideas which have - been found useful by Governments, but all the suggestions mooted Can be discussed either during the debate on the Budget and Tariff, or during the consideration of the ""Estimates. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie says that it is the duty of an Opposition to support the minority, but' I think it is rather our duty to study the interest of the general public. Seeing that in fifteen of the items of private members' business now on the paper Ministerialists are concerned, the Opposition is not greatly interested in the motion before the Chair; but we consider the proposed duties unjust, iniquitous, and atrocious, and desire that they shall be removed at the earliest moment possible. It has been suggested that we should sit an extra day a week. When I was in the habit of journeying constantly to Sydney at the week ends, I liked to have my Mondays at home; but now that I am living in Melbourne, I am quite willing to come here on Mondays. There are reasons why we should nof sit on Saturdays to which I need not refer. If we sat five days a week, the Government could give one of them to private members, which would be a better arrangement for them than that which has obtained up to the present time. 1 trust that, in future, private members who bring business before the House will press forward with it, instead of consenting to - long adjournments. In any case, they have not the Opposition to blame for this proposal to take time from therm.",24
112,Mr WH IRVINE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Flinders) [3.39]. - The only justification for depriving orable members who have business on the notice-paper of the time allotted under the Sessional Orders is the urgency of Government business. I agree that the consideration of the Tariff is an - urgent matter; but I understand that it is the tention of the Acting Prime Minister to interpolate the consideration of three other measures, the discussion of two of which the Commonwealth Salaries Bill , and the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill - will not occupy much time. Indeed, the passing of one - of these measures is a matter of urgency, because the question with which it deals should be determined in one way or another before the Treasurers of the States make their financial statements. As 'for the third measure which it is proposed to interpolate, the Judiciary Bill , its consideration will involve the relations between the Supreme Courts of the States and the High Court and those between the High Court and the Privy Council, a subject of such momentous importance that three or four days will be required to enable honourable members to express their opinions not merely on its legal and constitutional, but also on its practical aspects. I suggest that, while it will cause little delay to consider, prior to dealing with the Tariff, the other two Bills to which I have referred, there will be serious delay if the consideration of the Judiciarv Bill is interpolated.",25
113,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Coolgardie) [3.42] - It must be a matter of astonishment to honourable members that so much warmth has been introduced into the discussion of this motion, seeing that nearly every previous Government has taken similar action when occasion demanded. I could understand the great wrath of those who have business on the notice-paper, and the chagrin and disappointment which they have so unpleasantly manifested, if they had the slightest hope of carrying any of their propositions to finality this session. But every one knows that there is not the slightest chance of that.",25
114,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,We should not have heard the honourable member speaking in.this way had there been a Home Rule motion on the notice-paper.,25
115,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I advise the honourable member not fo introduce an irrelevant issue. If he persists in doing so, I shall give him a piece of my mind in regard to Home Rule. It was a piece of impertinence on his part to introduce the subject in that way. No honourable member has a right to make an interjection which is irhonrelevant and impertinent.",25
116,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It was neither impertito them nent nor irrelevant.,25
117,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member was not too sure about the Home Rule resolution, so that the"" less he says on the subinject the better it will be for himself.",25
118,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is not so.,26
119,Mr SPEAKER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I ask the honourable member for Coolgardie to confine his remarks to the motion before the Chair.,26
120,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I shall do so, but I claim the right to reply to impertinent allusions to a subject like Home Rule. I am not afraid of any action that I have taken in this House in regard to Home Rule, or any other question.",26
121,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,No one of us is.,26
122,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I advise my youthful and precocious friend to keep quiet. He is not likely to silence me, though I very much regret his irrelevant interruption. Speaking to the motion before the Chair, I wish to say that there is no finality possible in regard to the private members' business on the notice-paper. Even if the motions there set - down were carried, they would have no effect until measures had been passed to give effect to them. I have a notice of motion on the business paper which I am desirous to pass, but I know that there is*a strong feeling outside the House that we should get the Tariff out of the way as soon as possible. There is great unrest in regard to the Tariff in Western Australia and the other States. All over Australia business is in a state of chaos, and we should deal with the Tariff before we attempt to dispose of other measures. As one who was responsible for one of the first notices of motion which appeared on the business-paper, I am prepared to make this concession to the Government, and am surprised at the warmth that has been displayed during this debate. The honourable member for Wide Bay talked of the many magnificent schemes and reforms which had been promulgated by private members in this and other legislatures; but I should like him to consider for a moment where most of them originated - Is it not a fact that for the most part they have originated in the minds of obscure individuals outside Parliament ?",26
123,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Is'ther e no originality in this House?,26
124,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not say that, but I repeat that most of the great movements which have agitated Parliaments, and have led to great reforms, have been originated by men', outside Parliament, in humble walks of life. There is no possibility of any of the notices of motion on the business-paper being dealt with finally during the present session. We have less than fiftv davs within which to deal with the ' [99] Tariff before 'Christmas, and I should like honourable members to say whether there is the slightest chance of Parliament finally passing the Tariff before then.  in which to deal with it.",26
125,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If that were the position, I might be disposed to take up a different attitude; but the public generally consider that we should finish the Tariff before the end of the year. ",26
126,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Then I may be expecting too much.  months in dealing with the old Tariff, which was not half as bad as is the present one.",26
127,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The original object for which the Tariff Commission was appointed was not to bring about the revision of the Tariff as a whole, but to secure the rectification of anomalies. There are many items upon which both the Government and the free-trade and protectionist members of the Commission are agreed, and I hold that we should first dispose .of them and allow that section of the commercial community which is affected by them to settle down once more to business. I am certainly anxious that the whole Tariff should be dealt with by the Parliament before the end of this year. The present uncertainty has caused a great disruption of business. The bulk of commercial people do not care what duties are imposed ; their chief object is to ascertain definitely what the duties are to be, so that they may pass on any increase to their customers. In these circumstances, therefore, the sooner we deal with the Tariff the better it will be for the Parliament and for the people of the Commonwealth.",26
128,Mr SALMON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Laanecoorie) [3.48] As one who has on the business-paper a notice of motion for an early date, I desire to say that I think that the Government proposition is a justifiable one. I sincerely hope that the time to be given up by private members to the consideration of Government business will be used to good effect, and that it will not be devoted to speeches extending over three and four hours such as we have listened to during the last fortnight. If honourable members who have notices of motion on the business-paper are prepared to forego their rights, others who have long speeches in course of preparation should be ready to compress them; i»» order that we may make the best use of trie additional time thus granted to the Government. I was surprised to hear an honourable member suggest that we had over two years in which to deal with the Tariff, and my astonishment was accentuated by the fact that the suggestion came from an ardent free-trader. tionist I hope that we shall deal fairly, honestly, and expeditiously with the Tariff. We have to consider not only the manufacturer and the importer, but the great body of consumers behind them, who are at present suffering because of the general feeiing of unrest in the commercial community, as well as by reason of imposts to which they should not be subjected, and who desire to see the matter finally settled.",26
129,Mr MCWILLIA MS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Franklin)fa.51]. - The suggestion that we should meet on Mondays is, to my mind, an excellent one At the present time full y 75 per cent, of honourable members are in Melbourne every Monday.",27
130,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Why not sit on Saturthe days as well? ,27
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I have long held the opinion that we should sit regularlv Mondays.,27
132,Mr TILLEY BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Rubbish .,27
133,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is ""all very for. a representative of Victoria to receive the suggestion in that way. Surely we should be prepared to extend some conwe sideration to the representatives of other States, who, during the session, have to make their homes in Victoria - It is unfair to them that the session should be unduly protracted by the fact that we sit only days a week, when, we might well sit five. If this suggestion were adopted should, have ample time for the consideraHouse tion of private members' business as well of him. as of Government measures. The proposal that we should hand over to the Executive the whole control of ' Parliament is a serious one. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bav that honourable memtunately bers should retain as far as possible scanty privilege which they at present joy of submitting business once a week. an extra sitting day were decided upon Government would have ample ime to distime pose of the Tariff without depriving hon-- business, it should be recognised that p r i orable members of their only opportunity bring forward measures representinr» views of, at all events, a considerable ority in the House. It is singular whenever a Ministerial proposal is mitted honourable members of the Labour Party invariably abuse the Opposition.

135,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,If the honourable member would move such a motion I should support it . I trust that the House will also refuse to allow any important measures to be brought on for consideration before the Tariff has been dealt with.,27
136,Mr MCDONALD,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Kennedy) [3.55] I trust that the Government will not listen - to the suggestion that we should have an additional sitting day. Like the honourable member for Franklin, I at one time thought' that Parliament should meet every day in week and sit from 10 a.m - until the business of the day had been transacted. During one long session, however, it became necessary for the Legislature, of whichon I was then a member, to sit from Monday.' until Friday, and sometimes on Saturdays, and I can assure the House that after that, well procedure had been followed for two or three weeks every one was anxious that it should be discontinued. My own view is that, should sit only three days a week. If we are to discharge our duties honestly and faithfully it is undesirable that our sittings should extend over a greater number of days. An honourable member, no matter: four what his capacity may be, cannot sit here, on for more than three days a week if he is we to give to the proposals submitted to the that consideration which is expected: Some honourable members may, have a private secretary or an armv of clerks to compile information which they very need regarding the various - proposals from time to time submitted, but others, less forsituated, are full y occupied durthe ing the off-days in preparing themselves enfor the work of the House. Whilst it may If be necessary at times for the Government the to ask honourable members to give up the generally devoted to private members' + ; to vate members must have an opportunity to the introduce motions affecting questions in minwhich they and their constituents are in-' that terested. It is true, as has been said, that' submany great reforms have sprung from mor tions submitted by private members. If may be that Parliament has little originality,- but I know of great reforms which have resulted from the persistent efforts of private members who, session after session, have submitted motions relating to them until the people have been led to recognise their importance, and the Parliament itself has adopted them. I hope . that this privilege will not be lightly taken from honourable members. Having regard to the way in which the time given up to the consideration of private business is sometimes wasted, I have often said that it is not surprising that attempts should be made to do away with the concession.",27
137,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,What is the position when honourable members voluntarily postpone - their morions?,28
138,Mr MCDONALD,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is no wonder that the Government should seek to do away with the privilege when honourable members act in that way. An honourable - member may desire to sub- mit to the House a motion in which he and his constituents take the deepest interest, and private members' day affords him an opportunity of voicing the views of the electors in regard to it. I do not think that those who have objected to the motion should be censured, and I certainly hope - that the Government will not seriously con. sider the suggestion that we should have - an additional sitting day. The reports of the Tariff Commission were presented from 'time to time in the early part of the year, and I am surprised that the Government . did not call honourable members together a month earlier than they did. Had they done so we could have dealt with important measures, and so cleared the way for the consideration of the Tariff as soon as the . Government were prepared to submit it . . I agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie that the Government would act wisely if they asked the Committee to deal first of all with the items in respect to which both sections of the Tariff Commission are unanimous. If they would also drop their preferential trade proposals and accept the protectionist recommendations of the protectionist section of the Commission, I am sure that it would not take long to dispose of the Tariff j but as long as they defend the imposition of exorbitant duties, they must expect their proposals to be criticised at length.",28
139,Mr FOWL ER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Perth) r . o ] - It appears to me that if the Government think it is worth their while to appropriate the two or three hours a week which are at present devoted to the consideration of private [99]- 2 members' business, they ought also to take steps to secure the hours of the forenoon upon ordinary sitting days.",28
140,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We sit long enough already. , »",28
141,Mr FOWLER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy that the number of days upon which we meet should not be increased. But if the work before us is of such an urgent character-and I agree that it is urgent-wh y should we not put in full days-jus t as we do on Fridays?,28
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Let us commence sitting at daylight and continue till midnight.,28
143,Mr FOWLER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is farcical for the Government to pretend that the three or four hours a week which, under this motion they will be able to snatch from private members, will be of material' assistance to them in shortening the debate upon the Tariff. If they are sincere in their protestations, they should at least take steps to secure more time for the consideration of that matter. It is quite possible that some arrangement might be made by which the HouSe might sit during the forenoon upon ordinary days of meeting, and proceed with the consideration of Government business. Personally, I believe that the afternoon which is devoted to the discussion of private members' business is well spent. . While I desire to see the Tariff disposed of as soon as possible, I suggest that private members' business should not be interfered with, but that some other method of insuring additional time for the consideration of Government measures should be devised. ' . Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [4.2]. - I shall vote against the motion, because I believe that the privileges enjoyed by private members are so few that they ought to be jealously guarded. No difficulty should be experienced by the Government in proceeding with the consideration of the Tariff. If I had a motion upon the business-paper, and I deemed that the Tariff .was of greater importance than it, the Acting Prime Minister would only need to approach me with a request that I should allow its consideration to be deferred, to insure that course being adopted.",28
144,Mr BATCHELOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I should like to see the individual who would convince the hon4 orable member that the Tariff was of more importance.,28
145,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I have been convinced that Government business was more important than my own private business - upon many occasions, both in this Parliamembers, ment and in the South Australian Parliatuents, ment. Undoubtedly, the honourable memday ber who is chiefly concerned ought to be the judge as to whether his business or of the Government is the more urgent. I ance. do not see a singli motion upon the busischedule ness-paper with which honourable members are not familiar. If the Government desire to expedite the transaction both of public and private members' business, why cannot we agree to take a vote upon these quesquently. tions right away ? They have all been cussed, and honourable members know exdo actly the position that they occupy in respect of them. As a rule honourable carried members put motions upon the busiit. ness-paper because they wish practicbers' ally to talk to their constituents. desire to educate their constituentsa very proper thing-bu t I say that when the authors of these motions have made speeches, a vote might just as well be taken upon them. I decidedly object to increasing the hours of sitting. I come to this House I am in attendance continuously throughout the sittings, wheresessed as some honourable members are present .for only two or three hours. I would further remind honourable members that Ministers are obliged to be present throughout entire days upon which the House meets, and it is too much to expect them to be able to attend to departmental affairs if present hours of sitting be extended.",28

He entertains the view that the rights of private members should not be lightly interferred with, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie pressed a similar opinion. Of course, all know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has, what he conceives to most important measure upon the businesshonorable paper, and in speaking in the way that, did, he was, to certain extent, defending own interests. He has declared that the Opposition has failed to support the rights of private members. I am a member of the Opposition, and I desire to see the present Government displaced as soon as possible. Consequently, I can perceive reason why the progress of business should be delayed any longer than is unavoidable. At the same time, I hold that we are not here to consider the interests of private but rather those of our constiand of the country at large. Tothe whole trade of Australia is being dislocated by the fact that the Tariff prothat posals of the Government remain in abeyThe sooner that the items in the are disposed of the better for all concerned. For that reason I shall support the motion of the Acting Prime Minister, although I do not anticipate that I shall be able to adopt a similar course very fredis- - Mr BATCHELOR (Boothby) [4.9] - I not care very much whether the motion proposed by the Acting Prime Minister be or not, although I intend to support I do object, however, to private membusiness being allowed to interrupt the They consideration of Government business. It is a mistake to set apart Thursday afternoon for dealing with private members' their business. When we proceed with the consideration of the Tariff on Tuesday afternoon, the discussion should continue until When 'Thursday night without interruption. Then, if honourable members who are posof ideas desire to meet on Friday or Monday to facilitate the transaction of private members' business, I shall offer no objection to that course being adopted - If the the Government cannot carry the motion they should at least set apart Friday, instead of Thursday afternoon, for the conour sideration of private members' business. Mr CHANTER . (Riverina) [4. n ] - I that the Government deem it necesresary thus early in the session to ask honorKenable members who have private business upon the notice-paper to forego their rights in connection with that business. I recognise that gradually our rights and privileges are being whittled away. Originally a whole and day in each week was devoted to the busiexness of private members, but the time we placed at their disposal was subsequently limited to portion of-a day, and later still be a it was reduced to about four hours. The member for Dalley has stated that he honourable members themselves evince so his little desire to prosecute their motions that they frequently agree to the adjournment of the debate upon them for a period of six weeks. From his parliamentary experience he must know that, as the session advances, the business-paper becomes seriously no congested, so that it is necessary for honourable members who are interested' in private business-afte r they have concluded their own speeches-to agree to its adjournment for a period of six weeks in order to secure another opportunity for its consideration.",29

148,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I am not in favour of abolishing the right of private members' to deal with public business. At the same .time, I do not desire to see the present system continued. I believe in setting apart .one day in each week upon which private members should be afforded an opportunity .to deal with their business. The decision of the House in respect to many matters (brought forward by private members is of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. I cannot avoid saying that if this motion be carried it will not have the effect of expediting the close of the discussion - upon the Tariff. The members of the Opposition should recognise that they have a public duty to perform by refraining from - speaking at undue length upon the general debate on the schedule, seeing that their remarks will be repeated ad nauseam when we reach the separate items. The real solution of the present difficulty is for the Acting Prime Minister to invite the Standing Orders Committee to frame a new standing order, imposing a time limit upon the speeches of honourable members. The opinion I have expressed has been formed after due consideration, and I repeat that, even if the Acting Prime Minister succeeds with this motion, he will not gain one fraction of time for the more important business of the Tariff. I decline to vote away my privileges, or the privileges of my constituents, and the private ..business which I have in hand is not in my personal interests, but in the interests of the Commonwealth. We know that private members usually receive a promise that the Government will facilitate ""in every way possible private members' business ; and I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will - announce that at the termination of the consideration of the Tariff, - or at some other time, ample opportunity will be afforded, not only to reach, but to dispose of the private business on the notice-paper.

I have agreed to adjourn at times which I thought were reasonable, but while the debate on the Budget continues-and I hope that it will not continue much longer- I think it is fair that on Thursdays it should not be interrupted by private business. I do not wish to press that suggestion if honourable members will not approve of it, but I feel that I am not asking too much in requesting that private business shall not intervene during the progress of the debate. As I say, there was a fairly full House at the time, and not one objection was raised; and I therefore took it for granted that honourable members were in accord with the suggestion.",30

155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I shall try to do so. Of course, much will depend on the method adopted in regard to dealing with the T a r if f ; but I will afford an opportunity for members' business as early as I possibly can. The honourable member for Riverina suggested that a recommendation should made to the Standing Orders Committee curtail the length of speeches; but motion to that effect would take nearly as long to discuss as the Tariff itself. Of course, I have no desire whatever to resort to the closure if I can.possibly it ; the closure is for use only in cases of absolute necessity. The honourable member for Kennedy suggested that Parliament too late in the year. The honourable ber must have forgotten that the Prime Minister and myself were in England, and that the reports of the Tariff Commission were not all submitted until time after we had returned.

159,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Macquarie) [4.33] - Las t night I briefly outlined my attitude towards the Tariff, before I , in deference to the wishes of the Committee, asked that progress be reported. I stated that I had secured the support of my constituents by advocating the principles of the new. protection. wish now to make clear what I conceive to be the difference between the new and - the old protection. The old, unregulated protection licensed the exploitation of the - community by capitalists. It is needless .to say that I ' a m against that form of protection, and advocate the new protection. Many of the members of the Opposition - decline to have to do with anything new. .They adhere so faithfull y to the musty traditions of the - past that they stand aghast when it is proposed to depart from precedent. On this aspect I differ from ,the honourable member for Parkes, who .'accepts nothing new;. were he an angel I should be afraid of being, considered the other thing, but as he is not an angel no .odium rests on me - The natural protec-tion of distance and carriage, about which - the members of - the Oppositionhave :^pokenso - much is not sufficient to permit NOES. the proper development of our industries. It is not allowed to operate freely, because so many of the manufacturing industries of other countries are controlled^ as by the American trusts and combines, in such a way that their productions can be landed here cheaply or dearly as it suits their PAIR. book. Where combines are operating to our detriment, it is desirable to protect ourselves from foreign importations. Under a high Tariff, without the restraints which I should like to see imPAPERS. posed, manufacturers take advantage of their position to charge what prices they like in the home market, flooding free ports Regulations- with their surplus output. That flooding has happened in Australia over and over again, and we must, in self-preservation, protect ourselves from such inundation, until we can satisfactorily develop the manufacturing side of our national life, which should be a complement to our primary production. I hope to see protection accompanied BUDGET. by an active closer settlement policy, to relieve the congestion of our population. With that subject. I shall deal at greater length further on. If it were necessary to detail instances in which we have suffered by importations from other countries, I could recite the facts relating to the American harvester combine, showing how it depreciated and inflated prices, but I think that honourable members have already sufficient information on the subject. Besides the protectionist point of view in regard to the Tariff, I wish to put befpre the Committee the workers' point of view. The workers hope that, by encouraging inI dustrial enterprise, they will obtain more employment. But they have no wish to become slaves, and feel that those appointed to administer the affairs of Australia must prevent anything in the nature of slavery from being brought into existence. Employment under harrowing conditions tends to undermine the stamina of the race, and we must take precautions against unfairness on the part of employers. The workers have supported me because I announced myself to be opposed to everything in the nature of imposition. The honourable member for - Parkeshas accused the Government of having introduced a Tariff without considering the consumers, or the moral and physical development of the race, but it is the humanitarian aspect of this policy, with which I am concerned, and the need for its consideration ismainly responsible for my. entry into politics. We, of course, rnust consider the consumers, of whom 1 suppose fully 80 per cent, are workers, as distinct from the 20 per cent, who live on investments, and in this connection I propose to define the principles of what I have alluded to as the new protection: I have on several occasions heard questions asked as to. the meaning of this term, and the manner in which the proposals which it embraces will operate, even those who are opposed to protection as ordinarily understood professing ignorant of what is meant. The Tariff itself I characterize as crude and cumbersome. It is an abortive attempt to reconcile the principles of revenue tariffism and protection, which, it must be admitted, are mutually destructive, and therefore cannot satisfactorily co-exist. The of revenue has induced the Government to impose heavy duties on goods which cannot be produced within the Commonwealth; but which, saries of life, must be imported. opinion that duties should be imposed upon goods which can be produced within the Commonwealth, so long as their local manufacture is properly regulated; but I am opposed to mere revenue. duties. revenue is needed, I should like to see ""adopted a form of taxation which will be bitterly opposed in some quarters, but which I think we shall have to resort to in justice to the community at large, in order to secure, not, perhaps, equality of tion, but equality of sacrifice in taxation. No' doubt those who sit on the Opposition corner benches will that while the Commonwealth revenue by means of Customs and Excise duties, it should not impose direct taxation ; but when the interests of the communitv are opposed to those of individuals the latter must suffer, the divine rights of man being paramount to the rights of property. The Government, however, in its unscrupulous haste to increase revenue, has, by its ukase, levied duties on goods which cannot be produced in the Commonwealth, and on goods which can be, but are not at present being made here. Most of us have heard of the consignment of which has had to be returned, cause of the increase in the duty to £5. The Tariff has been awkwardly It should have been tempered to the public. Ships which prior to its introduction had called at one Australian port should have been allowed to discharge their cargoes at that and their remaining ports of call wither. Carr. in the Commonwealth free of duty. The Tariff need not have fallen with such sledge-hammer force on importers; the clumsy and haphazard manner of its introduction has discredited protectionists. The new protection which I shall vote for,, and which I have advocated on the platform, means the imposition of high' duties on goods which can be manufactured i» Australia, combined with the regulation of the conditions of manufacture. to be Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Cannot we make bicycles in this country ?",32
160,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but consignments in ships already on the water before the introduction of the new Tariff should have been unloaded duty free. I believe that it is the intention of the. Ministry to proneed vide against the charging of exorbitant prices by protected manufacturers, and the sweating of workers such as has obtained in other countries, and I honour Ministers as neces- for it. Proposals to that end will cerI am of tainly get my' support. But, in my opinion, it is not intended to go far enough in the regulation and control of industries. To my mind, the conditions stated by the leader of the Labour Party approach most If more nearlv to what is desirable. All attempts at restriction and control interfere with private enterprise, but it is better that there should be such interference than that the lives of the people should be made hard, and that they should be compelled to bear taxaunnecessary burdens. The growing intelligence of the democracy sees the necessity for controlling huge manufacturing indusprotest tries, so that the public may have a greater can . raise share of the wealth which they create, and may no longer be overridden by capitalists. The members of the Labour Party express that growing sentiment, and I , as a young Australian, desire to voice it . I have no wish to indulge in extravagant language, but I trust that we shall have formulated a scheme which will be just in its incidence, and will tend to the moral elevation, of the people, and the national development of the Commonwealth. That is a reasonable proposition, and represent* ing, as I do, the young Australian sentibicycles ment, as I may term it , I am hopeful of beits being embodied in the new Tariff. We are all familiar with the proposal subintroduced. mitted by the leader of the Labour Party that goods manufactured"" or prepared under fair conditions of labour, shall bear the Commonwealth trade maTk, and that others shall bear an Excise duty stamp so that unscrupulous employers may be brought: into line with those who have decided to observe the conditions laid down. That is a. fair proposition, and I am disposed to think that very few Excise duty stamps will be purchased. Then, again, the leader of our party rightly says that some provision must be made to regulate prices. T hat will entail the appointment of a tribunal to adjudicate on questions relating to prices, and although some objection may be taken to this innovation, I repeat that we must either interfere, or be interfered with.",33
161,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It is a proposal very difficult to carry out.,34
162,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I recognise that it is, since the Tariff Commission was able into details in regard to prices in order determine what the ad valorem duties, in certain cases, should be, it seems that we should be able to go a step fursome means to ease the burden. ther. Unless we are going to allow the people to be exploited, the problem must grappled with. No one can deny that they have been exploited in connection' with the new duties on tobacco, since prices have been increased in respect to goods the increased duty has not been paid. A careful scrutiny of the facts is not necessary in order to determine that this course has been adopted, and I hold that principle of protecting the public might well be extended. When we know that such tactics are indulged in by unscruputries lous persons, the Government, as the presentative of the people, should be* petent to provide measures for the procable tection of the people. It is true that we plicable to others. have no precedent for what we now propossible pose, but the Parliament has as much right to establish as' to follow precedents. The people have to be protected, and I believe that the public generally will insist on such a system of protection as I have dicated.",34
163,Mr HANS IRVINE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If the duties reduced, would the honourable member be those in favour of refunds being made?",34
164,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We could not trace those to whom the duties had been passed on. There are already in the Tariff provisions which embody, to a large extent, the posal I have advocated. We find, for stance, that the duties under Division VIA . w'hich relates to Metals and Matent chinery, areTo come into operation on dates to be by proclamation, and exeir.pt from duty meantime. Proclamation to issue so soon is certified to Parliament by the .Minister that the manufacture to which the proclamation refers has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. That is the very principle to which the Minister of Trade and Customs took exception when I said that it might well have been extended to the cycle making industry. I hold that it can be amplified, and that there are in the Tariff many items that might have been subjected to similar conditions. Such a system enables the interests of the consumer to be safeguarded during the time that must necessarily elapse between the passing of the Tariff and the establishment of the industries that it is but designed to encourage. There is a gap to go which must be filled, no matter what to system of protection we devise. Until our industries are in a position to meet the deto me mands made upon them we must adopt I find that in many cases duties have been slapped be on,-although the Government know very well that the industries to which they relate are not in a position, to meet local requirements, and that therefore the public on which for a time will be fleeced.",34
165,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The v never will be in a position to meet local demands unthe less we give them some encouragement.,34
166,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Then why not provide that the duties relating to such indus-' shall come into operation on dates to rebe fixed by proclamation? If the princomciple embodied in Divison VI.A be appli-. to some cases, it must surely be apI recognise that it is that designing combines beyond the Commonwealth might, durng the interim, offer their goods at cutting rates, in 'order to prevent .the development of industries in Australia; but where it could be inshown that such tactics were being resorted to, it would be open to the Government to impose a duty sufficient to place the local were manufacturer on an equal footing with trusts. We have had an' illustration of what rnav be done by a combine in connection with the kerosene industry, attemnts to develop which were made in New South Wales some time ago. Retorts were proinstalled, and some kerosene was turned inout there, but the Standard Oil' Company immediately reduced prices to such - an exas to prevent the local article securing a footing on. the market. T recognise fixed that it mav be necessary to impose a small in the duty to safeguard local manufacturer^ as it from such attacks; but we should provide that when, later on, a) proclamation is issued, showing that in the opinion of the Minister the industry has been sufficiently established in Australia, the impost shall be so increased as to shut out imports. There should also be a provision that the local manufacturers shall maintain their present prices, observe proper conditions of labour, and produce a kerosene that will pass the proper flash-light test.. I see nothing to prevent the adoption of that course. would involve a little more responsibility than is usually undertaken by a Government, but the welfare of the people of our own land should be the first concern of the Ministry. Every able-bodied man, every intelligent unit, is an additional asset to the State, and it is because we have regard to the well-being of the individual that we stipulate that any protection that is granted shall be hedged about in the way I have indicated. The necessity for such a provision is amply demonstrated in connection with the kerosene industry. At the present time the shale miners in New South Wales can turn out only crude oils, such as solar and residual oils; but they would be in a position to produce the finished article-kerosene-if they were protected against the Standard Oil Company. I am sure that the people of Australia would far sooner burn a locally-produced illuminant than an imported one. The New South Wales Shale Company are prepared to give a bond'that they, will not charge 'more for their oil than 'the Standard Oil Company is charging. I understand that their price at present is n d . per gallon, whilst that of the Standard Oil Company is io}d. The difference is so small as to be scarcely worthy of consideration.  as compared with the-price that prevailed a few years ago.",34
167,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"That is a question with which ""the tribunal to be appointed would have to deal. If the evidence brought beview fore it showed that the price was extravaviding gant, it would recommend that the proteclocal tion granted the industry should be condiwire tional on a reduction in rates. We must duty shall be imposed. have more of this regulation of the commanufacturers mercial relationships of men; because, when they are left uncontrolled, it' Australia, is only human nature for one man - them to trv to make as much as he can dition out of another. ' The greed for profit, a general rule, knows ro moral law, and will just-as unconcemedlv sacrifice the lives plied at a satisfactory price. of the community, as it will sacrifice lives of any other animals to the attainment of its own ends. We have evidence of thisin the operations in other countries of huge combines, without bodies to be kicked or souls to be damned. We do not desire the establishment of such monopolies in Australia, and therefore we must face the issue like men, and provide against their possibility.",35
168,Mr SAMPSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the Shale Company It guarantee to produce kerosene as good as. the imported article?,35
169,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Exactly . My contention: is that the local production should be submitted to the usual flashlight test - - Surely we have in our midst men capable of conducting such tests. In England the test is applied in a more satisfactory way tham it is in the United States of America, and , 1 in consequence the kerosene sold there is of very high quality.",35
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is no difficulty in making such tests heie.,35
171,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Quite so. To come now to another item in the Tariff, I . think thatwire netting ought to be exempt from duty until it is known that local manufacturersare in a position to supply the demand. There would be no difficulty in embodying, such a provision in the Tariff. As a matter of fact, however, we find that a duty of 3o> per cent, has been imposed, although it iswell known that the local manufacturers cannot satisfy the demand for wire netting in Australia. There has been a great outcry in regard to this duty, and I , for one,, would have been prepared to support a motion censuring the Government for proposing the duty without imposing any conditions - They might' very well have temr pered the impost to the man who is deserving of every consideration-to the small farmer who has to depend upon wire netting to protect his land from the rabbit invasion. The object which the Government have in might have been accomplished by pro- . that, as soon as it is shown that the manufacturers can turn out sufficient netting to supply the local demand, a When the local could show that they were'in a position to satisfy the requirements of we should be justified in granting ample protection, subject to the conthat fair rates of pay should be enas joyed by the workers in the industry, and that - a satisfactory article should be sup*I un r the derstand that many manufacturers do not ask for higher prices than were ruling prior to the introduction of the Tariff. The Mildura fruit-growers, for instance, recently stated that they did not desire higher prices for their dried fruits, and that they would not attempt to obtain an increase, since they were satisfied with the extended . markets that protection would give .them. That is the spirit that I should like to see manifested throughout Australia. Unfortunately, in very many quarters it does not occur spontaneously, and it is the duty of the Government in the interests of the people to spur it on. I , for one, am .anxious that manufacturers and others shall .be compelled to take up such a-position. Item 168 in division VI . savours of the condition that I desire to see attached to .the Commonwealth system of protection. It providesAny dutiable machinery or machine tool, or any part thereof specified in any proclamation - issued by the Governor General in pursuance of - a joint address passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of the Parliament, stating tfhat such machinery, machine tool, or part cannot be reasonably manufactured within the Commonwealth, and that it should be admitted free, shall be free. That is a reasonable provision, and it is one that the daily press have very carefully ignored. None of the redeeming features of the Tariff have been put before the public by them. this provision that I pin my faith, and it has formed the basis of my defence of the Tariff. I trust that the fullest advantage will be taken of such provisions, and that we shall, in short, go as far as we possibly can in the direction of regulating, in the way proposed by the Labour Party, the system of protection that we adopt. wish now to deal with duties that have been imposed purely for revenue purposes. am averse to a revenue Tariff. Of course - I know that free-trade in its literal sense is impossible. Free-traders themselves admit that free-trade is synonymous with a revenue Tariff. The terms have become synonymous by usage, but I am not disposed to regard them as such. I do not fayour a revenue Tariff, and I will use my best endeavours to defeat proposals tending in that direction. The Government, in their desire to grant a large measure of protection to industries, have increased the duties upon certain commodities. .realise that they cannot derive much revenue .from the goods thus penalized, and accordinglv they have been compelled - to resort ,to duties upon the necessaries of l if e duties to which I am opposed. Upon cutr lery a duty of 20 .per cent, has been levied. We have no hope of manufacturing cutlery in Australia. The conditions required for its production are of a peculiar character. Its manufacture requires natural conditions which do not obtain in .Australia, in addition to which the necessary market is not available here. In the course of twenty or thirty years, when we have a closer settlement policy in full swing, that market may be available, and, perhaps, artificial conditions may then be introduced to take the place of those natural conditions which - are so necessary to the successful manufacture of cutlery. A duty of 20 per cent, has also been imposed upon cash registers and computing scales. Again, I say that we have no hope of manufacturing these articles in the Commonwealth.. They are patented machines, and, in addition, their manufacture involves the outlay of a vast amount of capital. Special knowledge is also necessary, and it is manifest that in Australia the necessary market to warrant the establishment of factories for their production is not available. The same remark is applicable to surgical apparatus and appliances.",35
172,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Would the honourable, member put them upon the free list?",36
173,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Certainly . It is to Mr HENRY WILLIS - And also wire netting?,36
174,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In regard to wire netting, I have already said that until our manufacturers are able to supply the local demand, that article should be admitted free. When our local manufacturers are able to cope with the demand I in Australia we may erect a tariff wall as high as we choose, so long as we retain I the right to regulate prices, and the conditions of labour under which the industry shall be conducted. The Government have also imposed a duty upon currants, although we cannot grow them in Australia.",36
175,Mr HEDGES,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,We are growing them. The honourable member ought to travel.,36
176,Mr SAMPSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,We shall be exporting currants presently.,36
177,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"At any rate, we are not producing currants equal in quality to the Grecian currant, about which there is a They peculiarity which places - it in a class by itself. If it can be demonstrated that we can grow currants successfully I shall not object to the duty - I wish to encourage Australian industries, .but' I am credibly informed by those in the trade and by fruit-growers that we do not produce currants which, from the stand-point of quality, approach the Grecian currants.",36
178,Mr SAMPSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member, must have been consulting the importers.",37
179,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I have consulted no importers.,37
180,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member say that we cannot grow currants in Australia?,37
181,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I am assured that we cannot produce currants equal to the Grecian currants. Then a heavy duty has been imposed upon magazines. I cannot support that duty, because it seems to me to represent a tax upon intellect, and in Australia we not flatter ourselves that we have a monopoly of the intellect of the world. Further, we cannot hope to see these magazines published in Australia. Of course, I am aware that the imposition of the duty is defended upon the ground that it is really, a tax upon the advertisements contained in these publications. But I would point out that these advertisements are not inserted on account of the circulation which the magazines en-, joy in Australia, but on account of the larger circulation which they enjoy at home. In any case, we must recollect that it is the prices paid for the advertisements which bring these magazines within the reach of the entire reading community. The advertisements thus enable our people to acquire a better knowledge of things in general, which cannot fail to be advantageous to them. I protest against this proposal to tax the thought of the world, and to erect a barrier between it and our own people. The duty upon magazines differs from duties imposed upon ordinary commodities. We cannot comprehend all the variety of human thought, all the elevated intellect of the day, and that being so, I say that we should give our people free access to these magazines. I happen to possess a little knowledge of advertising, and I know that the largest advertisements to be found in magazines are also to be found in the AustraJian newspapers. The authors of these advertisements do not rely upon the magazines to give their wares publicity in Australia, because the circulation, of these periodicals here is limited. For every copy that is bought a dozen are borrowed, but after allowing for that, the advantage accruing from advertisements in magazines here is infinitesimal. Then a heavy tax has been imposed upon certain prepared infants' foods. I suppose some honourable members will urge that those foods can be made in Australia. We can make some of them, but we cannot make certain special preparations for infants. These derive their chief virtues from qualities which are inherent in the soil of their country of origin. In addition there are tradesecrets connected with the manufacture of these foods. When I consider that the duty imposed upon them is equivalent to.about 4d. per tin I say that, in the interests of the race and of the child life of the Commonwealth, these articles should be admitted free. We ought not to tax infants' foods. It is a crying shame to docan- so-mother s experience the crying portion of it-bu t I think that at least we should be sympathetic. Apart from the sentimental phase of the question, I desire to> emphasize the national phase. If we wish* to develop a healthy type, it is imperative that we should conserve our child life. That result can be assured only by bestowing proper attention upon children in their babyhood. There are certain infants'"" foods, the manufacture of which generations of protection would not stimulate,, and these should certainly be made as free as possible to the people. The overweening desire of the Government for revenue is made manifest by their action in regard to these questions. They have levied duties upon the poor indiscriminately. Whilst in some cases they have imposed higher duties upon the rich, they have also imposed what the honourable member for Parkes calls "" equality of taxation."" I do not want equality of taxation, but equality of sacrifice in taxation. It is all very well for the honourable member for Parkes to talk about the national spirit, and the universal liability of the community to bear its share of taxation, but if I were to say that the people should share equally in natural opportunities, and, consequently, in the wealth of the country, he would at once tell us quite a different tale. We should then hear all the old cries about the rights of property. I propose to discriminate in this matter of taxation. We must have equality of sacrifice, rather than equality of taxation, and we shall not get equality of sacrifice by taxing infants' foodsThere are some items of the Tariff which,, as I have alreadv indicated, should come under Division VI.A. I refer to commoditieswhich admittedly we can produce in Australia, but which we are not in a position toproduce immediately. Amongst these commodities might be classed rubber specialties. We do not grow rubber yet. The duty upon these articles would clearly be a revenue duty for the time being. I say that it is incumbent upon us to conserve the rubber industry by all the means in our power. But let us conserve it by some such provision as is embodied in Division VI . A . Upon cartridges, a duty of 30 per cent, has been imposed, notwithstanding that we do not manufacture them in Australia. Up to the present, we have no arms or ammunition factory in the Commonwealth, and until we have, cartridges should be admitted free. We must recollect that they are largely used by the poorer classes of the community-by the man who gets a half-holiday on Wednesday or Saturday. The fact is that the Government propose to penalize the wage-earner every time. Further, I hold that the duty of 5s. 6d. which has been levied upon single-barrelled guns, and of l is . upon double-barrelled, should be deferred until it has been certified that we are in a position to manufacture these weapons in Australia - It would be a very easy matterfor the Minister of Trade and Customs to keep in touch with our local manufacturers-especiall y with the aid of a tribunal such as we propose to appoint - and to ascertain exactly at what period the duty should be made operative. Upon .woollens, a duty of 35 per cent, has been levied. Now, we all know that we can manufacture woollen goods locally. yield to no man in my desire to see the woollen industry developed, and the raw products made up in Australia, instead of being sent abroad to provide employment for other than our own operatives. I object to transferring this industrial activity from Australian to other shores. But the position is that we cannot at present produce the supplies required by Australia, otherwise we should not have imported over 000,000 worth of woollen goods last year. I admit that we ought to be manufacturing all these goods. But, pending . the time when we shall be in a position to manufacture sufficient for our own reauirements, why should we levy a 'duty of 35 per cent, upon them? I sav again, that Division VI . A of the Tariff should apolv to woollens. A duty should not be imposed, or, at anv rate, the duty ought not to be increased, until our local manufacturers are able to supply the demand. Then I venture to say the people of Australia would be quite satisfied to buy the local product. Indeed, I go further and say that now the tendency is merely to forget the local manufacturer when purchasing woollens. There is some fetish about foreign-made goods, particularly English-made goods, and these are asked for, but I think that the people would not at all object to being compelled to be patriotic and' to buy the local article.",37
182,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The only way to malce them patriotic is to impose a protective Tariff.,38
183,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"When once the local manufacturers are able to supply the demand we may build the Tariff as high as Heaven itself. What I say is that the high Tariff has been put on too soon, when local manufacturers cannot supply the goods, the people, in the meantime, being fleeced. To this I object; we have no right to ""take down"" the people while local manufactures are in process of development, and the Government should have made provision in the case of woollens, so that the Tariff could be imposed by proclamation on its being ascertained that the local manufacturers could supply the demand. Of course, this would entail more supervision; but we cannot be indifferent to the welfare of the people. I, for one, am quite prepared to take all the trouble that is necessary in order to ptotect the people from exploitation during the time which must elapse between the imposiI tion of a duty and the period when the local manufacturers can supply the demand ; and in the meantime I object to a duty of 35 per cent, on woollens. The same remarks applv to agricultural machinery, on which there is a duty of 20 per cent. There is no guarantee that the agricultural machinery required in this country can be made here in sufficient quantities to supply the demand; we cannot turn it out at a moment's notice, and vet. in the meantime, high duties have to be paid. This, of course, has simplv furnished free-traders with arguments against the proposals of the Government; and T very much regret the fact. The incidence of the Tariff should have been temnered much more than it is. Portable engines and. other similar machinery are taxed to the extent of 30 per cent., although they are not made in Australia, and it will certainlv be a year or two before they can be made here. Until the local manufacturer, when assured of effective protection, undertakes to supply this class of article at a reasonable cost-which could be ascertained in the same that value is ascertained for the purpose ad valorem duties-it should be free. Then, ment of cut prices. again, the same remark applies to wire-netengaged ting machines, on which a duty of 25 per cent, is imposed, and which should, in opinion, come under the operation of Divion sion VI.A of the Tariff. The proposed duties on mining engines and machinery has supplied further arguments to the oppothe nents of a protected Australia; and I. gard that policy as an' essential to national development. There has been a haphazard imposition of duties of 35 cent., evidently with the view of raisabandon ing revenue; and I hope, to see , the Government modify their proposals in this connection. 1 do not care how high the protective duties may be so long as we are satisfied that the articles which bear the duties can be produced here at a reaThe sonable price, with proper working condimunity, tions in the factories. Churns, refrigerexists ators, and so forth bear a duty of 25 cent., though we all know that these articles are not produced in Australia. duties mean taxation to those least able bear it, more particularly the farming community, and on behalf of the latter protest against the impost. Then there anomalies in the Tariff ; and one was brought under my notice only the other dav.. Umbrellas, as before, bear a duty 20 per cent., but the silk, which cannot be made in Australia, has to bear a duty increased by 5 per cent., while the sticks also carry a heavy impost. The raw mateout rials, so to speak, of the industry are taxed, whilst the finished article is not taxed; and this means that those now enenhanced gaged in the business will not foe compete with the outside world. Under the' old Tariff, it was possible to produce raise rents. umbrellas liere as cheaply as manufacturers are producing them in other countries, but if the imposition were removed, the' local producer would be inundated with the surplus foreign product, and we should lose the inapplv dustry. There should have been more disdemand, cretion exercised in the imposition of duties. Totax the raw materials of an industry which is already established, simply suicidal, so far as industrial deand velopment is concerned. I consider that'those engaged in the industry I have just mennot, tioned were only charging reasonable prices, which would comDare favourably with the prices of the article from overimproved Mr Carr. - ESENTATIV E S.] Budget. sea; but, as 1 say, if the protection be way removed, there will be an inundation of of the foreign product, with the accompaniAt any rate, those in the umbrella industry cannot, aftora to pay the increased duties on their my raw material without increased protection - the manufactured article; and I hope to see this anomaly removed. There are . other anomalies, but I shall not take up time of the Committee by referring to rethem, reserving my remarks until we reach the items. Of course, I realise, aiming, as I do, at high protection in order to stimuper late industries, that in so far as we a revenue Tariff we render some other form of taxation necessary. By "" another for m "" of taxation, I mean direct taxation, and until we have direct taxation, we can never get an equitable adjustment of the public burdens in Australia. land reflects the wealth of the comjust in proportion as that wealth and varies-that is an economic per principle. We must raise more of our revenue from the land than from any other The source; and I have frankly told the fartomers in my constituency that they are now paying five times as much as they would 1 in the way of land taxation. They have are to pay railway freight up and down to the centres of industry, and they have been taxed largely for the construction of railof ways which constitute the arteries of the country, and, in addition, they aTe paying interest on the public debt and Customs duties. A land tax, as I have pointed to them, would relieve them considerably of these impositions, and then, and then only, will they reap the benefit of the values which they, more than any able to other class, help to create.",38
184,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,A land tax would,39
185,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Would it? If a land tax were imposed on idle 'lands, which are held for speculative purposes, use would be made of those lands, and, of course, rents would be lowered. To say that is only to the ordinary crude law of supply and which now applies where it should not apply, namely, to flesh and blood. If the law, however, were applied to the land, is it would make land cheap, and not dear; the only way to compel the use of land is to impose a land tax. Such a tax would as some suppose, hurt the farmer. In New South Wales the farmers, on a moderate estimate, hold only ^20,000,000 of .unvalue in land,- whereas the unim: proved value of the squatters' land in that :State is ^47,000,000, while the unimproved value of land in Sydney is ^40,000,000. These are all moderate estimates. will be seen, therefore, that a land tax would hit the rich landlords of Sydney, and the weathy squatters with their princely revenues, and . banks much harder than it would ordinary farmers; and the figures show how the land tax would automatically adjust ""itself to aggregations of wealth. By such a tax we should get equality of sacrifice in taxation, instead of equality in taxation; and equality in taxation is unfair. I have' pointed out, over and over again, how, if there were a reduction of 60 per cent, in railway freights, and a land tax of 3d. in the pound, the average farmer with 500 acre"" would save £ 2 0 a year. Honourable members of the Opposition corner, who declaim against interference with the divine rights of property, seem to have no regard for the divine rights of men. - But those honourable members will have to 'be brought to their senses. As soon as the majority of the - community, who are the ""working population, see their way clear, there-will be a re-adjustment of taxation, and I hope to see accompanying this Tariff, highly protective as it is, a land - tax which ""will have the effect of breaking up large .estates, and providing that agricultural development, which, in conjunction with industrial development,. furnishes the com-plement of our social order. That is what I hope for, and I trust that the Ministry 'will be able to take such a course as will .permit of mv. following them.",39
186,Mr HENRY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,WILLIS (Robertson) [5.25] - The speech that has just been delivered by the honourable member for :Macquarie I do not quite understand. . Mr CARR - I cannot help that. Mr HENRY . WILLIS - I do not wish to be disagreeable. It appears to me that - the honourable member is a free-trader:,40
187,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"As a matter of personal explanation, may I state that I am not a free trader.",40
188,The CHAIRMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Order 1,40
189,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I understand that the honourable member for Macquarie was at one time a free-trader, though he is now in favour of the new protection. I repeat that I have no wish to say anything disagreeable of the - honourable member', - who, I think, made a very excellent speech. X 'understand that the honourable member 'intends to vote against the duty on wire netting, that he is not in favour of taxing the necessaries of life, and that he is not in It favour of duties on manufactures until those manufactures can be produced here to compete successfully against the imported article.  trader believes.",40
190,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"But the honourable member for Macquarie is in favour of then making the duties .prohibitive, though, I think, he will be found voting with honourable members on this side oftener than he will be found voting with the Government. Therefore, I am certainly not going to be in any way disagreeable to the honourable member. - Mr CARR - My vote will always depend on the conditions.",40
191,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I desire to say something about the Budget: To some extent - it has been lost"" sight of, owing to its being' introduced with the Tariff, which now occupies such a large share of public attention. The Budget deals with millions of money, and' hints at a number of problems, none of which have been grappled with. There is no policy put forward by the Government; the Budget is merely thrown on the table after having been prepared by heads of Departments. We are practically told that we may take it or leave it ; and it would appear that the members of the Government amongst themselves have said, "" If w.e bring in a Tariff, now, attention will be diverted from the Budget, and the bad management of the Departments will scarcely be referred to, owing to the discussion which must necessarily take place on the items of the Tariff."" That is really what the Government thought in introducing the Tariff at the present time.",40
192,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is what the honourable member thought the Government thought.,40
193,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I do think so; I have expressed a thought which I am sure is shared by most Ministers: If it be possible to divert attention from the Budget-, the Ministry will get over great difficulties, because there will be no reference to the bad administration of Department's, and they will be let down very lightly . in regard to such policy as they have put before the country'. A number of questions are raised by the Budget which T do not think the Government has seriously thought out. Had it done so, we should have heard more in regard to them from Ministerialists. I wish saysomething in replv to the statements which have been made outside as to the extravagance of Commonwealth administrawe tion. We find that some honourable memThat bers are inclined to support the State ticians who have inveighed against Coma monwealth administration on the ground its extravagance. Unfortunately, no monwealth Government has hitherto realized its responsibility in this matter. Commonralists. wealth representatives have met in conferment, ence representatives of the States, and metaphorically, sat at their feet, allowing themselves to be dictated to in regard matters of policy. It is only right the Commonwealth authorities should consult the authorities of the States on ters of mutual interest. But Commonback wealth Ministers are not alive to the sponsibilities of their positions when allow themselves to be dictated to to policy. We shall never make much headwav in popular esteem until we have ""a Government of sufficient stamina to up for the Commonwealth instead of kneelnothing. ing at the feet of the authorities of the States. The honourable member for Flinability, ders essayed, the other evening, to show that our finances are on a wrong footing, and that there is properly nothing to the credit of the Post .Office or of any other of our Departments; that, in fact, deficits would appear if the amounts spent in the construction of public buildings were shown in their accounts. He said that they would be shown in the accounts of a private firm; but there he was in error. Had he known ' anything of business, would have been aware that every comAustralia, mercial firm allows for wear and tear or the depreciation .of its property. Furthermore, every commercial concern, whether it be a very small one or one like the Australian Mutual Provident Society with a revenue of millions, has its property count. It regards its property as an asset. loan monev. S-milarlv the public buildings, which are the admiration of our people, are magParliament nificent Commonwealth assets, the value of which would be set against the expendiare ture upon them in anv commercial system insisted of bookkeeping. Furthermore, the honoring able member'suggested that the fact that since Federation, ,£6,000,000 has been reprinciple turned to the States over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise re'-enue'dueto them under the Constitution should not be considered a matter for satisinevitable. faction, or'regarded as evidence that"" there Mr Henry Willis. has not been wasteful expenditure on the to part of the Commonwealth. He seemed to think that, being unable, notwithstanding our profligacy, to waste, any more money, were compelled to return that sum. is the tone in which he used to speak poliat the Conferences which he attended as representative of Victoria, and the tone of which is being used by the present Premiers Comof the States.

195,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In all probthe States have excellent assets for the money which they have borrowed; but those in charge of their affairs might give this Parliament credit for intelligence. We have prevented the frittering away of money by Commonwealth Governments, with the result that up to the 30th June, 1907, there was returned to New South Wales, in addition to three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, £2,361,000; to Victoria, .£1,518,670; to Queensland, ;£6i,5i9; to he South Australia, ,£527,463; to Western ^1,099,910; and to Tasmania,  constructed a large number of public works out of revenue which, under State adminisactration, would have been paid for with",41

Under State administrarion the portfolio of Postmaster-General was the least important of those held by Ministers, whereas the Commonwealth Postal Department requires a very able administrator. The honourable member for Denison was such a man. Whene>er honourable members had occasion to see him it was made evident to them that he went about his work like a man of affairs. Mr KING O'MALLEY - So Sydney Smith and the honourable member for Coolgardie.",41
197,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"There have been two or three capable men, but under the administration of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro there has been a great falling away.",42
198,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,He was Postmaster-General.,42
199,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not think so. How has it come about that the Department has a large sum to its credit ? Is it not due to the fact that officials have been sweated, and that promotions which should have been made have been kept back, supernumeraries and temporary hands being employed when permanent appontments should have been made? On this subject a magazine, entitled The Federal Service, has published the following statementWe are prepared to give satisfactory evidence . they had their own way. that at least some of the fifth class officers, have not been promoted, are doing highly sponsible work, far in excess of the value paid consignments of for it; they have been on the £160 grade for a number of years, and they have been recommy mended for promotion each year. up this evidence, we find that the estimates not provide for these increases, and we are forced to the conclusion that somewhere in the official channel there is a stumbling block promotion. We now make the statement, and we invite those who can do so to join issue with us, that a number of promotions were recommended from the fifth to the fourth and that these promotions were struck out-not because the officers were unworthy, their recommendation proved their worth-but were too many fourth class officers in the service.",42
200,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That was fault of State administration.,42
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is pretty generally admitted by the Postal officials service. that under the administration of the States they were better off than they are now.. We have been told that the Public Sernecessarily vice Commissioner is not amenable to fluence, and, therefore, I would ask it comes about that, since the last election, postmasters and other officials were promoted to positions to which they were not fitted, 'and to which they were not entitled, and that men who were notified for removal to be honest. were allowed to remain where they were? Influence must be assumed to account for that state of affairs, which, it seems to me, has. not tended to improve the efficiency of the Department. Mr Amdell, the head of the Postal Department in Sydney, said in a reportAlthough in many instances officers have for a considerable period toiled long beyond the d.d Mr regular hours, no complaint of overwork has reached me, each striving to carry his burden while his strength lasts. There must, however, be a limit to the power of endurance of even the strongest, and unless substantial relief is shortly forthcoming not only the health of the officers but the efficiency of the service must sutler. The pace at which the work has to be rushed through is productive of mistakes, which, I have no hesitation in saying, would not occur a good if the staff were maintained at its legitimate strength I can therefore only repeat that unless substantial relief is speedily afforded the health of the officers and the efficiency of the Department must suffer. It is well known that there aire in „ the service all over New South Wales persons who cannot be trusted with money.. In many offices a leakage from the till has taken place. Postmasters have complained to me that they are compelled to leave in charge of the till those whom they would not think of employing if In some cases who postmasters are located at railway stations. reAt a railway station from, which immense wheat produced in electorate are despatched the stationFollowing master has to attend also to the duties atdo taching to the post-office.

Another complaint that I - have to make is that great delay in dealing with correspondence takes place in the Department. In answer to scores of letters that I have sent in I have received nothing more than a bare acknowledgment, with the promise that they will receive attention. No further attention has been given to them. This shows a lack of good management. Nearly every question has to be sent to the central office in Melbourne for decision.

210,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"He was a supernumerary- a junior-in the LandsDepartment of New South Wales.

He is the most .capable administrator in s t r 2.1^ ft",43
211,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"He was a VicHe torian officer, and was brought up in the home of protection. In all probability he is a highly efficient officer. But I was referring more particularly to officers introduced into the Commonwealth service by members of . the first Federal Ministry. Queensland had to have its representative in the Postal Department because the Postmaster-General came from that State. And! in the same way the then Prime Minister, Mr Barton, appointed his bosom friend! as Secretary to the Department of Externa li Affairs, because he had to have in the service an officer from New South Wales. We find inefficient men advising Ministers. The same state of affairs exists in the Defence Department.",43

215,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"So far I have given proof of all my statements, and I have yet to criticise the Defence Department. I propose now to refer to the cancelled mail contract. The present Minister of Trade and Customs, when Postmaster General, accepted the tender pf a firmwhich was to lodge a deposit of £25,000as a guarantee of good faith. Where is that deposit today ? The facts go to show that at the time the Government were in dire straits. They allowed Sir James Laing and Company to secure the option of floating a-, company to provide the necessary mail service, and they saw that if they insisted' upon the deposit of .£25,000 being lodged there would be no contract. In the circumstances, therefore, they did not insist Opon a cash deposit, and the syndicate, .finding that it could not float a company and so make a pot of money out of the option they had secured, threw up the sponge. That is an old game in mining - circles, and it - is singular that the Minister should have allowed it to be played. The position suggests the inefficiency of the Administration. One of the greatest Departments of the Commonwealth at the time Apparently was controlled by a man who did not possess a knowledge of'even the rudiments of business. He is supposed to have had some experience of mining business, - where tactics of the kind to which I have referred are resorted to every day. Mining men who secure an option without putting, - down any money are considered very smart. In this case a company was able to secure an option and to drag it through the streets of London. *",43
216,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Wit h no hope of floating a company, because the British public had been fleeced again and again in connection with steam-ship sendees.",44
217,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"That is so. The syndicate wished to make a pot ot money out of the option they had secured from the Government. In mining circles they would have been described as the "" first robbers."" What has become of the Minister who allowed the bond for £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 to be spoken of as a deposit? I was under the impression that the money was actually in the Treasury.",44

219,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Can the Government realise upon it?,44
220,Mr EWING,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Of course they can.,44
221,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If it cannot be liquidated, then the Minister responsible for it should be at once shunted. Government should either ask him to retire or themselves take the responsibility of resigning. I am saying that which business men know to be correct.",44

226,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is a statutory provision.,44
227,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We have to remember that if we said tomorrow to the British War Office authorities, "" We are not going to give you any more,"" they would say, "" That fs all right. Please do not take up our time by discussing so small a matter.""",44
228,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It is a pity-they did not say that eight years ago.,44
229,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"They did. When Mr Barton discussed the question with them they asked for twice the present subsidy. He replied that he would support the granting of £200,00 0 per annum, and the authorities said, "" Very well; anything you like; but we think £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be a small subsidy."" I should be prepared tomorrow to vote £1,000,00 0 for this purpose, and I am sure that my constituents would endorse my action.",44
230,Mr MATHEWS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Le t the fleet come to Melbourne, and I will support such a subsidy. Mr HENRY WILLIS . ^ It will be found that the people of Australia are not niggardly so far as this question is concerned. They are prepared to pay for the defence of Australia.",44
231,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If we paid a subsidy of ,£1,000,000 a year, it would illustrate the saying that there is no limit to human folly.",44
232,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It would be an excellent investment. Our chief line of defence, I maintain, is the British Navy. If that were withdrawn, all our The military and naval forces would be of no avail against an enemy. At the same time, I do not hold the view that it is our duty to do nothing towards providing ourselves with an effective system of defence. For that reason I should like the Governto exhibit a little more interest in the naval cadet movement. The other day the of Defence declared that every facilitv was being provided for the enrolment of cadets, both in the Naval and the Forces. I krow from correspondput ence with the Defence Department that Upon a previous occasion . I pointed out that damaged ammunition had been supplied to The Minister n \ replied that'such a state of . things ought That is not quite the answer which should have been given by the honourable gentleman. He should have known a little more about his own Department. From the Jubilee number of The Sydneian, the official magazine published by the Sydney Grammar School, I quote the followingThe grave political limitations under - which our staff officers struggle-in silence-ar e more than hinted in the following statement, published in the Daily Telegraph so recently as July 6th. We have seen no official denial :The quality of the ammunition supplied to the cadet force has been the subject of unfavorable comment on more than one occasion. The attention of the National Rifle Association was officially directed to the matter at its last meeting by one of its members, Mr H . B. Jamieson, who was on the Randwick range recently, and had ocular demonstration of the utter uselessness of the ammunition which cadets were using at target practice. Lieutenant Dakin, the secretary of the association, was also in a position to substantiate these remarks. His son, who is a promising young shot, and has figured in the prize list at the cadet rifle meetings, was unable to find the targetwith the ammunition issued to him, but on trying with another brand scored six bull's-eyes in succession. The association decided to forward a letter of protest to the District Commandant. What are we to gather from this? That Major Dove takes a wicked delight in fooling his cadets with bad ammunition ? Either this, or that he is issuing to the boys the only ammunition he can get-ol d stuff perished through long storage",44
233,Mr EWING,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I endeavoured to trace the case when 1 saw it referred to in the newspapers, but nobody could tell me where the ammunition came from.",45
234,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The article continuesthat he requisitions the Head-quarters Staff in Melbourne for fresh supplies, who in their turn ask the Minister for War for a military vote sufficient to provide serviceable ammunition. The Minister for War in his turn utters "" prave 'ords"" in public-bu t continues to do nothing. Whatever the future policy of our trustees may be, few will question their wisdom in waiting t i ll they are assured that the Federal Government is in earnest, and is prepared to supply Australian cadets with serviceable arms and ammunition that is not "" utterly useless."" These statements are contained in the official journal of an educational institution, which is attended by 8oo boys, who decline to enter the cadet service owing to the defective ammunition which is supplied to its members.",45
235,Mr EWING,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Why did they notcommunicate with me?,45
236,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,They have communicated with the Minister through their responsible officer. I maintain that we should have serviceable ammunition supplied to our defence forces..,45
237,Mr SALMON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Serviceable ammunition made in Australia.,45
238,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Who was the responsible officer through whom the complaint of the cadets was communicated ?,45
239,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Jt was Major Dove, I think. The Acting Prime Minister stated the other day that he was in favour of the appointment of a High Commissioner in London to exercise supervision over our financial affairs. In the past we have been fortunate enough to secure.the services of honourable men as the official representatives in London of the various States. But I would point out that a very large sum of money is being annually expended there on account of the Defence Department. We are spending millionssterling in England, and I maintainthat if we had an - officer representing the Commonwealth there he would be better able to perform the duties which are now being discharged by persons who are not directly responsible to us. It is very necessary that we should have an efficient Department, governed by a man whose selection has been approved by this Parliament, so that we may be able to fix responsibility. Unless we appoint, our own officer, we cannot expect to be always as fortunate as we have been-seein g that millions sterling will have to pass through the hands of persons who are not immediately responsible to us. I now come to a question which was incidentally touched upon by the Acting Prime Minister during the course of his Budget speech - I refer to the federalization of old-age pensions. I am in favour of the Commonwealth initiating a Federal scheme of old age pensions, but I recognise that such a. scheme is impracticable during the continuance of the Braddon section of the Constitution. Until that section expires, we cando nothing in this direction except by means of direct ""taxation. I have always advocated the discontinuance of the Braddon section at as early a date as possible. I hold that the Commonwealth ought to control the whole of the Customs revenue. Of course, the States, must not be allowed to want for funds, but it should be for the Federation to determine what sum shall be annually returned' to them. I believe that less than £ 2 6s-' per head of the population of Australia represents all that they at present receive from the Commonwealth. If it could be arranged that the Commonwealth should return that amount annually to the States, we might exercise absolute control over the whole of the Customs revenue, and there would then be no reason why we should not undertake the payment of old-age pensions from the funds in our possession. would then be incumbent upon the States to discontinue paying those pensions from their own sources of revenue.",45
240,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member wishes to tax the tea of the old people Australia in order to pay them old-age sions ?,46
241,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member, I am sure, agrees with what'I saying. Even if we imposed what might be regarded as a prohibitive Tariff, we should continue to collect a large revenue under it. The control of the Customs venue should be in the hands of the Comcountry. monwealth, which should return a,fixedsum annually to the States. We should then be able to undertake the payment of age pensions, and to raise additional revenue if necessary, by means of direct taxaand tion. Of course, the-land taxes and every him."" other form of direct taxation the States would have to be abolished. By assuming our responsibility and undertaking Federal work in a Federal way, we should compel the States to adopt that course. It has been said that standing was arrived at amongst the f ramers of our Constitution, that direct taxation should not be imposed by the Commonpull wealth. Such a compact was very necessary while the Braddon section continued operative, and until we had gained some experience of the working of the Constituin tion. But I decline to admit that my hands yond bility. are tied in this connection, and that 1 should . not vote in favour of the imposition of direct taxation. As soon as the Braddon section has expired, I hold that we should accept the members full responsibility of providing for the payment of old-age pensions, and for other services of a Federal character, and, if necessary, we should raise additional revenue by means of direct taxation upon the land. At the present time, is operative in some States, but not in others.",46
242,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The Braddon section will not expire by effluxion of time.,46
243,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It can be superseded in ten years from the establishment of Federation.

260,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The money cannot be got at .3 per cent.,47
261,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I heard the discussion between the honourable member Parkes and honourable members in the corner as to the raising of the money; and the honourable member had an idea that we is should have to go into the market, and raise ,£230,000,000 with which to pay the people who hold bonds to that amount.",47
262,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Not h in g of the,47
263,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I am merely pointing out .what the honourable member Parkes thought. Another idea was entertained by honourable members. In the corper ner, though that idea was not made very clear. It was suggested by somebody that, of the inasmuch as our bonds were at one time at . £ 9 9 , and were-now at £ 8 6 , the present is not an opportune time to consolidate our debts. But it does not make our a bit of difference what the. bonds are between selling at in London.",47
264,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable mem,47
265,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; and T. shall tell the honourable member why. Thewords ""consolidate"" and ""convert"" have their meanings; and if we convert our we debts from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent -- - ",47
266,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is no country in the world raising money at 3 per cent.,47
267,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In Canada Moriey can be raised at any rate of interest; it all depends on how much less than the ,£100 we receive. My proposal is that we can raise money at 3 per cent., and pay nothing for the conversion. As a matter, of its fact, the time when our bonds were I selling at £[99 would not be the best The best method of all is the inscription of stock; and we might give the lenders 3 per cent', perpetuity if we like. However, I do not desire to go into the scheme fully, because I dealt with it in some detail on a previous occasion; but, in my opinion, it the best scheme that has yet been put The money would be raised by calling on those who now hold our bonds to take 3 per cent, for what we now pay per cent. A man who held 4 per cent, stock would not take 3 per cent, stock if he knew what we know, namely, that Auscontralia is just as sound when represented is by separateStates as under Federation-. But the' financial advisers of investors in London know - our affairs as well - as we know them: ourselves, and if we offered 3 per cent, stock in place of .4 per cent, stock, they ,would say that it was not an opportune time for thetransaction. It was here that Mr Coghlan stepped in, - and suggested that some inducement should be offered in order to facilitate the transaction; and there would be an inducement if we said to the investor, '-'We will give you cash value as between the 3 per cent, stock and 4 per cent, stock for the period of your bonds,"" which may be for a year, nr for forty-five years in some cases.",47
268,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member say that investors would accept that offer ?,48
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I say that 1 would accept it if I were an investor. The cash value, as between 3 per cent, stock and 4 per cent, stock, would give me the actual value of my bonds as I held them originally. Then, what is the inducement to me as an investor? The inducement is - that I still hold the face value of the amount I invested in the bonds, with the additional sum of interest for the period of one year, - or forty-five years. stock also would be inscribed, or I could pick up the money if I chose, and my capital would still remain at what it was. It may be said that the stock could be inscribed at so much more than £,100, and that we should be paying interest on it. But I say that we should be paying not more, but less, interest in the aggregate, because ""we should be paying 3 per cent. But, at the expiration of the period for which the bonds were running, whether for one year or forty-five' years, we should be paying just the same as if the bond had run on without our intervening. The next question that arises is, "" What benefit is it to us to do this "" ?",48
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is it j I just about to ask the question.,48
271,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The advantage is that some of the bonds will f all due in twoor three years, and yet they will be already launched at 3 per cent, at par without any additional expense; every bond falls due will be already floated, and per cent, will be the limit of our on the public debt. Then the moneys ultimately must be paid; and in this cent, connection, the scheme I suggest own, but it is an old one which has been .worked both in England and in New South shall we derive? Wales. A sinking fund of per cent, for sixtv years would liquidate the debt; and, while the actual sum paid in.interest would be no more than it is today, there would tuarial be provided a sinking fund . * Sir JOHN FORREST - We should not paying less than we are 'today.",48
272,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We should be paying 3 per cent, whereas now we are paying 4 per cent. M i . MAHON - But there would be a loss on the conversion.",48
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I may remind' the honourable member that some of the loans were issued at 6 per cent. ; but, in any case, the principle is the same, and the cost of conversion would occur once only, whereas it would be repeated with every loan falling due if the debts were not converted. As the sinking fund accumulated we could go into the market and purchase our own stocks, and we could do so at advantageous terms if they ran down, as they must occasionally. The fluctuations of the money market are just the same as in' ordinary trade--indeed , it is trade in money. We could go into the market and buy our stocksas soon as opportunity offered.",48
274,Mr KING OMALLEY,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is done by That Canada.,48
275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is done by every country. The honourable member for Macquarie asks how I account for the reduction in the value of our bonds. One reason may be that the English Government are now borrowing ,£112,000,000. That,, of course, makes a difference in the London money market, but the influence of that operation will not last long. The people who receive this .£112,000,000 for their Irish properties will not walk about .with it in their pockets; and the very financiers who found the money for the British Government are the financiers"" who are lcok J ing for secure' investment for it on behalf of the recipients;' and so it comes back again into the market. was",48

277,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In a speech that which I delivered last vear, when I pro3 pounded a scheme for the conversion of the liability debts of the States. I said If we ask the bondholders to accept 3 per for 4 per cent, stocks, we must give them somethingthat will be equivalent to the differis not my ence in the percentage. .",48
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Then what advantage1,48
279,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We should gain upon every loan maturing from iqo"" t ill existing loans had run their fixed period under the acvaluation, as from that period the stocks converted would cost the Commonwealth noth4 ing. . In respect of every bond current, webe should .give an inducement on paper by inscrib; iilg our stock. We should in that way raise - the value of that stock, whilst at the same time we should reduce the interest bill on loans maturing, providing for a sinking fund of £ percent-, which in sixty odd years would wipe out the face value of the accumulated debt. Under this system we should pay nothing more in respect of interest, although we should appear to pav a little more on paper. When our bonds fell due, we should redeem them at their face value. That is a very terse statement of my position. As one who has devoted a considerable amount of time to this question, I wish, without speaking on it exhaustively now, to do something to advance its consideration a little, and I hope on another occasion to contribute still further to its discussion. Referring to Mr Coghlan's 'paper on the debts of the States. I saidMr Coghlan points out that loans amounting to several millions will fal l due every year for forty-five years, and that if the States debts «re consolidated at 3 per cent, at par, there be a saving to the Comn.onwealth when the loans expire of ;£t,375,000-that is, if we Allow the bondholders an opportunity to make some profit in the meantime. During the five years, from 1907 to 1911, the loans falling due, if redeemed at 3 per cent., would represent a saving of £273,000 per annum. .During the period, from 1912 ta 1916, we should effect a - further saving of £390,000 per annum. So the saving would be increased every year. If we <lo not adopt the plan suggested, the States will probably have to raise money at 4 per cent. ' The honourable member for Swan asked of what advantage it would be for us to consolidate now. The advantage is that it would cost nothing, and would result in an annual saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds, from 1907 onwards. bonds are allowed to fall due as he proposed, we must take the risks of the market, and borrow the money necessary to meet them, at whatever prices are asked. But under my scheme, the holders of 4 per cents, would be offered stock at 3 per cent, to the amount of their holding, together with the capitalized difference between 3 and 4 per cent, for the period for which the loan had currency, which might - be one year or forty-five years. Commonwealth would inscribe upon its ledgers the amount of the principal originally held by the bondholder, and the amount which would represent the capitalized difference between the first rate of interest paid to him,-and 3 per cent., and would pay 3 per cent, on both sums.",48
280,Mr CARS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,A bondholder would not agree to conversion unless he knew that he would gain by it.,49
281,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"No one would accept 3 per cent, in substitution for 4 per cent., unless he was given some advantage'. Mr Coghlan points out that it would be necessary to otter to bondholders an inducement to convert. The financiers of England know the position of Australia even better than we do. It is their business to know it. They have in their safes Australian stock, which they have underwritten, and a short time ago put some of it on the market, with the result that prices fell. Recently a gentleman went from Australia to London, joined the Stock Exchange there, and made £500,000 in a very short time, because he knew as much as the English financiers of the value of Australian stock. He knew when to buy and when to sell, and by giving information to clients all over England, and satisfying them by testimony from various quarters as to the correctness of his' views, will he secured for investment trust funds representing a great deal of money, and made the profit I speak of. The advantage the bondholder would get would be interest on the difference between the rate at which he originally advanced his money, and the 3 per cent, given under the conversion, while in sixty years the whole of the existing public debt would be liquidated if we put away £ per cent, per annum. Is not this result worth securing? Earlier in the discussion some one asked what about the future borrowing of the States.",49
282,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,They have already borrowed too much.,49
283,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"We cannot If the take from them their right to borrow, but it would be an advantage to them to borrow through the Commonwealth if it were willing to give them what they asked. It has been suggested that they might be compelled to come cap in hand, and to take then turn. My proposal is that they should be allowed to get what they ask for. The Commonwealth.could raise money at 3 per cent., which is less than the States The pav for it, and it could make an appoint1 ment which would save the commission of i | per cent, now paid to the Westminster Bank.",49
284,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Would it not be the work of the High Commissioner to manage our borrowing ?,49
285,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"He would have an oversight; but he could hardly be expected to do the whole of the work, remembering the magnitude of the indebtedness of the States. The honourable member for Ivalgoorlie, quoting from Mr Coghlan's statement, pointed out that in one .year £[8.000 falls due, and the next nearly £[32,000,000; but under my scheme that does not matter. The scheme cannot be carried out without the co-operation of the financiers and the consent of their clients. When a man proposes to invest trust funds he acts, not upon his own initiative, but upon the advice of his financier. Within the last two or three years the British Government have allowed Australian stocks to be placed on the list of securities in which trust funds may be invested. That action was taken because of the high standard of our stocks.",49
286,Mr CROUCH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The British Government insist upon our lodging heavy guarantees in London.,50
287,Mr HENRYWTLLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is only right that we should give .a guarantee. So far as the London financiers are concerned, the guarantee that we offer is to be found in our magnificent railway systems and public works, from which an annual income of millions of pounds is being derived.",50
288,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Is not the character of people the best guarantee?,50
289,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It certainly is a guarantee, but I would remind honourable members that the character of the Khedive of Egvpt as a guarantee was not worth much to Great Britain. She had to take possession. She went behind his character and seized securities in Egvpt which she holds today. Honourable members must recognise that it is necessary for a debtor to have assets as well as a good name. The possessor of an. excellent name might be a bankrupt, and a mere name without assets is of no great service to a creditor who wishes to realise. If we raise the monev necessary to pav off the debts of the States we must make a debit in their accounts in respect of the fixed sum to be returned to them' after the expiration of the Braddon section.",50
290,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member think that the Commonwealth could borrow better than could the States?,50
291,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I believe that the Commonwealth could always borrow at 3 per cent: Any one asking in'England for money and possessing such a security as a province or a State can fix his own price. Canada said she 'would give 2\ per cent, interest, and she got what she wanted, whilst in boom time Western Australia fixed at 3 per cent, the rate of interest that she was prepared to pay, and got what she wanted at £ 9 9 . We may fix our own rate of interest, but the man tendering will also fix the price that he will pay for our bonds. It is, after all, a mere matter of business, and when we speak about 3 per cent, stock we expect to be able to float our loans practically at par. I wish now to say a word or two with regard to the Tariff, in the preparation of which less intelligence appears to have been exercised than in connection with any other Australian Tariff. A Government charged with the responsibility of legislating for something like 4,250,000 people, scattered over a vast continent, has seen fit to accept Tariff proposals framed by a body of irresponsible perscns. A number of honourable members in this Parliament, together with others outside the Legislature, were appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the Tariff, and there came a time when not one of the Commissioners was . a member of the LegislatureI t was suggested by the honourable member for Parkes that the recommendations of the Commission should be, swallowed by the Committee. My reply is that I was not sent here fo the delegate to an irresponsible body my right to assist in legislating for Australia. I decline to follow in detail the recommendations of the Commission. I shall go to the sources of information to which they have gone as a representative of the people, and shall make my own deductions from the evidence taken by them. It is immaterial to me whether the recommendations be those of free-traders or of protectionists ; I hold that it is my duty to_ decide for myself what Tariff should be imposed. The Government, in adopting the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Commission, have been guilty of disgraceful procedure. They might just as . well have adopted the proposals of a debating society. We find in the Tariff only twenty-seven items for. which the Ministry are responsible, and their action in regard to them reminds one of the tipsy man who takes up a pen and writes at random. It seems to be of no concern to them whether 10, 15, or 300 per. cent, duties be imposed. They have actually proposed duties as high as 300 per cent, and their action in this regard would be a disgrace to any responsible Administration. No intelligence is shown in the preparation of the Tariff-it ' is neither protective nor prohibitive. It fails in every respect. The Government have not even looked into the reports of the free trade section of the Commission, and they are attempting to impose upon their supporters when they ask them as a party to vote for the Tariff. I have not yet heard one honourable member say "" As a good party man I shall vote for the Tariff."" Under another Tariff, New South Wales, a free-trade State, had £[1,500,000 per annum in excess of its requirements.",50
292,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It never had a free trade Tariff.,51
293,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"My point is that the last Tariff raised for New South Wales £[1,500,000 more than she required for governmental purposes. According to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister, the new Tariff will yield her an additional £[40,000 per annum. One-third - of the people of the Commonwealth who are opposed to such taxation are to be. treated in this way. Have the minority no rights? Have they no claim to consideration ? The States Governments', who have enjoyed these immense surpluses, have frittered away the money. The Government which preceded the Carruthers Administration frittered away the surplus revenue returned to it by the Commonwealth, and at the end of three years, during which Joans amounting to £12,000,000 had been raised by it, retired from office . leaving a deficit of £[350,000. That is a sample of the extravagant prodigality of New South Wales. The present Administration in that State have enjoyed an enormous surplus every year, and they now claim praise for their proposal to reduce taxation.",51
294,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"They ought to pay their debts before they talk of reducing taxation. ' Mr HENRY WILLIS - The present Administration in New South Wales have not only paid their way, but have paid off part of the public debt. For the first time in the history of Australia that step has been taken.",51
295,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,They took money out of the trust funds for the purpose.,51
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is no foundation for that statement.,51
297,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is incorrect,, but I do not wish to discuss in detail the affairs of any State.",51
298,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,When the honourable - member makes such strong statements he must exoect some replv to them.,51
299,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I was speaking of the prodigality of the remnant of a party to which the honourable member belonged when he was a member of the Legislature of New South Wales. I had in mind the stragglers who followed the Acting Prime Minister when he was the leader of the Government in that State.. I have not much to say of the present State Administration.. They are a lot of spendthrifts. The Commonwealth Tariff has produced for them an immense revenue drawn from the wage earners. It takes a man of pluck to propose direct taxation; a mere weakling may bring in indirect taxation, to "" pluck the goose without making it cry."" At the present time a man who works hard and lives well has 25 per cent, of his earnings swallowed up by taxation. We are faced with a deplorable condition of affairs. I am glad to observe that the people of this State are beginning to recognise what they have to pay under the Tariff, and are resenting it. The honourable member for Gippsland smiles, but I do not think his smile is caused by thoughts of the men who have to submit to this taxation.",51
300,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,No . ' He is smiling about the swindling that is going on.,51
301,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Swindling must take place in connection with Customs taxation. During this debate we have heard again and again the statement that the mer* chants are passing on the duties to the consumers. There was a time when we were told that the foreigner had to pay the duties. Our protectionist friends have changed their tune, and we are told that the importers pass on this taxation to the consumers, who are also called upon to pay increased prices for goods on which the duties have not been paid. The Minister of Trade and Customs told us the other day' that we had in Australia a supply of kerosene sufficient to meet all our requirements for the next twelve months. I venture to say that 75 per cent, of that supply is to be found in two States. What, then, is the position in the other States where there is a shortage ? In those States there must be withdrawals from bond, and the increased duty on kerosene has there to be paid.",51
302,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is no duty on kerosene passing from one State to another.,51
303,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"No, but the honourable member must not lose sight of the. fact that the stocks in the different States may be held by a dozen different firms.",51
304,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In what State are they now paying duty on kerosene? Colonel FOXTON. - In Queensland duty has been paid on something like 10,000 cases. .....",51
305,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"That, of course, is of no consequence to the Minister - I usually pay 22s. 66 - and they",52
306,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member knows that increased prices are being charged for goods on which no additional duty has been paid.,52
307,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Possiblv in four out of the six States the duty on kerosene is already being paid by the importers and passed on to the consumers.,52
308,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Do not flog a dead horse. That duty will be removed.,52
309,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not know that it is a dead horse. The duty may be removed, but the Minister said today, in answer to a question put by me, that no refunds of duty would take place.",52
310,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,How much would the importers refund to the consumers ?,52
311,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I raise no objection to the policy of the Government that refunds shall not be made - At one time - refunds of duties were made, but we found that whilst the merchants benefited the consumers did not. The people in four of the six States are possibly paying to merchant what he has been called upon to him. pay by way of duty, and something more. '- Mr HENRY WILLIS Whena man has to spend £ 1 in respect of a duty he very often expects to get 30s. in return. I have received from small shopkeepers who say that they fee! the effect of this duty being passed to them very acutely. Not only has a duty been imposed upon kerosene, but almost every article in daily use has been taxed the Government. The other day the honorFrench able member for South Sydney presented an invoice, with a view to showing that increased price paid by a consumer who t purchased his goods at the Civil Service leather. Co-operative Store was only 6d., although the amount of his.purchase was not inconfibre. siderable. The explanation for that simplicity itself. It is that upon the Aus- ""skin in Australia, save one. tralian goods specified in the invoice duty, has been .paid. It is true that duties of 30 or 40 per cent, may have been imof posed upon similar goods of foreign origin, but those duties merely represent the meathese sure of protection which has been extended to the local manufacturer, and added to the cost of living. Take the case of boots shoes as an illustration.",52
312,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Boot s and shoes are beor ing sold for less than the duty that levied upon fhem. Mr ' HENRY . WILLIS - I bought a pair of boots in Melbourne for ios. 6d.. 'are the worse boots I ever purchased. The poorest woman in the community would buy the best goods, if her means permitted her to do so, because they are the cheapest in the long run. I admit that we can make good boots and shoes in Australia, but we have not a sufficient quantity of the right class , of leather to supply our local requirements.",52
313,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Canno t we make leather here ?,52
314,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , and no. ' We can make leather in Australia, but we cannot make as good leather as can be produced in cold countries.",52
315,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Is there no cold country in Australia?,52
316,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"There is in Tasmania."" We cannot produce such good leather for the uppers of boots as can be imported from France, Germany, or England.",52
317,Mr HUME COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Nonsense . The honout orable member could not tell the difference the between two skins if they were put before - I am quite prepared to argue that question. There is no better leather than French calf, because letters the grain of the skin is much finer and closer than is that of Australian calf. The on ""reason is that French calf comes from a much colder country, where the skin carries morr: hair in its natural state. Australian by calf-skin is much more porous than is. calf-skin, the fibre is not so close, and the hair is not so thick. That is the the reason why, for the uppers of boots, Ausr a l i a n leather is not equal to imported In Tasmania, a wallaby is to be found, the skin of which has a very close When that skin is dressed, it posis sesses a finer grain than does any other Upon Kanno garoo Island, in. South Australia, a much smaller wallaby is to be found. The grain the skin of this animal is as fine as the b>itr of a horse hide. Large quantities of skins have been sold at 16s. per lb-, so that honourable members will perceive - that they aire valuable. Unfortunately, howand ever, the supply of these, skins is very ""limited. In Australia, we can produce twothree classes of leather equal to anything is in the world, but the trouble is that we ""cannot produce as much sole leather as-'is required to supply our people with boots and shoes.",52
318,Mr HUME COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Nonsense !,53
319,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member does not know anything about the matter. I know exactly what I am talking about. The sole leather of the small proportion of hides which is imported from New Zealand is very valuable. But in Australia all the hides of animals fall away at the shoulder. They are very thin and porous. That is why we export so much light sole leather to other parts of the world, whilst importing the heavy sole leather. We do not produce superior boots because we do not permit our manufacturers to obtain the best material for the purpose. Under this Tariff the Government have increased the expenses of the working man by at least to per cent. After allowing for the middleman's profits its effect will probably be diminish the wages of the worker by 4s. in the pound. In other words, if a man is receiving £[2 per week, his wages will be reduced by 8s.",53
320,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,He will be provided with more work.,53
321,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member who preceded me made a - very sensible speech. He declared that 80 per cent, of the community consists of workers, and the remaining 20 - per cent, represents the wealthier classes. If the Government were possessed of any pluck they would have imposed these heavy duties upon the 20 per cent, who can afford to pay them.",53
322,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member ought to be sitting upon this side of the Chamber.,53
323,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"No . What I am saying has always been the policy of the Opposition. Not only have the Government levied duties ranging from 10 to 30 per cent, upon everything that the working man consumes, but they have also taxed the iron and wood which are required to build his home-indeed , they have not even allowed his drainage pipes to escape taxation. Can a man erect a house today for the same price as prior to the introduction of this Tariff? The builder must increase his interest, or, in other words, his rent; and every working man will have to pay more for his cot-, tage, as soon as there is a. greater demand for houses. Then the poor miner has nothing to gain from protection; and why miners are ever protectionists is very hard to understand.. To-day I received a letter from a miner, who informs me that in his district the people are up in arms against the Tariff, because they are free-traders and know what protection means. Not only have we reduced the miner's £[1 to the value of 15s., but it has been made more expensive to provide the machinery which is necessary for his work. If a syndicate have only ,£1,000 to spend on machinery, they cannot afford £1,500, and must abandon their enterprise, as we find to be the case all over the country. How is it possible under the new Tariff to obtain the cyaniding and other machinery necessary to extract the last grain of gold out of the mullock? Such machinery cannot be made in Australia.",53
324,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is hardly any machinery used in the cyaniding process.,53
325,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Of course, we to know that vats are used in this process, but machinery is also necessary in mining; and the duty in this connection has been raised considerably.",53
326,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The largest gold mine in the world gets all its. machinery made in,53
327,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"No doubt a good deal of machinery is made in Australia. For instance, boilers used in Western Australia are made in Adelaide; but machinery which cannot be made as well here as elsewhere is imported; it is all a matter of price and patent rights. - Mr HUME COOK - To what sort of machinery is the honourable member referring?",53
328,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I am referring to electrical appliances amongst other machinery, and, as the figures shqw in connection with the Melbourne City Council electrical project, machinery that formerly cost £[1,000, will now cost -£1,500; and the same may be said of machinery in every department of industry. Will anvbody deny the fact that, owing to the Tariff, it is now more expensive to undertake industrial enterprises? There is not the slightest doubt that mining is not the only industry that is being injured by the Tariff; and I think I ought here to sav' a word for the farmer and settler. Every piece of machinery, or necessity of life the settler requires is unduly taxed under the Tariff. Last week I visited a property which I had not seen for six months, and I exDected to see long grass there for the sheep which badly require it ; but there was not a blade of grass to be seen, every, bit of it having been eaten by rabbits. Yet the duty on wire-netting has been raised to 30 per cent, or 40 per cent.; and thereby the very men who create wealth are injured.",53
329,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The netting is doomed; there is no need to worry about it.,54
330,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I hope that may be so. When I asked the Acting Prime Minister today whether, in the event of the duty being abolished, he would return that already paid, he replied in the negative. Are we to allow the rabbits to have full sway For another twelve months? There is not the slightest doubt that the Tariff will not be disposed of for at least eight or nine months. years ago we were considering a Tariff month after month.",54
331,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Tw o men were practically killed in the process.,54
332,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; but those men, unlike the present Government, worked.",54
333,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Is not the Minister of Trade and Customs killing himself?,54
334,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I was disap-pointed to find the honourable gentleman looking so well. In the case of the last Tariff, the Senate, which represents the States, did good work in reducing the duties; but that Tariff, as I say, took months to consider, and, so far as I can - see, the users of wire-netting will have to continue to pay duty for perhaps nine months.",54
335,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Why not take the duty off now ?,54
336,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I am pretty certain that the duty will be taken off, eventually; but I am equally certain that the Acting Prime Minister will not return the duty already paid. Mr Carruthers, the Premier of New South Wales, is making political capital out of the situation in regard to the duty on wire-netting. That gentleman has sent out circulars, or has been instrumental in having citculars sent, out, with the object of showing the settlers that £ 1 2 6s. per mile will have in the future to be paid for wire-netting supplied to those who have applied to the State Government. Mr Carruthers knows that if he desires to help the settlers, he need not add more than one-fourth of the. duty to the wire supplied, because three-fourths will go back to the States from the Department of Trade and Customs, and of the one-fourth, a large proportion will be devoted to administering the services taken over by the Commonwealth. Further, a large residue will also go to the State of New South Wales. What kernel is there in the nut that Mr Carruthers is cracking duty on wire- before the public?",54
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There is still a percentage that will not go back to the people.,54
338,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is so; but I started by saying that: three-fourths could be remitted.,54
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I do not think it. could. _,54
340,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It is a constitutional question.,54
341,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If Mr Carruthers can do that, he can do anything ! Several Mr HENRY WILLIS - The Government of New South Wales is supplying netting to settlers at cost price.",54
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That is all right.,54
343,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"And if 15s. of every £ 1 collected is returned to the State of New South Wales, Mr Carruthers could remit the charge to that extent. Sir JOHN FORREST:-Then he could destroy the T a r if f !",54
344,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,He could make a present of the wire if he liked.,54
345,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"This, of course, opens up a constitutional question; but there is no doubt that Mr Carruthers could take that step, and risk the consequences in the High Court. Mr Carruthers is imposing on the electors, when he tries to make political capital out of the present situation; and, further, he is abusing his friends as well as his enemies. Mr. Carruthers wrote to me and others, asking us to help him and the State Government candidates; and yet, at the same time, he abuses us. I do not intend to deal with Mr Carruthers further; but I cannot help saying that he is insulting us shamefully, and I resent it . He may be fighting our battle, but we are fighting his; and we ought not to be insulted. I should now like to refer to the question of free-trade versus protection. The honourable member for Parkes suggested that we should swallow the Tariff as outlined by the Tariff Commission-that we should impose duties for the protection of industries. When I went before the country as a candidate, I was prepared to adjust anomalies in the T a r if f ; and if , when I am returned, I find a majority here with power to legislate as they please, am I to turn protectionist because my party is in a minority ? I do not think so; and, what is more, I do not intend to turn protectionist. If I have to turn protectionist I prefer to leave this House. I shall work for my constituents and the people of the country as long as they choose to elect me, but I will not punish the people by supporting the Tariff which has been submitted by the Government. Let it be understood that I believe in free-trade, but in absolute free trade.",54
346,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,There never has been absolute free-trade in New South Wales.,55
347,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member says that there never has been absolute free-trade in New South Wales.,55
348,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I say so again.,55
349,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Unde r the Government of Mr Deas Thompson, long before we were born, and later, under the Government of the present representative in this Parliament of East Sydney, New South Wales had the freest Tariff in the world. That Tariff was as near free-trade as we can get it ; if we have absolute free trade we have 'to look for other means of raising revenue. - Mr CHANTER - Then why call it free trade ?",55
350,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"It is what is known as free-trade in England, and we take our cue from the British people.",55
351,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The Reid Tariff did not mean a free-trade breakfast table, but imposed duties on butter, bacon, and almost every requisite. ' Mr HENRY WILLIS - The Reid Tariff relieved the people of taxation to the amount of £1,000,000, and that is the sort of legislation we can admire. Mr CHANTER, - That Tariff took the burden off the shoulders of the rich and it on the shoulders of the poor.",55
352,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Why should we always try to help the strong by resortso. ing to protection? Why feed the fatted calf?,55
353,Mr CHANTER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Has not the honourable# member contended"" that protection does feed the fatted calf ?",55
354,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,It is protection that has created the millionaires of America. Mr TUDOR. - What has created millionaires of Great Britain ?,55

That country is the world's emLet porium, to which manufactures and staple - products are sent from all over the globe. However, I do not wish to trespass uport the attention of the' Committee any longer. I thank honourable members for the patient hearing which they have given to me. Asa free-trader, it will be my duty to reduce the duties on the Tariff as much as possible, and remove all anomalies. I shall do this for the advantage of the 80 per cent, of our population who are workers. Thefree-traders are the friends of the workers, the .true representatives of the people.. Having in view the interests of the masses. I can never be a protectionist.",55
356,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Batman) [8.46] - It is not my intention to follow the bad example of honourable members opposite by making a long - speech. One might have thought, after the last general elections, that free trade was dead, but the few free-traderswho were returned to this Parliament - seem to be very much alive indeed. The free-trade party, however, was badly beaten in New South Wales and throughout the Commonwealth, and when I look at the Opposition benches, I am tempted to vary the well-known lines, and toaskDo I sleep, do I dream, Or is visions about? Are things what they seem, Or is free-trade played out? - Mr JOHNSON - The fiscal issue was not . raised at the last elections in any other State than Victoria.",55
357,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Thos e who were the leading free-traders in the last Parliament are not members of this Parliament. Evpr.y country in. the world is throwing aside the doctrines of free-trade.,55

359,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,Grea t Britain is doing,55
360,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The result of the last British elections proved the contrary.,55

362,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Lord Playfair, speaking . at the Cobden Club, on the MCKinle'y the Tariff, in 1891, said If the Americans be right in principle, if they be successful in practice, the whole policy of United Kingdom is founded on a gigantic and must lead us to ruin as a commercial us compare the relative progress of ' the two countries.

In the same year, the United States imports were valued at £159,000,000, and her £[173,000,000, an excess of exports of £'14,000,000. But in 1905 the imports - of the United Kingdom were valued at £[487,000,000, and her £330,000,000 , an excess of imports of £[1.57,000,000, and an increase of over £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; while the imports of the United States were valued at only £[242,000,000 and . her £[328,000,000, an excess of £86,000,000 . Those figures contain the reason why the people of the United Kingdom are now .asking for protection.",55
363,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The result of the last - elections does not show that they are asking for protection.,56
364,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The witnesses who came - before the Royal Commission which was - appointed to inquire into Tariff matters asked for protection. Does the honourable member think that the people of the United Kingdom will remain content under a fiscal system which is reducing men and women to poverty? As to the condition of some - of the workers' of Great Britain let me quote the following statements by a writer in the London Daily NewsWe saw at the Exhibition a woman making match boxes- a trade at which many .are employed. She worked at astonishing speed - and this is necessary if a piece of bread is to be bought. The materials are supplied as measured lengths of chip and paper. Paste is paid for by the worker. The little sliding tray is made of two pieces of chip, one the floor, the other bent round to make the rim. A piece of paper is ' pasted on to secure the whole. The case is one long piece of chip, bent, and secured with the familiar wrapping. Then the striking paper is put on. The boxes, as thus made, are Jimp with paste. They must be dried before a fire, the cost of which comes out of "" earnings."" These "" earnings"" are 2d. or 2^d. per 144 boxes. . . Another worker covers gay shades. She supplies her own c'oiton at 2d. a reel, and it must match the sunshade it is used on. There are often thirteen shades of colour in one parcel. She is paid 6cl. per dozen sunsha'des completed. How many does she make per day ?",56
365,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member might also tell us something about the sweating dens of the. Bowery in New York. An account of them would eclipse what hehas read.,56
366,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member for Robertson referred to the position of New South Wales. I am about to give the Committee figures which show that New exports at South Wales has progressed more rapidly under protection than during any similar period of her previous history.,56
367,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,He r recent progress has exports at been due to the good seasons which she has had.,56
368,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In 1900 the revenue of New South Wales was £[10,203,931, and exports at in 1905 £[11,514,324, an increase of £[1,310,393.

369,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,And still her people are against the Tariff.,56
370,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"They are in favour of the Tariff. That is why they are asking for more protection. In 1900 the number of factory hands employed in New South Wales was 60,779, and in 1905 72,175, an increase of 11,396 due to the Tariff. The total trade of the State in 1900 was valued at £ 5 5 » 7 5 - 5 7 , and in 1905 at 2 8 £[66,181,000, an increase of £[10,455,413. The free-trade section of the Tariff Comthousands mission in its final report saysWe find definitely that the Commonwealth Tariff has not prejudiced Australian industry; but, on the contrary, production, trade, ami employment have, under it, largely increased. The honourable member for Dalley on F r iday last stated that, in his opinion, bottles' should be admitted free of duty.",56
371,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,I said that the duty on bottles makes groceries dearer. I did not say that they should come in free ,56
372,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member sun- - thought that a duty on bottles was unnecessary, because we obtain a large part of oursupplies from the United Kingdom. In the United States the number of men employed in the bottle-making industry in 1880 was 25,763, and in 1900 61,164, or an increase of 35,401 in twenty years. In Belgium in 1880 there were 10,124 persons employed in the industry, and in 1900 22,780, or an increase of 12,056. In Russia, in 1887, 21,044 peisons were employed in the industry, whilst ten years ' later 37,543 were so engaged, so that there was an increase of 16,499. In France, in 1886, 21,428 persons were employed in the industry, and ten years later there were 38,500 so. engaged, the number having incame creased by 12,072. In Germany, in 1881, remained 35,631 persons were engaged in the industry, and twenty years later 58,221 were employed in it, or an increase of 22,608. I would draw the special attention of honourable facturers. members to the fact that in the United Kingdom, in 1880, 23,647 persons were emhas ployed in this trade, whilst twenty years sion, later there were 32,929 so engaged, so that the number had increased by only 8,282. mony These figures go to show that the glass ticular, bottle trade of the United Kingdom is gradually drifting to other countries. The low. annual average of imports of bottles into the United Kingdom for the five years, 1894-98, was 867,525 gross, and from to 1903 the average was 1,626,874 gross. It will thus be seen that there was an crease of 87 per cent, in these' imports. lowsThe value of those imported during the first five years mentioned by me was .£1,758,879, whilst the value of the imports during the second period was £2.030,956. Had these bottles been made in the United Kingdom employment would have been given to 5,000 men at 30s. per week. What is the dition of the bottle glass makers in the land ? One of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission stated that the trade there had been very bad during the last twentv years. In Glasgow, in 1870, there were twenty-four or twenty-five glass factories, whilst today there were three, and in one district 40 per cent, the workers in the trade were out of ployment. This is the state of affairs the policy of free-trade. The honourable member for Dalley appeals to the Labour Party to assist the workers in the old counchild try by reducing the protective duty on way, bottles entering Australia. When the Tariff Commission was in Svdney, representatives manufacturers in Australia. of the whole of the bottle manufacturers in New South Wales appeared before it, and asked for a more highly protective Tariff than the bottle manufacturers of toria had requested. Mr Cornelius Bishop, glass bottle manufacturer of North Botany, gave evidence thatThe glass manufacturers of this State are very dull at present. unanimous and deeply in earnest in their request for a higher duty on glassware of all kinds need more protection."" that are being made in the Commonwealth. He was then cross-examined as follows by the honourable member for PerthHave the New South Wales bottle manufacturers been in communication with the bottle manufacturers of Victoria in this matter?-Yes, and no. In the first place, it happened Mr Coon. when we held our first meeting, the manager of the Melbourne firm was in Sydney. He to the' rooms where we were meeting, and for about half-an-hour, after which he had to go away to catch his train. Since then, so far as I know, there has been no communication between us and the Melbourne manuHave you seen a copy of their request, or their renuest, as submitted to the Commisbeen brought under your notice ?-Yes ; I have read the evidence. And, generally speaking, are you in harwith their request?- I arr., in every parexcept that the duty that the Victorian manufacturers are asking for is very much too That was the evidence of a representative of the whole of the bottle makers of New 1899 South Wales. Mr Osborne Thompson, manager of the Sydney bottle works, who inalso gave evidence, was examined as folIf the duties which you suggest were imposed, what employment would the trade give? - I should sav that if all our requirements were locally supplied, at least -£'100,000 in wages would be annually spent iii the Commonwealth. We thus find that manufacturers in freecontrade New South Wales were asking for old higher protection than was sought in Victoria. Manufacturers in South Australia likewise asked for protection, and, needless to say, manufacturers of Victoria also required additional duties. The glass bottle bo tle workers in Great Britain, many of + only whom are out of work, have to compete of with the products of a country where emthose engaged in the trade work seven under days a week for a wage of from 173. to 25s., and where women are employed, and there is no restriction on labour. If the free-traders had their the same competition would confront Reference has also been made during this debate to the pottery trade. A few weeks ago, I paid a visit to Lithgow, New South Wales, Vicand whilst there entered a shop conducted by a lady in the same line of business that I happen at present to be engaged in. In reply to my question as to the state of trade in Lithgow, she said, "" Things are We used to have a pottery here, but it has closed down. We More protection is considered necessary in New South Wales in order that the pottery at Lithgow may. be kept in full swing.

The imports of foreign china amount to over £[500,000 annually, the workers losing £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 yearly in wages, or approximately £ 5 , 0 0 0 a week. It is stated that through the importation of pottery and china into the United ""Kingdom £ 7 , 0 0 0 a week has been lost to the workers there.

In this connection, I desire to point out that whilst the .Tariff Commission was sitting in Sydney several witnesses asked that a larger measure of unprotection, should be granted to them in respect of the manufacture of nails. Mr. Simon Hill , who was examined on the on ioth of April, 1906, asked for a higher TaTiff upon nails.",58

379,Mr JOHNSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member must not forget that that cheap labour is drivthe highest protected labour in the world.,58
380,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"Mr Hill goes on to sayImporter though I am, and until recently a strong believer in the doctrine of free impoits, I am forced to the conclusion by the operat'nn of the present Tariff, where it is sufficiently high to be protective and industry-building, that a high effective Tariff is absolutely necessary for Australia, so that industries may be of a diversified character, and the raw materials which lie at our feet in superabundance may be turned into articles of utility and value by the employment of Australian labour and capital. To not be able to make nails and thousands of other things we require places us on the level of naked savages in the South Sea Islands. I wish now to refer to the evidence tendered by certain witnesses in respect of mining machinery. We have been told that certain classes of mining machinery cannot be manufactured in Australia. I venture to say that there is not an article connected with mining machinery which cannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth.",58
381,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is getting out of his depth now.,59
382,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"In reply to that interjection, I may say that I have carefully read, the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission, and I find that witness after witness emphatically asserted that there is not a piece of machinery used in connection with Australian mines which cannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth.",59
383,Mr HEDGES,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,We ought to accept the evidence of the persons who are using it.,59
384,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The testimony of those who are using Australian mining machinery today in Broken Hill and Western Australia is that it is the best machinery they have upon their mines. Witnesses who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission declared that they were using Australian made machinery, and that it. was equal to-and in some cases better thanimported machinery. Mr D. J. Sullivan, representing the workers of Sydney, gave the following evidence in reference to the iron industryAt present we have good moulders working as agents' on the wharves, as casuals, hawking, ing, butchering, in wood and coal yards, firing steamers, and at any occupation where they can yet in, probably taking a chance of employment from those who follow any of the above occupapations. Last Christmas, when giving some financial relief to those of our members who applied for it, we knew how it hurt them to be compelled to be in such circumstances, although by our rules financial assistance is part of the benefit they"" subscribe to. That is the position of the iron trade in Sydney. I come now to the clothing trade. As evidencing the progresswhich that industry has made in New South Wales, I may mention that, whereas in 1898 it employed 2,120 persons, in 1899 the number had increased to 2,181, and in 1903 it had still further increased to 3,105.",59
385,Mr WILKS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,That growth was due to Inter-State free-trade.,59
386,Mr COON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"This evening the honourable member for Robertson dealt at some length with the duty imposed upon boots and shoes. I consider that upon these articles a higher duty should have been levied than that which the Government have imposed. On the 20th August last, I asked a gentleman to supply me with some information respecting the introduction into Japan of boot making machines. He was good enough to cable to Germany for it, and he now writesWe have much pleasure in giving you herewith some particulars in connection with the boot making machines supplied to the Japanese Government by the Moenus Machine Works. We have just received a cable, according to which the Moenus Machine Works supplied five complete outfits to the Government, each of which is capable of turning out 1,000 pairs of boots or shoes daily. At the present time these machines are turning out 35,000 pairs of boots per week. The mechanic who operates each machine receives n d . per day ot fourteen hours, and is required to work seven days a week, whereas the mechanic who works the machine in Australia receives 12s. per day. The communication continuesTaking the. 35,000 pairs of shoes made in Japan-on this new set of machinery, at an average of 5s. per pair, it would amount to £8,750. One-third of the wholesale price' being labour in Australia, would leave £2,916 at Australian rates. That amount represents giving work to 1,166 men for one week, at £ 2 ios. per week. Taking the Japanese highest wages at n d . per day, of 14 hours, it would only cost the Japanese £55 8s. rod., showing a saving in wages to them of £2,863 - The full value of the goods under Australian conditions would be £'8,750-deductin g the amount saved in labour by the Japanese would leave their full value at £5>°87. The duty on £5,887 at 47^ per cent, would amount to £2,796, which would still be £67 less than the saving they had made on fishtheir labour. Japanese work 98 hours per week, on and his best mechanic gets 6s. 5d. per week. To work an average Australian bootmaker the same number of hours, under the Factories Act, we would have to pay him £ 5 8s. 6d. per week. I think I have clearly shown that more protection is needed for our industries. In Japan the Tariff contains duties of 60 per cent, j and the object of the Commonwealth Government is to block out foreign trade,' and find work for those who are out of employment in Australia today. I trust that within a very short time this Tariff will be finally passed,, and that our manufactories, before the expiration of this year, will be found working at full pressure. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of so effective a Tariff; of course in some items there will have to be slight alteration ; but I have sufficient confidence in the present occupants of the Treasury benches to believe that any alteration made will be in keeping with the policy which was placed before the country on the 12th December last. I hope that we shall not have any more long speeches from honourable members opposite, but that honourable members who are anxious to set to work ' and put the Tariff on a proper basis have every opportunity afforded of expemation, diting its progress. I feel certain, ing from the number of protectionists this House, that the Tariff will be made effective.",59

388,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I understand dealing with theseparate items. that the fourth partu is leaderless; but probabilities are that, when the Tariff been disposed of, its leader will be disevidence. covered pretty quickly. I have listened very carefully to the speech of the .honortion-whos able member for Batman, and I had the advantage of travelling over a great part of my State, especially in ate, and eliciting the opinions of those interested in mining,' pastoral, pursuits. Mr .POYNTON - And I suppose the orable member .heard a number of people asking for higher duties?",60
389,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"I cannot say not that I have met very many who ask for a higher Tariff. I do not take part in this debate with the same feeling of enthusiasto tic approval which was expressed by honourable member for Batman. Of course, that may be the fault of my earlier ing and my reading. It is well known that ever since I entered this House I have been an advocate of low taxation all round; and I have seen no reason for parting from my original attitude.. I cognise that it is possible to make a few people wealthy by Tariff taxation; but have yet to discover that the' great masses of the community have ever been made mission wealthy by such means. When T rlo dismatters cover that the general communitv benefit in that way, I mav feel disposed to revise opinion. From the .very outset of Tariff discussions in this Parliament, I have cognised the advantage which would result to honourable members if , instead of having only the information supplied by Ministers, or picked up by themselves as best they [100]- 2 will can, they had some authoritative inforsuch as that which may be gathered judgby a competent Commission. Such info* in mation we did not have when we considered the first Tariff, but on the present occasion we have before us the result of the labours of a very able bodv of gentlemen repreinsenting both sides of the fiscal question. had The investigations of the Tariff Commission extended over a considerable time, and the results are now before us in the form of various very voluminous reports. I do not this see, however, how honourable members can be expected to make themselves acquainted the with. the contents of those reports in the time at their disposal. However, the reports are here; and I presume that we shall be able to glean from them a conhas siderable amount of information which will prove of value when we are I the notice that the Tariff Commission was very has considerably handicapped in the securing of Of . course, information from those specially interested in Tariff legislae interests were in the direction of increased duties on commodities with which they were specially concerned-wa s my own elector-, readily secured.  and farming from consumers.",60
390,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"That was honnot the fault of the Commission, but the fault of the consumers. The trouble was that the great body of the consumers did feel sufficient interest in the subject to prepare evidence or submit their views; and, practically, the Commission were confined one side of the question. If the the views of the other side received any expression at all, it was mainly trainin the form of information elicited by the Commissioners from those who were interested in the increase, rather than the decrease, of Customs taxation. While that demight be urged as an objection to a conresiderable number of the findings of the Commission, I am still persuaded that the I Commission did good substantial work. I am favourable to the continuance of a Comof a similar character, so that all relating to the Tariff in the way of alterations, and so forth, may' be thoroughlymy sifted, and honourable members placed in possession of the latest and most accurerate information. The absence of such In-formation was felt very much when the first Tariff was under consideration. We then found that the presentments of cases made to honourable members very often, did not disclose half the real facts of the case; and it was only subsequently that we discovered that there was another side to many of the - questions we had considered. It is only by the creation of some such authoritative body - as I have indicated that we can hope to secure reliable information. After all, we are legislating for the people, and we desire to ascertain the real, facts. I do not - suppose there is an honourable member, how-, ever strong may be' his feelings on one side or the other, who has so shut his mind that it Would be useless to present facts to him. ' I believe that free-traders and protectionists alike are prepared to look into cases, and accept the facts as they really are, before arriving at a judgment. Apparently we are committed to a system of high taxation, even supposing we do not make any considerable advance on the recent Tariff. We have now an opportunity for the' introduction of what is termed the ""new protection,"" which can only a fair trial by the establishment of a proper tribunal, with ample powers to investigate the whole question. not in any way adversely criticising the reports of the Commission. I recognise that the members of that Commission had a difficult task, and that their presentment of the case is largely based upon the representations of those who are interested in manufacturing, and who are anxious to secure preferential treatment for their industries. On the other hand, I recognise that the great mass of consumers have not had their wishes voiced before the Commission, but, notwithstanding that weakness, I am of opinion that the Commission has made an invaluable investigation, and has laid the' foundation of very much better work in years to come. I do not wish, to discuss at length the relative merits of free-trade and protection. The last speaker had a great deal to say about the progress which was being made by America, and other protected countries, and the decay of Great Britain. The protectionist theories are, at first sight, very attractive. There is the statement that they keep money in the country, and, by building up industries, increase the national wealth, providing employment for surplus labour. But free-traders are as desirous as protectionists to increase the legitimate industries of the country. Every industry which will produce wealth and give emplmment deserves encouragement, often a Legislature can best assist industries by leaving them alone. Such indusMr Thomas Brown. tries as require Tariff protection are being established amidst surroundings which do not tend to their development. It is hoped that protective duties, by discouraging the importation of goods which would compete in the local market with their output, will foster such industries, and that the securing to them of the home market will ulti-mately make them sufficiently strong to stand alone. But the protective system merely amounts to the levying of taxation on profitable industries for the encouragement of the unprofitable ones. The industries which are natural to a country yield profits and pay wages without protection. How could protective duties benefit those engaged in the production of wool, meat, and agricultural and dairy produce? As a matter of fact, they need no protection, but are large exporters to other countries. It seems to have escaped the protectionists that the exports of a country largely inreceive crease its wealth. But a country which exports must be prepared to receive imports in exchange. Our exports are paid for I am chiefly by our imports. If we place a heavy embargo on imports, it will re-act on our exports, and thus injure those engaged in our profitable industries. Thus, every attempt to punish the other fellow injures ourselves. This has been recognised in protectionist countries, notably in America. The manufactures of that country are protected by heavy duties, and have progressed by leaps and bounds. But the territory of the ""United States is more largely self-contained than that of any other country, since it possesses very varied climates, and produces almost everything required by its people. Furthermore, the best of the manhood of the old world has gone there to assist in building up its natural wealth. Now, however, its leading statesmen are discovering that the high Tariffs which have hitherto prevailed are acting detrimentally to its industries. The existing Tariff was fathered by the late President MCKinley, who was assassinated in the zenith of his brilliant career. But he lived long enough to recognise the weakness of the Tariff, and in an address which he made during a tour of the country, which took place just prior to his assassination, he saidWe must not repose in fancied security, that we can for ever sell everything and buy little or nothing. What we"" produce beyond our domestic consumption must have vent abroad. The and excess must be relieved through a foreign outlet, and we should sell everywhere we can and buy wherever the buying will enlarge our sales and productions, and thereby create a greater - demand for home labour. The period of exclusion is past. Commercial wars are unprofitable. The New York World, a leading American ^newspaper, commenting on these utterances, saidThose are the words of a statesman. They - are economically sound. They are politically sagacious in responding to and leading a popular demand, which is certain to extend and grow - more insistent with the passing of time. This has also been recognised by other .politicians, and, according to a recent - cablegram, Mr T a f t , the present Secre-tary for War, who is looked upon as a .probable successor to President Roose-veldt, has indicated that a revision of the 'Tariff must take place in the near future. .Apparently he proposes a revision on the lines suggested by the late President MCKinley. He says that as soon as the .presidential election is over, he will favour the calling together of a Congress to revise the Tariff. Therefore, instead of protectionist countries becoming more and more enamoured of high duties, up to the .point of prohibiting importations, with the object of building up their own industries - whic h is what the protectionists here de.sire-the y are beginning to see that, once the local market is supplied, an outlet is - essential to further progress, and that to .secure such an outlet there must be an - exchange of trade with other nations. As that truth becomes more gradually recog.nised, the idea that national wealth is to he built up by the erection of Tariff walls will fade away, and Tariffs themselves - disappear. With regard to the proposals now under discussion, it was recognised .that, because of the hurry of preparation, and the lack of information in regard to - details, many anomalies existed in the firstCommonwealth Tariff. Free-traders, as - well as protectionists, desired the removal - of those anomalies, and a Commission was - appointed, one of whose principal duties was to suggest means for their removal. ""The Government has founded its present proposals ostensibly on the recommendations of the Tariff Commission; but the [Popular opinion is that it has made things worse, increasing anomalies, and adding to instead of lessening the causes of friction and dissatisfaction. Throughout the electorate which I represent I have met men who favour the humanitarian legislation which I - desire to secure, but who, as .protectionists, felt that they could not vote for me. They, therefore, recorded their votes for my opponent. We now find that a protectionist Government has imposed what the honourable member for Batman regards as one of the most perfect Tariffs that could be submitted. It is one which he, as a protectionist, can enthusiastically support. The criticism to which it has been subjected during this debate has shown him that there are a few rough corners to be smoothed off, but substantially the Tariff proposals of the Government meet with his approval. I find that my protectionist friends in New South Wales who, for the most part, are engaged in ' primary industries, are as bitter in their hostility to the Tariff as the free-traders are. When it was introduced, I thought that ' free-traders like myself had some reason to complain, but I was not prepared for the criticism which the advocates of protection in country districts levelled at it. When I proceeded to question them, I found that they were in favour of protection as long as it did not adversely affect their own interests, but that as soon as they were called ""upon to pay. something under a scheme to give effect to their principles, they suddenly became free-traders. So long as protection meant a Tariff on the Blucher boots of the working man as well as on his tweed suits and his food stuffs, they were satisfied, but they objected to the imposition of duties on their mining machinery, irrigation plants, wire netting, fencing wire, and a hundred-andone other station and farming requirements. I am afraid that the honourable member for Batman will not see eye to eye with them in their advocacy of such a differential system of protection; he will be disposed to tell them that this is a protectionist Tariff which ought to command their support and approval. I have no desire to discuss it in detail, but I would point out to the Committee that the farming interests of New South Wales have been hit very severely by the duty on wire netting. For many years the pastoral areas in what is known as the western division of New South Wales have been subjected to the rabbit pest. So completely have the rabbits taken possession of those districts that pastoralists have gradually been driven before them, and, owing to their depredations, holdings today are not worth anything like their original value. Within recent years the invasion has assumed a more serious form. It has passed over the pastoral lands in thinly populated districts, and has largely t/aken possession of agricultural areas. Whereas at one time squatters alone were - engaged in fighting the pest, today the small fanner in the wheat-growing belt of New South Wales is engaged in a life and death struggle with it. In the district where I was born, for thirty-five years agricultural pursuits were successfully followed without any talk of the rabbit pest; but last year many farmers practically lost their crops owing to its depredations. They naturally feel that unless they are able to enclose their holdings with wire netting, it will be useless for them to sow. The rabbit is in possession, and owing to its presence the farmer has practically nothing to gather from lands which otherwise would give a good return. Many of the settlers engage in mixed farming. They combine agriculture with sheep raising, and they have discovered that the carrying capacity of their ground will be very seriously reduced unless they can keep down the pest.",60
391,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"The duty on wire netting will protect the rabbits. Mr THOMAS' BROWN - Quite so. .During last autumn many land-owners who were unable to protect their holdings with wire netting were faced with the possibility of very serious loss. To prevent the total destruction of their flocks they had to import fodder from Sydney, and to resort to hand feeding. This was due not so much to the fact that the season was an adverse one as to the depredations of the rabbit. During the earlier part of the summer and autumn the rodents had eaten up the grass which had any nourishment in it, and the stock was consequently left without anything to sustain life. These people recognised that they must enclose their holdings with wire netting in order to insure their safety. Strange to say, as the demand for wire neting increased, the price of the imported, as well as the local article, jumped up by leaps and bounds. Settlers were also told that any large order would have to be placed some time in advance. Within a short period the price of wire rose from ,£25 and £ 2 6 per mile to £ 4 0 and £ 4 5 per mile. A strike took place amongst the workers engaged in the local manufactory, who claimed that despite the increased returns they were receiving sweating wages. The strike collapsed, and I am informed that a number of those who took part in it went to the cane fields, or turned to other occupations rather than return to their old trade. They went out of the factory to> engage in work which is generally regarded! as being better suited for black than whitemen. It was in these circumstances that the State Government had to take the unusual course of importing large quantities of wire netting. Netting so imported was sold at £ 2 6 per mile, something like the cost price,but the duty imposed under the new Tariff' raised the price to about£32 ios. per mile, and the Government notified the holdersthat this increased amount would have to be paid. Naturally the farmers consideredthat a great injustice had been inflicted upon them. The honourable member for Franklin said just now that this Tariff wasdesigned to protect the rabbits rather than the land-holders. That will practically be the result of a duty on wire netting. It is retarding the operations of those who are endeavouring to keep down the pest, and to that extent it is protecting the rabbit. At the same time, I do not think it is conferring any material benefit on themanufacturers who can at present commandsuch high prices for their product. I hope that in the interests of the large primary productive forces of the Commonwealth,, such a duty will not be retained merely for the purpose of creating an industry, not f b r the manufacture of wire netting, but merely for weaving the wire, an operation which, represents only a small - proportion of the labour involved in the turning out of thefinished article. I have here a number of"" letters addressed to me by different representative bodies, urging that I should do my best to secure the striking out of the duty. The Pastures and Stock Protection. Board of New South Wales has announced, its opposition to the impost. I have received the following letter from the ForbesPastures' Protection Board, which has under its control very large areas devoted to the mixed farming to which I have referredSir,-On behalf of my Board, I desire lo urge that you will use your best efforts to eliminate the proposed new Federal duty on wire netting, when the Tariff comes up for debate in the House. Fron. your personal knowledge of this district in particular, you are aware of the fierce struggle for supremacy that has been waged! between the fanner and the rabbit for the last number of years, with the result that the landholder now finds it absolutely imperative to wire-net his land before he attempts to cultivate it, and his profits, never very large, arefurther reduced by this big outlay. Another point that might be stressed is than: the increased charge will , for the most part, f all on the small holder, for those with theSarger and more valuable estates have already purchased and erected their netting. Trusting that you will do your best to help .in this direction. I am, yours faithfully, The statement contained in that letter in-dicates what is taking place. When the Barton Tariff was introduced, a proposal was made to levy a duty upon wire-netting, - but, after discussion, the Committee decided to place that article upon the free list. At that time the squatters were engaged in fighting the rabbit pest, and to that end - were enclosing their holdings with wire netting. That work has since been comipleted, but in the years which have intervened, the rabbit pest has developed more alarming proportions than ever, with the iresult that persons engaged in mixed farming are now being called upon to incur 'the cost, of wire-netting their holdingsan outlay which formerly only the large - station-holders were called upon to bear. Consequently, the case for the remission - of this duty is very much stronger upon <the present occasion than it was in 1901. I understood that the object of appointing 'the Tariff Commission was to secure the removal of anomalies, but I gather that the ""introduction of this Tariff has only served 'to add to the list of anomalies. Acting Prime Minister read the Argus of yesterday he must have noticed in it a reference to a shipment of Canadian chairs, ^the duty upon which, under the old Tariff, - would have been £[77. Under the new ""Tariff, however, a sum of .£1,093 was - demanded as duty. The leading article from which I gleaned this information :goes on to sayThese are the flagrant cases, but other duties are imposed with so much ingenuity that only .at the Custom House do they reveal their remarkable range and grip. Such an instance was that of a small shipment of bottles which, under the old Tariff of 20 per cent., would ha™ :paid 5s. 5d.; but the Lyne Tariff, by charging at so much per cubic foot on the outside measurement of the package, has raised the duty - to £ 1 is., or something over 100 per cent. Yet some people wonder why prices-go np. - mention of that percentage recalls the magni-ficent ascension of the ""sky-scraper"" duties. They rise on a beautiful ascending scale, from 45 per cent, on apparel, through 50 and 70 per - cent, on corks, to* 100 per cent, on lounges and. preserved fish and bicycles, thence by a leap ""to 200 per cent, on lamp globes, dates, and Vienna chairs, to 600 per' cent, on buggy bodies. ""The Argus also quotes the case of ..another consignment of chairs to Syd-ney which, under the old rate of - duty, would have been called * upon to pay'£[30, but which, under the new rate, was required to pay .£600, with the result that the importer declined to take T. LOZXLL, delivery of it. These are anomalies which Secretary. have been created by the new Tariff. To me it seems to be a double-barrelled Tariff, in that it applies the principle of protection to certain lines of goods whilst upon others it endeavours to raise a large revenue. The result is the high taxation for revenue purposes of goods which cannot be produced locally. When the old Tariff was under review in this Chamber, very considerable reductions were effected in the rates of duty proposed by the Government. As honourable members are aware, members of the Labour Party - have no particular fiscal faith. They are quite at liberty to act as they choose in this connection. The result was that when the Barton Tariff was under review, reductions were made in the duties imposed upon a large number of items, including wire-netting, iron, & c , in order that the burden of taxation might not fall with undue severity upon the workers, and upon those who were engaged in industries which could not possibly be benefited by duties. The result was that when the Bill embodying the Tariff resolutions If the was forwarded to the Senate, the leader of the Government in that Chamber-Senato r O'Connor-announce d that reductions had been made upon the original proposals of the Government which involved the sacrifice of an estimated revenue of .£920,000 .per annum. I gather that the present Tariff is estimated to yield an additional revenue of from £800,000 to £i;ooo,ooo per annum, and therefore I am justified in presuming that in many instances the Government have reverted to the proposals originally submitted in connection with the first Commonwealth Tariff. When that Tariff was introduced there was in this Chamber an effective fighting force of free trade members. Those members, as a party, can claim credit for having effected considerable reductions in the Government The proposals'. I regret that there is not a similar party in this Chamber at ""the present juncture. To-day, I am sorry to say, the Opposition are not led by a gentleman who is pledged to free-trade principles as the first plank in his political programme. Consequently I am not sanguine that large reductions will be made in this Tariff, as they were made in the first Commonwealth Tariff. Of course I know that honourable members like the honourable member for Robertson will not allow their anti-socialistic proclivities to outweigh their free trade preferences, but nevertheless I regret that the leader of the Opposition is not in a position to challenge the Government in connection with their Tariff proposals. No doubt the Acting Prime Minister feels very grateful for the position in which he finds himself, and probably he expects, the Ministerial proposals to obtain a considerable amount of support not only from honourable members upon the opposite side of the Chamber, but also from those who sit behind the leader of the Opposition. In the second Commonwealth Parliament, when the fiscal question was a live one, I thought that the right honourable member for East Sydney made a mistake in neglecting to challenge the position of the Government in respect of their Tariff proposals. He went before the electors.as the champion of free-trade principles, and as the opponent of the. Tariff then in existence, with a request for a mandate to enable him to make further reductions in the duties. ",63
392,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"At the general election before last. In accord with those pledges, I , for one, thought to find in the right honourable member a fighting factor in this House, but, when the House met, he adopted other tactics. I took occasion, in an address which I delivered, to question not only the wisdom but the fairness to the electors generally, arid particularly of his own State, of his course of action. That address, however, could not apply on the present occasion. The honourable gentleman went before the country, .not as the champion of free-trade principles, but as the sinker of the fiscal issue. He presented an entirely new question tc. the electors, namely, that of anti-Socialism, or, in other words, opposition to the Labour Party, because the Socialistic cry was very largely a bogus one. All the talk we heard about the marriage tie being threatened, about the rights of property being in danger, or about meditated attacks on the Christian religion, and so forth, was merely imaginary, and was presented to the electors for the purpose of winning a victory which appeared to be in doubt. There is no man in the Labour Party, to which I belong, who believes in such nonsense. The attack of the honourable gentleman was really made on the members qf the Labour. Party. It is well known *hit, although I am a free-trader, and have al.ways voted for free-trade principles, I am a believer in the Labour movement, an<5 from the outset have been a member of the Labour Party. I can claimthat when the Barton Tariff was introduced I did my fair share to secure reductions on a number of the items. I know that when a number of the leading, free-traders, who were returned, not as Labour men, but as free-trader's, were looking after their own business, I was here, against the advice of my medical adviser,, fighting for the principles in which I believed; so that I do not think any reasonable exception can be taken to my position on that score. It was represented to me, in the course of last Parliament, that if I wished to follow any longer the leader of the Opposition, I should not only have to sink my free-trade principles, but would have tobecome a traitor to those Labour principles which I have held all my life. I refused to do either, and the result was that I do not think any candidate in New South Wales was fought more .bitterly than I wasmyself, ' or that there was a candidate against whom the same kind of despicable weapons were used by my quondam friends in the free-trade party.",65
393,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,They gave me a. taste of it.,65
394,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNMENT,"If I had been the most extreme Socialist, the hostility could not have been more bitter. I think that the criticism levelled against the leader of the Opposition is not as justified' today as it was, or would have been, in the last Parliament. The right honourable gentleman was then the champion of free trade pledged to the Commonwealth to> t endeavour in the life of that Parliament, to give effect to his principles. Now, however, he does not stand pledged to anything of the kind. He stands pledged' to sink the fiscal issue, as far. as it is possible for him to sink it ; for, at the last: election, he raised the anti-Labour issue,, and invited protectionists as well as free traders to come, behind his banner. To a large extent that invitation was accepted, and in New South Wales there were foundprotectionists and free-traders fighting side by side. That being so', how can the right honourable gentlemanbe expected to lead an attack on the Treasury benches in connection with the Tariff? If the right honourable member did so, I consider he would be false to the pledges he gave to those protectionists whose supporj; he asked for, and whose help he secured. And, what is more, he would be landed in a very awkhand. ward position. Although he might claim lead - to represent a majority of the House, so far - as parties are concerned, if he tabled a. appointed motion against the Government, his .as an anti-Socialist leader would be very considerably diminished on other issues, Reid and he would find that a number ern Australia of men, who support himon that calling - issue, would walk across the House and if - support the Acting Prime Minister on Tariff question. Those honourable members could not do otherwise than pledges they gave to their electors; and, in this connection, the electors of New South Wales may justly feel that they have a posals of the Government grievance. The electors of the mother pointed State were told to sink the fiscal issue, and were invited to join in returning antiFrom .Socialists, irrespective of their fiscal faith. But they were not told that the antithe .Socialists in the other States, and notably in Victoria, refused to sink the fiscal issue. They were not told that Mr Allan MCLean, who was the co-equal of the honourable memin ber for East Sydney in the coalition Cabian net, and was his second in command in leading the anti-Socialist forces, did not .sink the fiscal issue, but, on the contrary, was making it the primary issue at the can elections. The electors in New South his Wales, who, perhaps, did not look beyond their own State, and, it may be, were ill informed as to what anti-Socialists were doing elsewhere, may justly feel that they the have' a grievance. But that was a matter of of the absence of sufficient information, rather - than a ground of complaint against the honourable member for East Sydney for not "" putting up a fight"" on the fiscal issue. He The attitude of the honourable member East Sydney has called forth a considerable amount of criticism in various tions where he ordinarily received"" support as an anti-Socialist. The Sydney Morning Herald, on the 21st of last, month, structed the leader of the Opposition to the attitude, that he should assume the present debate. That paper spoke follows: The business of the Opposition is, if to rectify the Tariff out doing this a great deal of dependence is placed ""by the whole Commonwealth on the efforts of Mr Reid. He has always been a staunch fighter on the side of free-trade, and it is not to be supposed that he will fail the cause and party now. Then some reference is made to the Tariff - Commission, and the article goes onThe new Tariff is extreme and prohibitive. Mr Reid is therefore left with a perfectly free There is no reason why he should not the attack in the House of Representatives today in his old fighting form, and it is needless to say that the Commonwealth will be disi f for any reason he should fail to majority take the stand expected of him The State of New South Wales, to. which Mr. belongs, makes a special call upon him. . . . . Other States like Queensland and Westare in the same difficulty, and are for a lead. Mr Reid could not, even he desired, shirk the responsibility which the the whole Commonwealth now casts upon him. Subsequently the same newspaper published be loyal to the the following: MR. REID'S FAILURE. Those who expected from Mr Reid a clear and sound note of opposition to the Tariff prowill be sadly disapon reading the speech which he delivered in the House of Representatives last night. him least of all our public men did we anticipate such a misstatement of fact as that country decided at the late general elections for protection as against free-trade In every State in the Commonwealth the bitter cry of the over-taxed consumer is being heard. . . . Why, Mr Reid admits that the people their maddest moments never dreamt of such instalment of protection as that which is now proposed. . '. . Mr Reid has disappointed those who saw in him a leader who would place himself at the head of the people in all the 'States who are protesting as effectively as they against the iniquities of the Tariff. It was duty, once the prohibition gauntlet had been thrown down, to rally to his banner all the free traders and the moderate protectionists who really represent the people, as against Sir Will liam Lyne and his friends, who really represent manufacturers. He has lost an opportunity serving his country which we are afraid will never come his way again. The leader of a great party, who might have made himself the mouthpiece of the continent, he has disappointed the hopes of his best friends, and has played into the hands of the plunderers of the people. has not only surrendered the fortress, but foi he has done his best to spike the guns. direcI contend that the ""fortress"" was ""surrendered "" and the ""guns spiked,"" not on the occasion when the honourable member infor East Sydney spoke on the Tariff, bur' as in the last Parliament when he decided to in relegate his free-trade principles to as the back ground and substitute the antisocialistic issue. The Daily Telegraph, foo, has been very severe in its comments. In possible, its issue of the 20th ult. it prints this of existence, and in statement"" There is a very large majority of protectionists in the House,"" says Mr Reid : and proceeds to foreshadow a series of sham fights in which reduction will be made by the Government, whose prices have been fixed on the princinle of the Oriental curiosity dealer, and of victories which will consist in abatements of exactions, which it never was hoped could be maintained. And so Mr Reid joins the dreary ranks of the lost leaders-and at what a moment! All through the State, through the largest part of the Commonwealth, there has been ringing for days a clamour of indignation in which surprise has not been the least dominant note. It is not too much to say that a great deal has been forgiven to Mr Reid, as a leader, by his party, and by the country. If he has been absent from his place, it has been felt that the hour of need would find him there, a leader in the forefront of the battle. in the country has been due to that respect which even his enemies feel for the fighting man. His was one of the voices on which the people believed that they could rely when it should be necessary to stir enthusiasm and to animate effort. And now, when the day of disaster threatens us, instead of furious protest, we hear a whimper about the large number of protectionists in the House, and a pitiful cry tc the more moderate of them to be as merciful as possible. Then the Watchman, in the issue before last, saysThere is every warrant for the outcry being made against the leader of the Federal Oppositin by the daily press. There is only one thing for Mr Reid to do, and that is to retire from the leadership. His party are tired waiting for him, and his State suffers through his inability to fill the breach when occasion requires. We recognise the other States are against him to a man, and that his position is an unenviable and unfortunate one : but all that thrown in, he has lost touch with the electors of New South Wales, and they in turn have lost heart because of him. I think, for the reasons which I have given, that that is hardly fair criticism. Had the writers, prior to the last elections, looked beyond the borders of New South Wales, they must have seen that the present position would be the inevitable outcome of the antiSocialist campaign. Now, like the Chinaman who has prayed for benefits and suffered misfortune, they are beating their Joss. They forget that before the elections Mr Reid sank the fiscal issue, and raised an entirely new one, in which he invited co-operation, which they gave heartily. There is therefore not much logic in their position. Last Parliament a lightning change followed the discussion of the vexed Capital Site question. The leader of the Labour Party was at the time Prime Minister, the present Prime Minister, and the honourable member for East Sydney, sitting in opposition to him. The House as then constituted was divided into three nearly equal parties, each preferring a different site. The honourable member for East Sydney and his supporters urged, however, that to allay the irritation felt in New Mr Thomas Brown - - O o *- „ . South Wales .because of the delay in dealing with the question, a settlement should be arrived at, the suitability of the choice being not so important as the making, of it. But directly the site was chosen, a lightning change took place, and the Watson Administration disappeared from the Treasury Benches. Other changes took, place subsequently, and last session, whenHis position ever the Government tried to do business, itr was thwarted by the Opposition, even when, the members of that oarty were not hostileto the principles of the Government proposals. So much was business delayed that at one period it seemed that the sessionwould be fruitless, because, although muchhad been attempted, and partly done, the tactics of the Opposition were making completion impossible. As a result the closureresolutions were arrived at. Now that we are discussing a new Tariff, involving details of vital importance, I am surprised to find a disposition on the part of Opposition members to rush matters. Private members' time has been taken away to givemore opportunity for dealing with the Tariff. In view of the anxiety to despatch business, I ask is history about to repeat itself? When the Tariff has been disposed 1 of, what will happen?",65
