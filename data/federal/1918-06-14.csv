1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister if the Government contemplate the .creation of a. position in London to be held by a member of Cabinet rank? If that is contemplated, will the House be given an opportunity to discuss the matter before anything is done?",20
2,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Before the departure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to London, the attention of the Government was directed to the fact that both Canada and Sonth Africa have Ministers doing active work in London, and it was agreed that be and tire Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) should look into the matter when in London. Beyond that I know nothing. EXPENDITURE ON NAVAL BASES. - Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the expenditure in connection with establishing Navy Bases presented hy Mr Charlton, and Ordered to be .printed. NA CAMP: VISIT S or MEMBERS.",20
3,Mr SINCLAIR,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"Las t night the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) read extracts from a letter which contained reflections on honourable members, including myself. I ask, Mr. Speaker, whether it is fair that quotations of that nature should be allowed to go into the permanent record of our discussions, seeing that the letter itself was a faked one?",20
4,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION," What the honourable member refers to - must have occurred in a Committee of the Whole; I have no recollection of the reading of such a letteT while I occupied the chair yesterday. The reading from letters, newspapers, or other sources, of statements which would be out of order if made directly by an honourable member in the course of his speech, is not permissible.",20
5,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"Bot h statements of the honoraible member for Moreton nre incorrect. I made no reflection' on him, and had no intention of doing so. He admitted last night that he visited the German Internment Camp. I see nothing wrong an that. Had I had the opportunity, I should - have done the - same, to interview the ""writer of the letter about which he oemplained. I have done my best to get the man released, believing Win to he wrongfully interned. ",20
6,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"The Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard) now has the letter. I have no reason for being other than open and frank in regard to it. To my mind, the explanation of the honourable member for Moreton was entirely satisfactory. He said that he had visited the «amp, but not in company with. Any one - Neither I nor the writer of the letter sax) that be had visited the camp to get "" scabs,"" as tihe Minister few Recruiting will see if he looks at the letter, and it is sot suggested that the Minister was at the camp - for that purpose. Any traaorab-le member might be at the camp for a perfectly legitimate 'purpose. The statement in the letter is clear and plain, lit ib Ubaft Mr Kelly., Mr Sinclair, and Mr Orchard visited the camp. I .see nothing objectionable in that. Neither my remarks nor the extract which I read from the letter should convey the idea that those members visited the camp for any. other than .an honest purpose.",20
7,Mr JOWETT,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,Then let the whole letter be read.,20
8,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"-You will be sorry if it is read. In repdy to the second statement of the honourable member for Moreton, I say that the letter is not a faked one, and last night I told him the name of' the writer. MT. GROOM - Hav e you given the name of the writer to the Minister for Recruiting t MT.. FINLAYSON - If he or the honourable member for Wentworth (MT : Kelly) wishes to know thename of the writer I will tell them, but I am not prepared to trust the Government with the name. Yesterday, when speaking of the letter, I gave .from memory the effect erf certain statements in it , and, later, in - confirmation, read those statements from the letter itself. The - letter denounces ine and rr.y comrades here for not. having visited the camp. We are. called everything for not having done our duty to the Australians confined there. The man is an Australian-born citizen.",20
9,Mr BAMFORD,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,Does he suggest that the honourable member himself should be interned' ?,21
10,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"He seems to think that we should get a taste of what those in camp are getting, so that we might have more sympathy with them. I have no objection to the reading of the letter, but those who have asked for it to be read will be sorry if it is read. The Minister for Recruiting has the letter, and if he will read it, I shall make no objection.",21
11,Mr SPENCE,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,The letter is unsigned.,21
12,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,The honourable member for Brisbane is going beyond the limits of a personal explanation.,21
13,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"Then I shall only add that I intended, and made, no reflection on the honourable member for Moreton. I believe that he visited the Camp legitimately, and I would have done so had the opportunity offered.",21
14,Mr SINCLAIR,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,That does not appear from the press reports.,21
15,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I do not know what the newspapers say. I have written to Mr Hall, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, giving him a verbatim report of what I said, taken from the Hansard proof, and also the extracts read from the letter. He will thus have full information ,at first hand, and will be in a position to deal with the statements that have been made. Mr .SPEAKER-Of course, I know nothing of the letter to which reference has been made, hut I again remind honourable members that it is not in order to read from letters, or other written, or printed compositions, statements reflecting on members, which. they would not' be permitted to make in the ordinary course of a speech.",21
16,Mr OROHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"A couple of minutes before entering the chamber this morning, I heard that my name had been mentioned last, night in a letter read by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayam sure. soii) in connection with a' visit to the German Internment Camp, and the securdeavour ing of ""scaibs"" for use during the recent strike in New Sonth Wales. [221]- 2 diately went to the honourable, member for Brisbane, and he was good enough to hand to me the letter which he had read. I have not had time to do more than read certain passages in it which he has marked.",21
17,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,I did not mark them; they were marked by the honourable member for Moreton.,21
18,Mr OEOHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"The letter, speakingof persons, visiting the camp, says-Several Tories have: Sinclair, Orchard, Kelly, and Ball. He wanted scabs at the time of the strike. The statement aboutscabs "" refers to the present Attorney-General of New South Wales.",21
19,Mr JOWETT,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,Who is the writer of the letter?,21
20,Mr OEOHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I cannot see any name attached to it. In another passage the writer saysKelly, Orchard, Sinclair were here, but not inside. Attorney-General Hall was here at the time of thestrike, to get scabs. He got none.",21
21,Sir ROBERT BEST,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,It is a disgraceful slander.,21
22,Mr OEOHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I have no knowledge of any visit paid to the camp by Mr. Kelly, Mr Sinclair, or Mr Hall.",21
23,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,'No oue has said that you have.,21
24,Mr OEOHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"In explanation of my own visit, I may say that some time after the strike ended, I heard that certain goods were being manufactured in the camp, and were being disposed of, or offered for sale, by certain houses in Sydney, these goods thus competing with local industry.. At the invitation of the O.C, I visited the camp, to investigate the charge. - The visit had absolutely nothing whatever to do with the strike. If my memory serves me aright, it was made some months after the strike was over.",21
25,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,The writer does not suggest that you visited the camp in connection with the strike.,21
26,Mr ORCHARD,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,My only visit to the camp was this that I have mentioned.,21
27,Dr MALONEY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"You did no harm, I",21
28,Mr OEOHAED,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,I went out to ento prevent-shoul d it exist-com petition by interned Germans with AusI immetralian workmen outside. Mir. FINLAYSON - The writer of letter is not a German. Later :,21
29,Mr ORCHARD,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"May I be permitted to make a further personal explanation. Last evening, after the honourable member for Brisbane had read certain extracts from the letter which we have been discussing, the honourable member for Calare  the Attorney-General in the New South Wales Government, repeating the statement contained in the letter, and he has just handed to me Mr Hall's reply, which reads as follows:Finlayson's statement that I approached German internees, either directly or indirectly, absolutely without foundation.'",22
30,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I regret that I was not in the chamber when the statement was made by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson); and as I wish to refer later on to the letter he produced, I am anxious' to know whether it will be possible to secure at once the Hansard report of what occurred yesterday ?",22
31,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"It is not customary to allow uncorrected galley proofs of Hansard to be available, except with the consent of the honourable members concerned. Hansard is not yet available from the Government Printer's hands.",22
32,Mr KELLY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"As my name was mentioned last night, it having been said that I had visited the German Internment Camp at Holdsworthy, I have looked at the first three sheets of the letter, which is addressed, ""Dear Mr Finlayson,"" from some internee in .that camp, in order to substantiate the accuracy of the honourable member's quotation, and I find that the letter has apparently no ending. The last sheet is missing.",22
33,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,I can give the honourable member my positive assurance that the whole of the letter is there.,22
34,Mr KELLY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"It does not seem to end in the ordinary way; but I accept the honourable member's assurance. The letter starts with a reminder to "" Dear Mr Finlayson "" that he had promised to raise hell a couple of year3 ago. Dr MALONEY - Doe 3 the honourable member propose to rend the letter right through? the Mr KELLY -<No ; I would only add to the hilarity of the House if I did so. I find that . the reference to myself is contained in the words, ""Kelly, Orchard, and Sinclair were here, but not inside."" I did go inside that camp in order to look over it, and as the gentleman who writes to "" Dear Mr Finlayson "" complains bitterly about the class of food provided there, I wish to say that from personal inspection I found that it was excellent, and was in adequate quantity. I say also that the conditions in that camp are infinitely better than those which our own poor prisoners in Germany are experiencing.",22
35,Mr BAYLEY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"In view of the fact that the letter from which extracts have HALL, Attorney-General. been read is unsigned, and that it casts a reflection upon a memher of another Parliament, and mentions the names of honourable members of this Chamber, I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it would not be in the interests of this House if you saw that all references to the letter and the personal explanations arising therefrom were expunged from the rewords ?",22
36,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,That can be done only by resolution of the House.,22
37,Mr KELLY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"May I suggest that the letter is now the property of the House, and should be tabled as a record.",22
38,Mr FINLAYSON,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,It is not the property of the House.,22
39,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"According to MayIt has also been admitted that a document which has been cited ought to be laid upon the table of the House, if it can be done without injury to the public interests. The same rule, however, cannot be held to apply to private letters or memoranda. I understand that the letter referred to is a private one, and that it has not heen read as a whole, although extracts from it have been quoted. In any case it was read when the House was in Committee, and the attention of the Chairman of Committees should have been called to it at the time if any exception was taken to its character or contents.",22
40,Mr JOWETT,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"In regard to this question of privilege, I understand that last .night the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) admitted that he accepted responsibility for the statements, contained in the letter.",22
41,Mr SPEAKER,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"There is no question of privilege before the House, and this discussion is altogether irregular. I may remind honourable members that it is not in keeping with the dignity or practice the House to involve the Chair in cussion or argument. If honourable mempartment ? bers desire the excision'of anything from Hansard, the Standing Orders provide way in which that may be done.",22
42,Mr KELLY,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"Will the Assistant ister for Defence have careful inquiry cussion of Estimates. made into the exact nature of the proments mises made by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) and others German internees two years ago, and form the House at its next meeting as whether those promises had any relation to the general election, then before the the end of the year. country, or special reference to any as for sistance from the sympathizers with those persons in camps ?",23
43,Mr WISE,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I will submit the request to the Minister for Defence. PATERSON, LAING , AND BRUC E",23
44,Mr BRUCE,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"I wish to make a permates, sonal explanation in reference to the ment made last night by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace) to the effect that the firm of Paterson, Laing, and Bruce Limited, of which managing director, has doubled its reserve, funds during the period of the war. think it is well that the House should know the exact position in regard to the funds referred to. On the 21st July, 1914, about ten days before the war broke out, the company's reserve fund and unsoldiers divided profits stood in the balance-sheet £159,692, whereas on the 21st July, 1917, when the last balance-sheet was made up, at Broadmeadows? they stood at £180,152, showing an increase of about £20,000. The that they have been doubled which would mean that they would now stand at about £320,000, was extremely unfair. ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE .",23
45,Mr HIGGS,GERMAN CONCENTRATION,"In the early days of Federation it was customary to bring forward the Estimates of expenditure at a comparatively early period of the financial year, and - to allow several days, and even weeks, for their discussion. view of the fact that our expenditure now amounts to over £120,000,000, will the Treasurer, when he brings forward his next Estimates, do BO in suflicient time before going into recess, or before any adjournment of the sittings of the House, to enable at least one day, if not two or' of three days, to be made available for the disdiscussion of the Estimates of each De",23

Australian Parliaments have Minoccupied a great deal of time in the disI n State Parliaa month is often assigned for the consideration of them, and of the Approto priation Bill covering them. However, in - such an arrangement is only possible to when Parliament assembles in the middle of the year, and concludes its sittings at All arrangements fixed sittings of this Parliament have , been dislocated owing to the war, and a great number of irregularities, with which the honourable member is just as familiar as I am, have crept in in relation to the consideration of many subjects. I am anxious to give a reasonLIMITED. able time before the close of the financial year for the consideration of the Estiand I can promise' the honourable statemember that in the next sittings of the House I shall endeavour to afford more time for the consideration of next year's Estimates than we have been able to I am devote to them at this time. I NA SOLDIERS.",23
47,Dr MALONEY,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,Will the Defence Department endeavour to obtain for the in uniform who are stationed at at Laverton the same reduction in railway fares as applies to those who are in camp,23
48,Mr WISE,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,I will submit the matstatement ter to the Minister for Defence. LENGTH OF ADJOURNMENT .,23
49,Mr WEST,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"rOwing to my desire to assist in recruiting and make myself thoroughly acquainted with the industrial conditions and welfare of the people of the Commonwealth outside the State of New South Wales, I would like to know from? the Acting Prime Minister how long he proposes to deprive me of the In privilege of coming to Parliament?",23
50,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,I know how deeply the honourable member appreciates what he describes as a privilege. No doubt what is regarded by other honourable members as a grave obligation is to the honourable member a j o y f u l privilege.,23
51,Mr WEST,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"Tlier e is no need to put in the *' d i r t .""",24
52,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,May I not be permitted even at this late stage of our sittings to indulge in a little b it of humour at the expense of the honourable member?,24
53,Mr WEST,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,Certainly .,24
54,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"During the last month or so ample opportunities have presented themselves, to us to make the honourable member a target, but we have restrained ourselves. However, I believe the Government will be able to summon Parliament in August, and I assure the honourable member and his friends opposite that as soon as we have our financial measures ready for presentation to the House Parliament will be called together. 'PUBLIC SERVICE . MAGISTERIAL INQUIBV .",24
55,Mr FENTON,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"Will the Prime Minister ascertain who is responsible for bringing men before Mr Barnett, P . M . , who has' been intrusted with the task of inquiring into the enemy origin of members, of the Commonwealth Public Service?. Men of long standing in the Public Service, and the descendants of British parents, have been placed in very humiliating positions in this regard.",24
56,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"The terms of Mr . Barnett's commission were published. They gave him a free hand to inquire into the - matters referred to by the honourable member, but I do not know what procedure has been adopted by him, or by the Department. I shall make inquiries, and endeavour to inform the honourable member later today. SCOTTISH REGIMENT .",24
57,Mr FINLAYSON,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I am advised by the secretary of the Brisbane Caledonian Society that they have carried a resolution asking me to support the formation of an Australian Scottish Brigade. Although the matter is somewhat belated, I should be glad to know if the Government have finally decided anything in regard to the formation of such a brigade;",24
58,Mr WISE,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"The matter is still the subject of communications, but I may tell the honourable member that last night the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Livingston) informed me of what I expected was the case long ago, namely, that the formation of such a brigade was now unnecessary, because every man withScottish blood in him who was eligible, had already enlisted without waiting for a particular uniform. SHIPPIN G BOARD. THROUGH BILLS OF LADING . Mr CORSER. - In view of the very unsatisfactory control of shipping from Great Britain to the Commonwealth, by which a monopoly is established in about, two ports of discharge, through the Board refusing to issue through bills of lading to. final portsof delivery, which have been issued in the past, to the detriment of i m porters to other ports, and through the refusal of shipping brokers at the port of . shipment in Great Britain to sign bills of lading until after a vessel has sailed, thus preventing the shipping and banking documents being despatched - u n t i l the following steamer, which may be at least Acting two weeks after the departure of the vessel on which the goods are shipped; also through the refusal of the Shipping Board to accept any responsibility for p i l lage or damage in respect to cargo, which is not taken delivery of upon discharge, and. which cannot be done without presentation of the shipping documents which are still on the seas, the owners of the goods not being mentioned in the ship's papers-wil l the Acting Minister for the Navy, controlling shipping, take steps to tr y to remedy this state of affairs.  courtesy of the honourable member, I was able' to submit his' question toAdmiral Clarkson, who is in control of the Shipping Department, and his reply is as follows: The statement that shipping brokers refuse to sign a bill of lading until after the vessel has sailed cannot be understood, and it is thought that it can only apply under very exceptional circumstances. The British Ministry of Shipping has directed that through bills of lading are not to be issued. It is a matter outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction and is drectly due to scarcity of tonnage. The Shipping Board is of opinion that this action was, under war conditions, unavoidable. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL FORCE. ALLOTMENTS AND ALLOWANCES.",24
59,Dr MALONEY,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"In the interests of recruiting, and having regard to the difficulty of obtaining recruits, of which those who go on the platform are well aware, will the Assistant Minister for Defence make an announcement at the earliest opportunity, through the press or to honourable members, as to the number of wives, children, and dependants of men at the Front or on home service who, through no fault of their own, have had their allotments and allowances reduced or cancelled ?",24
60,Mr WISE,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I will convey the honor-"" able member's request to the Minister for Defence. NAVA L BASES. WASTEFUL EXPENDITUBE.",25
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"Has the Acting Minister for the Navy given attention to the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which shows that wharfs in connection with naval bases have cost 17s. per foot, although similar wharfs have been constructed in Melbourne for about 8s. per foot, and in other parts of Australia at considerably less cost ? Is this waste of money, which has now become a public scandal, being continued, and are the men responsible for the blunders still allowed any voice in the disbursement of public funds?  in the press this morning, and, having been a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I have some knowledge of the information on which the report is based. The wharf work at one of the bases has been completed, and I am not aware whether any other wharfs are. being built. ""All I can say is that I shall endeavour to prevent any future bungling of the kind. DEPORTATION OF ITALIANS.",25
62,Mr BUENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"In all good faith and seriousness I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will receive a deputation, if not from non-naturalized, then, from naturalized Italian citizens of this country, who feel that the non-naturalized Italians are between two firesnot having'their point of view adequately represented to the Italian Government through their Consul, and, being Italians, not having the full protection which they think they ought to have from the Federal Government? Will the Minister allow the naturalized Italians to place soberly and temperately before him tlieir views regarding the injustices under which their non-naturalized former compatriots labour?",25
63,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I do not think that there is any real objection to the proposal which the honourable member now makes. Naturalized citizens of Australia are entitled to approach the Government cr Parliament in order to discuss matters which they and their former compatriots may be interested in. T will consider the matter with the honourable member after the House adjourns. There is no time to do that now. May I take this opportunity of removing what I think is an improper etigma upon the Italian Consul and for which the honourable membeT for Batman is responsible? As I read Hansard, the honourable member implied, rather than expressed, that the Italian Consul was an Austrian. I think the 9d - honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) made that statement definitely.",25
64,Mr BRENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I did say that I had good information, and that I believed, that the Consul-General is a man' of Austrian parentage, but if that is disproved I am quite prepared to make amends in Hansard.",25
65,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I do not accuse the honourable member of having said that the Consul is an Austrian, but I understood him to say that that gentleman is in favour of the Austrian military system, and is immersed in Austrian military traditions. To those statements the Consul, in a representation to the Government, takes very strong exception. In fact, he has asked me to report the matter to Parliament in a formal way. That I am not prepared to do, but I have replied that the Government sympathize with him in the attacks which have been made upon his character. The Government are ""not responsible for the appointment of consuls in this country. They are appointed by the Governments of the countries they represent, and I presume that those Governments, select persons who are qualified by blood and training for the tasks with which they are intrusted. But the Commonwealth Government have to approve of the exequatur or appointment, and in the case of Chevalier Eles the appointment was regularly made, and received the approval of tha Commonwealth Government. Anything beyond that is a flagrant insult to a representative of a foreign power.",25
66,Mr HIGGS,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"Is the Acting Prime Minister able to say what is the exact status of the Consul, and how far he represents the Italian Government in Australia?",25
67,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"The appointment was made long before I took office, but officers of the Department which deals with this matter assure me that the appointment was regularly made hy the Government of Italy , and was just as regularly approved by the Government of Australia. That being so, the matter should end there. Consuls are visitors to our land, and in time of peace any attack upon one of them would be resented most indignantly by their Governments. The ideas of the honourable member for Batman have clashed with the duty which the Italian Consul has been obviously instructed by his vernment to carry out. That duty is inatter of which the Consul can judge. He is the servant of his own Government. Any responsibility for what has been rests not upon the Consul, but upon Commonwealth Government. The Auscept tralian Government could have refused sanction the proposals of the Government of Italy in regard to the gathering up reservists and other soldiers for service Italy , but in the discharge of what thought to be our duty to a friendly try,- we acquiesced in the proposal. Italy's request, we said that we would give the Consul all the assistance necesrerepresented sary to accomplish his task. That should end the matter so far as the Consul concerned. Honourable members may place what responsibility they choose upon Commonwealth Government, but I that the honourable member for Batman, on reconsideration of the matter, will withdraw any sneers upon the appointtlieir - ment or parentage of the Italian Consul. That gentleman has his duty to perform.",26
68,Mr MCGRATH,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,And he performs i a very unpleasant way.,26
69,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,'The honourable merely accepting an ex parte statement.,26
70,Mr MCGRATH,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"No , I have had to terview him. - Mr Watt - The honourable member can be just as unpleasant as found Chevalier Eles a gentleman in every sense of the word. I have said before that he appears to be a singularly culit tured Italian representative, and I not think we ought to place strangers, approved and hall-marked by both Governments, anv stigma that would reflect back upon the Governments responsible for their appointment.",26
71,Mr BRENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I feel keenly the observation of the Acting Prime Minister that I have indulged in a sneer with respect to the supposed nationality of the Italian Consul. I uttered no such sneer. I would be among the last in this House ""to cast any reflection upon a man by reason of^his parentage or nationality.  sneered at our Allies this morning.",26
72,Mr BRENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"I think I would be the last to do that. What I have done is this: I took advantage of the opportuniGoties which the Government and the forms not a of the House gave me, to move the adjournment in order to put the view that the Ministry was wrong fro m the beginning in acceding to the request of the done Italian Consul for the deportation of the these men. The Government did not acthe view I put, and apparently they to are continuing to carry out the Consul's wishes. Since taking that action I have of urged that we ought to offer a special in measure of protection to non-naturalized we persons within our shores who are encountitled to the hospitality and protection At of the British Government and the Commonwealth -'Government. I have also that we are entitled to give these men every facility to .communicate is with their own Government. The position has been misrepresented, unwittingly, the by the Acting Prime Minister. J doubt hope whether his Attorney-General wonld officially support his statement that the proper course for these non-naturalized persons to adopt is to communicate with own Government through their Consul here. That, I suggest, is an entire misconception of the duties of the Consul t in for any country, and it deprives these men of their legal right to communicate member is with their own Government.",26
73,Mr WATT,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,May I say that the answer inI gave the honourable member is the oflicial reply after due inquiry i u the Government Departments as to the proper chanI can.' I have nel of communication.,26
74,Mr BRENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"Then I must accept it , although I do not admit that is correct. It is quite likely that the do attitude of the Consul towards the Leader upon visiting of the Government- ",26
75,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO, Order ! I do not think the honourable member is entitled to go into that matter in making a personal explanation.,26
76,Mr BRENNAN,RAILWAY CONCESSION TO,"W h i l e it is true that the Acting Prime Minister himself has nothing to complain of as to the Italian Consul, it is equally true that Italian residents here represent that they have much to complain of, and think it is only fair that, as foreigners they should be permitted to communicate freely with their own Government. I submit that that claim is unanswerable, and I ask the Acting Prime Minister to reconsider the position in-that regard. NA AUSTRALIA.",27
77,Dr MALONEY,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,"An injustice, I think, is being done to the Consul said to have been appointed by the party now in - power in Russia to represent that country in the Commonwealth. I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, if the Russians in our midst-and who, rightly or wrongly, think they know more about Russia and its affairs than do the outside public-desir e that M . Simonoff shall (represent their country here, he will extend courtesy to that gentleman until the proper papers come to hand either from Russia or the Home Land?",27
78,Mr WATT,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,"I do not think I can be accused of discourtesy to M . Simonoff. While the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) did not see fit to receive him either officially or unofficially, I have taken a further step, and have discussed with him in a purely unofficial way some of the problems confronting him.",27
79,Dr MALONEY,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,- I did not wish to suggest that the. honourable gentleman had been guilty of any discourtesy towards M . Simonoff.,27
80,Mr WATT,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,"I have asked the British Government if M . Litvinoff, who occupies a similar position in England, has yet heen recognised or dealt with in any * way, and I have as far as possible placed the unofficial representative of the present Russian Government here in as good a position as that occupied by M . Litvinoff in London. I am informed that M . Simonoff wishes > to leave Australia, and after consultation with the British Government I have advised him that no opposition will be offered to his departure, provided he goes through channels that are acceptable to the Allied Forces. HOME SERVICE BADGE .",27
81,Mr GREGORY,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether a new regulation has been issued enabling home service men to wear the same badge that is worn by men who have been at the Front. iii other words, is there a regulation under which men occupying soft' jobs in the Department may wear the same badge that isworn by men who' have fought at Gallipoli ?",27

86,Mr WATT,REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIAI N,"This question deals practically with the matter covered by the first question on the business-paper. I could not have done more than formally refer the honourable member to my reply to his earlier question, but that by this morning's mail I received, with the compliments of the Hon. D . R. H all , Attorney-General of New South Wales, an extract from the Sydney Sum, of I 3 t b inst., which embraces a statement from his own lips in regard to this matter. I think that, in justice to him, I should read it It is as follows:Mr Hall (Attorney-General), who returned to. Sydney yesterday from Japan, referred this morning ""to a, q,ues.tion asked in the House of Representatives during his absence in the East regarding the alleged internment of an Australian lady. ""The fact is,"" said Mr. Hall, "" that when Mrs Hall and I arranged to visit China and Japan, a lady friend whom we knew very well decided to make the tripat the same time. The lady is an Australian-, daughter of aBritish soldier, married to a Britisher, and has two brothers fighting at the ingWhether, Front. Onewas wounded at Mons, and the the other is now on active service in Mesopotamia. I had no hesitation in supporting her applicasentations tion for a passport, and at the same time sured the Federal authoritiesthat the lady would returnto the Commonwealth within four months. She went to the East, and in due course. The suggestion of her internment Is rather a brilliant effort of imagination on the part of some one in Australia. We never .heard the idea mentioned, even in the vaguest way, either in Japan or China.."" PUBLIC SERVICE SALARIES. AUTOMATIC INCREASES.",28

Females employed in the Taxation Branch of the Treasury Department were formerly employed under the designation of assistants, and were paid the rates laid down for persons employed in that position (-5s. per day to 8s. 6d. per day, according to age.). It was found, however, that the value of the work did notmerit the pay attached to .the position of assistant, and a new designation of female sorter has been introduced, with a minimum rate of pay of '3s. 6d. per day for those under twenty-one, nnd 7s. per day for those twenty-one years!

102,Mr MASSYGREENE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) a while ago asked me a questiou as to shipping available for the carriage of jute, and I promised to obtain additional information. The Minister in charge (Senator Russell) has forwarded me the following memorandum from the Chief Prices Com The position with regard to the shipping is that the Shipping Board is now expecting to have the following steamers available between now and the end of December:Carina, four trips; Australs (2), eight trips; Talatoa, three trips; Carawa, three trips; Yankalilla, one trip; making nineteen trips in all, whereas the. estimated requirements are twenty-seven trips of 7,000-ton steamers. Continued efforts are being made to obtain this additional tonnage. The Carina is due in Calcutta this week, and will commence loading at once. The Yankalilla is now on her way to Calcutta, and it is expected that the Talawa, and probably two Austral boats, will be available for August loading. It is further part of the scheme that the vessels mentioned shall remain in the direct trade between Calcutta and Australia during the season. An additional part of the scheme is that a certain amount of cargo shall be taken to Colombo by a local service, and there transhipped to transports and other boats calling at Colombo from Egypt on their way to Australia. Of course, that latter will be additional to the nineteen steamers of which we know at present. BUDGET , 1917-18.

103,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Melbourne) [12.3]. --When the House adjourned last night after a prolonged sitting of thirty-one and a half hours, I had the privilege of the call; and I have now to express the hope that all honourable members feel as fresh as I do after a good night's rest. I first desire to draw attention to the result of the by-election in the Albert Park constituency for the State of Victoria, which shows which way the wind is blowing in the matter of price fixation. Honourable members will have seen from thismorning's newspaper that Mr Hannan, the successful candidate, had a majority of 1,841 over his next opponent, as compared with the majority of 1,540 recorded for his predecessor, the late Mr . Elmslie. B ut for the stand taken by the Age, I do uot think that the Federal Government, or their supporters, would have made any pronouncement in regard to price-fixing; but we have yet to learn exactly what they intend to do, and how soon it will be done. If the Government carry out the promise that has been made to the House, it will be made plain . to every purchaser how much he is called upon to pay, and if he is overcharged there will be an official to whom he can' appeal. I only hope that this official will have the power to institute any legal proceedings necessary, so as to - remove. from the private individual the onus of initiating a prosecution. The leading article in the Age of today saysIn establishing the practice of the short session and the long recess, the Government is making a serious mistake. That is my opinion, and I am sure it-is the opinion of the public generally. We members are not earning our £12 a week by holding short sessions and taking long holidays. I much prefer Parliament to be in session, for then Wrongs may be readily remedied, whereas if Parliament is not sitting weeks of delay may be involved. The leading article goes onNow, when the 'Commonwealth is spending more than £80,000,000 a year on war, and has vast trading interests throughout the couti. ncnt, there is more reason why recesses should be short and sessions long than there was in the days of peace, when the Federal Parliament was expected to sit for at least six months in the year, and on one occasion sat almost continuously for eighteen months. Any member on the election platform who expressed disapproval of these sentiments would receiveshort shrift at the hands of his. constituents. The Government has promised preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and propprtional representation for the Senate; and why should we not have. - a special session of a week to settle this - electoral question once and for all ? Our .industrial laws, both State and Federal, ^require disentangling and strengthening, and this work should be done before we - rise. The leading article proceedsThe most regrettable features of the political position are the indifference of Parliament in general to the establishment of new industries, and the light and airy way in which the Administration is .scattering the public funds. The anxiety of members to promote comfortable means of life for .discharged, soldiers was as admirable as it was politic. .1 bave spoken on many and various platwhere, forms in .aid of recruiting, and any young at pulling burrs out of wool. man, with the rich blood coursing in his veins, wiil .always .be welcomed by me the service of his - country; but we ought ito consider ousrselves pledged to see the interests of those he leaves When a man enlists and goes to the Front, prepared to offer the supreme^ sacrifice., every care should be taken to* 'insure that no injury results to his pendants, whether they be wives, >er children, even though he may. - be guilty of some fault from a military point of view. The letters I have ceived in reference to this matter make long to do something that would prove very awkward to those who are to blame. I refer to the case of a mother and three children, who have had every penny of their allowance withdrawn at a moment's the amount of those pensions. notice. The wife received a letter May stating that a cable had been sent by the Chief Paymaster, London that the soldier was absent without and that that neteessit&ted a cancellation of her allotment. When I submitted case to the Assistant Minister fence he gave me a very sympathetic reply, and expressed the opinion that such cases the women, and especially children, should not be made to suffer. This is only one out of many cases - For instance, if a soldier draws his pay at the Front, .his wife dependants may be compelled to go short. Does the Minister think that the occurrence of these cases assists in recruiting? If I , with others, were to lead the parents, old men, women, and children, who are suffering, the streets of Melbourne, to the citizens for food and the means to live, what would ihe effect be? The Minister must think as I do, that Dr Maloney. cases prejudice enlisting. The neighbours who know of them are likely to say to in tending recruits, "" Why go to the Front ?"" After I have spoken on recruiting platforms I have often had individual cases brought before me, an'd I have been asked Is this fair and just ?"" I find it most difficult to answer the objections which spring fro m injustice. A large number of returned soldiers have been offered the opportunity to leara wool sorting and wool classing, and l&ey have been sent to the stores of the Australian Estate and Mortgage Oompany, they say, they are employed only Two of those who have been sent have been in in many a shearing shed, and they .thought that they were getting a good opportunity to to improve their positions, but they combehind. plain that they are learning nothing. The honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner) has assured me that it is ridi' culous to try to pull the burrs out of wool, - debecause they can be much more cheaply mothers, and better got r i d of by a process of carbonization and the use of certain rolling machinery. These aaien are keptiat work for reeight hours a day, but do not receive the me wages which would be paid to an ordinary labourer. Those >of them who have been granted pensions-and pensions are given only to severely wounded men, and to men permanently injured in health-ar e fined In other dated words, a man is allowed to earn £2 2-s. per week, but if he is in receipt of a penstating sion of 15s. per week, that is deducted, leave, making his earnings 27s. per week. These men ""complain, with justice, that if the the value of the wool is increased by the refor Demoval of the burrs, they are contributing to the wealth of the firm by which they in are employed, for payments below the the wages that in the ordinary way would have to be paid for such services, and similar therefore that they are being exploited, overand other workers are being indirectly and injured. Why should not these men be sent to the Working Men's College to learn this business, the stores that I have mentioned being used - only if there is not sufficient accommodation at the college? throoigh Of course, as a boy, I have picked uy» a appealing fleece in a woodshed, but I know nothing of ithe wool intestry. It is, however, an insult to men to employ them on a iask these which - is an absurd - one. I coine now to the fixingof prices, and the robbing of the public, hourly, daily, and weekly, to the extent of thousands of pounds. The high prices of foodstuffs will bring infamy on our parliamentary institutions if we permit them to continue. In this' connection I wish to read a statement, recently published in a newspaper that used to be the strongest organ in Australia fighting for Liberal measures. It is stated in that journal that the people are being overcharged by millions of pound's. This is not the statement of a Labour man or a Socialist, but that of a wealthy newspaper, whose writers feel the injustice inflicted on the community hy the robbery that is going on at the present time. Parliament permits this robbery; because it could put an immediate stop to it . The criticism of the Age should win for that paper the: appreciation of every head of a family who is finding difficulty in. making ends meetYet on that point Mr Watt. is. silent;, There is the' Government's decision. The people; must pay double,, or go without, and. try and look as pleasant as-the tameuess of vegetarianism will permit them. "" The control of meat prices is universal now m the: belligerent, countries/ writes the Gommission, "" and as: has been seen,, the indirect, as well as the direct, effects, of' thewar have been elements' in bringing about the' present high pricesin Australia. The' policyof countervailing such exceptional influencesby national action, has,, therefore, the: support of world-wide precedent."" . . . . has yet to realisethat in order to "" win the war "" it is not essential to enable afew to make huge: profits at. the expense of themany, oc stoutly to defend those, profits against taxation. I believe, that the tworichest, members of this Parliament have naade< their money honestly and straightforwardly, and bave 1 always - treated their employees well , which is not always, done by the wealthy. Suish persons as they, audi the. big companies, trusts, and combines that, are making, huge profits, should' know that in the hour of the. country's, need' it is their duty to contribute largely towards the expenses of Government'. By no. word or vote will I add to the cross which must be borne by persons of moderate means-the labour section of the community-afte r the war. We may have to give up the hope that, we can compel the enemy, which has been misled by the brutal Prussian military system^ to indemnify us.  if we get through at all.",31
104,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"If I had the power, I would rather make Germany pay than make Australia pay for the expenditure that we have had to lincur in. connection with the war, for which we are in. no way responsible'. I hope to see the military power of Germany broken and destroyed, so that it can never again be effective. But I havegreat regard for the middleand southern Germans, asad great, reverence for the great scientists, musicians, artists, and litterateurs of Germany. The only name among them indicating Prussian descent is that of K a n t , the-, great philosopher. I have mixed a gseat. deal' with Germans, as boy and. man;, and believe that, generally"", speaking, they will' welcome the time, when Geriaaay wildbe a series of republics, and the kinglets and: princelets. who now obey the: behests, of the Kaiser will be-known norinore. It is said "" You cannot fix prices, and any attempt will break down, as previous attempts have broken down.''' People speak of what was done in the reign of Diocletian in 30>1 A.D., and under Julian 1 in 361 A.D., whose systems both failed. Such anobjection is asidiotic as would be the statement that because in the old' Roman days the swiftest mode of progression was the two-horsed chariot,, whose ruts can be. seen in thei streets, of Pompeii at thisday, one of the. swift, aeroplanes* now being used on the .West. Front, couldParliament not fly from Melbourne, to Sydney in sb. . houars. We>haverrailways,, telegraphs, teb>phones,, and many other mechanical contrivances of which former peoples knew nothing, and so Gomparisoncam be madebetween their state of knowledge and our own. Therefore it is absurd to say that we must fail , and that we cannot succeed 1 because they failed. Another objection t h at is raised is that in the turmoil o£ the . French revolutionthe regulationof prices was attempted' and failed. That revolution swept away the rule of thei aristocracy and brought about the expression of all sorts of wild ideas and theories:, but as Allison, the conservative historian, has remarked, "" never in the history of the world has there been such an uprising of genius and the appearance of so many great minds within so shorta space of time as. in that period.'' The press is at times, a great tyrant, as the Labour party has often had cause to know, but it is one of the greatest educators that the world' has seen,, and I am glad to be supported by the A ge when I say that it is ridiculous to declare that we cannot fix prices. Have not Greab Britain and her mighty Allies, as well as her terrible enemy, fixed prices ancl organized industry in the midst of the turmoil of war? How much more easy should it be for us to do it under conditions of comparative peace? Government, however, want us to take a holiday and put the matter aside. recess is a holiday for me, because I live close to my constituency. Le t us, as men, face the difficulties and, taking advantage of our position, declare that we will fix prices. Let us see that the farmer gets a fair price for his wheat at the station. Let us try to induce the State Government to carry the farmers' wheat at zone rates. My memory carries me back to perhaps the greatest surgeon who passed from the last century into the present, Jonathan Hutchinson, who advocated the nationalization of bread, proposing that every family in Great Britain should have its allotted portion. In the same way I am speaking for the farmer.. I was a settler over forty-five years ago. I only mention it in order to make my argument stronger, and show that my sympathy is always with the man on the land. On the question of the savings to the people let me quote from State Regulation of Prices in Australia, written by that brilliant student of the University' of Melbourne, Mr H . L . Wilkinson, a member of the Price of Goods Board of Victoria, and a winner of a great prize that few men have been able to obtain. On page 73, Mr Wilkinson, in his book, says- The Hon. D. K. Hall, Attorney-General of the State of New South_ Wales, who administered the price-fixing legislation of that State, estimated that the following savings were made to consumers as a result of the State regulating the trade in these commodities :On account of reduced prices of wheat ... ... ... £600,000 On account of reduced prices of bread On account of reduced prices of butter ... ... ... 152,000 That makes a total of £890,000 to the extent of which the people of New South Wales have benefited. On page 79 we have the followingThe accountant of the Commonwealth Prices Board, in a statement published on 24th August, 1916, estimated the benefits accruing to the consumer as n result of fixing the prices Dr Moloney. of bread and mill products since March, 1916, as follows :Saving (due to reState. duced price of bread).

Some further figures, which ought to be placed on record in Hansard in order to give a basis for fixing the price of wheat, flour, and bread, are to be found on page 95 of the same bookIn a report issued on 16th June, 1916, the board, in regard to fixing prices, says:- We have considered the question whether the fixation of minimum prices by legal enactment for wheat, flour and bread, or by the method of ' recommended, prices ' would be the best suited to the conditions prevalent in New Zealand. There are difficulties to be encountered under either system, but on the whole we prefer the latter method, and suggest that the following table should be the recommended prices, subject to alterations by the Board of Trade, as 138,000 may be required by changing conditions from time to-""""time :Wheat Flour Bread per per bushel (per ton 4-lb. loaf (delivered at mill). f.o.b.)

St 4s. 9d. to 5s. 12 5 0 ... 6Jd. At 5s. to 5b. 3d. 13 0 0 ... 7d. That table is borne out by some prices which I shall quote from Mr H . L . Will kinson's The Trust Movement in Australia, giving the quotations for flour and the ruling prices for bread in Victoria as follows: Flour Bread End of July, (per 2,000 lb.), (per 4-lb. loaf). £ s. d. 1907 .. 9 5 0 oiato 6d. 1908 .. 9 10 0 od. to 6d. 1909 .. 11 10 0 oid. to 64d. 1910 .. 9 10 0 aid. to Oid. 1911 .. 8 0 0 5*d. to 6d. 1912 .. 9 5 0 B*d. to 7d. 1913 .: 8 15 0 7d. When the people of Victoria were paying £11 10s. per ton for their flour, in the other States the price ranged from £ 1 0 2s. 6d. in some cases to about £ 1 2 in Queensland. Yet we were paying 7d. and 7£d. for the loaf of bread.",33
105,Mr BAMFORD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,What has been cause of the increase in prices?,35
106,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I ascribe it to the fixation of the price of wheat at 4s. 9d. per bushel, although We have enjoyed bountiful harvests. Of course,, wages have also been increased to a slight extent. Although flour was only £ 8 15s. per ton in 1913, the price of the 4-lb. of bread in Melbourne was 7d. paying too much for bread at. present. Allowing for an average of 1,335 2-lb. loaves of bread to be made out of the ton of flour, estimated at 2,000 lb - a honourable members may be aware, a of flour in the process of bread-making will absorb about 670 lbs. of water-and liable. selling them at 3d. per small loaf, a return of £ 1 6 13s. 9d. per ton of flour, others do. which costs £ 1 0 7s. 9d. Thus there is a margin of £ 6 6s. per ton of flour to cover. working expenses and return a profit to the baker. Chapman, of the Technical College, New their bread-making. South Wales, has by experiments obtained far greater results - of course, with a smaller quantity of yeast than the average baker uses - and he has shown published at Benallathat it is possible to obtain 1,400 2-lb. loaves from a ton of flour. to induce a ton of flour to absorb 800 lbs. could of water, and working on his basis an upthe to-date baker should obtain a return of £17 10s. at 3d. per loaf for each ton of tism flour made into bread, giving a balance £ 7 2s. 3d. per ton of flour to cover workLabourite ing expenses, and overhead charges.",35
107,Mr BAMFORD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,In those circumstances he would sell more water and less flour.,35
108,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,In plain chemical language that is what it amounts to. - Mr COHSER - Moistur e in bread beyond a certain amount is now prohibited.,35
109,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I would be very pleased if I could get the figures from the honourable member. It has been proved incontestablv that most of the English-speaking people eat their bread in too moist a condition. Those who have had experience on the Continent, where - the people are very careful in the preparation of bread, know that it is far,better cooked than is the average loaf in Australia. ' I have read medical opinion to the - effect that the bread we eat in Australia will stand more cooking. It explains why more t in loaves are turned out by the bakers than the ordinary cotthe tage loaf, or the long loaf, which is so much to be seen on the Continent.

Mr Sydney Kidman, ""the cattle king,""' is one: offchait;big ilk known-, as. the squatocracy, who does not want its bow, for, though as if to rebuke and stultify it for its sycophancy, he swore uponi hisoath' before the Inter-State: Commission; that he reckons cattlebreeders were getting more for stock than they were worth, thus justifying the recommenda1 tion the Commission makes to. reduce the price of meat to the standard at which it has been sold' to the Imperial Government. We know that Mr Ryan, supported by the Government and. people of Queensland', has compelled the selling of meat to the consumers of that State at a less price than that charged to the Imperial G'overnment, namely, 3d. per lb. wholesale on beef. The statistics' as to cattle and sheep coming from and going to Queensland prove that the complaints regarding, the. effects of the embargoplaced by the QueenslandGovernment upon stock movements had no foundation: in fact. To-day the Commonwealth, Government have an opportunity that few Governments have enjoyed. Why do they not grasp the, nettle firmly? If they will embark upon a policy of price fixing, they will receive, the support and approval of the vast majority of the people. The first report of the Inter-State Commission was made on the 3rd October, and was shelved. Early in this year the Prime Minister asked the Interstate Gommission to make further investigation, and in the: meantime he stayed all proceedings, in regard to the regulation of the price of meat. 'The report was: still hidden from the gaze of Parliament, and only quite recently was the press allowed access to information which members of Parliament, could not get.",35
112,Mr GLYNN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The report was not deliberately set aside. It was under consideration, and that is the reason of the delay in making it public.",36
113,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Carefu l consideration of the report may have been wise, but during, all the delay the people were suffering.. The consumption of meat per head of population is getting less and less, and if the food of the people is unduly limited the life of the future units of the coaamranity is, imperilled.. Investigations have shown a difference of 5 inches, her tweenthe height of boys, of fifteen years of age reared in the poorer suburbs of Col1 lingwood and.

115,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I quite agree-, with the honourable member. Contrast the little we are doing with what has been done in America. J. D. Rockefeller is reputed to have a fortune of' £200,000',000'. Those figures may be understood by my saying that if he were shifting his fortune in gold he would' require 1,400 lorries-, each carrying one ton. Rockefeller's acknowledged' income was £12,000,000 per year, of which the United States Government took intaxation £7,600,000-, or 63J per cent. Andrew Carnegie-'a income was- £2,0OO',OOO-, and he paid in tax1 ation £1,30O',00O, or 65 per cent. Henry Ford' acknowledged an income of 1 £1,000,00©, and was taxed to the amount of £600,000, or 60 per cent. J. Pierpont Morgan, with an incomeof £700,000, paid in taxation £450,000, or over 64 per cent. Honourable members who have studied the system of compiling income tax returns in America will agree with me that there are ways, not unknown in Australia, of falsifying the returns so that they do not represent the actual total income. I have previously stated in this House that the Vacuum Oil Company had before the war a reserve f u n d of £600,000, which in 1915 had increased to £S0O,000, and in 1917 to £1,600,000. My policy, all the time, is to appropriate for the Treasury all profits - in excess of the average profits earned in pre-war years. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company advertises that its reserve fun d is £1,900,000, and that it has paid in dividends and bonuses £13,000,000. If the reserves had been distributed in dividends, £15,000,000 would have been received by the shareholders. I do not object to that. But I have seen men who have been "" leaded "" through working in the company's mines. Their lungs had been unable to reject the whole of the dust that had entered them, and I know that some of them have had to claim invalid pensions from the Commonwealth. Rarely do they reach the age at which they can claim an old-age pension. I do not blame the company for these things. They represent our present method of doing business. But I blame any Government, whether Labour, Socialistic, Conservative, or National, which allows such things to continue. Any honourable member who has seen the wrecks of humanity that are caused, particularly by dry mining, will agree that the statements I am making are not too severe. I believe that if the Government would make an appeal to the very wealthy people to lend their money free of interest during the war, a large number of rich men would respond. When we are trying to get the shillings and pence from the workers in the street, when no man can go down the city without being asked to spend something on patriotic buttons or other means of raising funds for war purposes, it cannot be derogatory for the Government to make a request to those possessed of, say, property over £10,000, to help the country in its hour of need, by lending money free of interest. I believe that if the request were made, it would meet with respect and bear f r u it .",36

117,Dr MALONEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I propose now to make the following quotation from a letter by Mr Will i a m Wilson, secretary of the Australian Protectionists Association, in regard to the fiscal issueWhy will not the National party fulfil its pledges ? Is it because the Government is afraid of losing revenue from Customs duties on tliese luxuries, whose importation the Luxuries Board has recommended should be prohibited, and that the Government is afraid of introducing taxation to make up for this loss of revenue, or is it because the importers-the old free-trade Conservative party-hav e control of their National party, and dictate what shall or what shall not he done, quite irrespective of party pledges, the welfare, and the solvency of the Commonwealth ? No one appreciates more than I do the difficulties in the way of dealing with the Tariff during the present world war, but I think those difficulties could very well be avoided if the Government would adapt to our circumstances the Japanese Tariff, which is, perhaps, the most up-to-date in the world, and bring in a Bill applying it to Australia. Honourable members might well be asked to pass such a Bill after a week's discussion of it . The difficulties which honourable members have at the back of their minds in regard to tackling the Tariff at the present time would in this way be removed. No nation could object to another country paying it the compliment of copying any of its laws, and I am sure that we should not offend the susceptibilities of Japan if , with the necessary adaptation, we applied, its Tariff to Australia. I am anxious concerning the Tariff question, because, having regard to the difficulties we experience in finding employment for our returned soldiers at the present moment, when they are coming back in their hundreds, I dread to think of what will occur when they return in their thousands.",37
118,Mr GROOM,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 2 . 3 5 ] - I desire to reply to complaints that have been made with regard to the woolshed class for returned soldiers, formed in connection with the vocational training system adopted by the Repatriation Department. I have received the following report from the Department:Work for the season was promised by a number of graziers if the men were trained. A class was accordingly formed, and men invited 1 to join. Every one who did so applied to be admitted. In any instance the men, being trained, are assured of a definite engagement in the country for the forthcoming' season, approximately eight months. Shed-owners have further given an undertaking that, if the men are suitable, they will be given an opportunity for permanent employment. The class was started with twenty men, and was later increased to fifty. The class hours were fixed at from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with one hour for lunch and two ""smoke-ohs"" of fifteen minutes each. In the second week' of the course, the men knocked off, objecting to the hours, which they desired Bhould 'be confined to !) a.m. to 4 p.m. Two of their number ultimately interviewed the oflicer in charge of vocational training, and submitted three complaints1. Short payment of sustenance in certain courses. 2. The nature of the wool handled. N 3. The hours df training. The first was immediately adjusted, and steps taken to prevent its recurrence. Regarding the second, the oflicer in charge reports:-""The second point in dispute was that of the nature of the wool which they were called upon to handle, and I immediately called over to mo the instructor, Mr Carrodus, and Mr Coombe, a representative of the Estates Company, and an expert classer, in order that I might be informed as to whether the men were being treated unfairly in the matter of nature of wool that they were handling. It transpired that the men were handling wool known as "" carding pieces,"" and that this very wool had been selected as being best calculated to give the men speed in their work and to provide the very training which they were most likely to require in the wool-sheds. It was intended that they should pass next on to merino pieces, and graduate on to the finer wools. This was explained to the men, and in less than two minutes the matter of the class of wool was disposed of."" As to the matter of hours, the officer in charge pointed out to the men that these had been fixed in the interests of the men them- selves, having regard to the brief period for training. After further discussion, the men intimated their willingness to resume, and all, with the exception of one man, did so on the following morning. The places of the man who declined to resume, and of two who dropped out through physical disabilitv, were immediately filled. The instructor states that the men settled earnestly to their work after he had explained to thera the reason for sorting the wool complained of. They have become quite interested in their work. Some men, with leg wounds, found the strain of standing caused swelling. Instructions were immediately given that these men should he given frequent opportunities for sitting down and resting. Another difficulty was that some of the stronger men were detailed to carry the wool from the sorting table to the presses, and they objected to having their time occupied in this way instead of at sorting and picking. Men Mr Groom-. have since been specially provided to remove the wool as it is treated at the sorting table. It is not correct that the wool was provided by the Estates and Mortgage Company. It was specially released by the Wool Committee to permit of the instructional class beingformed. It may be added, however, that thj: company referred to very kindly made available its large show-room floor for the use of the class. This was most helpful, as, owing to the heavy demands upon storage space consequent upon freight difficulties, it was extremely difficult to procure suitable accommodation. A comparison with rental quotations shows that the accommodation made available by the company represents a contribution to the training of returned men of approximately £300. v It will thus be seen that the company has been treating the Department very generously. It reaps no advantage out of the transaction, but is really assisting the Government in training returned soldiers for useful occupations.",37
119,Mr FALKINER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is also supplying power and light.,38
120,Mr GROOM,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Yes ; it has treated us very generously.,38
121,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is the one oasis in the desert.,38
122,Mr GROOM,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I tliink the honourable member will admit that one of the brightest features of the war is that it has brought to the front amongst all classes a degree of personal sympathy and humanitarian interest that many did not believe to exist. The Department also reports that 1. The curriculum includes rough wool sorting, piece picking, and wool rolling. 2. It is true that the men have been engaged s on picking burrs out of the wool",38
123,Mr FALKINER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,They do not do that.,38
124,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"They have not to pick burrs out of the wool. - Mr GROOM - I do not wish to be misunderstood. What the men are doing is necessary work, but they are not in the class for the sole purpose of picking burrs out of the wool. The report continues2. It is true that the men have been engaged on picking burrs out of the wool. This duty is necessary, and, on the recommendation of Mr Fox, Chairman, State 'Wool Committee, through which all wool is made available for the class, the men were put on this class of work, as it was calculated that, by so doing, their training would be greatly expedited. It really constitutes the ABC. of the training. 3. The men do not receive any wages, as they are totally inexperienced. However, they receive a sustenance allowance compatible with the regulations. i . The company do not derive any advantage in consequence of the fact that wages are not paid. On the contrary, this Department is paid a certain rate for the improved wool which leaves the class. The men are being trained, and they receive a« sustenance allowance in accordance with the terms of the regulations. I wish to emphasize the point that the company does not derive any advantage at all from this arrangement, and deserves rather our commendation than our criticism. report shows that the officers of the Department are carrying' out their work in a sympathetic way, and that the whole of the arrangements are in the interests of the men themselves. The Department in short is doing what Parliament desires should be done in the way of providing these men with such training as will enable them to re-establish themselves in civil employment.",38
125,Mr CORSER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Wide Bay) [2.40] The reply which I received this morning from the Honorary Minister in charge  statement from Admiral Clarkson, shows that it is absolutely necessary in the in terests of the community that the whole question of shipping should be threshed out in this Committee, and that the Government should be asked to give it serious consideration. W it h in the near future, that question will be a burning one throughout the Commonwealth.",39
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is now.,39
127,Mr CORSER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It will become still more acute. Honourable members are, no doubt, aware that the Ministry for Shipto ping in London has control of all vessels, and determines the number that shall visit Commonwealth ports. Shipping, the result of the war, is very scarce, an endeavour is being made so to regulate the trade with Australia as to provide for the most necessary items being first dealt with. Of that no one can complain. I fear, however, that the British Minisally try for .Shipping is not cognisant of the requirements of Australia. It does recognise, apparently, that we, have thousands of miles of seaboard with shows numerous ports at far distant points along it . During the present shortage of object to is tonnage, goods for different parts of the Commonwealth are being sent largely by vessels visiting only' two ports-for the most part the ports of Sydney and Melsailed, bourne. This inflicts much inconvenience on business men in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Goods coming for those States have to be discharged at one of the larger ports I have named, and are sent from there to their destination. Before the war, and until shipping was taken over by the British Miuister for Shipping, the rule was always to supply through bills of ladling to the final port of discharge, so that a consignment remained in the control of the . shipping company by whose vessel it was shipped from the Old Country until it The reached its final port of destination. In that way our goods were safeguarded until they reached tlieir final port. This London Board, however, has now given instructions that no bills of lading shall be issued to any merchant except to the first port of discharge-the destination of the vessel- . and the goods are no longer handed over by the agent of that vessel to one of the coastal companies (to bje forwarded to their destination without any additional expense to the merchants at other ports. Under this decision of the London Board, it is absolutely impossible for merchants in other ports than the port visited by the oversea steamer to handle with any degree of safety goods from Home.",39
128,Mr FALKINER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Does not the honourable member tliink that we are fortunate in being able to get any goods at all from the Old Country?,39
129,Mr CORSER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I suppose that in these times we ought to be thankful that we are alive. When we have ships we should try make the best arrangements possible . under the circumstances'. I should here like to read an extract from a letter reas ceived on the 12th of this month by a and merchant in Melbourne from a manufacturer in Glasgow, as follows: We are also glad to inform you that the s.s. Dungarra is ahout to load for Australia, and we have arranged freight; but until she actusails we cannot rely on her departure, as the Government frequently commannot deers steamers at the. last moment. many We have no objection to that, bu t it one of the difficulties with which we have to contend. What we do strongly Kindly note, as the ship brokers will not give up bills of lading until after the vessel has the documents .may not reach you through the bank before she arrives. It will be well, therefore, to keep a look outforher, and arrange in. some way for the warehousing of the goods until documents reach you. That is all right so far as the joonsigiiee at the port of arrival is concerned, for he is on the spot, and is a'ble to ascertain whether any goods are on board for him. The circumstances are very different, however, in the case of a merchant in Townsville, Rockhampton, Maryborough, or any other distant port. When goods are shipped, whether from Glasgow, London, or Liverpool,, the manufacturer there obtains his money on bills of lading with other documents handed to - a bank, and these, together with the invoices and insurance documents, are forwarded to the port of destination. Then, and not until then, the shipping agent at the port of arrival knows to whom the goods belong,..they being consigned to order as a protection to the bank. If the goods are landed in Melbourne and Sydney fourteen days before the merchant in Rockhampton, Townsville, Tasmania, or South Australia receives any notice, how can the goods be protected? There is now a regulation under which it is possible to refuse to entertain any claim - for pillage or destruction of goods .unless that claim is lodged with the agents for the British Shipping Board within seven days, and, of course, in such cases as I have instanced, this removes any chance of complying with the regulation. Unfortunately, there is considerable pillaging; and only last week, in a case in which I was concerned, a ship's agent .for .an oversea steamer repudiated any claim because notice from Maryborough had not reached him within seven days of the time of the discharge of the goods from the ship.; and this occurred even before the drastic regulalation came' into operation. Under the circumstauces it will be simply impossible to obtain a penny piece on account of any damage to, or pillaging of, goods in transit, and it will be necessary to appoint agents in Melbourne and Sydney to see that goods on their arrival are properly stored and insured, and sent on to their destination. All this, of course, means a considerable added cost, which will have to be passed on to the consumer. Why not use the machinery already in existence for handling such goods ? I trust .'that the Minister will represent to the British Shipping Board that, in view of the long distances between ports in Australia, bills of lading should, as in the past, he issued to the final port of discharge, and it ought to be imperative on Ur. Corser. the British agents at these ports to see that'the goods are safeguarded and forwarded with all despatch. Should this entail a little more expense, I am sure the Australian merchants would prefer to bear it rather than have their goods knocking about the port of discharge with nobody responsible for their safety. I have no desire to say anything against the management of the Shipping Board under Admiral Clarkson. He is an excellent man for the position. I , amongst others, have often wondered that he should be able to grasp the situation as he has, and to so sncoessful-ly administer his office. But the matter to which I am more immedia-telly referring is outside the range of Haas duties, except, perhaps, the latter part.  pears to me to be within his powers. Mr CORSER,-But the responsibility must rest on ithe shipping authorities at the port of shipment to give through bills of lading to Hobart, Rockhampton, Adelaide, or wherever it may be. It is for them to safeguard these goods; and if the agents here had sufficient clerical assistance when there_ were five or ten vessels - to one arriving at the present time, surely the old arrangement could be successfully continued. However, the present difficulty is not because there is not the assistance, or owing to any refusal to do this work; and I can only put it down to lack of knowledge of the local circumstances of .Australia on the part of the British Shipping Board. The whole of the facts ought to be laid before that Board with a view to some remedy being applied. In the letter read by the Minister today, we are told that this is a matteT outside the Commonwealth jurisdiction, and that the trouble is due to the scarcity of tonnage. I can quite believe that the matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, but it has nothing to do with the scarcity of tonnage. A small quantity of goods can be dealt with in identically the same way as a large quantity in the past. We are also told in that - letter that the Shipping Board is of opinion that this action is . unavoidable under-war conditions, and that is where I join issue with the controller of shipping, for it is quite possible to do as we did in the past. This is a matter of so much importance that the Minister, I amsure, will reeeive considerable correspondence from all pants of the Commonwealth unless some change is made. Honourable members who know something of the shipping industry may doubt whether it is correct that the manufacturer at Heme is refused the shipping documents until after the vesset has sailed, but uhe letter I have read proves that such is the case, and it only bears out inform rotation received from other sources. The new arrangements are recent, and there hais. scarcely been time for the shoe to pinch; but prevention is better than cure, and I thought it right to take the earliest opportunity to draw the attention of the Government to the facts,, so that merchants in the Commonwealth may he saved from such harrassing and unnecessary restrictions.. The curtailment of postal facilities in Queensland is causing and placing immense disabilities on the selectors in the agricultural and pastoral districts of that State.",39
130,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is the same all over Australia.,41
131,Mr COESEE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"But in Queensland, with its. 429,000,000 acres of land, and a scattered population, the disabilities are much more intensely realized; and of this I could give numerous instances. many districtsa tri-weekly service has been replaced by a weekly service.",41
132,Mr NICHOLLS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,That is being done in every country centre.,41
133,Mr CORSEE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That intensifies the complaint I am making; I am speaking for the whole of Australia, and merely using Queensland as an illustration. The other day a commission agent in Nanango wanted on a Friday to communicate with Murrarumbi, a station about 40 miles on the Maryborough side of Nanango, in reference to a transaction involving a sum of about £5.00. As a train leaves Nanango at ten minutes past 5 o'clock each morning, and stops at Murrarumbi,. he naturally concluded that his letter would be, delivered ahout 9 o clock on the same morning, in accordance with custom in the past. But because no mail is now made up. on the down train for Murrarumbi and numerous small stations, the letter was sent on to Maryborough, a distance of about. 140 miles, and brought back to Murrarumbi on the following Monday, too late to be of service, and, therefore, the deal was lost. All along the line are butter and cheese factories'. In my district there are ahout twenty of these factories. At certain times in the month there must be a large correspondence, including advices of cream and cheques, between them and their suppliers. This correspondence is much longer in transit than it should be. Why must country communities,, which, under any circumstances, are under disadvantages unknown to city dwellers, have their inconveniences increased by the Postal Department? If there must be cheese-sparing, let it be in. the city,, where, if necessary,, boys can be despatched with the delivery of messages and letters. Many of the farmers out back have sent sons> and often only sons, to the war. They are prevented from getting letters from them as often or as early as they might get them,, and they are also prevented from getting information through the local press as early as they might get it. This naturally increases their' anxiety beyond that, of persons resident in the cities, where information can be obtained from newspapers; not only daily, but every morning and evening,. The Postmaster General, is,. I believe, a competent man, and is doing his best, according to his In judgment. But I fear that too much pressure is exercised by city populations to prevent inconvenience being suffered by them,, with the result that out-back populations;, which cannot so easily place their difficulties before the Minister, or the Deputy Postmaster-General, of the State; do not get fair treatment. Country correspondence is mostly very important, containing, as it does very largely, advices concerning the despatch of cattle, produ:ce>. and orders for goods. It frequently happens that goods are now delivered ahead of the letters advising their despatch. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of pilfering on. the railways,, and men who have: not received invoices cannot always; tell whether the goods of which they take delivery are of the quantity or ? in the condition in which they were sent. I hope the Postmaster-General' will give attention to this complaint, and at least not accentuate: the troubles of the man on the land, but remedy this very unreasonable regulation. Every agricultural district in the Commonwealth probably suffers in the manner that I have indicated.",41
134,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Hunter) [3.8] Soon after we commenced the present series of sittings/1 spoke of the need for action on the part of this Government and the Governments of the States to promote harmony in the community to facilitate the prosecution of the war, and a little later a Conference was convened by the Governor General, at which many suggestions were made to that end. Since then, at the request of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), my leader, Mr. Tudor, has drawn up a list of regulations, the repeal of which would assist considerably to bring about better feeling. The Government has decided to repeal some of these regulations, but to retain others, many of which, I think, it will be wise in the public interest to repeal. Some of these regulations appear to have been hurriedly framed, because of strong feeling existing between different sections. Regulation 27a-'and regulation 86 might be dealt with in much the same way-appear s to owe its origin to the existence of sectarian feeling. I think it would have been better if it had not been framed, because the Government has ample power, under the War Precautions Act, to deal with disloyal utterances, and to protect the interests of the nation. It would be a good thing for all of us if we could turn a deaf ear to much of what is being said. What we want at this period of crisis is harmony. The whole community should be doing its best to assist the Empire and its Allies in the struggle in which we are engaged. Were these regulations repealed, it would conciliate many who, though in favour of the vigorous prosecution of the war, are incensed by the belief that the regulations were imposed to strike at 'them. I hope that even now the Government will go further into the matter, and see if these regulations cannot he repealed. This Government has certainly endeavoured to meet the position, and I should be pleased if I could say as much of the New* South Wales Government. At the Conference, its representatives promised to make arrangements for the re-registration of de-registered unions. That was to be done as early as possible. Therefore the State Parliament, which was in reces3, should have been convened at once to pass the necessary legislation. Mr Holman, however, had the matter referred to the Industrial Court, which was responsible for the de-registration. That Court had been originally moved to de-register the unions at the instigation of the Government, and, when applied to for permission to re-register, the Judge naturally felt that he could not stultify himself by reversing a decision which he had based on his interpretation of the law, and he declined to do what was asked. He pointed out that it was for the Government, not for a Court, to do what was desired. After having placed him in a very invidious position-becaus e I think he was perfectly right in the attitude that he took up-the New South Wales Government has now called the State Parliament together to consider the matter; but it proposes to discriminate between unions. Why not let bygones be bygones?",42
135,Mr BAMFORD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The unions have not done that.,42
136,Mr CHAELTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"They have done it. The inactivity of the New South Wales Government is keeping alive bad feeling. Of course, there will always be angry and embittered persons in every community; but it is our business to get the great majority of the workers interested in doing their best for the prosecution of> the war. That cajinot be accomplished while they think that they are not getting fair play. The New South Wales Government has not given effect to the promises that were made at the Conference. Consequently, we are not achieving the best results. I admit that there has been an improvement in the matter of recruiting since the Governor General's Conference, but it should be greater, and it can be made greater.",42
137,Mr FALKINER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Are the Australian Workers Union doing their share in Queensland ?,42
138,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I do not know what any section is doing. It is one of the factors which are doing so much harm to recruiting when one section of the community is always referring to the part another section is playing. No one has ever heard me during the course of the war refer to the part played by any section or organization. It is not right to do it. In this Parliament we should take a general view of the situation, and do our best to prevail on every one in the community to do what we think is the right thing according to our lights. Each man is entitled to his own opinion, and I have not seen any reason to change my opinion regarding the war. I have always been an opponent of militarism, and an opponent of war-, if it could be avoided. Even before I entered a Legislative Chamber I strove to do my utmost against militarism; but there was nothing for Great Britain to do but to enter this war. She was bound to do so, in order to protect the liberties of this world, and especially little Belgium, which was invaded by the Germans. That was' the view I took at the outbreak of the war. I supported the Government in possession of the Treasury bench at the time, which offered men to Great Britain , and 1I have seen no reason to deviate one iota fro m the position I then took up. We can do nothing but throw our whole weight into the war, with a view to bringing about an honourable and satisfactory peace. I do not think that we can bring about peace at the present time, when the enemy is knocking at the door, in the . belief that he is sure of obtaining victory within a reasonable time. The mail news to hand in regard to the Western offensive tells ns that the Germans broke through the 5th Army and created a salient .which, if they had been able to widen it sufficiently, would have brought about the defeat of the French Army on the one side and the British Army on the other, putting an end to the war in a very few months. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the situation is critical.",42
139,Mr BAMFORD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,This afternoon it is more critical than ever.,43
140,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It is getting more critical every day. We must face the situation. We must devote the whole of our attention to doing all we possibly can to extricate the Empire from the position in which it finds itself. Only when we can show Germany and her military caste that she cannot conquer the world, and only wben we can hold her and probably force her to give up some of the territory she has taken reoently, will there be opportunity of bringing about peace by negotiation. At present the Germans are absolutely opposed to anything but the furtherance of their desire to conquer and -.dominate the whole of the world, and in the face of this fact we should do all we can to see that there are no bickerings among ourselves. 'We started the war with enlistment on the voluntary system. The people have decided that it should be conducted on that system. Therefore, it is the duty of every one to assist in our voluntary effort to the best of his ability. No one knows what may happen within the next few weeks. We know that the Germans have succeeded in every effort they have made since the offensive started. It is useless to talk about strategy. We probably know little about the actual state of affairs. As a layman, it would appear to me that we are being driven back day after day, and that we are playing a losing game. That losing game should be stopped, and the only way in which that can be done, to my mind, is by getting as many men as we possibly can in a position which will enable them to stop anv further advance on the part of the Germans, and under the voluntary system the only way in which we can get men is by maintaining complete harmony in the community.",43
141,Mr FOWLER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Does not the honourable member think that the voluntary system has absolutely failed in Australia?,43
142,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I think we have done wonders under the voluntary system. We have enlisted 400,000 men out of our population, and I think that we can get a lot more men if we can only put the position plainly before them, and do away with any bickerings among different sections of the community. Australia has done really well in this war, but it should do still more. I was one of those who always held that we should not have sent away five divisions. Our population is not sufficient to enable us to reinforce that number of divisions. It would have been quite sufficient if we had sent away four. We could have reinforced them. It is a pity that the question of conscription should have been raised, because it has done much to set back voluntary recruiting. It was a pity that we were asked to supply 16,500 men a month, when it is now proved that not more than 5,300 are required. At the time the conscription cry was raised, the recruiting averaged about 6,000 men per month. As a matter of. fact, we were exceeding our quota. I have no desire to debate the matter; but from the day on which the cry for conscription rose dissension was created in the community, and great deal of harm resulted. I want to heal the consequent breach. I want people forget all those things of the past, and do all they possibly can to assist the cause of the Allies, so that we may bring about an honourable peace. The party which sent the men to the war at the beginning must stand loyally By those who went member away. Whenever I addressed men who were about to embark, I told them we were justified in entering the war, and doing all that we could in the .interests of the British Empire and the liberty the world. I am prepared to stand by trict. that view today. I hold that the Governments-bot h Federal and State-shoul d do all they possibly can to create a good those letters. feeling in the community, in order to prevent those who are a little bit extreme in their views, those who do not see eye eye with us, and those who are - the war, from getting; a handle to dissension and hamper our .efforts. onr duty to do all in onr power to prevent that. I make these observations so that views in regard to the war may be out on record. I realise that we are fighting our very existence. The Germans will present accept no peace. The peace want is one which can only be achieved at the mouth of the cannon. They are knocking at the gate every day, andare determined to get through if they pes-* sibly can. Any little help that I give in the direction of stopping them shall be only too pleased to give, and should be the attitude of every one. It would be better for all concerned leave the matter of annexations alone. We should not bother about what we are going to do in regard to post-war settleis ments, or territorial aggrandisement. We should leave those matters to those who are in control, and who are in best position to judge as to what is necescentres, sary in order to bring about an honourable peace. If we put forward certain quests, we are only likely to hamper them. We do not know what is going - on; in fact, we know very little apart what we can .see in the press; therefore let us leave the question of annexations and kindred matters in abeyance. Our mary duty is to make sure of winning war, and bringing about an honourable peace, in the interests of liberty and future generations. Mr Charlton. I agree with the honourable member a who has just resumed his seat that country districts are being deprived of facilities into the matteT of telephone and postal comto munications to which they are entitled.",43
143,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Canno t we get an alteration ?,44
144,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Every honourable is receiving communications upon this matter. I receive a letter now and then informing me that, if so-and-tro will in ""not conduct such-and-such an office at a certain fixed allowance, there will be no of postal service for the people in the dis",44
145,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,We are all getting,44
146,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Honourable memto bers representing country electorates get against them thrown at them week after cause week. The scale fixed by the De, It is partment is not sufficient for the work that has to be done, and in consequence the local residents cannot be got to do it. I will take the case of the my Tarro post-office. I do not suppose there is any better land for cultivation than is for to be seen in the neighbourhood of the at Tarro railway station, on the northern they railway line in New South Wales. There are dairy farms extending right through the country to Miller's Forest. A couple of weeks ago I received a communication informing me that if so-and-so was not precan pared to keep the post-office at a certain I figure fixed by the Department it would that be closed. Hundreds of people depend on that office, and if it is closed they will to have to do their postal business at Miller's Forest. Certainly the Postal Department should be put on a business footing-that to say, the service should be made to pay for itself. I see no reason why the Department should not be able to get sumthe cient revenue in the big metropolitan with a dense population, for the purpose of assisting country districts and redeveloping the country. Men go 10, 20, and 50 miles away from civilization in order to do developmental work, and we from cannot expect them to pay sufficient for the telephone and postal services provided for them to make them paying concerns, pribut we could raise sufficient money on the the whole for the purpose of making an allowance to enable the necessary serof vice to be given to these pioneers. The honourable member who has just spoken told us about persons, in country districts whose sons were fighting at the Front. The parents of our boys who are fighting are always asking when the next mail will be in from London, so that they can get the latest news of their sons, but in the case referred to by the honourable member delay occurs because of the route over which the mail is carried. That alteration has been brought about only recently. The claim is made that the postal revenue is increasing, or that it is much better than it was two years ago. Of course it is; it could not be otherwise. This increase has been brought about by reason of the fact that thousands of letters are posted every day for the boys at the Front, and thousands of parcels are mailed every week to the Forces overseas. Howmuch revenue does this bring into the Postal Department? As a matter of fact, the war has brought a large income to the Post Office. In these circumstances, why should country districts be deprived of postal facilities which until recently they have enjoyed ? It is our duty to give the fullest possible facilities to the people in country districts. In the case of sudden illness, if there is no telephone service there is no opportunity to communicate with a medical man 'who may reside 20 miles or 50 miles away, and very often if he can arrive within two or three hours there may be a possibility of a life being saved. The Department cannot be made self-supporting by depriving the country people of postal services which they have enjoyed for years past. I remember the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) speaking in the House when he was a supporter of the Labour Government. He said that, as far as he was concerned, he had made ample provision for his electorate, and that it was fully supplied with post-offices and telephone services from one end to the other. If his district is so well provided for, he should have some thought for other, constituencies.  fore he became Postmaster-General.",44
147,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I did not say that he was Minister at the time.  good representative of his district he must have been.,45
148,Mr CHARLTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"If the PostrnasterG-eneral, when a private member, recognised the necessity for providing facilities to such an extent in his own district, he ought to recognise also the necessity for creating similar facilities for the people throughout all country districts honourable member who has just resumed his seaj; has counselled the Government to repeal certain regulations made under the War Precautions Act. I counsel the Government in the opposite direction. It is not my desire to create dissension between sections of the community, but I remind honourable.members that the regulations to which objection has been taken were introduced at a time of considerable excitement, in Melbourne at any rate. In consequence of certain things which had happened, ill-feeling was being engendered, badges which were disloyal in their significance were being worn openly in the streets, and utterances which were hostile to Great Britain were being made in certain quarters. The regulations had the effect of preventing a continuance of those things. To-day it is not lawful for a person to wear any badge or fly any flag which is calculated to create disloyal sentiments in the community. If we are to win the war, one of the first essential's is that every true loyalist should feel that the Government are strong enough to maintain law and order against any set of disloyalists who may be in the community. That is all 1I have to say in regard to this matteT. In regard to postal facilities in country districts, of course, as a country member, I deplore the fact that facilities which have existed in many places for ""a considerable number of years are being discontinued. But it is futile to talk of carrying on the Post Office as a business proposition and at the same time claim ' that it shall not discontinue services which are not paying. A business proposition demands that a concern shall be made to pay, and. I hold that that policy in regard to the Postal Department is unsound.",45
149,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"We have no more, right to judge the Post Oflice by its balance-sheet than we have to judge the police or the Department' of Justice in the same way.  to that point. The primary purpose of the Postal Department is to satisfy public requirements, and to induce people to leave the city centres and establish themselves in ithe country areas.",45
150,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Can the honourable member guarantee an exodus from the city to the country if we add to the deficit hy establishing telephones everywhere?  facilities we give to the people in the country the more pleasant will life become to them, and the more, will they be satisfied. I turn now to another matter which has exercised my mind for a considerable time. In my opinion, it is a crime against our nation that we should permit persons of enemy nationality to occupy important positions in the Defence Department. ""When the war broke out the proper attitude for the Government to have adopted towards every German employed in this country was - "" Your nation, has made Avar upon us; it has forced us into this conflict. While that condition exists it is not fit and proper that you, who are of enemy nationality, should be drawing money from the public Treasury."" Whatever may be said in that way of the Public Service generally applies with greater force to the Defence Department. For a period of nearly twelve months I have lieen in correspondence with that Department and the Prime Minister's Department in regard to this matter, and certainly some changes have been made. Some persons with, names which were particularly objectionable have been removed, but enough has not yet been done. In May last I called for a return of Germans employed by the Defence Department. That return was tabled about three weeks ago, and showed that there are still thirty-one Germans in that Department, three of whom were born in Germany, whilst the others are Australian-born Germans of the firstgeneration. I hold the opinion that persons of British birth of the first generation, who hear from their parents of the glories of Old England, or Scotland, or Ireland are, as a rule, more loyal to those countries than were their parents, and I believe that the same sentiment operates in the case df children of German parentage. When they hear their German fathers and mothers speak of the traditions of Germany they must grow up with feelings of loyalty to the Fatherland of their parents, and 1 would deplore the fact if they did not. We have to remember what the Germans have proved themselves to be. I do uot think that if we searched the German army through and through we should find a Britisher in it ; certainly we could not find one occupying a position of command. Germany boasts that she has spies in every land. President Wilson, of the United States of America, very recently made a declaration on this point, and pointed out that German spies are to be found in every branch of industry and also i u the Civil Service. Testimony comes from all quarters that of all nations Germany has the most perfect system of espionage. A man who is given a position in the Defeuce Department, if he happens to be more loyal to Germany than to Australia, has facilities for rendering service to Germany. I do not accuse the 25,000 Germans in Australia of beiug disloyal to the British Empire. Probably many of them are truly loyal to Great Britain, but in a military Department we should take no risks. Officers in that Department can obtain knowledge which would serve German interests, and I have been surprised in the correspondence I have had with the Defence Department to find that, in respect of every German mentioned, the authorities have replied that they have investigated the case of that man, and proved him to be loyal. No spy can be of any service to the nation that employs him unless he is a man able to hide his identity and purpose.' Secrecy is the essence of success in his occupation. Only in today's paper we read of the case in Great Britain of Sir Joseph Jonas, a Rhineland Prussian and an ex-Lord Mayor of Sheffield, whom our Sovereign had knighted. For many years he has been living before the people of England as a loyal Britisher-loyal , of course, until he was found out. That is the danger. Every German in our Service today is a loyal man until he is found out. This ex-Lord Mayor of Sheffield has been found out, and is to be tried. His bail has been fixed at £.3,000. Of course many of the Germans who have come to reside here are naturalized Australian citizens, but the - Australian law of naturalization is an absolute farce, because it gives them Australian citizen rights without taking away their German citizen rights. The United States of America naturalization law is much sounder, for it requires that, before son can become a naturalized citizen that country, he must disown his other Department. nationality. No man can serve masters. But in Australia we naturalize foreigners knowing that they have their tongues in their cheeks, inasmuch as they are not forswearing their own nationality although grafting themselves on to ours. Some time ago the then Minister for the Navy (Mr Jensen) in explanation of a return of naturaliScience and Industry. zation certificatesSome of the persons enumerated in column B (naturalized as British subjects) are enemy subjects, since both Germany and Austria-Hungary permit their subjects, certain circumstances, to retain nationality, although naturalized - abroad; but informatiou as to the number of naturalized subjects who remain enemy subjects is known only to the enemy Governments. It is a very unsound policy for us naturalize men when we know that some of them have deliberately retained their foreign nationality. Because they naturalized in Australia, they are received with open arms into our businesses and Public Service, and they enjoy all the advantages of citizenship, knowing all the time that if Germany were to win the war they would be just as well off under Gerthe man rule as they are under ours. position is untenable, and I am astonished to its successful use. at the difficulty in getting the Defence Department, at least, to recognise that we have no right to keep in our employ any person who may be suspect. An I say that every man who, though naturalized, may be a German citizen lest ought to be suspect by a wise ancl reasonto able people.",46
151,Dr MALONEV,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That is Christian faith .  Britisher that I believe that if we win this war it will be by the arms, strength, and sentiment of the British race, and not thing. by the assistance of those who may be false to us, although naturalized citizens of our country. I have already referred to a return which showed that thirty-one Germans are still in the employ of the Defence Department. I have not official return; I am told it is in the we meet. hands of the printer. But included in it is a man named G. A . Ampt. Ampt, for all I know, may be as loyal as vious occasion. any Britisher. I am not going to impugn his loyalty as an individual, but I do that his name appears in a list of Chose a perwho may be of German nationality, and of are occupying positions in the Defence Whatever danger there two may be in the employment of Germans in the Defence Department, there are some positions in respect of which the danger is greatly increased. According to this return, Mr Ampt is "" Acting Chemical Adviser to the Defence Department at £354 per annum, plus £96. At present said, employed with the Advisory Council of Both parents born in Germany."" Not long after the United States of also America joined us in this war there was a great outcry in that country regarding in the quality of the ammunition that was their beiug supplied. Upon investigation, it was discovered that an enemy had done this thing. It was found that the ammunition was not what it ought to be, to because some evilly-disposed individuals had destroyed its effective power. When I had the honour of visiting the Old are Country as a delegate from the Commonwealth Parliament, it was pointed out to me at one of the munition works that one of the most critical operations in thepreparation of munitions was the accurate dispensing of the chemicals which go to make up the explosives. I was told that slightest variation in oue of the in The gredients of an explosive would be fatal In these circumstances, I view with no little alarm the possibility of one of enemy birth being employed where his love for Germany d might prove greater than his desire to serve the Commonwealth or the Empire, by any chance he should use his position the disadvantage of the Empire.

152,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It is a ridiculous  rageous that a man of German descent should be employed in such a capacity. If I cannot induce the Government to take action in regard to this matter, I the shall give them a warm time when next",47
153,Mr FINLAVSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The honourable memMr ber promised to do something on a pre sav my action in carrying out that promise, certain regulations were framed. I , with others, became interested in regard to the employment of this man Ampt, and sought to ascertain what work he was doing in the Department. As the result of inquiry, the Secretary to the Defence Department, under date^ 19th February"" last, wrote to the secretary of the AntiGerman League as follows: Dear Sir -'In reply to your letter of 15th inst., I am directed to inform you that Mr Ampt is not employed in any position in connection with this Department. We were satisfied that this man was not employed in the Defence Department, and allowed the matter to drop. the later return, to which I have referred, and which came to hand only three weeks ago, shows that Mr Ampt is employed in an advisory capacity by the Defence Department, although he has beeu loaned for some little time to another Department. It would appear that the position taken up by the Department is that this man occupies merely a consultative position. He is not actually engaged in departmental work; but he is certainly employed in a capacity that is a menace to us. When inquiry was made last February, the Department should have come out boldly with, a statement as to what this man was doing, rather than lead us as it did to suppose that he was no longer in the Service. He is still in the pay of the Department. I maintain that such a position is untenable, and that it is unwise in the extreme that it should be allowed to continue. In the interests of our Empire, and of the very life's blood of the 300,000 men and more whom we have sent to the Front, every German ought to he weeded out of the Defence Forces.. One possible enemy in our ranks is worth more to Germany than 1,000 men in her own ranks. In this list there also appears the name of another German named "" Kold,"" but who has been allowed to assume the name of "" O. Manners."" I refer to this man for the reason that there, have gone to the Front, as members of the Australian Imperial Forces, men who, because of their German names, were in the first instance unacceptable. They were allowed, however, to change their names in order that they might proceed to the Front. Knowing the character and disposition of the German people-knowing , as we do> their determination to win this war at any price, and without scruple as to honour and dignity-w e ought not to allow any Germans to go to the Front as members of our Forces. The menace is. a. double one when we allow such men to enlist under an assumed name, and so to hide their nationality. I do not know what this practice has led to on the field of battle. I have heard rumours, which I shall not repeat, because to do so might be not only dangerous, but unfair. A the consideration of the possibilities, however, ought to prevent us-from allowing anything of the kind to occur.",47

In a letter I hold from the Department, I am told that there are at present on active service several officers who are of enemy descent, and who, in some instances, have changed their names in order that they might go to the Front. Surely it is unwise to allow this sort of thing to be done. It is done, however, and done with the sanction of ithe Minister for Defence. There is a regulation which provides that no man shall change his name without the consent of the Minister. That being so, every man who has been able to hide his nationality under an assumed name has done so with the direct permission of the Minister. As the war proceeded, certain regulations that were deemed necessary at the outset to avoid the possibility of danger from these sources were set aside. Let me""quote the following Defence circular, which is known as Circular 86 :-r ENLISTMENT OF MEN OF ENEMY ORIGIN. . With reference to Defence Circulars No. 143 of 10th-February, 1916, and No. 407 of 14th July, 1016, relative to the enlistment of men of enemy origin, it has now'been decided that with regard to men of enemy origin born within the Empire, instead of having to obtain, before enlistment, a certificate of loyalty, all applicants will be accepted for service in the Australian Imperial Forces on the approval of the majority of the executive of any local Recruiting Committee That practically means that an essential safeguard, which' at the outset of the war was imposed, has been discontinued. Every German resident is loyal to thei British Empire until he is found out, and under this regulation a German, who - seeniingiy is loyal, but who carries in his blood the natural disposition of his race, is permitted to go to the Front with our Forces without being required, as he had to do originally, to sign - a certificate of loyalty. He - may now go to the Front provided that be is approved by a Local Committee. In country districts these local conwidttees are generally of small .concern.

Individually there are in Australia many Germans who are just as good as the rest of us, but the presence of such men, collectively, in the Defence Department is dangerous, and ought to be discontinued. I propose now to refer briefly .to the fixing of the price of meat. If the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) and the honourable member for Calare  ject yesterday, I should have had a good deal to say with regard to it ; but they have put the case so clearly that I shall not occupy the time of the Committee at any length in discussing it. Suffice it to say that the question bristles with technicalities. It is difficult to arrive at any conclusion that would be satisfactory to all classes; but two_salient points in - connection with the problem are deserving of special attention. In the first place, I would remind honourable members of the 1 importance of .the primary ""producers to the welfare of the - community. The fact is that owing to certain conditions which .have been evolved the producers of meat have been compelled to pay very large prices for their stores, and a regulation which is going to have the effect of largely reducing the selling value of fat cattle will very prejudicially affect them, and in many cases occasion them very serious loss. It is suggested that consumers are paying a high price for meat; but when we look into the question we discover that, whatever the price of the beast may be, the cost to the consumer is about 100 per ceut. more than what the producer receives. This means that between the time the beast leaves the hands of the actual producer and when it gets into the homes of the people for consumption, the beast has by some process or other practically doubled in value; and inquiry should have been made as to the possibility of reducing the intermediate cost. If some reduction could be made in intermediate charges, the people would get cheaper meat, and those engaged in the production of both cattle and sheep would not suffer materially. An announcement has been made by the Government that under certain conditions they propose to fix a cash price over the counter, approximate to the export value.",49
158,Mr HIGGS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Is that the decision of the . Government?  nounced ; but we know pretty well that it is to be something of that nature. This announcement, made in and commented on by the press, has already had the effect of seriously interfering ' with the interests of the producer. The very fact that it is in contemplation to make an alteration prevents men from going into the market to replenish their stock; and this must diminish values. Apparently, the Inter-State Commission has not considered how the price to the public might be reduced by a judicious control of intermediate traders, because, had it done so, I am satisfied we should not have had the almost farcical, if not laughable, report placed before us. The idea of gentlemen such as those who constitute the Inter-State Commission-me n without any technical knowledge of cattle or sheep, who trust entirely to evidence submitted from day to day-presumin g to.suggest to the people of Australia that the price of meat can be reduced by fixing the price of meat,on the hoof! The-idea is absurd! The prices on the hoof might be fixed, but unless special attention is paid to the intermediate traders, the price of meat to the consumer will not be reduced. Mr ATKINSON.'-And the very man we wish to encourage will be hit.  people are to have cheap meat, as a continuous thing, it must be by encouraging increased production, which would bring the law of supply and demand into opera-, tion, and within twelve months abolish present conditions without entailing material loss on any one. The only persons able to judge the value of meat on the hoof are those connected with the' trade, but this all-wise - Commission suggests that all that is necessary is for au official to declare the'weight on which the purchases are to be made.   what it amounts to. The Commission say that this declaration must be made by an impartial expert, forgetting, apparently, that the only experts are those who have had a life-long experience in the cattle trade. These men pass their eye over a beast, and form a more or less accurate estimation as to what its dead weight will be; and I venture to say there are not half-a-dozen disinterested men in Australia competent to assess the value of a beast.  cannot do it.  mistakes. The Government cannot be blamed for refusing to accept a stupid recommendation like that of the Commission.",49
159,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Stupi d ? ,50
160,Mr ATKINSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Quite impracticable, at any rate.  At a time when we require nothing 'but what is practicable, no impracticable suggestions should be entertained; and the Government are much to be commended for refusing to attempt the impossible. A man in Sydney or Melbourne might be found to make this calculation; but we have to remember the thousands of markets all over Australia, and also the fact that it would be necessary to bring an expert 50 or 100 miles in some cases to value stock on the hoof. The Government are taking a very much wiser course. They suggest that the retail price is to be fixed at something or other, for cash, though what the scheme is as a whole has not yet been determined. Had the Government attempted to act on the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission, they would have been landed in a difficulty. A shortage would certainly have been created, and the price of meat, instead of being reduced, would have been further enhanced by the increased demand, while that spirit which is necessary to create increased production would have been killed. It is unnecessary for me to go into the technicalities of the inatter, in view of the splendid speech of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) yesterday; but I must say that, in my judgment, whatever delay has taken place, the Government are perfectly justified in obtaining sound data, as against the unsound data in the Commission's report. I now wish to say a word or two in regard to the returned soldiers, whom we cannot honour too much. Unfortunately, a number of the friends of these men think that they can best show their regard by treating them. In Great Britain there is a no-"" shouting "" law, and no man there may pay for the drink of another. I would not suggest any invidious distinction between the soldier and the civilian; and I think that the bulk of the people of Australia would be prepared to impose upon themselves a self-denying ordinance, in order to save us from the distressing spectacle of wounded and maimed men going about our streets intoxicated. Any man who gives drink to our returned soldiers degrades the uniform of the King; and I strongly suggest that, by regulation under the War Precautions Act, ""shouting"" should he prohibited throughout the Commonwealth. The great majority of the returned men are good, sound, and honestonly the comparatively few allow themselves to-be overcome by drink. I exalt the soldier to the highest pedestal, and would remove any evil which might act as a stumbling-block on his path in life. And for the good of these men, for the welfare of Australia, and for the reputation we desire to maintain, some agreement should he come to between the Commonwealth and State Governments to make "" shouting "" illegal.",50
161,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Why do you not help us to remove other evils?  and I shall help you to remove them.,51
162,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The high price of food is one.  way in which I would reduce the price of meat-by encouraging its production. Mr MATHEWs - r^Not much chance of a reduction from the crowd who sent you here!,51
163,Mr WEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"East Sydney) [4.12] During the absence of the Postmaster General (Mr Webster) from the chamber, representatives of country districts have been making severe remarks about his administration, and declaring'that the metropolitan areas are favoured as against the country districts. I do not think, that that charge is true, for there are many postal grievances that require setting right in the cities. For instance, in Sydney there was at one time a machine in operation for transmitting telegraph messages from the central office to a suburban office; but, on the advice of some one, two boys, with bicycles, were substituted to do this work. The route which the boys have to traverse is one of the steepest and most dangerous in all Australia, and though as yet no accident has happened, I am daily expecting to hear of one. Apart from that, however, if, while these boys are away, any urgent telegrams arrive, delivery is delayed for a considerable time. I never remember a Postmaster-General having so many shots fired at him as there have been fired at the honourable [222] gentleman today, and I never knew a Postmaster-General take so little notice of shots. Honourable members opposite have the matter in their own hands, for the Postmaster-General is virtually a servant of the party, and might be replaced at any time by the Caucus if he gave any ground for dissatisfaction, just as any ordinary employee might be replaced. The attitude of his supporters towards him reminds me of some Chinese in Sydney, where there is a very nice joss-house. They appealed to the Joss for rain, and when it did not come they installed a new Joss, which, as rain fell soon afterwards, they retained, chopping up the old one. If honourable members opposite cannot get what they want from ""their present postal Joss, why do they not try another ? My view is that the Postmaster-General is as generous to the country as to the cities. Country members are always firing shots at him in Parliament, and I have done my best, by personal representations, to get certain results, though I have not succeeded. Some day the officials of the Department will find out that they have been making mistakes, and that what I have suggested is right. To come to another matter: About two years ago it was decided to strike and issue medals to the mothers and other relatives of our soldiers, a proposal which met with the approbation of Parliament and of the public. Those medals have not yet been issued. A very good design was. chosen, and tenders were called for, but the Department, although several firms of repute, possessing the necessary machinery and material, tendered, gave a contract to a man who styled himself an engineer, but had neither dies, machinery, nor material for making the medals. The matter having been brought under my notice, I made inquiries, and asked questions on the subject here, and had other questions asked in the Senate. "" From the answers it appeared that this engineer was fined £200 early in the war for trading with the enemy, and had broken the Wages Board regulations of Victoria. The Department consequently has to exercise a certain amount of supervision to prevent a further breach of the law in connection with the manufacture of these medals. I . think that when tenders are called, the Government should get what it wants from those who specialize,in the kind of work (hat is to be done. For a supply of building stone the Government should go to the quarry masters, for jewellery they should go to a jewellery firm. They have not done that in this instance. When I asked why the medals had not been issued I learned that the necessary enamel is not obtainable. Now, at no time in our history has the encouragement of local industry been more important than at the present time. Enamel has been largely made in Germany, sent to England, and shipped thence to Australia; but a reputable firm in Sydney, which employs a specialist at high wages, makes an enamel which,' I am told-and my observation confirms the information-is in some of its colours even better than the imported article. Indeed, the firm contends that its enamels are second to none in the world, and will meet all requirements The successful tenderer for the making of the medals to which I have referred cannot get all the material that he needs for their manufacture, and will not be able to get it, because those who should have been given the contract are holding it, needing it for their own work. It is the military officers who guide the Minister for Defence in matters like this, and I am beginning to think it would be far better if the business transactions of the Department were intrusted to civilians. The Department says that it will see that the wages conditions are observed in the carrying out of this contract, but had the work been given to persons who are specialists there would have been no reason to fear a breach of the law. The Government should see that the conditions of its various contracts are carried out in the spirit and to the letter, and, when conditions are not being fulfilled, the tract should be broken. There have been plenty of opportunities for breaking this particular contract, but the Government seems to think the delay in the issue of the medals unimportant. At the next election, God help the Minister if the women of Australia get to know of this. Nothing annoys a woman more than to promise her something, and not to keep the promise. The Department wants waking up. I am a loyal Australian and a lover of the country, and for years past everything I have worn, from hats to boots, has been of Australian manufacture. The encouragement of Australian industries, both primary and secondary, is of the greatest importance, and a contract should not Sir. West. have been given to an American gentleman who had been found guilty of trading with the enemy, when the work could have been done by a firm which has spent hundreds of pounds in producing the enamel necessary to carry it out. A so called "" National "" Government should not do anything likely to lessen national feeling. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) may have no knowledge of this matter personally, but I hope it will be brought under his notice. I introduced a deputation on the subject to the Assistant Minister (Mr Wise), but nothing appeared in the newspapers about it. The jewellery industry is one which should employ a great many persons. It is light work, and would give employment to women as well as to men.",51
164,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Franklin) [4.30]. - I wish once more to enter my protest against the manner in which the Estimates are dealt with in this Parliament by successive Governments. Here we are discussing Estimates when half the members of the House have gone away to their homes, though it is the only chance that is presented for bringing really vital matters before the Government and the country. It is just about time this system was entirely remodelled and honourable members were given the fullest opportunity of dealing with important matters which they wish to bring under the notice of the Government, without having to wait until the expiring hours of the session to do so. My remarks do not apply to the present Government more than they do to the Governments which have preceded them. I think that Ministers on this occasion have allowed more time for the discussion of the Estimates than con- was given by preceding Governments. I remember that a Labour Government "" bullocked "" the whole of the Estimates through the Committee in one night.",52
165,Mr WEBSTER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Are we not discussing Estimates every time a Supply Bill is before us?,52
166,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"No . 'When a Supply Bill comes forward it is the opportunity for a free-and-easy discussion, and nothing comes out of it. I hope that honourable members will insist upon opportunity being given to discuss the Estimates before we are met with the taunt that it is useless to discuss the items upon them because the money provided, or, at any rate, most of it, has already been spent."" In attempting to fix the price of meat, the Government have undertaken the most dimcult problem that could face them in carrying out the policy of price fixing. Every other problem will be child's play to them compared with this. Take the difference between Queensland and Tasmania. In Queensland stock are fattened naturally in winter, but in Tasmania that cannot be done, except by means of artificial feeding. If a Tasmanian grazier wishes to fatten sheep for the market he must commenceoperations at least twelve months ahead. He must plough his ground and cultivate it , and sow rape or artificial grass for the purpose of feeding his sheep during the winter, and it is fully twelve months before the beast is ready to go on the market. Compare these conditions with those which prevail in Queensland, where the climate is such that stock can be fattened during the winter on natural grasses in the open without costing the grazier ls. One of the best experts dealing with stock in Tasmania, a man who has spent the whole of his life in dealing stock, has told me that it would cost about £7 per beast to move cattle from Queensland to Tasmania, when the freight and loss in weight are taken into account. I remember coming down the coast of Western Australia on a steamer which was conveying 178 head of cattle from Wyndham to Fremantle. No less than forty-seven of the cattle died during the voyage, and had to be thrown overboard. Such losses as these will make the task of the Government extremely difficult. It is an unquestionable fact that the price of meat is too high. I know that it is sold in Melbourne' at a price which is altogether out of proportion to the return secured by the producer. I agree with those honourable members who say that it will be utterly impossible to fix the price of meat on the hoof. But if it were possible to do so, how would it give relief to the consumer, in face of the enormous leakage that takes place between the time when the animal is sold under the hammer and the time when the meat is sold over the block? The only way in which the consumer 'could obtain any benefit would be by fixing retail prices over the counter, but I venture to say that if that were done the system would break down, because the prices would have to be altered so continuously, and because the enormous variations in the climatic [222]- a conditions of the different States render it almost impossible to arrive at anything like parity.",52
167,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Does not the honourable member believe in fixing the price of the live animal by weight!,53
168,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I do not think that it will be possible to do it .,53
169,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is done elsewhere.,53
170,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I know that it is done in Chicago, Idaho, and other places in the United States of America; but it is the Packing Trusts who have the producer and the consumer alike in the hollow of their hands wbo insist upon it, not in the interests of the consumer or the producer, but in their own interests. The system which the Postmaster General has adopted is absolutely rotten. He is no more entitled to make the disposal of the postal facilities in the back blocks of Australia the subject of his balance-sheet than a Treasurer would be in making the educational system, the police force establishment, or the Judiciary subject to the national balancein sheet. But until we can get out of the official mind-and the Ministerial mindthe idea that this is the policy which Bhould be pursued, there will always be the complaints which honourable members are voicing today. Imagine effecting a saving by cutting down a mail service from three times a week to twice a week. Where people have a little post-office in a small district which they conduct for an allowance of £ 5 , £10, or £15 a year, imagine the Department coming along when these people remove out of the district, and saying to some - other persons who are willing to do the work, "" You must take it at the price we offer, or else we shall close the office."" The Postal Department is the greatest sweater in the Commonwealth in the matter of its treatment of some of the smaller post-offices.",53
171,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,In the country districts only.,53
172,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am speaking of country post-offices. The terms and conditions which are imposed on some of the people conducting allowance offices are a disgrace to this Parliament, to the Government, and to preceding Ministries.",53
173,Mr WEBSTER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"We pay more for thesev allowance offices, in proportion to the services rendered, than we do .for the official service.",53
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That is the official mind speaking again. Who can compute the advantages of a postal service by the number of people living in particular locality? Yet that is the system which is followed, and one which this Parliament should alter. I care not how many people are working at a little saw-mill in the bush, which receives mail two or three times a week. telephone is an absolute necessity to those people. Those who know anything about saw-milling in the forest know that, because of the liability to accident, it perhaps, the most dangerous occupation that any men could follow in Australia; and the absence of the facility to.

It is high time-ri more than high time-that the whole system of the postal service and entirely altered. I do not wish it to be altered in the way some would alter it by appointing a Postal Commission. God knows, the position is bad enough now, when Parliament can bring some inmove fluence to bear on the Postmaster-Genepartment ral.

I have already informed the Assistant Minister in charge of shipping that it was my intention to to reduce the Estimates of his Deby £ 1 , in order to thoroughly the question of ""the constitution of Board; but I find that by the time the the Estimates of the Department may As come before honourable members, there will probably be no opportunity for me to do so. Therefore, I have to take this opportunity, and as you, Mr Chairman, have informed me that I should not be in in moving at this stage a reduction of any item, I must endeavour to have the question decided when the Estimates for the Navy Department are before the Committee. It is almost unnecessary say what shipping means to Australia. is the lifeblood of the Commonwealth, it has been the lifeblood of Great Britain. From the very dawn of her Britain has depended upon her shipping. Australia, to a greater extent than any wanted £25,000. other country in the world, is similarly dependent. Situated 12,000 ""miles from the markets of the world, we must be able to ship our products or become bankrupt as a nation.

As one who desires to see the shipbuilding scheme a sucI advise the Minister' to ascertain extent to which the Isherwood type of since boat has been constructed in Great Britain, and whether it has been a suc at output is increasing by leaps and bounds ships would all over the world.",56
197,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Of course the of every class of ship is increasing at this time; but there are grave doubts of the 'success of the Isherwood type. We hear great talk of what America is doing in shipbuilding, but Great Britain to the end of April had built as much shipping as the rest of the world, including America. I repeat that the one country that has done nothing in ship construction is Australia. We must all take our share of the responsibility for that. It will stand io the discredit of this Parliament that when the people of England were short of food, although we had several of the best timbers in the world, and although hundreds of men were prepared to enter into the shipbuilding business, we have done nothing. I desire to refer briefly to what gard as a most serious blunder made by the Government in connection with the appointment of the Shipping Board. is Unquestionably Australia has been for many years, to some extent at least, at out a case. the mercy of the shipping companies. Now the Government, acting under the power conferred by the War Precautions Aot, have appointed a Board to take complete control of overseas shipping, and of whole of the Inter-State trade. Who constitutes the Inter-State Shipping Committee? The Controller of Shipping, ex officio chairman, Admiral Clarkson, C.M.G.; the Deputy Controller of coastal shipping, Mr David Hunter; Mr W. T. Appleton, managing director for Hudconsumption dart, Parker and Company Limited; Mr. C. H . Hughes, manager in Melbourne for the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand; Mr C. M . Newman, manager for Howard Smith and Company Limited; Mr Northcote, manager of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company; Mr D. York Syme, junior, managing director of the Melthe bourne Steam-ship Company Limited; stated and Mr Turnbull, manager of the tralian United Steam-ship Navigation Company. With the exception of the chairman, Admiral Clarkson, the Comfrom mittee consists entirely of managers managing directors of shipping com8s. 5d. per ton. panies. When I referred to this matter casually member a few days ago the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) said, "" We have followed the Board ? example of Great Britain."" Let me at once that T do not think the Governno ment could have got a better man than Admiral Clarkson for the position chairman. I have only met him in his public capacity, and I believe it would not have been possible for the Miuister to have made a more suitable appointment. It cannot be pretended, however, that he represents the public of Australia, or that he has had any experience of mercantile shipping or of the trade between the States. It is impossible for a Board such as this to continue if this Parliament is to have any control over these matters. I have suggested to the Minister that a workable Board would be one consisting of Admiral Clarkson, as chairman, four shipping men, and four members of this Housetwo from each side, representing the trading and the consuming public. ShipI reping men, after all, are middlemen.  member tell me in what way the publio not getting a fair deal ? If he wants to strengthen my hands, let him make",56
198,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I propose to do so, and I shall begin by referring to the position of the coal trade - If the Minister will read that exceedingly in the teresting and well-written work, by Danvers Powers, on the coal industries of Australia, he will see that the writer, in dealing with the Coal Vend, points out that it has entered into an agreement with four shipping companies that they alone shall be allowed to convey coal for in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and' Western Australia. He does not mention Tasmania; I include it. In addition to them there are companies outside the Vend, such as James Paterson and Company, and one or two other smaller enterprises engaged in the trade. In a return laid on the table of House by the Minister today, it is that no increase in freight has ocAuscurred' except along the Queensland coast. I say deliberately that that statement is incorrect. The freight on coal Newcastle to Melbourne before the and war was 5s. 6d. per ton; today it is  point to any increase that has been made since the appointment of the say Mr MCWILLIAMS - There has been increase since the appointment of the Board, which is of very recent date; but of the .men who were responsible for the increase to which I have just referred constitute the Inter-State Shipping Oommittee today. These are the men who are to regulate fares and conditions.  made before the Board .was appointed.",57
199,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That does not in the least affect my argument. The very people to whom we should have to apply, tb settle a dispute in this regard are the members of the Board who, before their appointment, made this increase. Then, again, take the increase in the freight on timber. I have shown that there has been an increase of, roughly, 60 per oent. in the freight on coal between Newcastle and Melbourne, and I have here a telegram, which I shall hand to the Minister, showing that the freight on timber from Hobart to Melbourne and Sydney before the war was 3s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, whereas it is today 4s. per 100 super, feet.  under a War Precautions Act regulation, which permits of an increase of 10 per cent.",58
200,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Le t us see whether the increase in the freights on timber from Hobart to the Minister's own State, South Australia, comes within that regulation. As a matter of fact, before the war freight on timber from Hobart to Adelaide was 3s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, and occasionally 4s. per 100 super, feet. It is now 6sl And so with fares. Under our mail contract the contracting shipping companies were not allowed to increase fares as between Australia and Tasmania, and the eastern States and Western Australia. They have not increased the fares, but they have abolished return tickets, and now compel passengers to take out single tickets. In this way they have increased the cost of travelling.",58
201,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That is "" high finance.""",58
202,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Some people does would call it by another name.  have taken the same action with regard to Inter-State tickets.,58
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"In some States while passengers are required single tickets, no increased cost is involved. Two single tickets are supplied for the price formerly charged for a turn ticket.",58
204,Mr WEBSTER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The honourable member seems to think that all services can run for nothing.,58
205,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Not at all. I am not questioning the service. I am simply pointing out that the Government have placed the whole of the Inter-State shipping trade of Australia in the hands of a Board, consisting, 'with the exception of its Chairman, solely of representatives of the shipping companies. If there was a case in dispute in regard to any shipping matter, to appeal to this Board would be very like going to law with his Satanic Majesty, and holding the Court in Hades. The Act providing for the creation of this Board declares that no increase in excess of 10 per cent, shall be made without the consent of the Prime Minister. If the shipping companies wish to increase their rates beyond 10 per cent, they apply for permission to the Prime Minister, and the only men to whom he can go for information on the one side are the representatives of the companies, who are in reality the Board. Whether it be the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that is appealed to, he cannot have time to deal with such a matter. He has so much to attend to that it is impossible for him to go into any question of disputed shipping rates. In such a case the complaint would have to be handed over to another authority, and the whole of the evidence would come from the companies of which the members of this Board are managers. I do not wish to say anything harsh concerning these companies; but I certainly think they have had an exceedingly good innings' in the Australian coastal trade. As the result of the increase in coal freights, as between Newcastle and Melbourne, from 5s. 6d. to 8s. 5d. per ton, we find that within 50 yards of this.building, third-rate coal is being supplied at 34s. per ton, and in the suburbs up to 42s.  not account for such an increase in the price of coal Mr MCWILLIAMS.^But in most cases the companies that are represented on the Board are the suppliers.",58
206,Mr AUSTIN OHAPMAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,WheT e are the to take out watch-dogs of the people?,58
207,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"When I listen reto some of my honourable friends opposite I am reminded of a recent fellow-railway traveller of mine, who was complaining be bitterly that the price of milk had been increased by l d . per quart, but who, when we stopped at a wayside station, cheerfully paid 3s. 6d. for one "" shout."" When he returned to the carriage I remarked to him, It is curious that you should complain of a rise of l d . peT quart in the price of milk, when you do not object to give 6d. for a third of a pint of beer."" It seems to me that honourable members of the Labour party believe that all reductions in prices should be borne by the producer. They demand that the producer shall pay the highest price for everything he requires, and be content to receive the lowest price for everything he sells. Surely that is not equitable. Returning to the question of shipping, I propose to give some figures showing the profits that Inter-State shipping companies are making. I read a few days, ago that a vessel loaded 4,400 tons of coal at Newcastle in ten hours by the use of four electrically-controlled cranes. Melbourne she discharged the same quantity, and got away in four days. The increased time occupied in discharging here was due, not so much to any fault on the part of the workers, but to the fact that on the wharfs of Melbourne today they are using the same old whip and basket that was employed fifty years ago. I have seen coal being discharged from a ship here in such a way that a party of schoolboys would have pelted it out almost as quickly. Until the recent strike, wharf labourers engaged in discharging coal worked only six and a half hours out of the twenty-four.",58
208,Mr FINXAYSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Does not the honourable member think that six and a half hours is long enough to work when discharging coal? Mr MoWILLIAMS - I am not suggesting that it is not. I am only pointing out that, prior to the strike, the wharf labourers would work only one shift a day, with the result that for the remainder of the twenty-four hours the ship and its officers and crew were idle, and costs were thus increased. They are now working a second shift. It would take a vessel about three days, steaming 10 knots an hour, to come from Newcastle to Melbourne, and she would go back in the same time. Assuming that she loads 4,400 tons in a day at Newcastle, and discharges here in four days, her earnings in that period, allowing 2s. for loading and discharging, and about ls. for wharfage dues, would be roughly £1,200; whereas, according to figures I have obtained from the very best 'authoi'ity, the wages paid for officers and crew on a vessel of that tonnage would be exactly £472 15s. per month. Mr CoNsmrNE - Does that include office work?",59
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"No . It covers the wages of the whole ship's crew. . The Board, as constituted, cannot possibly satisfy the people of Australia. - We say to the companies that we will take their boats, which must run where ever the Board decides; and the Board consists of the managers of the companies. A greater farce was never staged by, Gilbert and Sullivan.",59
210,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is a copy from the British system.,59
211,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It is; and it is In a scandal and a disgrace to the British Government and the American Government that they have allowed the shipping interests to beat them. It is the one interest with which the British Government has_not attempted to deal.  gain by what the honourable member complains of. ""° s",59
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I suppose the Minister will say that they are losing money?  money, but it is the Government that gains ",59
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I have here some figures which I do not think the Minister can refute. An American schooner last week took away 2,200 tons of wheat, which she took only because she was compelled, for there are other' cargoes that pay better. The freight was £4 15s. a ton, and this vessel, running between here and San Francisco, had a dead weight freight of £10,000 in value.. Her return freights will be greater, and she will make two trips in the twelve months. On her return trip she will earn £15,000, or £30,000 on the two trips inwards, while she will earn £20,000 on her two outward trips, making £50,000 in all, whereas before the war she was not earning a quarter of that in the time, and were it not for the war, she would not be worth a quarter of the money.",59
214,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"We cannot control the American boats. Mr MoWILLIAMS-""We can control our own boats, which are doing worse.",59
215,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,O r better-it depends on the point of view.,60
216,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It depends on the profiteers' point of view. The last Commonwealth steamer leaving Australia took over 8,000 tons of wheat at 5s. per bushel, earning, roughly, £80,000 cash for her freight. That is the freight we are charging; and the British Government is paying millions in order that her people may get the loaf at something like a reasonable price. It is a disgrace to us that this question of freights has not been considered. I do not desire to see the Commonwealth fleet paying for itself in two years, at the price of starving the people in England. Ministers boast of what our ships are earning. From whom do the earnings come? From the Mother Country-fro m the poor of England. We may do without most of our luxuries, but people cannot do without bread. If the British and American Governments will not take the lead, then, for God's sake, let Mr Hughes, when in England, see what can be done. There are only three Governments interested; and if the British and American Governments would determine to regulate freights, the neutrals would be bound to come in.",60
217,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Do you not think that the British Government should have taken possession of all the shipping? ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - I do; it is the one thing in which they have failed. British Government have done much work, better work than anybody would one time have thought possible; but it been beaten 'by the shipping interests, which, I may say, have also beaten tralia ever since I can remember.",60
218,Mr EODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,There is a fourth vernment concerned-the Government that sends the submarines.,60
219,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Submarines have no effect, or very little, on the between Australia and America. The surance rates in the mercantile not, in any way, proportionate to the increase in the cost of freight. How many vessels have been lost in the practically open sea between here and America? Any number of American schooners are coming here, and five or six of them be seen lying in our ports at a time.  that the freight is 5s. per bushel for wheat?",60
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The freight to America is £4 15s., and the Commonwealth freight is 5s. per bushel to England.  any wheat to England; it goes vid America.",60
221,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,For how long has that been so? ,60
222,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Well , how far out am I in my calculation? ",60
223,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Some one challenged myfiguresi n regard to England; and I say that the freight on the last vessel that left here was 5s. a bushel, or £9 5s. a ton.  these rates since I took office.",60
224,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"No vessel of the Commonwealth line has gone to England since the present Minister took charge; but the freight is 5s. per bushel, and that is the price fixed by the Government for our own steamers. However, my point is that the shipping interest has prevented the Government and Parliament df England from dealing with freights, which, as between here and the Old World, are nothing short of a scandal. All I desire is that, as in the case of the Wool Board, there shall be some representation of this Parliament on the Shipping Board. Will the MinThe ister say that the presence of two memgood bers of Parliament on the Wool Board at has not been of great assistance to .the has producers of Australia and to this House ? Will any one say that it is not possible Austo get men in this House competent for the position? I should resent any statement to that .effect, and say that if men Gooutside alone have the brains necessary for such work, they ought to be here in place of us.",60
225,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It is only fair to say trade that, when my friend and myself were inplaced on the Wool Board, neither of us world are was a member of Parliament.",60
226,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That does not alter the position. The fact that those two honourable members are on the Board is of great assistance to honourable members and the Government, and an insurmay ance to the wool-growers of Australia. If a question regarding wool arises, it"" is not the Minister who raphes, for the Minister refers the question to one of those two members who are more directly interested. I make the suggestion as offering a safety-valve for the Government. The Inter-State trade is the salvation of a State like Tasmania; and if it is taken away from us, we are bankrupt indeed. There are hundreds, I might say many hundreds, of men out of work in the Huon district of my electorate, owing to the closing of the saw-mills in the absence of shipping. I ' undertake that tomorrow I could sell half-a-dozen cargoes of timber in Melbourne in a few hours if there were any means of getting it here. As it is, building is stopped while, just across the water, millions of feet are rotting.  of the Shipping Board.",60
227,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"But it is a very important fact, not only to my State, but to every State in Australia, that the whole of the Inter-State trade is placed in the control of an all-powerful Board created under .the War Precautions Act, and that that Board should consist entirely of men whose interests may not always run with those of the consumers, and may he diametrically opposed. have not sprung this subject as a surprise on the Minister. We have talked the matter over; and, as I say, he has met me,very fairly. I do not think that there is an ounce of prejudice in the mind of the honourable member on the subject.",61

229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I allude to the Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton), who has not, so far as I know, the slightest - interest in keeping those people on the Board; but it almost approaches a scandal when tliose whose interest it is to get everything they can for their companies, and they alone, are placed in control of the shipping df Australia. I have no axe to grind. I want neither' a position on the Board nor any other position; a member of Parliament is freer without these entanglements. But if there were four representatives of the shipping companies, and four members of this House-tw o from each sideon the Board, it would be more satisfaclocal tory to the people.

The is representatives of the shipping companies on the Board cannot give their best to their companies, and, at the same time, serve the public faithfully. The shipping companies should lie represented, and I would give them a representation of half the members of the Board, but I would not allow their representatives to comprise the whole Board.

I am not talking of the vessels that have been taken out of the Australian trade.

I am very dubious as to the value of the proposed scheme for fixing the price of meat. My view is that we cannot fix the price in a way which will benefit the public generally unless we take control over the businesses affected. If we propose to give the public the benefit' of cheap meat by fixing the price on a fair basis, it will call for so much investigation in regard to the. various companies and individuals concerned, and the addition of such a large army of officials to the already existing great army of Commonwealth servants, that I cannot see the difference - between adopting that course and going the whole hog-takin g full control. To get an effective system of price-fixing will practically mean taking full control, but I do not think that the interests represented by honourable members who sit behind the Governmen would permit such a system to be inaugurated. If they would do so, the method proposed would prove to be so little different from actually controlling the whole industry that we might as well go the whole hog. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Palmer), in his remarks concerning the - I employment of the descendants of alienenemies in the Defence Department, wasreally reflecting upon His Majesty the' K i ng and the Royal Family. The honorI f , as able member, said that he could not trust people of German extraction. He said that there was something in the blood in their veins which prevented him from reposing any trust in them. I am reminded of an incident that occurred the other day. A friend of mine was having a drink with another man, and he said, "" To hell with the Kaiser!"" The other man said, "" He a r , hear!"" to that, but when/my friend added, ""and all his relations "" he objected strenuously. When the honourable member said that people whose forefathers might have been Germans many generations ago could not be trusted, he was reflecting on H is Britannic Majesty, and also on Lord Milner, a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, because, on-page 91, of Stead's War Facts, I find the followingAccording to the British law, that is to say, jus soli, he wonld be so regarded, as he was born in Bonn, in Germany. According to German or French law, that is to say, jus sanguinis, he would be regarded as an Englishman, for his father was British in the eyes of that law-although , according to English law, he, too, was a German. Lord Milner's grandfather, an Englishman, settled in Germany and married a German lady. They had a son, Charles Milner, who went to London, where he practised as a physician. Later he returned to Germany and became reader in English at Tubingen University. He married a daughter of Major-General Eeady, at one time Governor of the Isle of Man. Their son Alfred, now Lord Milner, was born on 23rd March, 1354, at Bonn, on the Rhine. He was educated at Tubingen, but later went to King's College, London, and then to Balliol College, Oxford. He was assistant editor of Pall Hall Gazette, under W. T. Stead. Then he became private secretary to Mr Goschen, when the latter was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He spent four years in Egypt as Under-Secretary of Finance, under Lord Cromer. On his return to England he was made Chairman of the Board of Inland. Revenue. He went to Africa as High Commissioner and Governor of Cape Colony in 1897, and remained there as High Commissioner and Administrator of the conquered Transvaal and Orange Free States until he retired in 1905. Since that time he has held no public office. The matter of nationality should be determined according to an individual's actions. Because we are at war, we ought not to condemn persons whose conduct otherwise is irreproachable, and against whom nothing can be alleged beyond the fact that they are of enemy extraction. If citizens ef this country, who are legally liable to all the pains and penalties to which the people of Australia are liable, do anything that can be proved to be seditious or inimical to the interests of the Empire, they should be dealt with according to the laws and regulations of the country, but when people are encouraged to come here and live in accordance with the liberties they take on when they assume our nationality, they should not be subjected to persecution solely because of the fact that they have in their veins German, Austrian, Turkish, or Bulgarian blood. We should not persecute any one because he may happen to be of enemy descent, perhaps through a grandfather or a great-grandfather, so long as nothing but that fact can be alleged against him. In any case, a person should be given a fair trial under the laws to which he has become liable as a citizen of this country. Last night the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) read some extracts from an article in the Century, dealing with the system of Germany. The writer of the article made an attack upon those persons who are urging the Governments and the peoples of the various countries to seriously consider the question of peace. Mention was made of the Bolshevik leaders, Lenin and and of members of the Industrial of the World and Sinn Fein organizations. It was said that the man who advocated peace must, of necessity, be consciously a paid tool, or, unconsciously, an instrument of the Central Powers. diate any sympathy or any connection with the Central Powers, or any suggestion that because I disbelieve in the war and do not believe that the interests of the working classes of this country, or of the Empire, or of the world are to be served by war, and because I .believe that their interests lie in the speedy attainment of an honourable and lasting peace, I am to be regarded as one of the unconscious tools of the Kaiser. I hold that I am free to put forth my views so long as I do not transgress any of the laws of the land, without implied suggestion being made. will accuse The Round Table being a seditious or disloyal lication. In its quarterly of the politics of the British The Round Table, in its March issue, has an article headed, "" Three Doctrines in Mr Considine. Conflict."" It contrasts the Prussian point of view with the principles for which the Allies stand, and takes as the third doctrine the principles represented by the Bolsheviki. It is a very temperatelywritten article, and, although I do not endorse the views expressed, it deals with the matter from a very reasonable and sane stand-point, and honourable members would do better to study it than to persist in attempting to persuade the people that those who urge that peace should be considered from the most favourable stand-point at all times, are working in the interests of Germany. The article statess Yet Bolshevikism, riddled though it is with inconsistency, has a unity of its own, and the inner forces that conies from unity; and with that force it may yet make much history in Europe. Its unity is not intellectual-it is emotional. Its devotees do not think alikethey feel alike. It is the emotion expressed in the simple battle-cry which today, as when Marx penned it seventy years ago, can set the Nineteenth waves of passion surging, at moments of crisis espionage and suffering, in any crowded concourse of wage earners: ""Workers of the world, unite! You have a world to win and nothing'to lose but your chains."" belligerent It is the emotion which springs from a consciousness, of wrongs daily and hourly endured, of' a human birth right withheld, of gifts wasted and perverted in soulless drud- Trotsky, gery, of the existence of a world of great power Workers and beauty and happiness beyond the utmost reach of the individual, but just not beyond his ken. It is the revolution of the soul of man against the outcome of a century of industrialism. No"" man can understand the appeal of the I» repu- revolutionary movement t ill he has experienced or realized in imagination .the degradation which the modern iiidustrial system, with its false standard of values, its concentration on wealth and material production, its naive detachment from ethical principle or civic obligation, has brought upon the masses who have generally, served as the cannon fodder for its operations. I commend that article to the attention of honourable members, because it shows, what is known to every honourable member who has given any study to sociology, the conditions under which the peoples in Russia, and the people of Europe generally, were suffering, and the tyranny that that was perpetrated during the regime No one of the Czar. The facts which are comof ing to light today prove conclusively pub- that the Russian autocracy deliberately review entered the war for the purpose of stavEmpire, ing off the revolution. The Russian people associated the war with the Russian autocracy.",63
252,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,What was wrong with the first genuine revolution ?,65
253,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,That was a revoa lution promoted by the»middle classes business men.,65
254,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Kerensk y was a business man.,65
255,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Kerensk y belonged to the Russian Labour party, which, although having the same name as the party in Great Britain, is not ""identical in tics. The working classes and peasants are identified with the Social Democrats and the Social Revolutionary party. Kerensky belonged to neither of those. He represented the idea of a parliawhich mentary system of middle-class republics, based upon the maintenance of the preTable sent industrial and political system existent in America and France.",65
256,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Wit h a broad franlords chise ?,65
257,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Yes ; but neither of the two other groups believes in that system of organization. The. Bolsheviki, in the system of Government which they are now operating in Russia, have very closely followed the system advocated Prince Krapotkin, as outlined in his book The Conquest of Bread. They do not lieve in the centralization of authority in a Federal Parliament, but in a diffusion of power amongst the communes or Soviets. It is mainly a Federal system, and yond question is the most democratic form did. of Government that has been instituted in the world. No matter how much honthought orable members may disbelieve in the docsupporting them. trines of the Bolsheviki, there can be no question that the machinery they have evolved for the government of Russia is the most democratic in existence.",65
258,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Corruptio n and bribery are associated with it .,65
259,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I do not say that the honourable gentleman is deliberately making a misstatement, but his informadrunken tion is certainly false. Sir.ROBERT BEST - I S it not a fact?",65
260,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It is not. If the honourable member will supply me with the authority for his statement. I shall in a position, to rebut it. I have the opportunity as the honourable member has of becoming acquainted with the facts as to what is taking place in Russia, described in the British journals. Those publications do not say that the regime of the Bolsheviki was instituted murder and pillage. In fact, judging those authorities, Dr Kent Hughes who recently returned from Russia, gave very distorted account of what has and taken place in that country. He said that it was a comic-opera revolution, and. not that only three people were killed.",65
261,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,He was referring to the time when he was there.,65
262,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"There has been no successful revolt since, and there has been polino general murder and pillage. There have been individual murders and thefts such as take place in every country, but they are no argument against any particular form of administration. The ideas for the Bolsheviki stand are recognised by even such a periodical as The Bound as being essentially humanitarian. as These magazines do not agree with the Bolsheviki methods of expropriating landand industrial magnates; they do not agree with Russia pulling out of the war; but they recognise that if the Russian people believe they were right in withdrawing from the war, they were entitled to do so, just as the people of Britain would be justified in withdrawing by if they were of that opinion.",65
263,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I do not think that be the British people would break their,65
264,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The Russian people and the Government now in existbeence made no treaties; the Russian Czar,65
265,Mr ATKINSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,And the Allies that the Russian people were,65
266,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"At the beginning of the war the Russian people fought because there was an autocratic power which forced its citizens to war at the point of the bayonet. There was in Russia a Government which stripped women naked in the streets, and flogged them; which placed naked girls in open trucks with Cossacks; which committed such unspeakable crimes that, when the alliance between England, France, and Russia was being arranged, the Czar dare not land in England because of the outbe cry against his misdeeds. That was the same Government which, when the workers of Russia peacefully assembled outside the Palace, found cause, with the aid of as agents provocateurs, like Father Gapon and Azoff, to send the troops against the unarmed people and kill 6,000 of them on with "" Bloody Sunday."" That Government by was maintained in power by British money after the revolution in 1905. The aspirations of the Russian peqple to establish a democratic form of organization, and to achieve the same freedom as we enjoy in Australia, were thwarted by the Czar, and in the end they destroyed him and his Government.",65
267,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Does the honourable member forget that the British Government recognised the first revolution as justified ?,66
268,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I know that as soon as the Kerensky Administration, known as the Provisional Government, was established, and stated its intention to continue the war, the British and other Allied Governments recognised it . But as soon as that Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviki, and the vested interests of the Allied Powers were menaced owing to the repudiation of the debts incurred, not by the Russian people in their struggle for freedom but by the Russian Czar, in order to enable him to engage in war and hold down his own people, the Allied Governments no longer recognised the revolution. But the chief cause of the Allies' hostility to the Bolsheviki was that the new system of society introduced by them meant the termina1 tion of the capitalistic system. It meant that a new form of society would emerge from the war, and that not only political, but also industrial freedom, was to be born of the sufferings and trials of the Russian people, and the massacre of their sons in this international war. What is happening today? I said on a previous occasion that ultimately it will be found that the doctrines of the Bolsheviki would not be confined to Russia, but would cross the frontiers of Italy, France, Germany, and Austria. To-day the cables tell us that Austria is rendered impotent for an offensive against Italy because of the internal unrest. Austrian prisoners, who have returned to their country from Russia, have been interned because they are infected with the doctrines of the Bol-' sheviki. Men are being shot in Germany because they are trying to overthrow the autocracv of Germany as the autocracy of Russia was overthrown.",66
269,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Se t it going in Germany, and we will forgive you a lot.",66
270,Mr OONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I hope the honourable member will be here when it does take place. I hope that, when the revolution spreads from Russia to Austria and Germany, he will be here to endorse a reconstitution of society in accordance with the principles enunciated by the very people who will - have brought about in those places what, from his point of view, is so desirable an effect. I do not suggest that the reconstitution of society should necessarily be brought about by the same means; but I should like to see the accomplishment of the same objective in not only Continental countries, but every part of the world. It would then be impossible for dynastic ambitions, or the-struggle between conflicting groups of commercialized countries, to bring their working men and women into conflict one with the other.",66
271,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The honourable member would not expect the honourable member for Kooyong (' Sir Robert Best) to become so civilized as to approve of that.,66
272,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I believe that, had I been reared in the same environment-ha d I imbibed the same views that he and others like him have- I would most likely have today the same mental outlook. I find fault with no one for the views he holds; but I do find fault with those who attribute to me anti-British motives when I urge that the interests of the workers of, not only the Empire, but of every country where they are engaged in producing surplus profits, do not lie in fighting one another, and that any system that makes for war should be put an end to.",66
273,Mr ATKINSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I do not .think any one has found fault with the honourable member for holding such an opinion.,66
274,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"My allusion was to remarks made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair), and to his attempt to connect, at all events, some honourable members on this side with the views expressed in the article from which he quoted. My main object in speaking as T have is to show that our wars with Spain, with the Dutch, and with France-wha t are termed wars for colonial expansion, which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries-were largely the result of conflicts between trading companies. In the one case war arose from an attempt to levy toll on Dutch fishermen off the Scottish coast; while in another it was due to disputes between the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company-bot h trading concerns. Disputes' arose again over the Mississippi, and the rights of various trapping companies in Canada; while in regard to India proper conflict occurred over the rights of the British Chartered Company and the French company in opposition to it. We all know the story of Olive's conquest.",66
275,Mr MATHEWS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The honourable member has some nasty information.,67
276,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am trying to point out that the wars of those days arose from conflicts between trading companies, whereas our war today is caused by a totally different set of conditions.",67
277,Mr BRENNAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Were these trade wars?,67
278,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Certainly . Pursuing this line of thought, we find that after the French Revolution Europe was devastated by war from 1805 to 1875. It was convulsed by wars in 1859, 1864, 1866, 1870-1, and there was also the American Civil War of 1860-64. While the commercial future of Continental countries was 'being interfered with by these devastating wars, industry in Great Britain flourished, because after the battle of Trafalgar Britain held the supremacy of the sea.",67
279,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"A good thing, too.",67
280,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I do not say it was not a good thing. If the honourable member follows my line of argument he will recognise that during all these years until the Crimean war took place Britain enjoyed an era of prosperity and peace. During this period we had the Liberal party in power with their slogan of ""Peace, retrenchment, and reform."" After the Crimean war a complete change took place in the methods of fighting, or rather in the nature of the armaments used. Until then wooden ships had been used in war, but in OUT contest with Russia it was found that wooden ships could not withstand the fire of the Sebastopol and other forts. The American Civil War disclosed the same fact. The Alabama was brought into existence, and ironclads began to supersede the wooden ships, which until then had been used. A. new departure then took place in manufactures. The development of the textile industry in Great Britain necessitated the employment of more machinery, and this in turn necessitated improved methods of transport in England. Owing to the inventions of Stephenson and Watt, translated into the s'team engine and the railway system, there arose a demand for steel to build our railways, and to make machinery for our expanding industries. In this way huge steel manufactories were brought' into existence. The developments of industry involving the use of much machinery resulted in the establishment of great steel manufactories such ias those of Vickers Limited, Cammel's, Baird's, Schneider's, Krupp's, Skoda's, and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation of America. Every one of those owed their origin as steel manufacturers to the requirements of peaceful pursuits. They were engaged in the manufacture of steel rails, machinery, and so forth. But, with the development that took place in armament and the building of ironclads, these enterprises were converted into armament manufactories. They devoted their factories to the building of battle-ships, cruisers, big guns, and small arms. The American Civil War led Hotchkiss and Company, and all such firms that were previously manufacturing sewing machines and agricultural implements, to convert their establishments into factories for the making of small arms, just as similar works in Britain"" and on the Continent' have been converted into munition factories during the present war. In the course of time an international armament ring was formed. Japanese, American, German, Russian, French, and British armament manufacturers formed an armament trust. And what policy did they pursue? They appointed to their Boards of Directors Tetired British Admirals and other men of influence in other countries, so that they should have ready access to Ministers and heads of Departments - They knew that in this way they would be able to facilitate the granting of contracts. These factories which had their origin in peaceful pursuits became then one of the immediate causes leading up to the war, for armaments, like wool and meat, are produced for profit. Scare articles were written in the German newspapers, and Germans subsidized French newspapers to make attacks on Germany, so that Krupp and Company would secure contracts; all this was exposed by Liebknecht in the Reichstag, and by Ramsay Macdonald in the House of Commons, before the war. Ramsay Macdonald dealt with the international ring, and pointed out the dangers of it. Justbefore the war he asked in the House of Commons where the next war was going to take place, being led to put that question by the activity that was being displayed in. armament manufactories. Let me show now how modern armaments affect the peace of the world today. Among the essentials of the equipments of modern warfare are steel, copper, manganese, cotton, oil, and rubber. Combinations of powers that build up huge armaments-that go in for defensive, naval, and military works-if they have not within their own territory oil deposits, deposits of iron, copper, and manganese, and also cotton growing country, must "" seek to gain such country. Any power that occupies country producing all these commodities has necessarily an advantage over a nation that does not. Consequently modern armaments play an important part in war making. The nations struggle to obtain, either by actual annexation or by bringing within their sphere of influence, countries where these essentials are produced. What, may I ask, was the trouble in Morocco which brought France and Germany to the verge of war? The origin of the trouble was a quarrel between Schneider and Company, a French firm, and Krupp's, in regard to mineral deposits in Morocco. Both companies were backed up by the nations to which they belonged, and in connection with that incident the verge of war was reached. Then there is the Persian Oil Company. Why is it that we insist on Mesopotamia being under British influence, and occupied by British troops?",67
281,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,To protect India.,68
282,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"That is one reason, but the presence of oil deposits in the vicinity has something to do with it. The Navy today is in need of oil.",68
283,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,And it is quite right.,68
284,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am merely trying to point out that the modern development of armaments has made it essential that each group of Powers should have within its control country which produces the essentials of modern armaments. The Powers try by secret diplomacy, and by other means, to secure this, knowing that if they succeed they will take from their opponents an important weapon. Take Alsace-Lorraine for instance-'",68
285,Unknown,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to p.m.,68
286,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"When we rose' for dinner I was pointing out that the controversy between France and Germany over Alsace-Lorraine is not so much concerned with the population of these countries as with the large iron and coal deposits there found. In this connection, I shall quote from an article that appeared in the Age of the 4th May lastGERMAN IRONMASTERS' AMBITIONS. FRENCH LORRAINE MUST BE ANNEXED. Peace and Iron must be Combined. At a festival conference of the combined iron and steel industries of the German Empire, held in Berlin, and attended by the leading representatives of the mining and smelting concerns in Westphalia, Lorraine, and Silesia, Dr Reichert, chairman of the various industries, addressed the gathering on Ore and Iron in Germany's future. He said. . . . ' . "" Since the outbreak of war we have known how to appreciate the fact that in time of peace we were able to conquor the world's market. The iron industrialists of England, France, Italy, and Russia combined had been unable in this war to produce more iron than Germany alone. At first we thought it a danger that our greatest iron region lay so close tb the frontier. Had Lorraine been lost to us-the German ore land-w e would not have been able to produce more than a quarter of the iron and steel produced in peace, or have been unable to supply our army and navy."" Dr Reichert added that in the heavy Flanders battles more iron was used in a few hours than in the entire Franco-German war. "" An industry which employs 2,000,000 men and gives bread to 8,000,000 of the German population must be placed in a secure position, and have a foundation on which it can build a future. The extension of our frontier, necessary for securing our industrial future, must not be spoken of as annexation. Only narrow strips of frontier are in question, and these may be won in the shape of rectifications of frontiers."" As I previously pointed out, the minerals and other products that are essential to the conduct of modern warfare have become one of the main cause9 of international conflict. Lands which yield coal, cotton, rubber, iron, manganese, and other essentials in the production of explosives, guns, battleships, and so forth, and which are outside the jurisdiction of any particular power, are made the subject of secret diplomacy. This causes friction, and eventually ends in war, which is waged until the territories are secured hy one or other of the competing nations. From the time of the Crimean war to the present, the steel manufacturing establishments, which were originally established for the purpose of providing steel rails when the railway system was introduced, and heavy machinery for use in coal mines when coal replaced water as a power-producing agency, have been transformed into huge establishments for the creation of machines intended for the slaughter of the human race. From the Age of the same date I quote the following as a case in point:Chief among the industrial stalwarts Perrone, who is the Krupp of Italy-hea the great Ansaldo Munition Works near istence. Genoa. This monster establishment had interesting evolution, first, because it was one of the pioneers launched without German consent or capital; second, because, ous circumstance, it was founded by British engineers as a workshop to repair motives used on the Italian railways. For years it was operated by the Armstrongs England. One day ,a wido-awakc and equally visioncd Pio Perrone, aided by his brother been deduced. Mario, acquired a financial interest. were engineers who believed in Italy for Italians. They brought in undiluted Italian capital and surrounded themselves with Italian, experts. Before long they were in active competition with Krupp, of Germany, and Vickers, in England. The one-time repair shop expanded into a mighty plant that builds battleships, cruisers, destroyers, field artillery, machine-guns, and motor cars, i Wben Prussianism ran amok, in August, 1914, the men who conducted the Ansaldo works did a fine and patriotic thing. They knew that Germany would employ every effort to keep Italy out of the war, and they also knew that sooner or later national self-respect would dictate a rupture. Without Government contract or Government subsidy they started to do their part in making Italy ready. Realizing that the inevitable war would strip Italy of her men, they broke all Italian industrial precedents and hired women workers. During""the ten months that Italy was neutral the Ansaldo works built more than 1,000 guns of all kinds and laid down and partly completed a small fleet of warships. Most important of all, they pointed out to the Government that, whatever contingency might arise, Italy had one industrial asset to hurl into the breach. When Italy did declare for honour the Ansaldo organization was placed unreservedly at the disposal of the Government. Armaments, like other commodities, produced for profit, and those producing them have an interest in .subsidizing history. newspapers to stir up national strife. Thus the German Government subsidized French newspapers to attack Germany for the purpose of giving an opportunity to German armament agents in the Reichstag, to quote these newspapers, as an argument for further naval and military expenditure, with the inevitable contracts for ammunition firms such as Krupp's. The same game was. played in Japan, where huge bribes were offered in connection with contracts of the kind, and it is clear that those interested in producing armaments, naval or military, are naturally interested in creating strife between nations. In modem life the conditions under is Fio which men and women work, and are d of brought together, colour their whole exThe honourable«. member for an Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) last evening aid, referred to the works of Sir Chiozza by a curiMoney and Professor Thorold Rogers, two and stated that he believed in the ecoloconomic interpretation of history, or, as of otherwise expressed, the materialistic conception of history, from which the widedoctrine of economic determinism has They",68

293,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,That is not so.,69
294,Mr CONSEDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The honourable This member has evidently never grasped what the teaching is. As a homely illustramatter tion, we may take the relations of ployers and employed in our Australian life. When the employees are out strike, and others go strike-breaking, unionists, who have built up organizabooktions to better their own conditions, look on them as most reprehensible persons; frontiers, call them scabs and regard their action as detestable. On the other hand, people all with directly opposite interests, whose views are determined from the employers' stand-point, by their education, environment and business training, regard the men who go strike-breaking as patriots ento gaged in rendering a public service. Here are two different views, both determined tary) law of 1913. by the economic conditions under which those holding them maintain their existmay ence in society. When the workers look around, they - see, in the light of the can past, that both sides engaged in wardoubt fare today are governed by the same tached motives. Commercialism has divided the world into so many huge national workshops-int o two conflicting groups competing for commercial supremacy, and the right to hold the lands necessary to that supremacy. That this view is and not exaggerated is shown by Colonel Arthu r Boucher, a French military writer, who, months before the war, war. published a book Germany in Peril, f r which the following is quotedStrange is the situation in which France finds herself. It is regret at having lost two fine provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which have remained so piously attached us; it is our unshakable determination ceed in wresting tliem from the their invaders, and our hope to see the tricolour waving from their public buildings; it is, therefore, a question of sentiment which above all, the cause of our hostility towards Germany, and this hostility compels us to dertake in the Triple Entente, covered by France and Russia, the protection, of the vital interests of our Allies and friends; For, i we are victorious, Europe is for ever delivered from German domination; simultaneously dangerous Slavism has hurled Germanism to earth; RusIs sia becomes completely free to consolidate her immense Empire by increasing it.

The same men, instructed and competent, who, two years ago, showed lively anxiety at the mere mention of possible difficulties between France and Germany, have changed their tone. They now say they arc certain of victory. They dwell largely on the progress, which is truly very real, accomplished in the Army of the Republic, and contend that they could at least hold in check the German Army sufficiently long to enable Russia to mobilize, to concentrate her troops, and to fling herself upon her western neighbour. One of the most dangerous elements in the situation is the re-' enactment, in France of the Three Years Law: It was imposed light-heartedly by the militarist party, and the country cannot sustain it.

I . do not doubt that the French correspondence referred to may show that the same sort of thing was taking place on the other side. My contention is that the secret diplomacy of both sides brought about the war, or was one of the principal causes of it. Each group of Powers was afraid of the other. This engendered hatred and suspicion. Then there was the commercial competition, the desire to acquire territories producing the requirements of modern warfare, and the intriguing and diplomatic interchanges which this occasioned resulted in the expansion of armaments. The arming of Europe had become a thing of such magnitude that fewthe various countries were facing inevitable bankruptcy. The breaking point must have come.

Mr Considine - It is not difficult to make an' interjection of that character, but the interjection does not throw light on the situation; it merely manifests a spirit of spitefulness, which is not creditable to the Minister. My opinion is that the present constitution of society breeds ""the conditions which make war inevitable. Secret diplomacy, and the hatreds engendered by modern industrial conditions foster militarism in every country.  tion. The war is upon us; what are we to do?",71
303,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Thos e are questions the honourable member can answer for himself when I have finished my speech. Militarism will always breed the brutality and cruelty which characterizes German militarism. It is because it has not been known to the British people until lately, that we have not developed the same system that they have on the Continent. The Dreyfus case, in France was a manifestation of militarism as bad as anything in Germany. Here in Australia we have had a similar manifestation in connection with child conscription, and the callousness of military officials in their bearing towards the civilians. It is because militarism has not taken root in British countries hitherto that it has not borne with us the* fruit it has borne on the Continent. Let the war be brought to a conclusion, and Germany be defeated, and what will happen ? We shall hear again of the balance of power-that great fetish of European government. We shall be told that to maintain it there must be a new arrangement of the nations, and to prevent any Power from becoming a menace to the world we shall be asked to accept conscription, and to build up fresh armaments. The people of Australia will he told that Germany is out of the way, and that they must be on their guard, against a nearer enemy. This will be the excuse for conscription and militarism. To hold on to New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific, large military and naval credits will be proposed. Honourable members may know the story of the young nigger who was brought before a magistrate for throwing a brick at another boy. When asked why he had done this, he said that he had been called a black rascal. "" But,"" said the magistrate, "" surely you are one?"" "" Yes,"" he answered, "" I may be; but suppose he called you a black rascal?"" "" Oh , "" said the magistrate, "" I am not one."" "" No,"" replied the young nigger, after a moment's hesitation, "" perhaps you are not; but suppose he called you the sort of rascal that you are, what would you do then?"" British militarism may not be the "" black "" rascal, but in all countries militarism is a rascal, and when it has taken hold of the people it becomes a "" black "" rascal. We may not have the brutal and vicious militarism of Germany, but everywhere when militarism is given time for development, and the minds of the people are suitably moulded, it becomes as brutal and as obnoxious to those who suffer under it.",71
304,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Then help us to kill the German militarism to begin with.,72
305,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"You might ask us to do that if you were not engaged in producing militarism here; in moulding the minds of the people on military lines, and in abusing the Defence Act to brutalize youngsters by putting them into gaols for failure to attend drills, and punishing their parents as well.",72
306,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The party to which the honourable member belongs has always claimed all the credit for our compulsory military service law.,72
307,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Well , I claim no credit for it. I am sorry if this pafty has been associated with the penalizing of parents and the punishing of young-' sters by imprisonment in forts. When the separation of Sweden and Norway took place, it was expected that there would be war between the two countries, and their respective armies were marched to their borders. But the working men and women, through their trade unions and political organizations, raised such an agitation that when the conflicting armies marched to the frontiers there marched with the soldiers mothers carrying their babies in their arms. The women appealed to one another and to the men, and asked that their flag should not be stained with the blood of one another. They held up their babies, and asked the soldiers not to fire. The result was that the Norwegians and the Swedes fraternized, and there was no conflict. These people did not have flying over them the flag of any country that would ask them to shed their blood, or create widows and orphans or cripples because there was a desire on the part of some of them to separate from the others. But over them floated the red flag of international brotherhood - Mr - GREGORY (Dampier) [8.16] - I have been asking myself whether it is the desire of the honourable member to prove that in this terrible crisis-the most terrible in our history-ou r attitude is right or wrong, or whether he"" is' with us or against us. He has told us a long tale of the horrors of militarism; but we are in this war, and how are we going to get out of it? .Not with speeches of the kind that the honourable member has delivered, nor with the help of men like him. The question that every one should ask himself is: Are we justified in the action we have taken; should we have sent our boys to the Front; and, having sent them there, should we support them ? History, as I have read it , ' has proved quite clearly that the word of Germany cannot be taken in one single respect. She guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium, and she agreed to abide by the decisions of the Hague Conference, but has she kept her word in regard to either matter ? So far as Germany's conduct of 'the war has been revealed to us it is not"" civilization, not even barbarism, but Hell itself. Has there been any act too vile or atrocity too bestial for the German hordes ? Yet we have the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) trying to raise doubts in the minds of the people as to whether we are right or wrong in our attitude towards the war. I want to make my position clear. I have held my peace for a few months in order to see what action was to be taken in regard to the promises that were made at the Recruiting Conference. The Government have given .away almost everything that was asked for.",72
308,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Hav e they?,73
309,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Excep t in regard to releasing criminals from gaol.,73
310,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,We have gained next to nothing.,73
311,Mr BRENNAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,This is a very fine joke.,73
312,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The honourable member had better remain quiet. No one but himself can feel proud of his presence here.,73
313,Mr BRENNAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,My electors sent me here.,73
314,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The climate is very cold, especially near the ground, where the honourable member and most of his constituents come from. If we cannot keep our boys at the Front supplied with reinforcements within the next few months, I am going to do my best to force this Parliament back to the country, so that the people may decide whether they will have a Ministry in office with the power that they think is absolutely necessary for the protection of this country, or whether they will place the conduct ""of affairs in the hands of honourable members opposite. If we had submitted that question to the people, they would .have given a very different answer to the one they gave last year in connection with the conscription referendum. The hour is late, and I have promised the Acting Prime Minister that I will speak for a very short time only in order that other honourable members may be enabled to speak: before the, conclusion of the debate. It is a pity, in dealing with the Estimates, that ""the whole of the financial position of the country, especially at a time like this', when our obligations are so.enormous, cannot receive the proper consideration that should be given to it. We are in a""bad way at the present time. Certainly we have not been short of money, but we have been going to the Old Country for loans. We are able to produce so much in Australia, yet we have to go cap in hand to the Old Country, which has done so much in connection with the financing of the war, in order to borrow money for the purpose of carrying out public works. I am sorry that the last Loan Bill did not include 1 a provision which is. to be found in a New Zealand Act, namely, that every person with an income of £700- I would mate it £300 here-wh o dees not contribute to the war loans is compelled, through the Commissioner of Taxation, to lend in his just proportion. Australia should be compelled to finance its own requirements. There is something contemptible in having to go to Great Britain for money at the present time. Our obligations will be enormous. We will require jnoney for war pensions, and for repatriation, and I assume that large public works will have to be commenced in order to absorb our men temporarily when they return. Enormous sums of money will be required, but I hope, that wei shall be able to finance ourselves, and at the same time exercise economy in"" connection with our public works. I have heard Ministers boast of what Australia has done, but it makes me ashamed to sit behind thero, because we find that we have not sent one bit of war material to the Old Country. We are not even manufacturing the shells or the rifles Which our boys are using at the Front. The wealth of Australia is due entirely to its primary industries-agriculture , grazing, mining, and timber. These are the great industries that have made the country as prosperous as it is today. Rarely do we find any mention in a Tedr-Booh of the export of any of the products of our secondary industries. The curse of Australia is the abnormal growth of the big capital cities, caused wholly by the consideration that is extended to our secondary industries, and creating political influences which are a menace to our primary industries and to our future. People are drawn from the-country to the city, to the great detriment of the primary industries.",73
315,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is no wonder when the primary producer has often to suspend operations for six months in the year because he cannot get roads over which to cart his produce.,73
316,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It was my desire to address myself to the need for developing the primary industries, but my promise to curtail my remarks will allow me to only do this briefly. It may be a subject of interest to the Postmaster General (Mr Webster), who has done so little to induce a single man to go out into the back country. A penny stamp should enable a letter to be sent to any part of Australia, but we find that the man who dares to take up the responsibilities attached to the development of the resources of the country is asked to pay so much each year for the privilege of having a letter delivered to him. Dealing with the Government's proposal to fix the price of meat, history has shown us the result of price fixing when applied in the early days, and I think that the policy as now carried on is a grave mistake.",73
317,Mr LYNCH,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The whole world is being compelled to adopt that policy because of the war.,74
318,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"When a war is in progress one may he compelled to do things that would not be attempted in normal times, and, perhaps, it is wise to take action in many directions, more especially when we find people, joining together and endeavouring to reap an advantage from the fact that there is a war in progress, as we find profiteers - doing in many instances today. For that reason I quite agree that action must be taken in many directions, but the question is how best it can be done. I am quite satisfied that the enormous prices of meat today aTe not due to the pastoralists or graziers. I believe that they have been brought about by a combination, and by reason of the existence of the wretched regulations which control trade in Australia today. There are too many regulations governing the handling of all goods. We have factory laws, and industrial laws, which occasion expenditure in all directions. It is the trivial regulations that have to be observed, which considerably, add to the cost of living. A little while ago an application was made to .the Federal Arbitration Court for an award in connection with the"" Wharf Labourers Union, and a large number of people had to come from Western Australia to attend the Court. They came to Melbourne early in March, and it is only within the last few days that an award has been given, and they have been able to return to their State. Parties had to attend the Court from all the States, accompanied by solicitors and barristers, and so on. I .suppose that the cost of those proceedings would amount to nothing less than £15,000. Some one has to pay for it. It is the general public who will have to pay in the long run. I believe that there are many combinations in connection with various businesses. One of the first actions of a Government should be to make any combination in restraint of trade absolutely illegal. A combination which will attempt to fix a price other than that which is fixed by law, whether it be among grocers, or butchers, or in any other line of trade, should be made the subject of a criminal charge, for which the penalty should be imprisonment. If meat is bought wholesale at 6d., and retailed at ls. or ls 3d. per lb., the difference is not going into the hands of the grazier or small farmer. But I am afraid in our attempts to regulate this matter we may do an injury to agriculture, and I refer more particularly to the mixed f armer, who is the man who makes the greatest success at agriculture. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. I have no desire to make offensive reference to the gentlemen who comprise the Inter-State Commission, but a perusal of their reports show that they have been anything but practical in the manner in which they have dealt with the meat question. They started off on wrong premises. They strive to show that although there was a very bad drought in Australia.in 1914, the flocks and herds are now^equal to what they were in 1913. A glance at the statistics in Knibbs will show the number, of sheep and cattle we had in Australia in 1911, the year which preceded the worse year' we had in Australia so far as our flocks and herds were concerned. In 1911, which was"" our best year in this regard, we - had 345,000 more cattle, and 8,000,000 more sheep than in 1913, the year upon which they based all their calculations in regard to the stock-carrying capacity of Australia. IE was on the figures, for that year that they were trying to show that although Australia suffered a serious drought in 1914, it had made good since owing to the intervening good seasons. According to Knibbs there were in 1911, in the four States dealt ""with by the Commission, 10,298,000 cattle, and in 1917, 8,995,000 cattle, or a reduction of 1,303,000. Of sheep there were in 1911, 85,000,000, and in 1917, 69,000,000, showing a decrease of 16,000,000 sheep. Is it fair in'those circumstances for the Commission to base its arguments on the figures for 1913? As an instance of how unpractical the members of the Commission are, they reported that in three States the limit of safe grazing has now practically been reached. I never heard of a more foolish statement on the part of men who had made a careful inquiry into an industry. They overlook the fact that as there has been a big reduction in the area of land under cultihas vation, the country must naturally able to carry more sheep. But what astonished me was the recommendation, on page 54, "" that no action seems sary in regard to retail prices which, evidence shows, will conform to wholeacted sale prices."" Apparently, the only prices to be fixed are those of the producer's stock, and the proposal to fix - the live weight on the hoof is so preposterous it is no wonderthe Government rejected it. I urge the Government to take treme carein regard to any action they may propose. If they intend to fix prices they must be the'retail prices the shops. I do not see how the problem can be tackled in any other way, and even then there will be difficulties, cause all customers will demand a prime joint, and if they are asked to pay than the fixed price, they will say that the meat is not prime. The difficulty will be to say which meat is prime and which is not. * Some time ago the Government decided to allow the producers to appoint a representative on the Central Wheat Board. Mr Giles, of South Australia, was elected by the farmers of the Commonwealth as their representative. He has attended the meetings of the Board, and ""has certain statements at Ouyen and other places in regard to the work of that body. According to a speech made in this House . by the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Catts) Mr Giles said that £45,000 had been paid in chartering fees on ships owned and commandeered by the Governlication. ment; that wheat was being sold for 10s. 6d. per bushel in California;, that the Wheat Pool. Mr Hughes was applying the profit made on wheat to the credit of the Commonis wealth ships in order to were making a success, paying for themselves in a year, and that this money was coming out of the farmer's profits; that the Government were disloyal taking wheat from the farmer at 4s. per bushel and selling it at'10s. 6d. further statement was made by him to and to others that in the early stages the war, and prior to the formation of the Central Board 1,000,000 tons of shipthree ping was offered to the Government at very low rate-75s. , I think-and was refused. According to the honourable memPrime ber for Cook these statements have been censored, but the Hansard report of them been distributed throughout the counbe try, and the enemies of the Government, most and the farmers themselves, who do not know what has been happening necesin connection with the Wheat Board, have the a feeling that the Government have not fairly towards them. I say they should be treated fairly. I know something of the working of the Board, and I believe it has been actuated, by a teen that desire to get for the farmers the best possible price for their wheat. I know exnothing as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statements made by Mr Giles rer' any garding Commonwealth ships, but in in order not to encourage suspicion, the sooner the Government allows Mr Giles' statements to be made public the better. beThen if he is proved to have made untruthful statements he can be punished. more I asked the Acting Prime Minister to promise that Mr Giles will be given that opportunity, but he very properly asked for time to consider the matter. I advise the Government now to let Mr Giles make his allegations, and they can he contradicted if they are untrue.",74
319,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Why allow him to make statements which, if made by anybody else, would lead to a prosecution?",75
320,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Mr Giles is the made farmers' representative on the Wheat Board, and he has equal authority on that body with the Minister for Agriculture in each of the States interested. Having, as a member of the Board, obtained certain information, he made a public statement to which the censor has refused pubThere should be nothing to hide in connection with the administration of",75
321,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The assumption that the statements were censored for show that they military reasons.,75
322,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"If there he any reasons of that kind, I shall withdraw my objections, but if only the work of the in Board is in question, I cannot see why 9d. the Government should not allow Mr. A Giles to make his charges. There cannot mo be any military considerations in this of case. If I had anything to do with the administration of the Pool, I should create Boards instead of two. There should a be one Board consisting of the Premier of - each of the producing States, with the Minister, and it should deal solely with financial matters. There should be a central Board, upon which not only the States would be represented, but also the producers to a greater extent than at the present time. . Then there should be another Board in .each State to control the handling and shipment of wheat. There are a number of other matters upon which I desired to speak, but I have promised to make my remarks as brief as possible. Probably the Estimates will be passed to-night, and they include provision for some very large public works. There is page after page of details in re. gard to wages and other small amounts, but at the end of the Estimates we find one item for £200,000 in connection with the Naval and Defence Departments, and not the slightest information is given to the Committee as to how the money is to be expended. Then there is to be a large expenditure in connection with the building of an arsenal. By the time the arsenal has heen completed, and provision has been made for the employees, it will cost the country something like £3,000,000 to £4,000,000. The township alone will cost from £1,750,000 to £2,000,000. The arsenal is to be established on a site near Canberra, a magnificent spot for a monastery, but, to my mind, not at all suitable for an undertaking of this sort. A further objection is that we shall be creating a second Broken Hill on the steps of the Federal Parliament House. I should like to know whether we are to come to a decision on that item to-night, because I fear that, if we pass the item on the Estimates, this House will be definitely, committed to the scheme.",75
323,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,We should have an assurance that nothing will be done until Parliament meets again.,76
324,Mr GREGORY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Because of the promise I have made, I shall not further prolong my'Temarks; but I hope that in considering the fixation of meat prices, the Government will take all possible care not to injure to any greater extent than is necessary, the great industry that has done so much to produce Australia's wealth.",76
325,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Wentworth) [8.44] About two years ago my attention was directed to the lack of appreciation on the part of the Navy Department of the necessity for some cheaper form of coastal reconnaisance than that which might have been thought to suffice some twenty years ago. I found in port a number of small armed vessels, some of which were built in the early* nineties, and all of which are of no military value atall today, but were-carrying crews, at great expense to the Australian taxpayer, and making believe that they were doing valuable war service on coastal reconnaisance. My mind was naturally directed into the channel to which any honourable member would turn , in such circumstances. I asked why the work of coastal reconnaisance could not be done in the same way as in every other country of the world, namely, by aeroplanes ? I was told in the first place that the difficulty of procuring aeroplanes was insurmountable. Subsequently I found that that was mainly an excuse, and that there were plenty of aeroplanes everywhere except in - Australia, where a few were needed for this purpose. I then approached the Navy Office and found there was a gentleman of wide military experience in this branch* who already had been urging upon the Department the necessity for taking steps now while the war was on to acquire the information necessary to enable our returning military flyers to be converted into the type of flyers required for naval reconnaisance. This gentleman had been active and energetic in pressing his views, even offering to sacrifice himself individually for the good of the Department. He door- had received no encouragement whatever. After I had pressed the .point for a few months I began to realise that the central administration of the Navy Office was against any reform in this direction. As with almost everything else in that office, the whole of its energy was devoted to keeping out new forces and new activities.",76
326,Mr FINLAYSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,That energy is not devoted to keeping out new men from overseas.,76
327,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am dealing not with a special officer, recently imported, who is a very gallant gentleman with a distinguished naval career, but with this question as it has come to me. _ I very soon began to find that the Minister who was then in charge of the Navy was allowing the Central Administration to remain in charge of itself.",76
328,Mr JOWETT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,What about the present Minister?,76
329,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"There are various kinds of Ministers. There are Ministers who slave in their Departments; there are Ministers who supervise their Departments. I am afraid that my personal friend the Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook), so far as I can ascertain his administration from my own experience, is a gentleman who neither slaved nor supervised, but slept in his Department. I could get nothing done. To show the stubborn and stupid resistance of the Central Head-Quarters to this proposed step- a step absolutely necessary unless the whole of the experience of our military fliers is to be wasted, since they will all grow stale and get off the job unless we keep them together- I may say that when I suggested to the Minister for the Navy (Mr . Joseph Cook) that he should call for applications from all returned aviators, select the best and attach them to the Royal Naval A i r Service, to get this information, the proposal was turned down. I find that an actual offer from the gentleman to whom I have referred-and who was the first to approach the Minister-to go, at his own expense, to England and find out for the Department some of the things that would be useful to them, was rejected. That offer was actually turned down, and turned down in a way that could hardly have been encouraging to the gentleman who made it . It may be said by honourable' members that perhaps this gentleman had no experience. I have here a copy of a letter he wrote to the Department on 3rd September last. I shall not wearv honourable members by reading the whole of it , but in order to show them the experience of this man, who was willing to make these inquiries for nothing, and whose offer was ignominiously turned down, I shall quote the following from itI graduated in England in the military wing of the Air Service, gaining my certificate on the 31st March, 1916. I was about five months on active service on the Egyptian front, and some three months mainly employed flying new machines across to France. ' I have flown all types of machines, and have carried out work on active service in all branches, namely, lery co-operation with field batteries and monitors, bombing raids, reconnaissances, night flying and photography. I have also been employed test-flying new machines and old ones which required adjustment before being taken on service. I have been mentioned in despatches for ray work in the field, and have also done work as instructor in advance flying and lecturer on engines, and the care and maintenance of machines. I have also been through a course or scries of examinations at the University of London, by which I am qualified as Inspector in the Aeronautical Inspection Department. This Department inspects all materials used in the construction of aircraft and engines, both before, during, and after con_ struction. He then went on to deal with his in debtedness to private firms who had provided certain facilities and so on, and concluded by telling the Minister who has asked for this informationI may say that Captain Thring, R.N., has a copy of my certificates, but I would be happy to forward the originals should you so desire. He then proceeded to set out the matters which the Navy Office might, in his opinion, care to know about. He wrote- 1. The training necessary to convert military aviators into efficient Naval airmen. 2. General organization and administration of Royal Naval Air Service. 3. Most efficient methods of equipping and maintaining Naval Air Stations (bases) and Outpost 'Stations (detached squadrons or flights). 4. The most suitable types of machines for different classes of work, dirigibles and observation balloons, in addition to heavier than 'air machines. 5. Latest and most efficient methods of manufacture and construction. He offered to do this for nothing, but has received no satisfaction from that day to this. He has not even had an expression of regret that so handsome an offer could not be accepted. I mention this merely f o prove the stubbornness of the Navy Department. What I urged at the time was that we should start to get ready to establish and organize a coastal aerial reconnaissance. I was not so much concerned then, nor am I now, as to the establishment of the naval air service for use with our naval unit, since our naval unit is dispersed to the ends of the earth, and will be u n t i l after the war. My chief concern is that there shall be no waste of the experience of out military aviators, and of the enthusiasm, engendered by the training they have received. A fte r a good deal of trouble, I threatened in a letter to the Navy Office to move to reartil- duce, their Estimates. That was a long time ago. Since then there has been a succession of political troubles, and this was so essentially a non-party proposition that I did not want its consideration to be in any way tainted with the party feeling which existed in this chamber about that time. I consequently desisted. But I find now that unless some pretty straight talking is indulged in here it is practically certain that the first plank in the Government's platform-the policy of preference to returned men-is going to be thrown over, by this Department, so that I feel it necessary to speak. I have no word to say against the very distinguished and excellent gentleman who has been imported by the Navy Office-no t to carry out any policy arrived at by the Government before he was asked to come here, but mainly and solely, I believe, to defend the Minister against myself, in our mutual correspondence and interviews. This gentle-man will almost certainly ""have the keenness of his branch of the profession to establish an efficient flying adjunct to the Australian Naval ""Unit. ' But I do not see in the Department's attitude the slightest sign thati t proposes to do much to organize our returned military aviators for the work of coastal reconnaissance. Further than that, I should like to say that the Department appears to be blindly unaware that unless it gets the whole control of aviation in"" Australia it is only going to do what this House has declared against over and over again; in other words, it will simply effect a duplication ""of Departments. We have had to compel the Navy Department to give up the policy of having its own separate works branch. There was a ridiculous system by which it kept a works manager and a whole host of men under him. The dividing line between' these - men and those employed in the Works Department was that the moment the water level was reached, in came the Navy works men to work underneath. As soon as they got above water level, - the Works Department came in and finished the job!  ranged that a conference shall take placebetween both branches of the service before anything definite Ts decided in regard to construction so as to prevent the very thing that the honourable member is talking about.",76
330,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,In regard to aviation? ,78
331,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am glad to hear it. May I say that I am also edad that my  ministering this Department. I wish to assure him that no word that I am uttering now is intended to Teflect upon him. He is new to the Department, and I am making no charges or suggestions against him. The works branch of the Navy Office has been abolished, but under the beneficent and slumberous influences of my old friend the Minister for the Navy, what has happened ? No sooner was the Works Department abolished than a super-spy staff- a new anti-spy Department-wa s established in the Navy Office. We thus have two sets of sedition and enemy hunters, both travelling over the same ground, both getting in each other's way, no doubt, and",78
332,Mr HECTOH LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,And both capturing each other ?,78
333,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"No doubt. All this is being done for the prestige of each Department! That service should be under the one roof. Both branches of aviation should also be under the one roof. No question of an excess of esprit - de corps as between either branch should stand in the way of common efficiency. It is c here that a' difficulty occurs. A navy aviator will sometimes say, "" A military aviator is no good so far as our work is concerned; he has not had to do the things we have to do."" And you will sometimes hear a military aviator say, "" The navy aviators have a very easy time of it. They never have to do what we have to do."" In England, in order to stop the mischievous operation of this service jealousy a new authority has' been created, and both branches have been put under that one authority. The service here is not big enough to warrant the creation of a Ministerial Department to handle it . but it is most important that we should wipe out this jealousy and bring the two branches under the one roof. I do not hesitate to say that the Navy Office ought to control this service. It must realise, however, that it has a twofold duty-no t only the duty of making its sea-going naval unit efficient by the addition of aerial observation; but the duty of seeing that a coastal reconnaissance around Australia is carried on as well. Mr FINI/AYSON - It was understood - when the Flying School was established at Point Cook that it would provide for both branches of the service.",78
334,Mr KELLY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Yes , but it was placed under the control of the military branch of the service at the time. The Point Cook school has had a very poor chance since the war. It is admitted that it is not a final school for aviation training, but merely a preliminary school, where a man who wants to fly may obtain his cadetship, and thereafter graduate, if he is fit, through the Royal Flying Corps.",78

I am simply dealing with the common-sense side of the question, which, I think, will appeal to honourable members. It is saddening. for a member of House to find that, after four years of war, the Navy Office is carrying out coastal reconnaissance with old vessels such as the Qayundah, which could not catch anything if she wanted to, and could not escape anything that wanted to catch her.

I have no experience of the technicalities of these questions, but I think that a vessel to used for such purposes must be of such type that she can catch any ship that she wants to catch, so that she may find out what she wants to find out. The Navy Office is composed, I think, of gentlemen who have directed their own policy. It is largely the fault of my old friend, the Minister for Navy, that that situation has arisen. cannot be too careful and too insistent parliamentary government that the lines of policy which a Department is to follow shall be laid down by its Ministers, and a Minister cannot watch too carefully see that - his Department follows that policy. There is one great predominathave ing policy throughout Australia, and that is preference to returned men. Here we have in the Navy Department a definite chance of giving preference in a case where the men to whom that preference would be given are better qualified than are outsiders. If we do not give them that preference now, what faith will any one in Australia have in the policy? It must be done, and I strongly urge the  I - ton) to take a firm grip of the situation, to see that this right thing is done I shall only say a few words more in regard to this problem of aviation, and I direct my remarks now to my honourable friend the Assistant Minister for Defence this (Mr Wise). We have coming back to Australia a regular staff office organizaits tion to handle the problem of military aviation in Australia. The gentleman in charge of that staff is Colonel Reynolds. He is a very excellent oflicer, against whom I have not a word to.say but that he is not an aviator-that he has not graduated through the ranks of knowledge of branch of the profession. We cannot secure that enthusiasm which we ought io have in so highly technical an arm unless have the men composing it know that there is to be no favouritism in determining who shall be at the head of it. Every man know that he will be able in time to reach the top, and that a man is not ' merely to be put over them without knowing their troubles and the difficulties with which they have to contend. They ought to know that the man who controls them for is experienced as they are experienced, has served as they have served, and has' suffered the same hardships and ditficulties. If after this gentleman returns the be matter is gone into thoroughly, I hope he a will be transferred to a sphere of usefulness, where his qualities will enable him to give better service to the country. Do not keep a man who knows nothing of avjation in charge of the Aviation Service on the Military side.. I am grateful . to honourable members for listening to the this small advanced statement. I have We for a long time had this trouble within in me, and I regret very deeply to have to make this statement in the absence of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Cook). My only satisfaction is that that honourable to gentleman knew I was going to make such a statement. Had time allowed I should quoted from correspondence to show that I have exhausted every means to make the Minister control his own Department. Having failed in that, my surprise may be imagined when I found that he had omitted to let his successor, the Acting  ahout our differences on the subject. For that reason no one must entertain other than a feeling of generous and sympathetic hope that the Acting Minister-will rise to the occasion, and avoid anything that may militate against the efficiency of that common scheme of Australian coastal reconnaissance that I have all along desired to see established.",79
343,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Maribyrnong) [9.2] The honourable member who has just spoken, like others, finds himself in the unfortunate position of not being able to devote sufficient time to the discussion topics of public importance. I regret very much that that honourable member did not explode on the particular question to which he has referred long ago, because it is necessary to ventilate one's opinions very vigorously here before reform can be brought about in some of our Departments; and I can only hope that his words to-night will have due effect. I am glad to notice that some honourable members opposite are prepared to take the stand that might naturally have heen expected of them, in days gone by at any rate, and that they do not support those who are endeavouring to depreciate the efforts of the Ministry to fix the price of meat. Not only in respect to meat, but in regard to all commodities, it will be absolutely essential, for the Government to take some action to protect the people of the country against those who continue to fleece the public. It is no argument to tell the people df a country overflowing with the gifts of Providence that food is cheaper here than in other parts of the world. With our great supplies we ought to be able to distribute the necessaries of life at prices that are fair and reasonable to producer and consumer alike. The remarks of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner), and others, recall to my mind the bitter complaint uttered"" by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at Bendigo only a few months ago. I do not know whether at that time there was any engineering going on, or what influence was at work, but it is rarely we find gentlemen of the calibre of the Prime Minister speaking so vigorously of those who support him. He declared that he would not be dominated by rich men, or by the Conservative element in the National party-that if he had to be dominated he would go back to those with whom most of his political life had been spent. There was evidently some special meaning in those words. So far back as last October, the Government had in their possession the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission regarding the price of meat, and I wonder whether the Prime Minister was thinking of those recommendations when he spoke of ""domination."" It is my hope that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), and the Government generally, will not allow of themselves to be dominated by the rich people of the country. I am out to-night to do a little special pleading on behalf of a long-suffering community.

If we wish to fix both wholesale and retail prices let us do so, but there must be some amendment to the present system. The Queensland Government has adopted a method of entering into business themselves. . I am glad that the Commonwealth has now a number of Government factories, because the experts in those factories will be able to determine what ought to be charged by those who conduct private establishments of a similar kind. We were told last night that a standard military suit can be turned out at the Government factories for 30s., and I know that the establish;ment of these factories had a material influence on the prices charged by private manufacturers, who, earlier in the war, were supplying the Government with uniforms. In this connection, I should l it e to quote from The Soldier, the official organ of the men, of 24th May, as follows: Therefore they (the Queensland Government) have purchased five large holdings, carrying 108,500 head of cattle and 3,000 horses, the purchase price aggregating £688,460, and being paid principally in Government debentures. The ultimate object of the Government is to establish - a chain of stations extending from the far north to the New South Wales border, and in close proximity to the various railway termini. With fattening depdts further west the Government will then be in a position to supply the needs of its ever lengthening chain of State butchers' shops. Last night we heard something about producers withholding cattle from sales, and. this article goes onCattle were being withheld from the market, when and the retail butcher and the general public' ket; the were the sufferers. The Government promptly drafted two batches of cattle, totalling head, into the Enoggera sale-yards, and prices came down with a run. Of course those who have cattle to do not like to hear of prices coming down with a run, but in normal times, withproper organization, there is no reason why a regular price should not obtainable every week in the markets, and price. ' the public enabled to obtain meat reasonable prices.",80
347,Mr BAYLEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Do you know that Queensland Government obtained 50ssidered per 100 lbs. at Enoggera sale-yards, and at the same time compelled the meat companies'to sell meat to them at 32s. per 100 lbs. ?",81
348,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I am merely quoting from a newspaperarticle, and if my i formation is wrong the honourable member will be able to contradict it , and dispose of my argument. At present am speaking on behalf - of producers as well as consumers, and contending in the interests of both there should be better organization of the industry. ever, let me further quoteAccording to the weekly reports of the bane Stock and Produce Agents' Association, roast beef, &c - in Melbourne. the average prices ruling at Enoggera the two weeks prior to the arrival of the State cattle, and during the two weeks in which these cattle were sold, were as follow :3rd October - Bee f sold at from 58s. per 100 lbs. 10th October - Bee f Bold at 60s. 100 lbs. Then came the d r a f t of bullocks from the Queensland Government stations17th October - Bee f sold at 52s. 6d. per 100 lbs. 24th October - Bee f sold at from 45s. to 50s. per 100 lbs. Thus on 17th and 24th October, there were phenomenal decreases in the price of cattle at Enoggera in consequence of the stock in the market i being augmented by drafts from the State stations. . Perhaps the argument will come with more force when it is shown that the drop in the price of cattle due to the sale of the Government stock, works out at an average of £3 6s. Od. per bullock-for the price of a 700 lbs. animal on the dates already mentioned worked out as follows:' "" £ a. d. 3rd October .. 20 13 0 10th October .. .. 21 0 0 17th October .. 18 7 6 24th October .. .. .. 16 12 6 Thus in two weeks before the State bullocks were sold the average price of a 700-lbs. bullock was £20 16s. 9d., whilst in the two weeks the Government cattle were in the maraverage price was £17 10s. 250 That is one method of enabling people the to obtain meat at cheaper rates. However honourable members may criticise sell the Queensland Government's method, they will not deny that the operations of that Government in the live stock market and in their butchers' shops has resulted be in keeping meat at a fair and regular When in Western Australia, at some three months ago, I was informed by an experienced grazier that in the the Perth market £ 1 6 per head was cona satisfactory price for a 7004b. bullock, and the present "" National "" Government of the State is offering 2 | d . 6d. per l b . for meat at Wyndham. Making a liberal allowance for the freight from Wyndham to Perth, that price will enable the consumers of Perth to obtain n - meat much more cheaply than it can be bought in Melbourne. The graziers and thus, others in Western Australia are in no I better position for supplying the consumers of the State than are our graziers. that I inspected the meat in a number of butchers' shops in Perth, and tasted it at Howmy hotel. I found that it was excellent in quality, and from 2d. to 3d. per lbBrischeaper thansimilar cuts-chops , steaks, The during Scaddan Government was criticised adversely for entering into the meat trade and taking control of slaughtering estabto 60s. lishments and butchers' shops, but its action has kept the price of cattle within per moderate bounds, - and has given the people "" of . Western Australia cheaper meat. While its balance-sheets may have been unsatisfactory, the people of the State have benefited by its policy, and the "" National "" Government that has succeeded it has not dared to alter any of its regulations in regard to the supply of meat. The honourable member for Dampier referred to the proposal to construct an arsenal. I trust that the Government will proceed with that work as soon as possible. I am not particularly concerned about the site, but as we have land at Tuggeranong, near the Federal Capital site, we can make that asset very valuable by establishing a great arsenal there, with workmen properly housed and employed under proper conditions. One of the first activities of the arsenal should be the production of steel for ship building. Let us not run away with the idea that the engineering and steel works of the arsenal must be devoted exclusively to defence objects. Our navy and our mercantile marine will require repairs from time to time, and will have to be . supplemented. Therefore, altogether apart from defence, the Government will need large quantities of steel plates and other steel material. We have delayed too long in this matter. The Broken Hill Steel Works and the Lithgow Steel Works cannot supply us with all the steel that is . needed. To-day-probabl y because little railway construction is going on-w e can supply ourselves with all the rails that we need. But for other steel material we must establish more steel works. I trust, therefore, that for industrial as well as . for defence reasons the arsenal will be proceeded with. The manufacture of woollen materials of various kinds should prove of great value to Australia. Here wool is plentiful, and of good quality. We are now spending millions of pounds in importing woollens, although we are the biggest, pro-, ducers of wool. Were we to manufacture wool in all branches of the trade we would be able to give employment to thousands of persons, and would increase our revenue by millions of pounds. The cement industry is the third big industry that should prove of great value to us, and, of course, there are many more. Therefore I urge the Government, even at the present time when every penny counts, to' establish' works which will Mr Ffinton. afford employment for our people, and for the soldiers who are soon to return to us. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) says that Parliament is to meet again in August for a financial session. Such promises made on the eve of an adjournment are rarely kept, and we may not meet until September, just in time to pass Supply for the payment of the public servants.",81

350,Mr FENTON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I hope that that will be prevented; but something must be done to make the people contented. The Treasurer in his statement on the finances gave us a sugar-coated pill, and left out of account the municipal and private borrowing of Australia. In about twelve months' time the loan money on which interest will have to be paid will be no less - than £800,000,000, and within the next six .years State debts amounting to £78,000,000 will have matured. To renew these loans we shall have to borrow at 6, instead of at 3 and 3^ per cent., and this will greatly increase our interest bill. To meet these heavy obligations we must increase our primary and secondary production, and only by the establishment of industries can we do this.",82
351,Mr MACKAY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Lilley) [9.25] - The Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) may congratulate himself on the fact that members have agreed"" to curtail their criticism of the Estimates. No doubt, he is a hard working man, and is satisfied .with the administration of his Department, but .very few other persons in Australia are satisfied with it. The other day it was published in the newspapers that a man had just enlisted in Victoria who had heard of the war only quite recently. No doubt, the administration of the Postal Department was largely responsible for his ignorance. I protest strongly against the way in which the country services of my electorate have been treated, and the same criticism applies to the treatment of the country services throughout Queensland and in the other States. I have brought this matter .before the Deputy Postmaster-General at Brisbane, a man well fitted for his position, against whom I have no complaint. He has done his best with the limited amount of money at his. disposal, but I blame the Postmaster General for cutting down country postal services to make the departmental expenditure balance its revenue. It is almost impossible to obtain telephone lines in outside places. The people of one small locality were compelled, not only to find the posts and to dig the holes for them, but also to make a cash contribution in order to obtain a telephone line of a few miles in length. In the interests of those who, at great inconvenience, have gone out into the country, the Postal Department should do what it can to extend the means of communication. The Departments usefulness should be judged by the measure of the conveniences it affords to the people. It would be a very nice thing if the Department could be made a paying concern; but in the present state of our development the Government should aim rather at conveniencing . the people than at making revenue by its operations. Liberal advantages should be given to those in the country districts.",82

356,Mr MACKAY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I should be glad if the Postmaster-General would cease looking for surpluses, and would give us more advantages. The Australian Year-Booh for 1916 show3 the drift of population from the country to our capital cities. The population of Sydney is 40.3S per cent, of the population of New South Wales; the population of Melbourne 47.11 of that of Viotoria; while, in comparison with the population of the States of which they are the respective capitals, Brisbane has a population of 22.76, Adelaide a population of 46.10, Perth a papulation of 37.89, and Hobart a population of 19.86. Copenhagen has a population which is only 20 per cent, of the population of Denmark, and of nineteen other, capitals that are mentioned, only three have a population equal to 10 per cent, of [223] that of the country in which they are situated. There are many reasons for the drift of population to the cities, but the lack of conveniences is a great cause in this country. The Postmaster-General can do something to rectify this state of affairs. He should strongly represent to the Government the need for advancing more money for the development of the means of communication in the country districts. An amount which appears upon the Estimates for the erection of a post-office at Caboolture has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and myself, but nothing has been done in connection with the building.",83

The Department should either find the postmaster another house in which to live or spend the money provided .on the Estimates for the purpose for which it is intended. It is quite evident that the official who recommended the expenditure was convinced of the unsuitability of the present building. I have used every endeavour to get the Deputy Postmaster-General to make a start with the work, but he says that the fault lies with the Central Office, and . when I have approached the Postmaster General he says that he is acting on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster General. I propose to put the correspondence bearing the Minister's signature in Hansard, so that the people in my electorate will be able to judge the real position for themselves.",83

The Deputy Postmaster-General adds that until a more reasonable tender is obtained, he cannot recommend that this work be proceeded with. Yours faithfully, WILLIAM WEBSTEB.

That is how the Government are going to work to bring about a kindly feelingin the community. No cause or party has ever lasted for any length of time by persecuting its opponents, and honourable gentlemen opposite cannot hope to hold the respect of any portion of the community if they continue to follow the line of downing all those who disagree with, them politically. Is it a crime to differ from the opinions of those who hold opposite views to ours ? The anti-conscription party in the recent referendum fight won by a fair vote. Surely, in a 'community like ours, Democracy should be allowed some 'method of showing to the world the great victory it gained over the other section of the community who sought to impose something on them which they deemed hideous. So-called patriots hold patriotic gatherings and wave flags and shout and howl "" God Save the King "" as if it were a proof of their patriotism, but when other ""persons attempt to show strong feelings in regard to their political views they bring down anathemas galore on their heads, and they are suppressed at every opportunity. Not far from Maldon the anti-copscriptionists decided to erect, a monument to commemorate the great victory of Democracy when conscription was defeated. I can quite understand the local people having a difference of opinion on the subject, and some of them considering the monument an eyesore, but one of the recruiting parties sent out by the Government deliberately demolished the monument. was rebuilt. Then another party left Daylesford at 6.30 one niight in two motor cars, one owned and driven by a man named Murphy, a hay and corn dealer, and the other by Mr Cox, who is a squatter, or cockie-on e of the big bugs of the district. With them in the car were six soldiers, named Trickett, Graff, Jenkins, Fraser, Gregory, and Paxton. They held forth in Maldon, but found that, because of the peculiar action [223]- 2 of the previous recruiting party, the enthusiasm of the young men had fallen off. They were so enraged at the failure of their efforts that they decided to again destroy the monument, and, I believe, that they stole the dynamite with which they blew it up. If this had been a monument in connection with the victory of the conscription party, and the anti-conscriptionists had dared to demolish it, they would be ih gaol, like the Industrial Workers of the World men in Sydney, and serving sentences of fifteen years. Practices of this sort should not be allowed to continue.

They thought they were doing right, but afterwards it was admitted that they had committed an act of vandalism in destroying something that was of historic value. Although the British were fighting against the Khalifa they were not justified in destroying the* tomb of. the Mahdi.

According to a letter I have received from Ballara,'the one baker in the district compels his customers to pay 8d. per loaf over the counter, although the fixed price for the district is 7id. It is the duty of the Government to see that traders do not evade the law, and that one section of the community is not penalized because of living in a district which is not under close Government supervision. I admit there are bakers who suffer certain disadvantages, but if one man may break the law, all may do so. Prior to Government intervention to make illegal, the increase which had been made in the price of tobacco, the combine was giving to the retailers a discount of 2 | per eent. and a rebate of 3d. per lb. But the moment the Government interfered, the combine got even with the retailers by discontinuing the rebate. Everybody knows that in tobacco retailing there is a very small margin of profit, pair, but the combine have been allowed to flout - the Government regulation by .depriving the retailers of the 3d. jjer lb. which they used to get by way of rebate. Owing to the high cost of living, it is the duty of the Government to fix prices according to the cost of production, and then take steps to insure that no section of the community is imposed upon by another. A few evenings ago we had the laughable spectacle of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) condemning the attitude of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) upon the meat question, and urging those who, like himself, represented working-class constituencies, to show their objections to the policy of those who were adverse to the fixation of meat prices. But, after the honourable member had given expression to his opinion, we heard no more from him, or from any o'ther member on the Government side, although they well knew that a section of the community are making fortunes, to the disadvantage of all other sections, and that no attempt is being made by the Government to prevent this sort of thing. The public have to suffer, and they deserve all they get, ing regard to their political madness the 5th of May of last year, when returned the present Government to system to go on. power. It would not be so bad if only those who voted for the Government and their supporters suffered under this of profiteering, but, unfortunately, those who did not do so have to suffer with political criminals who did. I suppose, thing. however, it is useless for me to discuss further the question of prices, since Government are not likely to do anything to bring about better conditions people. I should like to say a few words regard to the Defence Department and the Department of the Navy. The Cabibut/ net, I believe, decided that these Departsomething ments should be treated differently from all other branches of - the Public Service, in that works required iby them should come within the purview of the Public ""Works Committee. They have only say that a certain work shall be carried out and it must be carried out. There no one to criticise their proposals. Government apparently are afraid to take the proper course to admit of that critiI cism, and having regard to the dignity played by some of the naval and military officers when before the Public Works Committee, I can well understand their attitude. One naval officer, when Committee dared to question him' as the advisableness of carrying out a work proposed by his Department, seemed think that it would be little short of lege to touch a brick or a plank that the Navy Department had decided to place a certain position. Of all branches of the Public Service, the Naval and Military Departments are most in need of supervision. Even honinto orable members opposite admit that that so. From time to time we read in the newspapers of works and utilities trolled by these Departments in a way that is hy no means creditable to those responsible for them. They may be very good naval and military men, but they are bad business men, and they are ""down ""'at once on any experienced pubselected. lic servant', possessing business knowledge, who attempts to point out what they ought to do. The toleration of this sort of thing, under the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), might have been considered havcusable, but it is inexcusable for a Minon istry led by the honourable member for they Balaclava (Mr Watt) to allow such a",86

I should not have risen but for the speeches made by not the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) and the honourable member for to Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). Both have referred to a proposed work of great imis portance to this country-a n undertaking The that has been dangled before the eyes of the people for the last three or four years. want to hear from the Government, bedisfore this Appropriation Bill is passed, what they intend to do in regard to the establishment of an arsenal. When Mr. Fisher was Prime Minister, in 1915, the he proposed to refer to the Public Works to Committee for inquiry and report the suggested duplication of the Small Arms .to Factory at Lithgow. I then urged that sacrithe Committee should also be requested to report as to the best site in Australia in for such a factory, and, after a little trouble, I induced the right honourable gentleman to agree to my proposition. The Public Works Committee made inquiry, and enlarged the scope of its investigation the determination of the best site, is not merely for a small arms factory, but for an arsenal. Subsequently a Special conCommission was appointed, some members of which were even sent to India to inquire and report as to the main essentials of an arsenal. The Commission and the Committee reported, and three sites, all within the Federal territory, were These are known as sites No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, the last being better known as the Tuggeranong' site. At one time the Government appeared to desire to get away from the recommendations, exbut I obtained a promise some time ago that the site of the arsenal should not be determined until Parliament had had an opportunity to voice its opinion. Some time has since elapsed, but nothing has been done. In 1915 it was said, "" Why talk of establishing an arsenal now that we are at war?"" Had we made a start then we should have been able by now to construct both large and small guns, and to provide many essentials-to the conduct of this great war. The Special Commission made most exhaustive inquiries, and a remarkable feature of the whole matter is that it. has visited the Tuggeranong again and again as if there were a desire on the part of some one to reject it in favour of some other site. In every instance, however, it has reported in its favour. After inspecting suggested sites at Lyndhurst, Bathurst, Albury, Cootamundra, Lithgow, Yass, and other centres, it has come to the conclusion that while some of them are fairly good, none is as satisfactory as the Tuggeranong site. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong has said to-night, Tuggeranong is within the Federal Territory. The surrounding country belongs to us, and by the establishment of an arsenal there a large area of land which the Government resumed at a cost of £5 per acre would enormously appreciate in value. An arsenal in full swing would involve the employment of 4,000 or 5,000 men. That would mean a population of 20,000 or 25,000 in the arsenal town, so that by accepting the recommendation of the Committee and establishing the arsenal at Tuggeranong the Government would greatly 1 enhance the value of property which it has already purchased. I fail to understand why the Comniission has been sent round the country searching for something better than a site which the Commonwealth itself owns. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) said he was not particular regarding the site, neither am I as long as the best site is chosen.",87
375,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Oh !,88
376,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"A laugh from a Victorian representative! Victorian view, as far as I can gatherand I want to speak candidly-is that the Federal capital should not be built. The people of Victoria want this Parliament to continue to sit in Melbourne till the day of judgment. If the representatives of this State had to travel a thousand miles every week, as some of us have in order to attend to our Parliamentary duties, they would take a different view. I willingly admit that Victoria has treated us most hospitably. The State Government has given us the use of these fine buildings and has extended to us the most generous consideration, but Melbourne lacks the Federal atmosphere, and I invite my honourable friend who laughed to adopt the Federal, and not a merely parochial, view. Why should he be afraid to see the Governor General and the Commonwealth Departments, with the numersite ous public servants taken from Melbourne to the Federal Capital ? If Melbourne cannot afford to lose all these, then it should wither and die. Behind these genial laughs, on the part of representatives of Victoria, there is always a sinister desire to keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne. After seventeen years of Federation we are no nearer our permanent Federal home than we were at the outset. What is the use of spending over a million of money at the Federal Capital if the compact we made is not to be kept? The world today is engaged in a terrible war over the tearing up of "" a scrap of paper,"" and yet there are some honourable members who would tear up the agreement that was made with the people of New South Wales, with regard to the establishment of the capital in that State? The Commission estimates that the construction of an arsenal would involve a 1 first expenditure of £1,440,000, and that 1,200 employees would be at once taken oa in connection with the manufacture of arms* and munitions. A great industrial centre would in this way be established near the Federal Capital, where we have our own land and a railway running into the very centre of it. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) should say "" This site is within 10 miles of the capital; its selection would industrialize the capital."" How can he hope to establish a big capital city unless we The have there opportunities for employment. And where is there a better opportunity to find work for our returned soldiers than we should have by establishing them on Commonwealth lands? We have 600,000 acres of good land in the Federal Territory.",88
377,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,And not a reto do turned soldier yet settled on it.,88
378,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Quite so. The Minister for Home and Territories { Mr Glynn) cannot make up his mind as regards afforestation there. "" Many .returned men could be employed in planting trees in the Territory, and in the off season they could work their own land, and make their own homes. ings of 10,000 acres in the Federal Territory have heen leased to constituents of mine, and the sound of sheep and cattle bells is heard where school bells should be ringing. Instead of only flocks of sheep we should have troops of happy children there. In Canberra there is some of the best agricultural land in New South ""Wales. I have travelled over scores of old farms in the Territory where men have made a good living on 200 or 300 acres The old homesteads are'still there, and it is time that we re-established them. It is true that Canberra is over 2,000 feet above sea-level, but the climate is invigorating, and it would do some indolent Victorians good to visit such a district. What do - the Government propose to do in the way of preliminary works at the arsenal ? Amongst others there are a railway to cost about £90,000, water supply to the arsenal to cost about £25,000, the construction of the town £650,000, and all these would give employment of a reproductive character to thousands of men in a good climate. We cannot establish a capital unless we have plenty of work and men, which are the basis of success of any city. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), referred to the establishment of steel works there, but he forgot to mention that there is in the neighbourhood of T u g geranong one of the best ironstone deoosits in New South Wales. is also plenty of limestone for the manufacture of cement, and amongst the railways projected is one to Jervis Bay, which is one of those natural ports which will be established some day notwithstanding the opposition of the great cities. The curse of Australia is centralization; and why should not Jervis Bay, Portlaud, and Port Stephens be developed ? The present is the best opportunity we could possibly have for the establishment of the arsenal; and I should like to know from the Assistant Minister for Defence <"" Mr Wise), and the Acting Minister  the present have been giving us d ° i aud not words, when we are likely to have some work done. We are promised a financial session in eight or ten weeks' time, though I hope it will be twelve, for 1 do not clamour for a short recess when I desire a spell, and, in any case, an opportunity should be afforded us to do the Hold- best we can for recruiting. I suggest that the Postmaster-General should ask the Government for a grant of, perhaps, £250,000 in order to provide proper postal facilities for our pioneers of civilization in the back country. I do not join in the cry against the Postmaster General, because I have held that office myself, and know its difficulties; but there are other honourable members wlio, like myself, are dissatisfied with the whole administration of the Department; in fact, some of the administration is absolutely rotten, though I do not blame the Postmaster-General particularly. If the Government do not hearken ""to the voice of reason in this connection there is a majority on this side who are dissatisfied, and may send them where other Governments have been sent. I am only pointing out what might be done, and in what I am prepared to take a hand myself; my only fear is that if we did put this Government out we might get a worse onefrom the other side. New members of the House may think they are doing a great thing in obtaining postal facilities for various districts, but really that does not count for very much beyond giving a feeling of satisfaction that, one is helping those who require help. Before the Appropriation Bill is passed I should like to know what the Govern: ment propose to do in the matter of the arsenal. The whole business has been There strung on for two years, and it is time we got to work making our own guns and ammunitions.",89
379,Mr BAMFORD,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Do you not think it is equally important to get the men to use the guns and ammunition when they are made.,89
380,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"What better repatriation could you have than setting the returned' soldiers to work of the kind? It is infinitely better than keeping them hanging about the big cities, and giving them a distaste for country life: The curse of centralization is even creeping into the repatriation scheme; though I must say that if we had all done as much for this scheme as has the honn J orable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) our returned Soldiers would be happy men today. Our great idea should be to make these men robust citidropped zens in the bush where they can carve their own way to success. I have some figures Here which show that near Canis berra there are about 600,000 acres, thirds of which, in the opinion of men the district who know, is fit for cultivato tion, while the other third is suitable forestry. This latter area would carry about 600 pine trees to the acre, and ready 500,000 from the Canberra Nursery have been planted in the Territory, at present are doing well, presenting all the appearance of a green field of wheat. Millions of, trees ought to be planted within the Capital Territory, and would be a good commercial proposition. The Government may say they are handiport. capped for lack of money, but such trees would always be a good asset.",89
381,Mr GLYNN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"They would begin to be a good asset in ten years, and fully veloped in thirty years.",90
382,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"If they matter begin to reproduce in twelve years shall do well, and in the meantime they will give excellent employment to returned soldiers. What money do the Governcause ment propose to devote to afforestation",90
383,Mr GLYNN,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"They will devote as as they can. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Unles s into the Government are prepared to back the honourable gentleman in this work shall have to put a little ""ginger"" into our debates. I gathered from the Supply Bill that there is about £5,000 available for this work, but that is not of good. The best advice possible should obtained so that the right trees may - planted in the right place. As to the 400,000 acres or so of cultivable land, this might be devoted to the returned soldiers with some fixature of tenure, that they could make their homes ""and devote their attention to them in off season of planting. Is it proposed by Government to do anything in this directrue tion? If not, we may have to find another Government that will. Expert Minister reports on afforestation have been tained, and employment found at intervals for 150 men. But there is room there for 500 men. I have seen it recomcourage mended that we should experiment there with shrubs. The Commonwealth Gois vernment are finding money for the ployment of men in connection with State forestry operations. It is time that we that and did some practical work for ourselves. The idea prevails in this country thalHhe Federal Capital question only a plaything in politics, that there twois no intention of removing the Parliaof ment to the Capital. We may yet have make the question a party one, to be for fought to a ""finish on the floor of the House, though, of course, this is not the altime to press for big expenditure, and I recognise that. At Wagga, about two and months ago, a conference was held to - urge the construction of a railway from Yass to Canberra, through to Jervis Bay, the route of which has been surveyed.",90
384,Mr FALKTNER,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"To give us a new v Mr AUSTIN .CHAPMAN - The line would do that. It was realized, however, that in the present crisis all our expendediture should be devoted to the prosecution of the war, and consequently the is to be allowed to stand over for we a while. I cannot make up my mind to criticise very harshly to-night the adminis j tration of the Postmaster-General, beI - know the calls of the war. My ? district, however, has many postal grievmuch ances. The Government should make up their mind in regard to the Postal Department. Are our post offices to fall disrepair, the allowance offices to be up closed, and the telephone .lines_ to be we pulled down-whic h has happened in some places-o r is the position to be bravely faced? The Postmaster^General cannot make bricks without straw, and I am sure much that honourable members would support be him in asking the Treasurer for £500,000 be to pay for postal conveniences. I hope that he will do that, and that the matter will, be brought before us when we meet for the coming discussion of the finances. so Many of the Ministers represent country theredistricts. The honourable member for the Gippsland (Mr Wise) knows the want3 the of a large country district, and what is of Gippsland is true of other districts. The Postmaster-General is the only who is trying to make a surplus, obbut the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Spence) is really responsible for what surplus there is, because he had the to impose telephone rates that would make the telephone service pay. It easy to make a service pay if you cut emdown conveniences and increase charges. I appeal to the Government to give consideration to these matters during the recess. They are of great importance to the people in the, bush. I am not the only one who feels their importance, though many of the others will not speak during this debate. It is not pleasant to have to speak harshly to Ministers with whom I am on terms of good friendship, but something definite, must be done. I must insist also on a definite statement about the arsenal. Is it going to be established at the Federal Capital site, or are Ministers frightened of the bogy which the proposed establishment of an industrial centre within 10 miles of the Capital seems to have created? Personally, I think the bringing of a large industrial population near to the Capital should make it a success. It is three years last May since I succeeded in getting the matter referred to the Public Works Committee. We have now been in temporary residence in Melbourne for over seventeen years.",90

No Government will get any lengthy support from me which will not foster industry. Let us have ringing anvils and the smoking stacks of factories and foundries throughout the country, giving employment to our own people, instead of sending our raw material to be manufactured in other countries.",91

It costs three or four times as much, to use the telephone there as it does to use telephones much further out where more fortunate terms have been secured from the Postal Department. I wish to call attention to a few matters affecting our soldiers which should have immediate attention from Ministers. Our pensions law is not creditable to the Parliament that passed it, and we shall, not .have done our duty towards 'those who have fought for us until we have materially liberalisedits provisions. Many pensions of only 7s. 6d a week are being given, and still more of only 10s. a week. The Act is inelastic, so that fair administration to meet the varying conditions is impossible. The proposed recess is needed to enable Ministers to give a continuous consideration to these various problems, which is impossible when Parliament is in session, and I hope advantage will be taken of the opportunity to carefully review the treatment of returned men. In many cases dependants have been deprived of separation allowances and allotment money because the soldier at the Front has been punished for some infringement of military regulations abroad.",91
390,Mr CONSIDINE,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,And because of the bungling of the London office.,91
391,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I shall say something about that if I have the time. The matter to which I am now referring affects an immense number of innocent persons. Had their menfolk remained at home, pursuing their ordinary civil avocations, they would not have brought themselves within reach of the law. But when men who have been used to independence and freedom come suddenly under military discipline, such as that of the British Army, many of them: do things which, though not evil in themselves, Bring upon them punishment. It is quite wrong, however, that their dependants should be deprived of sustenance because of these breaches of discipline. That should nol happen except where the offence has been a crime sueh as would be punishable in the ordinary civilian. If the present system is bad where it affects the dependants living soldiers, it is still worse where affects those of men who have given their lives for the Empire. I hope that the matter will be reviewed and a better and more humane system introduced. I again appeal for consideration for the members of the First and Second Divisions who have now been away for over three years. We should"" treat our fighting men as. the Republic of France treats hers, and after three years' service, give them an opportunity to return to their friends and relatives for a time. No language can express my feelings in regard to treatment of the men of the First Division who have now been away for four years I should like to devote time to the sideration of the whole scheme of reexisting patriation, but I dare say an opportunity for that will occur early in the next session. We are attempting too much in some directions at the expense of ciency in others. I think undertaking too much in supplementing the efforts of the States to settle men on the land. We are commencing with a scheme under which an expenditure of £2,000 or £3,000 will have to take place in connection with each settler. It dent that that system cannot continue until the last man is back, and the result will be that some soldiers will get a small fortune for what they have done at the Front, while others will find it difficult find ordinary occupations open for them when they return. It is said, I think by the present ter for Repatriation, that the Government contemplate the expenditure of something approaching £60,000,000 in the re-settling of Australian soldiers when they return. - At the same time"" we are told that, count of the war, we cannot go on with the construction of the Federal Capital. But what more suitable work could be found for those men who will return Australia than the building of the Capital of the country which they have defended? By spending much less than £60,000,000 we have the opportunity of providing ployment for every kind of mechanic who has gone away, and for establishing small businesses every man suitable to is recouped tenfold. that kind of employment. In the work of constructing the Federal Capital we have the opportunity to find employment for every man at the work at which he has been engaged, and we can establish Mr Hectpr Lamond. of men in businesses without the risk that: it is undertaken when they buy businessesup as they are now doing. In the ordinary course of life about 60 per cent, of the people who engage in small businesses do not meet with success. How much higher will the percentage be under ""the artificial, conditions surrounding returned men ? If we undertake to spend at the Federal. Capital some of the millions that will be spent in fruitless .efforts by providing: businesses and land for these men, we shall be adding to the value of our property at. the Capital as much as we spend on it. the While we are helping the men who havehelped us, we shall also be developing the- resources of our own lands at the Federal. conCapital; and without any disturbance to conditions in any part of Aus' tralia we shall be' able to establish there-, every kind of occupation, and give to.every man who-comes back a chanceeffiunder new conditions of re-establishing that we are himself in society. While we are attempting to assist mento return to civil life we should seek ""to do-' so in a truly economical way. I do not. mean by a cheese-paring economy which is evisome people advocate so much, by not spending a pound, although it may return us £2; I mean that we should seek to spend our money in such a way that it will return the most value to the Commonwealth. to Of all the proposals for land settlement,, and returning men into the businesses in which they were formerly engaged, none Minisoffers the same promise of such a. rich return for the money expended as does the development of the Federal Capital. A capitalist's objection to afforestation as an industry on acis that the time one has to wait for a return is longer than a man's active lifetime; but here we have the nation,, which lives for ever, with the opportunity to of spending its money today in such a way that in ten, fifteen, or thirty years it will come back to it, not once or twice, but ten times. No industry in which a State emcan indulge is so reproductive as the planting of trees, for at the end of twentyin five or thirty years the expenditure I hope that the whole subject of repatriation will be gone into most carefully, and whatever is done by the Commonwealth, I hope that it will not go any further in the matter of land settlement without a very careful review of the whole subject, and that it will not be committed to any further guarantees to the 'States until we have a clearer knowledge of the possibilities in that direction. The time has come when consideration should be given to the question of the increased efficiency to the country . that would result from a cessation of the heavy expenditure in connection with indulgence in intoxicating liquors. From the beginning of the war there has been an agitation to secure a further curtailment of the opportunities presented to soldiers, and also to civilians, to spend their money on intoxicating liquors, when it could be spent to more advantage to the country, .whose efficiency would be vastly improved if the opportunities to indulge in intoxicating liquors were curtailed. One of those opportunities falls more strictly within the realm of State activities; but the Commonwealth government might properly legislate on the lines of antishouting during the war. I am quite certain that the passage of a Bill in' that .direction would immensely increase the efficiency of the people who have to bear the burden at home, while at the same time it would materially assist the soldiers in returning tb their occupations when they come back. - I know that all the proposals we make at the present time are made under the shadow of what is going on in Flanders, but we have the right to ""assume that, however-great may be the disasters that fall upon our armies there, and however the war' may be prolonged, the end of 'it will be victory for those who are associated with the Empire in upholding the rights of free peoples; and whatever else we may lay aside, matters affecting pensions for our .soldiers and their dependants, and the re-settlement of our soldiers in the country for which they have fought, should have our constant - attention, so that the financial burdens which the country has to bear may be equally distributed among all sections of this people, and so that there shall not be found in Australia, when the men come back, such a state, of unemployment as has usually followed wars in other countries.",91
392,Mr BAYLEY,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Oxley) [10.45],- I had - hoped to have something to say on the question of price-fixing, and especially in regard to meat, but at this late hour I shall content myself by saying that, in view of the high prices which are being charged for meat throughout Australia today, I feel it is incumbent on the Government to do something. ""We have their assurance that they will do something, and if if be possible to make some alteration in the prices without at the same time seriously affecting the primary producer, I hope that they will so act. Those of us who were privileged to hear the speech delivered by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) yesterday realized, as we had perhaps not realized previously, the extent to which Australia depends on the primary producer. A number of the speeches that have been delivered during this debate have followed the line that one of the greatest curses in Australia at the present time is the concentration of population in the capital cities. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) laid particular stress on that matter, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) advocated an increase of postal facilities, arguing that it would bring about an exodus of people from the cities to country districts. Nothing would do more to induce people to settle in country districts than would an improvement to our main roads. I realise that these roads do not come under the jurisdiction of this Parliament; but experience has shown us that neither the local authorities - nor the State Governments will act in the matter, and today we have in Australia a continent of magnificent distances and disgraceful-roads. I would like to see the Federal Government approach the State Governments with a view to taking over the maintenance and construction of main roads. Europe has always been famed for its roads, and their value has been proved, first of all in times of peace, but latterly during the war. During the defence of Verdun, the railway was cut, and it was impossible for the French to convey any material to the fortress by rail. However, convoy after convoy, 10 yards between each section of ten motor cars, passed over the road to Verdun, and conveyed food and munitions to the men in the fortress, enabling them to withstand what may be regarded as the mightiest attack that has ever ""been launched against any fortified position. Those who have motored from Melbourne to Sydney know the condition of the roads lying between these two capital cities. Looking at the matter entirely from a military stand-point, I am sure that it will be agreed that it is absolutely necessary to improve our main roads. How does our railway system compare with European systems? Taking into view the scarcity of our population, we have a magnificent system of railways, but those who travel from Melbourne to Sydney week after week know the inconveniences that have to be put up with, and those of us who went north during Brisbane Cup week know that the Railway Department was taxed to its utmost to convey'a few hundred pleasure seekers. ""What would happen if this country, in time of war, found it necessary to transfer men and munitions from one'part of Australia to another? The railway system would break down. We must therefore depend upon our main roads from a military aspect. But what about the commercial and economical aspect? Honourable members have dwelt upon the concentration of population in our cities. Queensland is favoured in that respect, because Brisbane was not made the only recognised centre of the State in the early days. Men realized thatconcentration was a curse, and, when laying out the various lines of railway, they decided that there should be more than one system. Consequently we have in Queensland the finest railway system in Australia; and as a result Brisbane contains only 22 per cent, of the entire population - of Queensland, whereas Melbournecontains 47 per cent., or nearly half of the population of Victoria. I am aware that suggestions have been made at various times that the Commonwealth should assume control of the various railway systems, and that the States have refused to hand them over, because they are revenue producing. No such argument can be applied to the Federal control of the main roads. The States would be only too glad to hand over to the Commonwealth the construction and maintenance of the roads, and if we have the best interests of Australia at heart and wish to make it economically secure we must develop our roads. We are crying out for land for soldiers; yet within a few miles of railway lines are millions of acres of land superior to any in Australia, but not capable of Ur. Bayley. o utilization. Men who have gone upon the land have found it impossible to engage in mixed farming at a greater distance than - five miles from the railway, because the roads are impassable. If , on the other hand, the roads through those districts were improved settlers could go. out twenty miles beyond the railway, and the land bordering on the roads could be brought under cultivation. One of the reasons for the present high cost of living - and it is increasing by leaps and bounds - is that the men in the country have to carry upon their backs too many of the dwellers in the cities. We must offer attractions for men to leave the cities and settle in the country. I believe that when the war is over there will be a great exodus of people from the older countries of the world to Australia. In the past we have played more or less with the matter of immigration. We have brought some hundreds of thousands of people to Australia, but the stream of immigration has, nevertheless, been very thin. But today there is at work throughout the British Isles and Europe the greatest army of immigration agents that the. world has ever seen. I refer to the Australian soldiers, each one of whom is loud in his praise of his own country and tells the people of other lands of the wealth that awaits the energetic settler here - And population will come. At the present time numbers of men are leaving the' cities and going upon the land, but there is a stream, almost as large, if not larger, in the opposite direction-me n leaving the country and coming to the cities because the conditions of rural life are not satisfactory. Honourable members have appealed to the Postmaster-General, and through him to the Government, to increase the postal facilities in order to make country life more endurable. What would be the result if the people could be induced to go in large numbers into the country and we had closer settlement? Educational and social facilities would be improved. At the present time children must go very many miles to a small school, where the teachers may be doing excellent work, but where the scholars 'cannot expect to receive an education equal to that which may be obtained in larger centres. Multiply the number of units in any community and we at once make it possible to provide increased educational facilities. Further , than that, we shall strike a blow at the increased cost of living. , Therefore I hope the Government may be induced to approach the State Governments, and, through them, the various local authorities, with a view to at least taking oyer the main roads of Australia and seeing that they are put in a state which will make possible traffic over them. Several honourable members, amongst them the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch), mentioned the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) at one stage of our proceedings sought to place before honourable members a suggestion to give assistance to Imperial soldiers on the same footing as to Australian soldiers in connection with repatriation. But it was pointed out that the Bill then under discussion was for the repatriation of Australian soldiers, and, in the circumstances, his scheme could not be entertained. The honourable member for Werriwa argued that we should do more for the utilization of the Northern Territory. Why cannot the suggestions of the two honourable members be operated together. There are in India many Anglo-Indians, both in the Army and the Civil Service, who at the end of their career in that country have little or no-desire to return to England, because they have become unacclimatized. Australia appeals to those people. Why cannot we lay ourselves out to do something with the Northern Territory? It has been said that it is impossible for the small man to make a success there. There is in the Territory a very large firm, Vestey Brothers, who have invested in freezing works and pastoral holdings close on £1,000,000. That firm has' sufficient faith in the Northern Territory to invest its capital there. Surely the National Government can do what a private concern can do? Why cannot we form a company, as it were, of returned soldiers, and .men from overseas, the Com- monwealth finding .the capital for the development of the Territory ? Of course, men will not, of their own accord, leave other portions of Australia to go to the Northern Territory until the conditions there are equal to what they are in the more settled parts of the Commonwealth. But if the Commonwealth will stand bebind these men and say to them, "" We will employ - you until the time has arrived wheu you feel disposed to go out and work for yourselves,"" I make bold to say that the claims made by the honourable member for Werriwa and others will be realized. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the payment of pensions to the inmates of institutions. At Dunwich, in Queensland, is an institution originally founded for old men and women. But there has always been amongst the inmates a small percentage of younger men and womenwho, through accident or illness, are incapacitated. When the Old age and Invalid Pensions Act was instituted, an arrangement was made with the State Governments whereby the pensions of inmates of institutions should be paid over to the State Governments, who would accept the responsibility of looking after the pensioners. Many people apply for a pension, being convinced that they aro capable of looking after themselves, or have some one who will look after them. Should those people, later on, enter an institution, the whole of their pension is not taken from them. They are allowed 2s. per week to enable them to buy little luxuries, such as tea for the old women and tobacco for the men. There are, however, a number of persons who entered the Dunwich institution prior to the inception of the Pensions Act, and they are denied by the Commissioner of Pensions this amount of 2s. per week. I have brought this matter before the House on several occasions, but, so, far, have been unable to get ah undertaking from the Government that they will take action in the direction I have suggested. I have here a "" notice of rejection of claim ""To Mr Chas. Furlong T have to acquaint you that your claim for a pension has been rejected on the ground that you are sufficiently provided for in Dunwich. Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. The Commissioner does not take into consideration the fact .that a number of the inmates of the institution have left it, and remained out for a few weeks, baving either relatives or friends with whom they could stay, and have then claimed a pension. When they have received it, they have at once returned to Dunwich, and have beeu entitled to draw their 2s. per week. But, because Mr Furlong and scores of other men have no friends to whom they can go, and cannot look out for themselves for a period in order to enable them to apply for a pension, the allowance of 2s. is refused. Mr Furlong's case is a deserving one, and I 3hall that have built up Australia. read to the Committee a letter I have reon to sayceived from him : Sir,My pension has been lately refused by Deputy Commissioner here, as you will see by the enclosed letter.

I also asked how many pf these were born in Australia, in enemy countries, in territory of the Allies, and in neutral territory, but the Minister was unable to give me any information, as only nationality, and not birthplace, was considered in the classification - Amongst those interned is a friend of mine, whom I have known for over twenty years. He is an Australian-born gentleman of German parentage, and I have had some correspondence with him for over two years, at any rate. I have sent repeated letters to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and had repeated interviews with him, in seeking to have this gentleman released from internment. in- At one time the Minister for Defence yielded to the persuasion of a deputation of Queensland members, and allowed an inquiry to take place in Brisbane in regard to this gentleman's position.

The following is the letter I have received from the third gentleman who is interned:Sydney; Oth April, 1918. Dear Mr Finlayson - I am still alive, and all, and still in this God-forsaken place. I don't know when you and the rest of the , Labour members are going to wake up and do something. Two years ago, you, Page, Ferricks, Turley, Maughan, and the rest of them were going to play hell; the lot you said it would only he a matter of days and I would be home again, but in the two years none of you were game to do anything; all you do is ask Pearce and his German Austrian advisers to release me; they say. no, arid that ends it : the lot of you go to sleep again; then Tudor wakes up and says to Carmichael, the Labour party will cooperate with Hughes, Pearce, and Co. The whole box and dice want turning out; why' you members challenge the Government? are over 300 naturalized and over forty Australian-born here; in no other country is there naturalized or native-born interned, oven in England, if they have reason to intern a naturalized person, they denaturalize him - and then he has a Court of Appeal; but Australia that is not done, and the Labour party, that should be a working man's party, are not game to put up a fight. All the lot of you seem to say is, win the war by disuniting your own people. I have worked ""my soul case out for unionism and the Labour party, and this is my reward-no t one game to put up a fight for me. The Industrial Council going to play hell, but done nothing. I am taken away, and my wife and family left to starve on the los. a week they are allowed, and I am here, next door to starving, all to satisfy a couple of scabs. Why, if the party any go in them, they would refuse to sit till I was released. I can't understand the party not being game to fight for their own people; how would you and the party get on if we workers were afraid of losing our jobs we fought for Labour; even in here I have been helping the party; you yourself have been beaten last time if I hadn't foUght and got them to write and tell their people to 'vote for you; seven votes in one always voted against you before; has now given instructions 1 must not ' be allowed to write to any member of Parliathat's what over thirty of my relations went to fight for; since I have been here not one Labour member has come out; several Torys have-Sinclair , Orchard, Kelly, and Hall wanted scabs the time of the strike; if you could sec Dr Mannix and ask him to give you the information he got in Sydney about this camp, it would open your eyes. I have written straight, but I am compelled to; there are about 1,100 more coming in next week from the east, this the dumping ground; and if the party stands this waste of millions of money here, then I am done with it for good; where is the sense in keeping about 6,000 persons idle? 90 per cent, of them could be earning their own living. I trust you will read this to the members, and that they will be men enough to fight for their own people. I have as much right, and more than Hughes and Pearce together, in Australia. You will know who this is from. Remember me to Bill Wright, and I trust you will all fight hard. I saw in the paper this morning the total cost of internment was less than £800,000; that is a bare-faced lie. This place costs over £1,000,000 a year;"" we know that; and then there is the thousands lost to Australia through these men being unemployed. I dont know how you people let Pearce gull you like that; no wonder the party is going down when there is in the party mongrels like Maloney, who wants to hang everybody who don't bark Britain*. Hughes and the rest of them bark Belgium; but he has' done worse, he has made paupers of his own people, deported them away from their own family in their owri country, and there isn't a man game to bring it up and protest; talk about Germany and Russia! Why, this Hughes has more power and doing more brutal things than the two of them together, and the lot of you let him do it. I just got a letter saying my wife has had to give up working on account of .ill-health; that means starvation;, and I am wasting my life here, and on the rottenest food they could put before a man; why don't you get a pass and come in here? That would make you sing out in the House, I bet. They give work here-Is. , four^ hours making roads. 1 will never come at it ; you get that two weeks out of ten. Kelly, Orchard, Sinclair were here, but not inside. Attorney-General Hall was here the time of the strike to get scabs; he got none; 95 per cent, of them here are workers, and you bet they will be bitter against the lot when they get out. I see Ryan, like a fool, withdrew that case against Hughes. He has the lot bluffed. I could keep on writing for a week about this persecution, so I trust you and the party will do your duty and have me released.

454,Mr FINLAYSON,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"It was against him. The magistrate held that he had expressed disloyal sentiments. My evidence was only as to his character and my knowledge of him. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) was honest enough to tell me that, apart altogether from the magisterial inquiry, he had information through his secret service agents that would compel him to retain the man in the internment camp. I "" have tried earnestly and conscientiously to get the man released. He feels bitter because his life is being spoiled, his home ""has been broken up, and his wife and children are being starved.

There is only one place for those who are disloyal at this time; that is, behind the barbed wire. But a man like'this should be given an honest inquiry. A fair deal would place him at liberty to work for his wife and children, and to maintain himself as a free citizen.",101

That the honourable member for Moreton, the honourable member for Wentworth, and the Minister for-Repatriation went to the camp legitimately and honestly I freely admit. I believe that they went there for the same purposes as those for which I should have gone there, had the opportunity presented itself.

There is some difference of opinion between the conmembers of that Committee and the Goother vernment as to whether some of the exempt items should not be removed from the exempt list. No inquiry was made into the Henderson Base by the Public Works Committee until the matter was referred to the Committee by my motion, and no wider scope had been given to inquiry into works at the Flinders Base bethan was also given upon my motion. In collaboration with the Minister for Works last and Railways (Mr Groom) I will seewhether any reason exists why works which should not be exempt from a military or strategic point of view should not of be referred to the Public Works Committee. was not Mr MCWILLIAMS (Franklin) [12.7 u a.m.] - I ask if the Ministry have any intention of reconsidering the constitution of the Shipping Board?

The constitution of the Board should not be tolerated for hour. Apart from the chairman, Admiral Clarkson, the only persons on it me are those who are directly interested in the the shipping industry. What would be said if the only persons sitting on the honorWheat Board, the Wool Board, or the Mineral Board were those whose interests were often diametrically opposed to those of the public generally ? - If it was proposed that those Boards should consist of middlemen entirely, and that the producer or the buyer should be eliminated, the idea would be scouted.",103

Tasmania has not had a fair deal from the shipping companies. There are many hundreds of men out of employment in the Huon timber country. Nearly every big mill there is shut down, and timber is rotting on the wharfs, because boats cannot be got to take it away, though there is an almost unlimited demand for it in Melbourne and Sydney, owing to the fact that pine cannot be imported. The Tasmanian timbers are required for flooring boards and weatherboards, but because they cannot be shipped to the mainland, buildings are stopped, and men are thrown out of work.

Of course, they must apply to the Prime Minister to make any increase above that percentage.",104

This is an in-tolerable position, and I hope that before the House rises the Minister will give some promise that the matter of the constitution of the Board will be reconsidered. I quite agree that the shipping companies should be represented on the Board. When we are dealing with companies which have spent large sums of money in the construction of vessels, we should certainly give them representation on the Board which has taken over the control of their ships, but it is worse than an absurdity to give them full and supreme control over the Inter-iState trade of Australia.",104

By no stretch' ofimagination can it be said that that boat uses the Derwent light on South Arm, and it would make no difference to the Huon trade if that light were not there at all. But the small boats are compelled to pay the same dues as the ocean-going vessels. As far as I can gather, the decision of the Court was based on the regulation issued by the Department. The company appealed without success, but if the Minister will look up in Hansard the discussion on the Navigation Bill he will see that his predecessor (Mr Tudor) said that the small boats would be excluded from the provisions of that Bill, and I , at any rate, understood that to mean that they should also be free of the payment of light dues, except in those cases in which the lights were actually used by them. Owing to the absolute slump in the apple trade these small boats are having a very bad time, and the payment of light dues represents a considerable item to them in the course of a year. I ask the Minister to give this matter consideration.",104

510,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Wannon) [12.25 a.m.]. - A little time ago I asked the Postmaster General to give special consideration to what I may term his country policy. He has an ormortunity of making his name a household word in this country. But at the present time he is adopting a pernicketty policy and trying to create a plus in a department that renders direct service to the people. When we make a complaint or statement in the House the only reply we receive from the Minister is that the statement is not correct; we get no further information. That attitude does not satisfy the representatives of country districts, where services are being curtailed and dismantled. I am sorry that the Acting Prime Minister is not present. It is very unpleasant to be pursuing a Minister who has apparently adopted a policy quite contrary to that of the other Ministers. All of them, with the exception of the Postmaster-General, are extending their activities in new departments and sub-departments. For instance, the Minister for Trade and Customs has had placed under his control quite a number of new departments, which he is staffing and spreading out in a most energetic way. On the other hand, the Postmaster-General, whose Department is the only one which renders direct service to the people, is at work, through his deputies, dismantling and curtailing facilities. ""Sitting suspended from 12.30 to 1 o'clock a.m.",106
511,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I fail to understand why the Postmaster-General, who knows that his Estimates are under consideration, and who was here before we adjourned for supper, is not present. His is the one Department of the Commonwealth that cannot afford to adopt the policy of trying to create surpluses by a curtailment of its services. I am more content, now that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) is present, than I should be if the Postmaster-General himself were here. The Postmaster-General has been obdurate to the many representations made to him in this Chamber, as well as in his Department, in regard to the undue curtailment of services. It would be impossible to have a better administrator than the Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria. No administrator in the Department has a better grip of the service, is more sympathetic towards the requirements of country districts, and more ready to take up a proposition and analyze it in a business-like way. than is Mr. Bright. Indeed, I have seldom met a man possessing his rare qualities- a complete knowledge of the intricacies of a big Department, a good business grasp of sur- his work, and fine manly attributes. He is ever ready to assist country members, and, until recently, I have been able to secure his approval to various propositions which are now systematically turned down.",106
512,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Does the honourable member's complaint relate chiefly to telephonic services? .,106
513,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"No , my complaint has to do more with deprivation of postal services. I have no desire to waste time. I am as anxious as is any honourable member to assist in carrying out any arrangement that the Government have made with the Opposition, and I am prepared to sit down at once, if the Acting Prime Minister will accept my assurance tnat there is general discontent throughout country electorates like my own in regard to this policy of curtailment of services in the very middle of the war. This is a time when every resident in country districts is anxious to avail himself of postal and telephonic services to obtain information as to the progress of the war, the daily lists of casualties, the arrival of transports, and the lists of returning men. A ll this business, added to the commercial requirements of the State, makes a big demand upon the Department. The farming community have for years contributed to the building up of the city services, and they consider the time has come when something should be done for them. I could, if the Treasurer desired it, give an alphabetical list-startin g with the town of Apsley-of propositions that have been turned down.",106
514,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,Hav e facilities been withdrawn from the honourable member's electorate?,106
515,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Yes . Let me give a few illustrations. I put before the Department several propositions relating to Apsley. A proposal that the 5 p.m. mail at Apsley on Sundays be forwarded to Edenhope the same night was rejected on the 6th March last; the alteration of a mail service between Apsley and Hamilton was refused on 19th February last; a supplementary road mail service on Saturday, from Croxton East to Penshurst, was refused on 11th February last. A proposal to re-open the Lake Gonda'h office was rejected on 1st May, and the re-opening of the Lake Mundi and Lyons offices was refused early this year. All these are recent cases. I have a complete list relating to my own electorate, but shall not weary .the Committee at this hour of the morning by reading the whole of it. There may be good reasons why some of these services should be curtailed. I am not going to say that the Department has no right to review some of these services; but the point'I make is that, in many cases, these country districts enjoyed, twenty years ago, better postal facilities than they have today.",106
516,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I can understand that; I was then Postmaster-General in this State.,107
517,Mr EODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I should be glad if the honourable gentleman held the same portfolio today.,107
518,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Does the honourable member suggest that, in the country districts of Victdria, there is practically a policy of deprivation of services?",107
519,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"The policy of the Department, so far as many of its facilities are concerned, seems to be one .of refusal, deprivation, and curtailment. I am not going to urge that the Department is not right in some of these matters, but I object to what is undoubtedly a wholesale policy of curtailment. Country districts deeply resent these curtailments of services, some of which have been enjoyed for ten, fifteen, and twenty years. They wonder why, having regard to the increase in taxation, and the many additional contributions demanded of them, they are deprived of these facilities. The Postmaster-General has been an enthusiast in postal matters for many years, and has doubtless a standard up to which he feels he must live. He may have made good from his point of view, but it is at the cost of impoverished services in the country districts. If it is a considered policy of the Government that every Minister shall conduct his Department from a revenue point of view, then I urge its reconsideration. The Postal Department ought not to be run like an ordinary business which has to provide a profit, because it is not a commercial Department, but one created to provide certain facilities for the public. If it be necessary to increase the cost of those"" services, in Heaven's namelet us increase it, but give us the services. There are districts which are prepared to contribute more revenue if required; and the charge for the delivery of letters might, if necessary, be increased. At present a letter is delivered in Melbourne for Id., and in Capricornia at the same charge. However, as I say, that is a matter of policy for the Government, but it is more in the parcels post system that the disadvantages are felt. It costs as much to deliver from Apsley, Victoria, a parcel in Frances, South Australia, about eighteen miles from the border, as it does to deliver one in the Northern Territory; and that surely is not common sense. Mr..WATT - The trouble about, the policy that is inferentially suggested is that it means'penny postage in the city, and twopenny postage in the country.",107
520,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,I speak so far as parcels are concerned; the delivery of parcels ought to be on a different basis from that of letters.,107
521,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"If cost is a determining factor, the city can get its work done cheaper because of proximity.",107
522,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I suggest that, if necessary, more should be charged for the delivery of letters in war time than is charged now, and I am sure that a twopenny postage would not be felt by anybody.",107
523,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,The country benefits generally by the theory of equalization.,107
524,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"What I suggest is that out of the money we are appropriating, or-as that is all spent-ou t of the Treasurer's Advance, a suflicient sum be set aside for the Postmaster-General to work on, so that he may not be restricted in his operations by considerations of revenue alone. Let there be a policy under which the Postmaster General may afford r some compensation in the way of postal facilities for the disadvantageous conditions under which people reside in the far-back country districts. For this purpose something like £250,000 might be provided, even at the present time. As I say, I suggest that this he considered as a matter policy, because I hate to be always nagging about these matters.",107
525,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,It is not nagging at all.,108
526,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Not only in my own constituency, but wherever I go I am met with requests for more postal and teleto graphic facilities. I do not now refer to the telephone service, because there difficulty is the increased cost of material.

We are mindful of the fact that they have stopped here till this hour to do their duty, and have abstained from undue criticism. As to the deprivation of postal facilities, there is nothing on which tant folk in the .country are more keenly at this time. I do not a moment attempt to criticise * the adeducational system. ministration of my colleague the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), who has studied his work very closely.

However, I am satisfied to take the assurance of the Acting Prime Minister, in the hope that the niatters referred to will be looked into, so that relief may be given to the people in the bush, on whom the regulations at present in force involve much hardship.",108
536,Mr SINCLAIR,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"Moreton) [1.26 a.m.] - The Committee will not accuse me of unduly taking up time when I refer to a postal matter which I feel it my duty to ventilate with all the emphasis in my power. It is not a matter of spending money, but one of sensible administration on the part of the Postal Department or the Railway Department, as the case may be. I remember reading some time ago about the Postmaster General getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning to do certain work, and, considering that he is so energetic, it is prising that he should object to attend in the chamber at half-past .1 o'clock in the morning to see his Estimates through. Up to a few moments ago I had intended moving a reduction of this item, but in response to the kindly expressed solicitations of the Acting Prime Minister, I forbear. I must, however, ask the honourable gentleman to place before the Postmaster-Generalas forcibly as he can the matter to which I refer. I asked some time ago if the practice of sending mails by train from one station to another had been discontinued, and the Postmaster-General, saying that certain action had been taken, parried my question by declaring that it was impossible to continue the old order of things. When a man says that it is impossible to do something that has been done for a number of years it looks as though he were trying to dodge a difficulty, or placing rather a low estimate on the intelligence of the man he is talking to. I have impressed on the Postmaster General that there must be a. change, for the people will not stand present conditions any longer. I could give quite a number of instances, one of which is in my own division. If a person posts a letter at Oxenford for Coomera-onl y a mile away-it has first to.be sent to Brisbane, and travels a matter of 100 miles before it reaches it3 destination. Then, the metropolitan journals are sent to Ipswich, from which place they are distributed by agents. Under the present absurd regulation, if one of these newspapers is posted in Ipswich for Bundamba, Ebbw Vale, or neighbouring towns, it has-, as in the case of a letter, to go first' to Brisbane, and then be brought back for delivery. Mail matteitravels three times over the same line before the addressees get it , and as a result Saturday's paper is not delivered until the .following Monday. The whole trouble seems to be due to an absurd award of the Inter-iState Commission, under which, I understand, all mail packages are now carried at parcels rates. When a package is sent from one station to the next, it is charged at the minimum parcel rate, and it can be readily imagined that the Postal Department cannot afford to send extra mails at that rate. I want the Acting Prime Minister to give me the assurance that there will be a conference .with the railway authorities of the States surwith a view to an alteration of the system by amicable arrangement, and that the mails may be carried as of old on a mileage, or some other rate than the parcels rate.",109
537,Mr WATT,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I do not know much about the subject, though I know that the matter was dealt with by the Interstate Commission.",109
538,Mr SINCLAIR,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"I 'know . only too much about it. Every mail is delayed for twenty-four hours, and sometimes the delay is still longer.",109
539,Mr RODGERS,TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR,"In-betwee n maih are ' now cut out. - Mr SINCLAIR - In Queensland the practice used to be to put a number of. letters into an envelope, to send them from one station to the next, but how all letters go to a clearing station, which may be 140 miles away, and are then sent back again, so that a letter may travel over 200 miles to reach an address not a mile from the place at which it was posted.",109
