2,Mr LYONS,Unknown," by leave-To-da y we meet in an atmosphere of sadness, because of the untimely death of Mr CharJes Allan Seymour Hawker, the honourable member for Wakefield. When the House met yesterday, I made a brief statement concerning an air crash which had occurred in the Dandenong ranges, near Melbourne. At that time, very little information was available. A few minutes after the House had _ adjourned, the appalling nature of the disaster was realized when it was known that all of the passengers and crew of the airliner Eyeema, numbering eighteen, had been killed. Our sadness at this terrible toll of life was deepened when we learned that Mr. Charles Hawker was among the passengers who had perished. Our sense of loss is great, for no member of this House enjoyed a wider measure of popularity and esteem. Mr Hawker was first elected to represent Wakefield at the general elections of 1929. He held the portfolios of Minister for Markets and Minister for Repatriation from the 6th January to the 13th April, 1932, and, upon the alteration of the title of the Department of Markets to that of the Department of Commerce, the portfolio of Minister for Commerce from that date until the 23rd September, 1932. Despite severe physical disabilities, the result of wounds sustained during distinguished service in the Great War, the deceased gentleman applied himself to his parliamentary work with remarkable vigour. He was a man of very keen intellect and high educational attainments, with a wide knowledge of the problems associated with rural industries, and by means of intensive study had gained a deep insight into national and international affairs. His speeches in this chamber reflected his unusual ability, and showed the care with which he applied himself to the particular subject undeT discussion. As one of my colleagues in the Ministry in 1932, I can speak with keen appreciation of his wholehearted loyalty and co-operation. I valued his friendship very greatly. Mr Hawker was a man of very high personal worth, and of marked sincerity. One can say with conviction that he was truly a great Australian. We shall miss his kindly personality, as well as the example of his indomitable spirit. His death has occurred at the comparatively early age of 44 years, but he leaves behind him a record of distinguished service. The knowledge of achievement in such a life will, I trust, bring some measure of consolation to his mother, his brothers, and his sisters, in their great sorrow. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at. the death of the Honourable Charles Allan Seymour Hawker, member for Wakefield, and a former Commonwealth Minister, places on record its appreciation of his distinguished public service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to his mother, brothers, and sisters, in their sad bereavement.",13
3,Mr CURTIN,Unknown," I second the motion which the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has moved. I find it impossible to express adequately the very deep grief which my colleagues on this side of the House and I experience at the regrettable death of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker). Por nine years, the deceased gentleman graced this representative chamber of the democracy of Australia. He was a forthright as well as a very honourable and very honest-thinking man. His physical courage was, I think, no greater-grea t though it was-tha n his moral courage. He was not afraid to say what he thought should be said. His services to this nation have been very great. He was a gallant man in war, and a gallant personality in the civic life of the Commonwealth. Broadminded, friendly and tolerant, he was willing at all times to hear and to weigh what could be said against his own view. He was a fearless, but, nevertheless, a very manly, and I believe a very understanding, opponent of mine in politics and in respect of ideas of government. He felt that the clash of opinions was good for the people of this country. The Opposition respected and admired him. In the lobbies, they found his personality always gracious, and the opportunities for conversation with him most welcome. This country profited by Charles Hawker's membership of this Parliament, and the members of this Parliament also profited as individuals by the value which intercourse with him gave to them. I feel very, veTy deeply for his mother, his sisters, and his brothers; but, in a sense, I feel more deeply for Australia, because this nation has lost a very splendid representative. The members of this Parliament mourn him, not only because of the friendship they held for him, but also because of their sense of the national loss sustained by his death. He was, I believe, on the threshold of great achievements; because, as the right honourable the Prime Minister has said, he had not spared himself in studying the problems of this country. It was not sufficient for Charles Hawker to hold an opinion; he had to have a for t if y in g reason for he was essentially a reasoning man. I believe that his example will infect the body politic, and that the men and women of Australia will learn by it that physical disabilities may be overcome or that compensating qualities may be developed. It is true that nine years is but a short .period in the political service of a country. During that time, however, the late honourable member made many wise pronouncements which will live in memory. It may be that in the years to come members of this Parliament, reading Hansard, w i ll appeal to the judgment given by the late Charles Hawker on many an occasion. In that way his spirit will endure in this House of Representatives and he will be, as it were, a continuing influence in respect of what has to be done. Thus, his labours will possess the quality of immortality.",14
4,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown," I wish to associate myself, and the party which I have the honour to lead, in expressions of sympathy to relatives of all the victims of the air crash, and especially of our own colleague, Charles Hawker, and to add a tribute to a great statesman, a truehearted patriot, and a very gallant man. Because of the difficulties Charles Hawker surmounted to come here, his presence in this Parliament was an inspiration and a challenge to public service. H is daily life among his own people in South tralia seemed like a blessing. I once places. travelled with him many hundreds of miles through the countryside-h e in sisted on driving all the way-and I found that he was the guide, confidant and counsellor of the poor and rich on every side, and of the settlers and no labour was too arduous for him in his efforts to better their lot. Although terribly handicapped physically by his war wounds, he lived a lif e full to the brim of high public service, of hard personal work and of unexampled private generosity. To a rare simplicity of character was joined a bold and constructive mind, which he enriched by constant study, travel and discussion, and he thus made himself a first-class parliamentarian, .a strong Minister and a wise friend. Australia, in this crisis of its history, it ; can ill afford to lose so ripe a mind, whose spirit was like a flame. He added lustre to a name already noted in Australia for public service and for pioneering work in land settlement, in science and in aviation, and we deeply deplore his tragic passing before the full promise of his lif e had been fulfilled . Question resolved in the affirmative; honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by Mr LYONS ) agreed toThat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Mrs Hawker, mother of the late Honourable C. A. S. Hawker, the foregoing resolution, together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. AIR DISASTER.
