1,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the volved Prime Minister if he can furnish any formation with regard to Major-General Hutton's report, respecting which I asked question yesterday?",12
2,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I have had inquiries made, and find that the statement that the report was sent tti the Defence Department, and that before being received the Minister some df its Contents were published in the newspapers. Inquiries being made as to how the information was obtained by the Press; but it may be stated that the account that appeared in the Press is not altogether accurate. The report will be laid on the table of the House in the course of a day or two. HIGH COURT FEES.",12
3,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Atwhich, torney-General a question with regard the charges made by Commissioners for takbeen overcome. ing affidavits for the High Court. When' an' appeal is made to the High Court it is necessary-to prepare affidavits, exhibits are sometimes attached. In tion to the charge made for taking the davits, a fee of is. per page has to be paid anv caucus. in respect to the exhibits, which may be very voluminous. That charge has been made by an officer of the Court, who, I am told, receives a salary of about ^1,200 annum. I wish tp know whether these cumstances are within the cognisance Attorney-General, and whether they are keeping with the promise made 'High Court Bill was before us, that the procedure under the High Court rules Would be easy and cheap.",12
4,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"-The regulations as to the fees to be paid to any Commissioners appointed by the High Court for taking affidavits are made, not by the Governor General in Council but by Their Honours the Justices of the High Court. I have been in correspondence with His Honour the Chief Justice with regard to the fees which are payable to officers of the Federal Departments, and he has intimated his intention to so alter the rules as not to permit of officers of the Federal Departments receiving fees. in addition to their ordinary salaries.",12
5,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Will that apply to the State Registrars who are acting as DeputyRegistrars of the High Court? >,12
6,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"-That will depend to some extent upon the arrangements' made with the States. Another question is inin the matter, to which attention has inbeen directed by the honourable member for Laanecoorie,'. namely, the extent of the a .charge for exhibits-is . per page.",12

8,Mr SALMON,Unknown,No ; the charge indiby cated by . me has actually been made.,12
9,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If the honourable memare ber will be so; good as to put before me the facts of the case referred to, I shall be' very happy to bring them before their Honours the Justices of the High Court, LABOUR CAUCUS. Mr Reid,- I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether the difficulty appeared to exist with reference to his to non-inclusion in the labour caucus has If not, does it proceedfrom disinclination on the part of the Government to receive him, or disinclination on to which his own part to join the caucus ? addi- .

DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS.",12
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Ministerof Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the report on the public works executed by his Department since the establishment of the Department was not in course of preparation when he took over the control of the Department? 2. Whether a number of returns were not practically prepared, showing the expenditure under various headings, with a view of giving full information to Parliament, in a clear and. concise tabular form, as to all the operations of the Department? 3. ' Is it to be understood that he has decided not to have these returns completed and presented to, Parliament? 4. If so, how is Parliament to be supplied with this very necessary information? 5. Seeing, that all the information would be in possession of the Department, in what way would its compilation for submission to Parliament cose ^400, exclusive of printing (as recently stated) ? Mr BATCHELOR' - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes, so far as relates to expenditure. 2. Yes. 3. No. 4. When the Estimates are under consideration. 5. No such statement was made. The honourable member, in his question of the 24th inst., referred to an annual report of the Department of Home Affairs. PUBLIC SERVANTS' LONG SERVICE honourable",13
12,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether it is. a fact, as published in the press, that the Public Service Commissioner has decided to restrict long leave to Federal servants in South Australia to three months after ten years' service, and six months after twenty years' service, although terms of four months and eight monthsrespectively are provided for by State legislation? """,13
13,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o ws : 1. The Public Service Commissioner states that there was no statutory right to four and eight months' furlough in South Australia; the law on the matter, was merely permissive, now considered that there should be uniformity throughout all the States on the lines of the later Commonwealth Act, which permits of officers of over twenty years' service being granted leave of BILL. absence not exceeding twelve months on half pay or six months on fullpay. It having been the practice, however, in the various States to grant meritorious officers of less than twenty years' service leave on full pay upon their retirement, the Commissioner considered it would be only fair to continue such practice, and he therefore recommended that extended leave under the circumstances mentioned should be granted on retirement on the following scale :For service of twenty years and over, six months on full pay. For service of fifteen years and under twenty years, four months on full pay. For service under ten years, one month on , . full pay. A ll the officers of the Commonwealth service are now treated alike in the matter of this reave, and there would' seem to be no justification for dealing with the officers transferred from South Australia in a manner different to that adopted in regard to the rest of the Commonwealth. NA SHIPS.",13
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,COASTWISE CARGO IN OVERSEA,"the Minister of Trade and Customs; upon notice I. What was the total value of cargo carried coastwise in the Commonwealth for 1903 (exclusive of cargo carried from abroad and landed at ports of the Commonwealth, or cargo shipped from ports of the Commonwealth for abroad) ? 2. What proportion of such cargo is carried by oversea ships-that is, ships trading from abroad and touching at ports en route to their final port of destination in the Commonwealth and vice versd ? 3. What was the number of passengers carried by Inter-State ships coatswise in the Commonwealth during 1903? 4. What was the number of passengers carried by oversea British and foreign ships coastwise in the Commonwealth during 1903, distinguishing the numbers carried by British or by foreignships as is possible ?'",13
15,Mr FISHER,COASTWISE CARGO IN OVERSEA,"The answers to the low :member's questions are as folLEAVE. The various State collectors have been communicated' with, but necessarily some time must elapse before replies are received from the more distant States. It should be remembered, however, that in regard to questions 1 and 2 the Department is largely dependent upon outside sources for its information, and such can only be obtained as a matter of courtesy. The information required by questions 3 and 4 has to be obtained from the State returns. Immediately .replies are received from the State collectors the information will be laid on the table of the House. NA MELBOURNE AND SYDNEY.",13
16,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"the Postmasterand it is General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that there are four daily mail deliveries in Melbourne and only three in Sydney? If so, why? 2. Whether it is a fact that mails arriving in Sydney by express train about 10.15 a.m. are detained in the General Post Office until 1 p.m. ? If so, why?",13
17,Mr MAHON,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- 1. Yes; because the fourth delivery in Sydney was discontinued while the Department was under the control of the State Government, and so far as the Postmaster-General is aware no application had been made since the transfer of the Department for its restoration. . 2. The mails from Melbourne arrive by-express train at the Sydney Railway Station at 10.43 a.m., and those from Brisbane and the North at 1 i.S a.m., and the correspondence by both is delivered by letter-carriers at 12.45 P- - Under these circumstances there is no unnecessary delay. IMPERIAL TITLES AND ORDERS.",14
18,Mr CROUCH,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether there is any record in the Department of any recommendations as to the titles and orders granted to citizens of the Commonwealth last week by the Imperial Government? 2. Were all such titles and orders made only on the recommendation or with the concurrence of the present Commonwealth Government or its predecessors in office?",14
19,Mr WATSON,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. There is no such record. 2. I have no knowledge as to who recommended the titles or orders in question, but presume the recommendations were made by the Governor General. PUBLIC SERVICE CLASSIFICATION.",14
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, as under the new classification Public Service many persons may lose their appointments owing to the work in some offices being reduced, he will take care that in all such cases such officers shall be transferred to other positions, where their services can be utilized; and that retrenchment shall not be resorted to except in cases where no suitable transfer can be arranged ?",14
21,Mr WATSON,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows :lows :In cases where it has been found that are more officers than are necessary for the cient working of the Department, it is the intentherefore, tion of the Commissioner to transfer such officers to other positions as soon as possible, and in the meantime to utilize their services to relieve branches where the work is congested, and allow of annual leave being granted to officers. There is no intention to retrench-officers. POSTAL PNEUMATIC TUBE. _ Mr CHAPMAN asked the Postmaster General, upon notice I. What is the total cost to date of the pneumatic tube between the General Post-office, Sydney, 'and the Exchange? 2. Has the tube been used. If not, why?",14
22,Mr MAHON,MAIL DELIVERIES I N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The Department is 'not in possession of the cost to date, but under the contract entered into by the State Government the cost was ^6,500. 2. It has been used experimentally, but has not been taken over by the Postmaster-General's Department, because it has been reported to have m been proved by inumerable tests to be unreliable, and, from a Departmental aspect, unworkable. NA COMMONWEALTH.",14
23,Mr CROUCH,VOLUNTEER FORCES OF TH E,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Colonial Defence Committee of London recommended the Defence Department to abolish the Volunteer Forces of the Commonwealth, and that the composition of the Australian forces in future shall consist of the permanent and partially-paid members only. 2. If so, when was such recommendation received, and will a copy of it be placed on the table of the House? 3. Do the Government propose to adopt such proposal ?",14
24,Mr WATSON,VOLUNTEER FORCES OF TH E,The answers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1. and 2. No. 3. The Government do not propose to abolish the Volunteer Forces. FEDERAL CAPITAL.,14
25,Mr SKENE,VOLUNTEER FORCES OF TH E,"the Minister of Home of the Affairs, upon notice Whether, in .view of the impression made upon those members who recently inspected a suggested site for the Federal Capital on the Upper Murray, he will cause an inspection and report to be made by Mr Chesterman, who inspected and reported upon other sites.",14
26,Mr BATCHELOR,VOLUNTEER FORCES OF TH E,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as folA report by Mr Chesterman will be obtained. there I may add that Mr Chesterman has been effiover the ground recently, and there is, no necessity for a further inspection. I should also add that there will be no delay in consequence of asking for anyto such report in the introduction of the Bill as soon as the business of the House permits. NA In Committee (Consideration resumed from 28th June, vide page 2748): Clause 62- - 1. Any of the following associations may, on compliance with the prescribed conditions, be registered in the manner prescribed as an organization :(a) Any association of employers in or nexion with any industry, who have in the aggregate, throughout the six months next preceding the application for tration, employed on an average taken per month not less than 100 employees in that industry; and (b) Any association of not less than 100 employees in or in connection with any industry. 2. The conditions to be complied with by associations so applying for registration shall, until otherwise prescribed, be as set out in Schedule B. 3. Upon registration, the association shall become and be an organization. Upon which Mr .GLYNN had moved by way of amendment That after the word "" industry,"" line 14, the following words be inserted, ""Provided rhat no association shall be registered :1. Unless it has been formed, and exists solely for the purposes of this Act, or.""",14
27,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I had to speak last night or not speak at all, but I shall not keep-the Committee much longer in expressing my views upon this question. We find that there are only three arguments advanced against the acceptance of this amendment. The first is that the unions on registering with the Court give up their power to strike, which is a very great and a live power, and should, in consequence, get a preference under this Bill. If the unions give up their power to strike, it must not he forgotten that they are now, in return, securing the protection of an omniscient being who is to have complete guardianship and control of all industrial affairs. The Prime Minister has time and again told us that we are to trust the Court. If the honourable gentleman bases his whole objection against the amendment on the firstargument that the unions have to give up their power to strike, and should, therefore, get a preference, I ask him, to be consistent, to trust the Court even in this regard, and accept the amendment. The next, argument against the amendment is that the unions- I am speaking entirely of the unions with which our honourable friends opposite are concerned, and not of the industrial organizaBILL. tions to be brought into being under this measure - take the risk of actions in this Court, and should consequently reap the reward. Trades unions certainly take the risk of actions under existing conditions, but under the new scheme the whole organization will take the risk of action, and will deserve to reap the reward. That arguin con- ment, therefore, does not count for much. The third argument is that these unions have cohesion. This amendment is. mainly regis- directed against political unions, militant trades unions. If we accept the word of the honourable member for Darling, which I am perfectly ready to do, that the Australian Workers' Union is the best instance of a militant union, then I say that a militant political union does notmake for cohesion. Its numbers have decreased so obviously in the last few years that it is clear that it cannot even keep together its own members, to say nothing of those who may be compelled to join it. I hope I have made clear my reasons for believing that the arguments urged against the amendment carry no weight. AVhat are the arguments for the amendment? The most important is that the Court is to supersede the unions in all' their functions, with the exception of the voluntary function usually connected with a benefit society. The' power to make collective bargains is to be given up, and the Court now will have'to do between the two parties what our friends opposite always refer to as a "" fair thing."" These two parties are to trust themselves absolutely to the Court's discretion. I hold that, if that discretion is to be in any way useful, it must be absolutely untrammelled. What is the position at present? Is the discretion qf the Court untrammelled ? We find that in the experience of New South Wales it has been so in nearly every case, except where our political friends of the Australian Workers' Union came into conflict with it. What is the historyof that case, which is the strongest case we can put against political unionism under this Bill ? In that case the Machine Shearers' Union came to an understanding and agreement with the employers, and they sought to register that agreement, and asked the Australian Workers' Union to come in. The agreement was registered on the basis of the wages pertaining previous to the inauguration of the New South Wales Arbitration Court.  orable member speaking about now ?",15
28,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Australian Workers' Union were then asking for an increase of 5s. a 100 in the shearing rate. They saw. that an agreement had been registered between the Machine Shearers' Union and the Pastoralists' Union ,16
29,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At 20s. per 100. They saw that that necessarily meant that they could not hope to get the rate which they wanted adopted as a common rule, and rather than go to the Court themselves to have their claim investigated, this fine body of men refused to go to work. They refused to obey the Arbitration Court. We are told by their president that they did not go on strike. Butthey refused to go to work, thinking that as they numbered so great a proportion of the shearing community, the Pastoralists' Union would be compelled, in spite of the Court, to concede their terms. Strike camps were formed by members of the union in just the same way as though an actual strike were in existence-despit e the Court! When they found that they were beaten, they then appealed to the Court to cancel the registration of the Machine Shearers' Union, on the score that it was a bogus association. ",16
30,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Registrar at first acceded to their demand, and recommended that the registration should be cancelled. The Machine Shearers' Union appealed to the Court, on the ground that, if their registration were cancelled, there was no union in existence to which their members might conveniently belong, and they instanced amongst other things the difficulty of the political rules of the Australian Workers' Union. The Court upheld their appeal, and dismissed the claim of the Australian Workers' Union. Austialian Workers' Union then came, back to the Registrar and said that their rules had been altered. The Registrar examined them, and found that the statements of the officials were characteristically specious, and that the rules had not been altered. The officials then went away, and subsequently waited upon the Registrar with the altered rules.",16
31,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is a rather specious way of putting the matter.,16
32,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am stating what is absolutely a matter of fact.,16
33,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is one of those half facts that do not convey the truth.,16
34,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that the Prime Minister is justified in saying that.,16
35,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know the circumstances quite as well as does the honourable member, and I say that his statements do not convey all the truth. ' Mk. KELLY - I shall quote the; remarks of the Chief Justice of New South Wales and two other Judges' in support of my contention. These Justices are not subject to influence, whereas the Prime Minister is largely dependent' for support upon the votes cast for the Labour Party by the members of the Australian Workers' Union. I repeat that the officials of that organization interviewed the Registrar a third time, and declared that its rules had been altered. The Registrar then said:-""The rules may have been altered, but the misconduct of the officials of the Australian Workers' Union is so notorious that I cannot compel any man to join that organization."" What did the Union do then ? Through its secretary, who is a member of the New South Wales Legislature, it secured the' appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the bogus character of the Machine Shearers' Union, which was not in any sense the question at issue. Presumably that Select Committee ought to have been of an impartial character. But whom do we find made its chairman? None other than the secretary of the Australian Workers' Union ! To my mind that was absolute political indecency.. The Committee sat and discovered that they did not possess the power to compel the production of certain books which they wished to examine. The indefatigable secretary of the Australian Workers' Union thereupon applied for the appointment of a Royal Commission. The Commission was appointed, and, The strange to say, its chairman was the secretary of the Australian Workers' Union! Fancy the secretary of a claimant union examining the bona fides of his opponenta most indecent state of affairs ! Public feeling was so outraged by this action that the personnel of the Commission had to be altered. Subsequently, a District Court Judge was appointed to take the place of the secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. I mention that case to show the means which can be adopted by any union with political rules to override, through its influence in this Legislature, the judgment of the Court. I do not think it is our duty to increase compulsorily by statute such a power, now in the hands of some unions. Why should we compel men, at the peril of their livelihood, to join organizations, whose officials may seek to override in Parliament the judgments of the Court which it is proposed to establish. Since the Prime Minister has doubted the accuracy of my statements in connection with this case, I may mention that those who were mulcted in damages by the Royal Commission for refusing to give, evidence afterwards appealed .to the Supreme Court, admittedly an impartial tribunal.",16
36,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,On e of its Judges does not seem to be too impartial.,17
37,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Because a Court gives a decision against the party with which the Prime Minister is associated, it is not impartial. What is to happen to the fine theory that we should "" trust the Court,"" if the moment the Bench has the audacity to declare againstmy honourable friends, its impartiality is to be impugned? What were the words used by the Judge upon the occasion to which I refer? He saidHere we have a thrice defeated litigant, first obtaining a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly of which Committee he is chairman, to inquire into the subject matter of the litigation, followed by the appointment of a Royal Commission, of which at first he is made President, and the members he had selected for the Select Committee of the House made members. Common decency at last prevailedThat is very strong language, coming from the Chief Justice of New South Wales.",17
38,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is very strong language.,17
39,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He proceedsand led to the alteration of this, and after having been made a member of the Royal Commission, he is finally excluded, his nominees, however, remaining as members and a District Court Judge being nominated as President. these facts demonstrate that no matter of public interest was involved, but merely an inquiry into private litigation between parties, a matter with which the Arbitration Court, if properly invoked, had full power to adjudicate upon, and do complete justice to, as between the parties? The officers of the union sought to go behind the decision of the Court when they found that their demands would not be acceded to. I do not think that is what honourable members upon this side of the 'House intend when they sanction industrial legislation such as is proposed in this Bill.",17
40,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Most of the honourable members opposite, including the honourable member, are opposed to the Bill.",17
41,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister very often seeks to discredit certain members of the Opposition who have declared themselves opposed to the principle which is contained in this Bill. He frequently attempts to discredit their motives in urging amendments, of this character. But I would ask whether his own bona fides are not equally impugnable? Upon page 2568 of Hansard he is reported as sayingI have already admitted in this Chamber on several occasions that for some years I was not in favour of compulsory arbitration. I did not favour it until I saw that is was possible to use the unions as influencing bodies, with a view to enforce the awards of the Court. I am opposed to the principle of arbitration as it is laid down in this Bill, because I hold that the measure makes for the political aggrandisement of honourable members opposite, and not for industrial peace. The Prime Minister has declared that he does not desire industrial peace unless the trades unions are to be. intrusted with the control of it.",17
42,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is a peculiar interpretation to place upon my remarks.,17
43,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Prime Minister admits that he did not favour compulsory arbitration .until he saw it was possible to use the unions to enforce the awards of the Court. One of these political unions has sought to evade the awards of the Court.,17
44,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is a misstatement.,17
45,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I refer the Prime Minister to the remarks of the Chief Justice of New South Wales upon the question.,17
46,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Chief Justice is not a deity.,17
47,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then where shall we obtain the services of the omniscient individual who will be required to preside over the s proposed Court? Do not Mr WILSON - We are told that we must "" trust the Court.""",17
48,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member's idea is to "" bust"" the Court.",17
49,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is unfair to urge that we seek to destroy the Bill because we support amendments which are aimed - at the very root of its secret politicalobject. If I were in the position of the - Prime Minister, and wished to gain an enormous power at the hands of the people, I should ask for it straightforwardly and openly. I should not seek under the guise of securing industrial peace to force men to join unions, and, by contributing to the funds of those unions, to support the party, l t shows extreme sight on the part of honourable members opposite- a kind of foresight that I should be very loth to imitate !",17
50,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The percentage unionists in my electorate, as compared with others, is hardly worth mentioning.",18
51,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister qualifications of a nature that naturally commend him to all classes, but some able members opposite stand entirely the "" ticket"" in the same way that honourable members on this side of the House stand in a hidebound way on the fiscal question. The Prime Minister may have but few unionists in his electorate.",18
52,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What did the honourable member get in on?,18
53,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I certainly got into this House on a ticket-the straight-out queswords tion of free-trade.,18
54,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But for that he stood on a "" ticket"" the honourable member would not have gained a seat in this House.",18
55,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I stood as a I signed no pledge. I was simply asked, ""Are you a free-trader?"" that I was, showed that I could win the seat, was selected, and secured a victory. I am not bound hand and foot to any party has not done so. platform as are some honourable members, opposite. Members of certain unions are bound hand and foot, individually and collectively, to support members of the Labour Party, and the Government proposal in the Court. regard to unionists would compel men seeking employment to join such unions and vote individually and collectively for members of the Labour Party.",18
56,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is perfectly untrue, and the honourable member knows that it is.",18
57,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I would ask Mr Chairranks. man that the Minister of External Affairs be called upon to withdraw that statement.,18
58,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Minister mustunion. withdraw the remark. He is not in order in saying that the statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth fectly untrue, and that he knows it is.",18
59,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I withdraw the statewere ment "" that the honourable member knows that it is,"" although he has many times that the statement is incorrect. The assertion he has made is to my knowtee ledge perfectly untrue. It may not be to the honourable member's knowledge, but although he has been told half-a-dozen he times that it is he persists in repeating fore- In deference to parliamentary usage I withdraw the statement.",18
60,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am never unparliamentary in my attitude to the honourable of and learned member when he makes assertions of which I do not approve. He asserts that I have been told on authority has which I must accept-of his party, in fact-that the statement. I made just honornow is untrue, and that I am neveron the less repeating it . To the best of some my knowledge the statement is true. I believe it to be correct, and am, therefore, arguing on an absolutely fair basis. If honourable members opposite do not like it, that fact only gives point to my argument. There must be considerable force in it when it causes honourable members opposite to become so excited. I have quoted used by the Prime Minister, showing that he too would not support compulsory the fact arbitration unless unions were granted the power of being influencing bodies.",18

It has been shown that the one union in New South Wales which, accordamendment ing to the president, the honourable member for Darling, is a political body, has not made for industrial peace, but has sought to harry the Court on all sides. I confess that if one did not take into consideration the secret motive behind this Bill, he forced. would be rather staggered at the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister in opposdestroy ing amendments of this description. honourable gentleman tells us that this amendment would, if carried, emasculate the Bill.

The Government fully realise that within a very short time the Bill ate a.great political machine; that in a very short time this political machine would give them, in place of the power to strike, the power to confiscate.

73,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-They are the machinists.,19
74,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Darling is qne of the "" machinists."" If that is what they are after-and I oppose the Bill for the reason, among others, that I think that it is-the n the Committee should vote solidly for the amendment. We should say that no man shall be compelled to a union, especially if his compulsion means building up a machine such as that I have just outlined, a machine designed' not secure industrial peace, but to give our orable friends opposite a power which I not think they are worthy to possess, which they certainly would not exercise the best interests of the community as a whole.",19
75,Mr MCDONA LD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," If the were carried it would practically render the best part of the Bill of no avail. I take it that the Bill has been framed practically to endeavour to induce men to join organizations, because it is only by means of organizations that awards can be enThe amendment, however, would destroy organizations, and in that way the principal object of the Bill. The The honourable member for Wentworth, in about the fiftieth second-reading speech that he has delivered on this measure, has talked of many matters of which he knbws absolutely He speaks of the Machine Shearers' Union as a respectable body of men; but every one knows that they are more than the paid satellites of interested parties.

81,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Why has the membership of the Machine Shearers' Union increased by 500 per cent, during the last two years?",19
82,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will explain why that bogus union was started. Some years ago the trades unions were told that their join members had no right to strike; that a strike was practically an act of civil war, which brought disaster upon the whole comto munity. Our proper course, it was said, honwas to endeavour to redress our grievances do by constitutional methods, by sending men and into Parliament to represent our views. in But directly the trades unions became political organizations, they encountered the enmitv of the capitalists and their satellites, who did all they could to break down their growing power.",19
83,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That the Australian Workers' Union is not a growing power is proved by the fact that its membership has decreased in two years from 20,000 to about 11,000.",20
84,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the honourable member will look at this morning's newspaper, and read the result of the elections in Western Australia, he will see that the Labour Party is a growing power there.",20
85,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The result of the recent Victorian elections proved it to be a growing power here. - Mr MCDONALD - Yes , and the result of the last Federal elections proved it to be a growing power throughout the Commonwealth. A short time ago, it would have been deemed impossible that a Labour Ministry should be intrusted with the conduct of Australian affairs of State, but that is the position today.",20
86,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Labour Party had not then declared, by supporting an Arbitration Bill such as we are now considering, that non-unionists were not to be permitted to live; because if they are not permitted to work they cannot live.",20
87,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable and learned member, the honourable members for Wentworth and New England, and one or two more, are wreckers. They have told us that they will vote for any amendment which will wreck the Bill.",20

89,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , the honourable member is a little wiser than the others, though that is the line of actnn which he has taken. It has repeatedly been said that if the Bill is passed, non-unionists will be unable to live. happened after the great maritime strike, and the great shearers' strike? people on whose behalf honourable members opposite are advocating the claims of non-unionists discharged their non-unionist employees as soon as the strike was over, to take on unionist employees. The employers have repeatedly declared that the best men are generally to be found in trades unions or other labour organizations. It is idle to say that if the Bill is passed non-unionists will be unable to live. They have every opportunity to join unions. For a union to close its books is childish. When we have been defeated in a strike, it has generally been by those to whom admission has been refused. I have always held that it is not the duty of those who control unions to ascertain the fitness of the workmen who wish to join them; that is the business of the employers. The object of those who control unions should be to get as many men as possible to join, so as to organize the industry. Honourable gentlemen opposite appear to fear that those who are now non-unionists will be driven into labour organi-' zations, and used for political purposes. Since 1890, when the new unionism came into existence, it has been a political movement.  Parliament for 'reform.",20
90,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes . Unionism is now a political as well as an industrial movement. I do not see how the two can be separated.,20
91,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They can be separated.,20
92,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The old unionism could do nothing to effect reforms. So long as the capitalists sat tight, they could defeat the unionists in every case. But when the unions obtained political power, the capitalists found it necessary to rise in arms against them. Now they hold that everything that is bad is connected with trades unionism.",20
93,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the condition of the worker today better than it was ten years ago?,20
94,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The capitalist is as able to 'fleece the worker today as he was ten or twenty years ago; but' one of the great obstacles to reform has been removed by the granting of an equal franchise. The right to. vote will be wielded by the unionists in such a way that in the future capitalists will not be able to fleece the But what workers as they have done in the past. To-day the worker labours four days of the The very week for his employer and two days for himself. The honourable member for Wentworth and others would like to maintain that state ef things.,20

100,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member cannot say that he honestly believes in conciliation and arbitration.,21
101,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , I do.",21
102,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then he must have very crude notions on the subject.,21

104,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hope that, at all events, the standard adopted by the Committee with regard to the means necessary to secure industrial peace will be higher than those of the honourable member. If he believes in the amendment, which would practically preclude the'whole of the existing trades unions from becoming recognised under the Bill, and necessitate the formation of new organizations, I cannot come to any other conclusion than that his desire is to wreck the Bill . our object is to secure industrial peace, let us deal with the Bill in a fair and honest way, and not follow the dishonest and fraudulent methods adopted by the honourable member for Wentworth and other honourable members who entertain the same views.",21
105,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I rise to a point of order. I have been accused by the honourable member for Kennedy of dishonesty and fraud. I would ask that that statement should be withdrawn.,21
106,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the honourable member takes my statement personally, I must withdraw it.",21
107,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I could-not help taking it personally, because the honourable member mentioned my name.",21
108,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I say that the action of the honourable member in connection with the Bill does not permit me to form any other conclusion .than that which I have indicated.,21
109,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I ask that the honourable member should be requested to withdraw his statement.,21
110,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member must know that I am only speaking politically. I trust that the amendment will not be carried, because it will make the B i ll useless. It is ridiculous to suppose that the whole of the trades unions in Australia will alter their constitutions merely for the purpose of coming under the Bill, which would probably apply to only two or three of them. I think they would be very foolish indeed to adopt any such course, and I should certainly so advise the very large bodies with which I am connected.",21
111,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Surely they will have to come under the Bill , whether they like it cr not. If not, the measure will be useless.",21
112,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If by any possibility the existing unions can avoid coming under the operation of the Bill, I shall certainly do everything in my power to dissuade them from rendering themselves subject to its provisions. I consider that if they did so it would be detrimental to them, and also inimical to industrial peace. One of the employers' organizations has already spent thousands of pounds in establishing a bogus organization for the express purpose of defeating the objects of the New South Wales Arbitration Act. The political Chief Justice of New South Wales, who recently gave a decision relating to that bogus union, must have known If that it was a fraud.",21
113,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the honourable member mean by a politicalChief Justice ?,21
114,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I refer to the Chief Justice of New South Wales, who, by his action, has declared himself to be a political Judge. If the New South Wales Government have any grit they will at once suspend him.",21
115,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member seems to forget that two other Judges concurred with Chief Justice Darley; are they also political Judges?,21
116,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The other two Judges referred to did not take up the same position as the Chief Justice. Their remarks dealt with the question of law that was submitted for their decision; but the Chief Justice went beyond that, and, so far as an ordinary man can observe, took the part of a strong political advocate.",21
117,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, I would draw - attention to the fact that the honourable member is discussing a matter that does not seem to come within the scope of the clause.",21
118,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I may point out that the honourable member for Wentworth is responsible for the introduction of this subject into the debate.,21
119,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I simply quoted a judgment of the Court, whereas the honourable member has gone beyond that, and ""has applied hard names to the Chief Justice of New South Wales,",21
120,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member dragged in the subject to suit his own party ends, and thereby adopted a most despicable method' of argument.",22
121,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would point out that, although the Chief Justice of New South Wales is not an officer of the Commonwealth, it would perhaps be in better taste if honourable members were to refrain from discussing his conduct. If he were a Commonwealth oflicer, honourable members would be precluded by the Standing Orders from referring to his conduct, except in connection with a substantive motion. I think it would be better if the action of the Judges of the States were not made the subject of further discussion here.",22
122,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I quite agree with you, Mr Chairman, that perhaps it is not good taste to make such references as you. have mentioned, but I cannot help the bad taste displayed by the honourable member for Wentworth, who introduced the subject. He introduced the matter in order to serve purely party purposes.",22
123,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not accuse the honourable member of having initiated the discussion; I simply ask him not to continue it.,22
124,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that I am justified, under the circumstances, in referring to the statements made by the honourable member for Wentworth. I do not, however, intend to pursue the matter any further. I trust that the amendment will not be carried.",22
125,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," It is a somewhat singular circumstance, but it is one with which men of any experience in public life are quite familiar, that, as a rule, those public men who themselves claim the right to express their honest opinions in the coarsest possible language are most sensitive when some other person seems to have fallen into a similar mistake. I think that, from time to time, in every country, there must arise occasions when individual members of the community may entertain opinions with reference to the utterances even of the best Judges that ever sat on a Bench. But there has been this distinguishing feature of our peopleperhaps it distinguishes otlier people too, but I know more of our own people-that in spite sometimes of mistakes on the part of persons exercising high judicial functions their conduct has always been treated in a generous and respectful way, partly because of the position they occupy, and partly because of the fact that they cannot reply to attack. Those are two very weighty reasons why, even if some high judicial functionary seems to go a little beyond the strict line, we should view a lapse of that sort as not at all calling upon us to brand a Judge as a "" Political Judge."" It is a gross abuse of the right of free discussion to brand one of the noblest men who ever, lived as a citizen or a colonist in Australia, by such an infamous name, because, perhaps, he may have lapsed into the use of an expression or two from which a greater degree of prudence might have saved him. The whole of the circumstances were extraordinary. I only wish that every other man in New South Wales, who has high responsible duties to perform, would perform them with the same singularly efficient honour and rectitude as that distinguished man has shown throughout his long career in that State. The honourable member talks of wreckers of this Bill , but he has himself shown that unless he and his friends get their own way, they are prepared to wreck the Bill. They are prepared not only to wreck the Bill, but to wreck it in the worse possible way, and that is after it has become an Act of Parliament. Why should the honourable member be so bitter about other honourable members who differ from him as to the propriety of attempting legislation of this kind, when he says that if he does not get his way about this amendment he will use all the great influence he has with the labour organizations of Australia to shipwreck this measure by preventing them from takincr full advantage of it. The honourable member for Darling is a man for whom we always have a thorough respect as one who fearlessly expresses his honest conviction, and. I will say that, after all, a man who has that merit, which he certainly has, ought .to be a little tolerant of other men who claim the same right, although, perhaps, occasionally their language may be considered in excess of. what is necessary, or their arguments may be entirely wrong. I quite agree with the honourable member for Kennedy when he says that the trades unions were thorough political movements. But they were political movements in the most honourable sense. At the time the pioneers of trades unionism met together a system prevailed which was offensive to every honest man's idea of common justice. Whilst men who had large resources of wealth, and occupied commanding influence in the industrial world, needed no sort of combination, because of their enormous strength, the weak workers of the old country had only one resource in their endeavour to get anything like honest conditions of equality, and that was to band themselves together in these trades unions. Their movement was a po litical one in the noblest possible sensethe sense of fighting for right and justice for themselves and their class. That aspect of the trades union and the trades unionist is one with which, I think, no man who has even a glimmering of liberal ideas can fail to be heartily in sympathy. I am expressing but my own opinion, and I candidly admit that I have had the greatest admiration for those men. I do not care whether they be trades unionists or the men who formed political leagues, because the principle is the same-ther e was a great wrong to be redressed. It is, of course, a nobler movement still when the wrong for which redress - is sought is which does not affect the individual interests of those who make the endeavour to redress it. The state of things existing when the trades union laws were passed was such that, even putting it upon selfish grounds, it was the selfishness which demanded merely fair play and proper recognition of undoubted rights. been looking at some of these Trades Union Acts, and one cannot have a greater proof of the unfair view which was taken by the laws of the old country, and even of Australia, than is to be found in looking at these Acts. The last Trades Union Act of New South Wales was passed in 1881, in a democratic community possessing manhood suffrage, yet if any one will look at that Act, he will find that it does not give trades unions the power to recover by law the subscriptions of their own members due under their own rules. It actually does not give them ' any power with reference to agreements for benefits amongst themselves. It is couched, even in New South Wales, in the old Tory jealous spirit, which resisted giving men the ordinary rights of political free men. We are all at one, I hope, on points of that sort, and when the honourable member for Darling speaks of wrecking the Bill, he ought to remember - that his own party wrecked the Bill to begin with. The Bill was proceeding in charge of a Govern-' ment which, in alliance with the Laboui Party, dominated this Chamber against all comers, and would have continued to do so if honourable members opposite had remained in that alliance. But, on one point- I do not say it was an unimportant point, but in view of the importance of the measure it was not one of very great importance-honorabl e members opposite broke this overwhelming alliance which gave T them infinitely more power than they will ever have again. When I say "" ever "" I mean within my lifetime. I do not wish to prophesy for remote years, but, speaking for the next eight or ten years, so far as I . am concerned-and it is only a matter of opinion, oh which I may be entirely wrong - m y opinion as' a. man who has had some experience in politics is that the position which the party that is now in office occupied whilst the late Government was in office was one of a great degree of strength and power to carry out their own views. That position has been fractured and wrecked by their own act.",22
126,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not by our act. one Mr MCDONALD - We do not worry about it.,23
127,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member does not, and I hope that honourable members opposite generally will have no further cause to do so. What I wish to point out is that these epithets about wrecking the Bill can be exchanged. I have Mr MCDONALD - They can be, and they have been by some honourable members opposite.",23
128,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am aware of that, but I am putting another view of it. I quite agree that my honourable friend is justified in using the expression as applied to some one who has acknowledged that that is what he desired to do.",23
129,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The right honourable gentleman is in favour of the principle of the Bill ?,23
130,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When anv honourable member stands up and says that he desires to wreck the Bill, another honourable member, as a friend to the measure, is entitled to reproach him with it, and to watch everything that he does. So far as I am concerned, I remind honourable members that I look upon this Bill, not as the property of the late Government or the property of the Labour Party-the present Government-bu t as equally the property of the Opposition. I cannot control individual opinions of my,party. Some of the memit bers of that party may wish to see this under the table, but I do not make my assurances to the public in a spirit of that utterances sort.

That is I wish to the trades unions occupy as free and a position in regard to the reforms for which they agitate, and the methods which they employ, as does every other individual and every other body. As and I would limit none of them, that means a But whilst the trades unionists-the free-traders and protectionists in six their different bodies-hav e a perfect right to take an active part in politics, to exercollectively their power in order to advance the views which they conceive to be for the benefit of the country, we ought to n the draw sharp lines between the warring interests of individuals and societies' and the temple of justice. Let us fight in politics as fiercely and freely as we will, but when we erect a temple of justice, which is to be unswayed by interest, passion, or politics, we ought to draw the clearest possible line between the fighting political organization and the party to an industrial dispute which is under the control of a Judge of the land. I confess that at first I did not see the full significance of the great issue which is now at stake. I admit that one is tempted to d r if t with the current of these great changes, and not to exercise the scrutiny that he should upon matters pf this sort. But I fully realise now that there is a great principle at stake in the amendment under consideration, and that it is one upon which the honourable and learned member for Angas is quite entitled to take the opinion of the Committee. entertain that view for several reasons. A man may hold aloof from a political organization if he does not agree with its aims, and yet occupy precisely the same position, as regards his daily bread, irrespective of whether he is a member of a Protectionist League or of a Free-trade League. There is no industrial boycott upon him. The difference that is involved is this: That unless some such principle be affirmed in connection with the working of this Court, this latest achievement of democracy will become a greater grinder of the poor than has existed within the British Empire for the last JOO years. adoption of the ballot in England it could not be said, even there, that a man had the freedom of his political convictions. If the 'poor tenant, the poor farmer, or the poor farm labourer in England exercised an honest vote, which happened to be in conflict with the views of his employer, he was practically ruined. But thanks to the ballot-box, both in England and Australia, such a state of affairs has been abolished. In Australia, however, we have now a new sort of crime. Democracy, having .redressed the political crimes of the past, has invented a new crime of its own. We could not have a more odious invention than that which condemns a man, if he exercises his own free, independent judgment, to penalties in the performance of his honest labour. What could be worse? If we interfered with a man's religion, but allowed him to work, he could still obtain bread for himself and his wife and children; if we interfered with his political convictions he might still be able to work and earn bread for his wife 5D2 and family. But now if a man objects to join a union he has to consider whether he will have the privilege of working for those who are dependent upon him. . If these proposals are to triumph there will be two avenues to courts of justice for vital matters affecting a man's work. This will touch a man seriously. If he is to live, he must eat. When a man cannot obtain work he becomes a canker- a pauper in spite of himself. Is there a worse injury which a workman of the right type could sustain than that of such enforced idleness as to make him the seeker - of charity? Is there anything which could more completely undermine, not only the man, but the community, than the feeling that the very men who talk of equal opportunities, who pull down the most venerable instituI tions in order to give what they call equal political opportunities, are the very first - to try to make opportunities for honest work unequal-unequal, not against the capitalist, not against the man who can take care of himself, for a man who has money can usually do so-bu t against their own fellow workmen? Take the terrorism embodied in the expression used in this House the other day by the honourable member for Kennedy. Is there an epithet from which a decent workman more naturally shrinks than that of "" scab "" or ""blackleg"""" ? It is a name which does not designate a legal offence or lead to a gaol, but makes the Before the man to whom it is applied an outcast in his class; an object of scorn to his fellow workmen throughout Australia. What is the new class to which this epithet is to apply? Is it a class consisting of but one or two stragglers? No. It is a brand to be applied to practically all the workers of Australia.",24

I should not object to the right honourable member quoting the vyords that 1 used' on the occasion in question, but although I have requested him to do so, he declines to mention exactly what I did say. He is incorrect in attributing to me the statement to which he has referred. Unless he quotes the whole statement, the meaning of the remarks made by me is not 'faithfully conveyed to the Committee. take exception to the statement made by the right honourable member, and ask whether he is in order in repeating what I say is untrue ?",26
147,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member must know that no one has a right to interrupt an honourable member because he feels that something attributed to him is in conflict with something that he said, and is therefore untrue.",26
148,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I say that what the honourable member has said of me just now is untrue.,26
149,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That statement adds another offence to the honourable member's list. . Mr MCDONALD - If the right honourable member will' not withdraw the statement complained of, I must say that it is untrue.",26
150,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That does not prove anything. I simply claim the right to speak without being interrupted in this way. The honourable member is not in order in interrupting me, in order to state that I have said something which varies with a statement made by him.

156,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I suppose I am entitled to the same indulgence that is accorded to every other honourable member. When an honourable member is referring to remarks made by others he does not carry a volume of Hansard under his arm in order to be able at once to show the correctness of his statement; but my honest recollection is 1 that the statement. I have made in regard to the honourable member for Kennedy is correct. A perusal of Hansard will enable me to show that it is.,26
157,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I will tell the right honourable member in two or three words what I did say.,26

They are sitting in a House in which the Government are members of trades unions, while every member of the party behind them is a trade unionist.",28

186,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We have such regard.,28
187,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course. The tender regard of honourable gentlemen for those who would never come under their wing is very touching. May I suggest to my natural one. honourable friends that, whilst there is some honest merit in persuading a rational ing to join a union, whilst that is a praiseKennedy, worthy act, there is no merit, but a great deal of infamy, in using political power drive free men into unions which they do not wish to join. My honourable friends are in this position. Either admission to their trades unions has been honestly open to their fellow working men, or it has not been so. If it has not been so, they been doing a great wrong. They have"" been establishing one of those corrupt ganizations which were the scandal of dustrial affairs in England eighty years ago, of fact. and are a scandal in many other countries today, and which have the effect of refor peating in a more dangerous and form the iniquities which used to be inflicted upon the workers of the world by means of capital. As I say, the scene is changed. This power, which is now dominant, instead of showing just regard, in its hour of triumph, for the interests of the great masses of the people who are not within the ranks of the unions is trying under cover of this Federal Act, to boycott them. If this proposal were put in plain English in an Act of Parliament, it would be received with universal execration. If , in plain English, we embodied in one little Bill the proposition that if , by a certain date, the workers in a given industry did not join a certain trades union, they would be debarred from employment, jwould it not be regarded as reviving the most odious tyrannies of the dark ages? Such a measure would indeed be a good Trades Union Act !  the Bill, and the right honourable gentleman knows it.",28
188,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is becoming a fashionable phrase.  orable gentleman tell the truth, and treat the Bill fairly?",28
189,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member need not be offensive. ,28
190,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is offensive when he uses such an expression as ""why don't you tell the truth."" If I am erring through ignorance, I should be corrected. It should not be assumed that I am saying that which I know to be incorrect. The honourable member may not have heard my previous remarks, and, therefore, his observation may have been a My point is that it is admitted that trades unions are political orbeganizations.

192,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Oh , I see. I am in the have hands of my honourable friends, because they do know all about it, and I do not. orTherefore, I am not going to question anyinthing that they say with regard to matters ",28
193,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member Kennedy has lived the best past of his mischievous life in Queensland.,28
194,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know that, but I did think that he was not one of those insular. trades unionists who do not know anything - about the trades unions of Australia outhe side of their own State. I rather think that the honourable member for Kennedy has figured as a representative at trades union conferences, and, therefore, my honof orable friend must not throw him over that way. Ministers are becoming dexterous in shifting the onus. But we are all only, human when we find ourselves in position of difficulty. For the present, accept the honourable member for Kennedy as a well-informed authority upon Austraterrorizing lian trades unions. It may turn out that he knows nothing about them, and that may be because he is not a Minister. I know nothing of these things; but I accept for the present as a well-informed authorthe ity. He has said that the trades unions thing very much worse. are political bodies, and I have said that they were justly so, because they had grave grievances to redress. I have actually plauded the trades unions for acting in the way they have done to redress their grievof ances. The Labour Party may keep their trades unions and make them as political as they like. They are just as much titled to exist as are"" the Free-trade League or the Protectionist Association - I give them the same latitude that I claim for self.",28
195,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the associations which the right honourable gentleman refers are given up-the y are dead.,29
196,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But they are not dead in the sense that the honourable member seems to imply. Have honourable members noticed the beautiful regard for fiscal which is evinced in the composition of the present Ministry ? We have four Ministers opened to non-unionists. on one side and four on the other. They talk about our sinking the fiscal question, ditions being equal? but the Labour Party took substantial guarantees in the composition of the Ministhe try that that issue should be sunk, because there are four Ministers pulling one way and four pulling the other.",29
197,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is no pulling at,29
198,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is quite right.,29
199,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are like the right honourable gentleman. If he were here he would not pull on the fiscal question the slightest degree.,29
200,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not complaining. Whilst I thoroughly admit that every body in the world has a perfect right to do it likes under the law, I contend that any week. person who may be outside of one of these bodies has also a perfect right to do what likes. If , in the exercise of his freedom, he stays outside a union, he should not be subject to a boycott. The trades union boycott is serious enough; but since the boycott the trades unions and the abuse involved in in the application of epithets, such as "" scab"" and "" blackleg,"" do not guide fearless working men into the unions in a order to escape the stigma of such abuse, I we are asked to apply other pressuresince all these means of influencing and of men, exerted by the trades unions of Australia, have absolutely failed, this trades union Ministry comes along and asks, not a trades union House of Parliamenthim we have not reached that stage yet-bu t Commonwealth Legislature to do some-, They ask us to do something infinitely worse.

The glory of all our other to Courts is that there is only one entrance for litigants-the entrance of perfect equality so far as the law can make equal a people some of whom are poor and some rich. This is a proposal that there should be two doors in a Court of Justice. The main door is to be open to trades unionists, truth and if employment can be found only for trades unionists, the side door is never to be What does preference to unionists mean, all other conThat until every unionist in a district has secured work, all non-unionists in that district must starve, or find some other work, or be kept by the State. ' The Minister of External Affairs referred the other day to one of the all. largest and most powerful unions in Sydney. I think I am correct in calling it the Wharf Labourers' Union. He depicted a sad state of affairs in that union-consider in ing the importance of Sydney as a port.. I was told that the Minister stated that for a long time, owing to some cause or other, the members of that union had not been able to obtain full employment, and that they had what earned on the average only some 15s. per",29
201,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I said that during the last five months a great number of the members of the union had not averaged more than that.,30
202,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My honourable friend, who knows all about the union, corroborates what I say. I ask honourable members to regard that as an illustration. wonder at these unfortunate men in the union trying to keep out other men, when they are not able to earn even a living wage for the support of themselves and their families? We have not yet, I hope, come down to such a miserable state of affairs that 15s. per week is considered a full wage for men engaged in working on the wharfs.",30
203,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They have to live on it.,30
204,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They are under the miserable necessity of living on it somehow; but we know what that means. It means running into debt to the landlord and to the people who supply their daily wants.,30
205,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Nevertheless , they must live on it.",30
206,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We accept the facts as presented by my honourable friend. state of affairs described exists in the Wharf Labourers' Union in the great shipping port of Sydney, I think I am taking a fair example.",30
207,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Arbitration Act in New South Wales has not done them much good.,30
208,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not going to inquire into the causes of the unfortunate state of affairs. The thing itself is a miserable fact which must excite the humane feelings of any man. I have not time, in view of facts of that kind, to enter upon a critical disquisition as to whether they were brought about by the operation of the Tariff or of the Arbitration Act, or by the action of employers, or by the withdrawal of English capital. That is a proper inquiry in its proper place. I am only taking the facts as they are presented to us, and I ask, can we wonder that these unfortunate wharf labourers, who are themselves earning only a starvation wage, should throw obstacles in the way of other men coming into the union and increasing their destitution? It is wrong, of course, and they had to be coerced by the Court, which must administer the Act as fairly as it can. But we can appreciate the human nature of it. and the terrible strain on the men. I am taking that as a picture of misery now under our very eyes, in connection with one of the best unions in the port of Sydney. I ask honourable members to consider the universal wretchedness which must prevail in these bad times. There was a time when we could do anything, and it would be all right. We have left that time behind us, and have reached a stage when the problem of mere existence is striking at the very Can we heart of the proudest trades unions in the richest centres of industry on this Continent. If that be the condition of affairs in the large centres, we know how hard the lot must be in many places more remote from the public eye. This is a bad state of affairs. But, in the midst of such conditions, are we in the name of the laws of the Commonwealth, going to pick out, in the struggle for existence, the men who belong to the unions, and make them the wards of this Australian chancery, and make the other men of labour in Australia the outcasts of a Court of law ? Well, do it if you like ; but let it not be said when honourable members vote, that the consequences cannot be foreseen. Let it not be said that it is done by accident or owing to want of knowledge of the full conseI f the quences of such an iniquitous proposal. Fortunately, our Courts of Justice have kept in touch in some marvellous way with the humanity and progress of mankind, and they still continue to do so, so far as our Empire is concerned. In the midst of the surging, tumultuous powers which rage outside the precincts of the Court, in spite of the terrific convulsions, the awful struggles between capitalists and large bodies of workmen, we have had in our British Courts of justice this noble history, that even in the House of Lords, even in* that historicHouse of privilege, the rights of the poorest union in England are safe. The House of Lord* has been known to lay down the laws in favour of the unions in a way that the Courts below never had done. It would be something worth having for men of all classes-that somewhere in the Commonwealth the poorest man would be safe. I say that in these Commonwealth Courts of Justice we want, if we can, to preserve these grand traditions. Was there ever a time when we should be more anxious to preserve them, than when we are establishing a Court which is not to be a Court as all these other Courts are, in which A and B, citizens, banks, finance companies, can bring their civil actions, but at r i bunal of an entirely different character? This is to be a Court in which the great captains of industry-whethe r they represent employers or workmen-ar e to meet and struggle and fight. We bring humanity into this Court. We make the bread of the most friendless child in the most remote parts of Australia depend upon the dictum of a Justice of the High Court That is the tremendous power, the awful obligation which we are going to impose npon a Justice of the High Court. will be beset, on one side, by great industrial unions, and, on the other, by great employers' unions, and in the battle between these mighty forces, where will the masses of the workers of Australia come in ? may be told that the common rule will be applicable to them. But I claim that the common rule which may be observed in some large factories in a great city may deprive thousands of men throughout Australia of their employment. I do not care for these big cities and great unions so much as I do for the isolated workmen who are scattered over the villages and bush throughout Australia. They have no unions, no counsel, no wealth, and no power. If we must establish an industrial Court, if we must have a temple of Justice devoted to the settlement of the most difficult problems of human existence, all men should at least start fair, and the individual who is not a party to a suit should not be deprived of his work because somebody has won his case before the Court. The honourable and learned member for Angas has asserted a great principle, We hear much about granting a preference to unionists. That is a perfectly legitimate aim for a trades union to keep in view- a perfectly legitimate thing for a free-trade league, so far as the - battles of politics are concerned. But, should we not despise a free-trader or a protectionist, who, when a man applied him for employment, inquired, not, "" Are vou a good workman ?"" or "" Have you a good record?"" but "" Do you belong to a protectionist league or to a free-trade league ?"" ",30
209,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,If T had my way I should hound out of the country any man who did that.,31
210,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They ask more pertinent questions than that in Sydney.,31
211,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Any man who does that I do not care who or what he is-is an enemy to society.,31
212,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are all agreed upon ;that point.,31
213,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am sure that the practice is not adopted by employers generally.,31
214,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Withi n the past few weeks men have been dismissed in Victoria because of their political opinions. - Mr Reid - Our attitude towards any such outrage would be absolutely the same. The point I wish to emphasize is, that He whilst in this democracy we fight as free men, we do not place a ban upon any individual on account of his political opinions. That is the act of some eccentric, illiberal individual. To-day we are We asked to do that which we all denounce as infamous, and we are asked to do it by Act of Parliament, not to one man, but to hundreds of thousands of men. My honourable friends opposite can do these things, and go back to their trades unions crowned with laurels. It will be a great achievement for them - The Minister of External Affairs can go back to the wharf labourers of Sydney- I think that he has been honorary secretary of their organization for many years",31
215,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not. I am secretary of the Wharf Labourers' Union, but not "" honorary "" secretary.",31
216,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I was unconsciously putting the matter in a more favourable light.,31
217,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think so.,31
218,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,At any rate I stated it in a way that was not offensive.,31
219,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the right honourable member mean?,31
220,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,If a man is engaged in political life he can afford to hold honorary positions in connection with unions of his fellows.,31
221,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have never received a fractional part of a penny for services rendered to any union with which I have been to associated.,31
222,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It was for that reason that I designated the Minister "" honorary secretary "" of the Wharf Labourers' Union.",31
223,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I wished to correct the right honourable member because in the case of that union a technical meaning attaches to the term "" honorary.""",31
224,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not wish to introduce into this debate any but the most fair considerations. I repeat that my honourable friend, who has been secretary of that great union for many years, will be able to go back to the wharf labourers of West Sydney crowned with a laurel wreath.. He will be able to emphasize the advantages conferred by trades unionism. He will be enabled to say, "" We comprise only onesixth or one-seventh or even one-eighth of the - workers of Australia, but see what we have been able to accomplish. We have made the Commonwealth Arbitration Court a little branch of the trades unions of Australia. The laws of Victoria and New South Wales do not allow a union to collect subscriptions in a Court, but we have passed an Act which enables us to penalize non-unionists up to their eyes, and which permits us to use this Court to recover our dues-eve n subscriptions and penalties. In short we have subordinated the Commonwealth to our individual purposes."" I never knew of a great cause being dragged to a lower level. According to the honourable member for Kennedy, we now find that under the glorious banner of industrial peace the militant trades unions are to be led over the prostrate bodies of the non-unionist workers of Australia. If they had gained that advantage in fair fight, I should have nothing to say, but when they wish to make use of this Parliament to further the interests of the unions it is time for some one to attempt to call a halt. I wish now to deal with an argument which has been used during this debate, and which must be considered. The members of trades unions arepossessed of only limited means. Anything which will impose additional burdens upon them is a very proper subject for consideration, because-as has been said-the y are not in a position to throw their money away. I have considered that statement, and I have come to the conclusion that the expense of registering a special organization under the Court would be of the most nominal character. Better still, since expense will have to be incurred by the trades unions in any case, the amendment will not add to their expenditure. effect will be simply to alter the account from which the money is paid. The expenditure will have to be borne in any case. The question involved is merely one ot whether it shall be paid out of one pocket or out of another. What appeals to me in this matter is that we should forget that we are in a State, and remember that we are in a CommonAvealth. We should recollect that the power of a trades union or of a "" part of a union "" to institute proceedings in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which may alter the conditions of labour throughout Australia, is in itself a monstrosity. Let us. just consider what we Mr Reid. are asked to do. Not even a trades union is required to move in the matter. Any single branch of a union in Bourke, Newcastle, Maitland, or Woollongong, can register as an organization, can bring about an industrial convulsion, and confer upon one individual sitting in Melbourne or Sydney the jurisdiction to dictate the conditions of subsistence and existence over the entire Continent. These are very serious matters. If these unions are at one - as I believe they are - in their desire to have some such measure passed, is there anything in the world that would prevent all the trades unions of Australia from affiliating for the purposes of registering under this Bill ? Take the case of the wharf labourers. Would any difficulty be experienced by the unions of wharf labourers throughout Australia in registering as one body under, this measure ?",31
225,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that the amendment does not propose that.,32
226,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment would prevent that from being done.,32
227,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The same men could register as an organization.,32
228,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is what I understand.' The point I wish to make is this: Let us leave the trades unions absolutely free to achieve everything they can. The central idea of all this class of legislation-whe ther it be of a State or a Commonwealth character-is that there shall not be two unions fighting in the same industry. The radical aim-as the honourable member for Darling knows well-and I look upon him as the oldest trades unionist in the Houseis to secure in any industry in a State one the central body. A great deal has been said this afternoon in reference to the Australian Workers' Union and a bogus union. I Its happened to be professionally employed in that case. ,32
229,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was employed by the Australian Workers' Union, but I do not know that I ought to be debarred from making any public utterance on the subject on account of that circumstance. I wish to say fhat I absolutely sympathized with the Australian Workers' Union in every shape and form. The case in question constituted a sheer conspiracy on the part of some pastoralists and some working men of a type in which I do not believe. It was a positive conspiracy to create a bogus union, and their action was not fought with the aid of working men's subscriptions, but with money which came from quite another source. I look with as great detestation as any man can upon the action of men - whether they be employers or workmen - who can be bought over to thwart the honest desire of their fellows to do a very proper, and beneficent thing. I wish to point out, however, that the basis of this sort of legislation must be one union of employees and one union of employers in respect of every industry, in order that the measure may be properly administered. If two workers' unions in the same industry began to light with each other, what chance would they have? If this unity is essential in relation to a State Arbitration Court, how much more vital is it that unions shall be consolidated under a Commonwealth Court? It would, of course, be impracticable to consolidate them so far as all their internal benefits are concerned. The relief of distressed members and like mat-. ters are best dealt with by the local unions familiar with local requirements; but matters affecting an industry carried on all over Australia would be better under the control of a federated union. A federation of the unions of Australia in each line or industry would make them infinitely stronger bodies under this measure than they would be if they remained separate. ",32
230,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is what the honourable and learned member for Angas seeks to secure by the amendment. ,33
231,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I may be under a misapprehension, but I understand that the purpose of the amendment is that, while trades unions shall preserve their own identity, as they stand, in every possible way, they shall, for the purposes of this legislation, form an industrial organization.",33
232,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is it.  ganization ?,33
233,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes.  and learned member for Angas say to that ?,33
234,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that the amendment would allow of either a federated or partially federated organization.,33
235,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hear , .hear.  break up the whole system.",33
236,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No .,33
237,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think not. Let us take the case of a number of unions, relating to the same industry, in New South Wales. rules. The effect of the amendment would be that, even without amalgamating with like bodies in other States"", these unions would be able, for the purposes of this measure, to form an industrial organization and be registered.",33
238,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hear , hear.",33
239,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They would have to form a new organization.,33
240,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course they would ; but might I suggest to my honourable friend that, since we are proposing to create a new Court of Justice for the benefit of the workers generally, trades unionists might well take the little trouble that would be necessary to enable them to march, pace to pace, with us. The existing unions would be able to retain their existing constitutions, so far as their own internal working, which is very often of a local character, was concerned. There would be no trouble, so far as I can see, except the possibility of some of the unions refusing to come in.",33
241,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But that would be outside the scope of the amendment.,33
242,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have put the question to the honourable and learned member for Angas, and he says that it is not.",33
243,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The same persons would constitute the organization.,33
244,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If it could be shown that the amendment would haye the effect submitted by the right honourable member, I do not know that I should oppose it.",33
245,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am very glad to have that statement from the honourable and learned member. Perhaps he would like to explain his position.,33
246,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At the present time a trades union, or any other like body, in New South Wales has to conform to the provisions of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act in reference to industrial organization. For instance, the Wharf Labourers' ""Union is known as the Wharf Labourers' Industrial Union of Employes, and other bodies are called industrial unions. The point made by the honourable and learned member forAngas is that an organization under this Bill would have no connection with a union, that it would have to be a separate body.",33
247,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The same men could pass a resolution declaring themselves an ""organization.""",33
248,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No Mr Glynn:-Yes , they could; and, on doing so, would no longer be bound by the",33
249,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The amendment sets forth that no association shall be registered(a) unless it has been formed and exists solely for the purposes of this Act, or (b) whose funds may be applied to purposes other than the purposes of this Act, or (c) except in respect of the district within which the place of employment is situate. The reading which my honourable and learned friend gives to the amendment is such that it would not alter or have any effect on the clause as it stands.",34
250,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , it would separate the finances.",34
251,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am not arguing the general point. I am simply referring to ' what is done in New South Wales.,34
252,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," We can settle this controversy afterwards; but I can assure the Minister of External A f fairs that if he is in sympathy with the idea that I have expressed I shall be prepared to give him every assistance in carrying it out. I am simply taking the amendment as it stands. My view of the position of an honourable member who votes for the second reading of a Bil l is that, in doing so, he commits himself to an attempt to pass that Bil l into law subject to amendments which he may think necessary. felt that I was strongly opposed to such an attempt being made in the present case, I should not have voted for the motion for the second reading of the Bill . Government to understand that whenever we reach a proposal in regard to which they are able to meet my objections, instead of persisting in, or aggravating them, I shall do my best to assist in passing it in a form in which it would be most desirable. If the Ministry could suggest anything else that would better meet the object I have in view, I should be only too happy to vote for it. I must say that paragraph c of the amendment gives me some anxiety. I think it requires some explanation.",34
253,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is not essential to the first two paragraphs.,34
254,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not quite follow the proposal contained in paragraph c.,34
255,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is for the purpose of a subsequent amendment of which I have given notice.,34
256,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is some ambiguity about it. It seems to me at present that it would restrict the generality which I am advocating. I believe that it would be in the interests of trades unionists to give - effect to the proposal I have in view, just as the principle of trades unionism is. in itself, a good one- a combination giving single trades unionists the fulcrum of the powers which they have since exercisedso by the association of trades unions would their fulcrum become an infinitely stronger one. The very principle of trades unionism is to make a trades union as comprehensive and as strong as possible. I suppose that my honourable friends opposite will agree with me that the ideal of all trades unions is reached when no worker in the industry, with which it is associated, and carrying on operations in the locality to which it applies, remains outside it , unless he happens to be some undesirable person. The ideal of a trades union is that every competent worker in the industry, to which it belongs, shall be a member of it , and this proposal would, in that respect, have a tremendous effect in helping trades unionism. It would not sacrifice its individual power. These organizations might introduce a large number of persons not in trades unions; but the unions would have absolutely no power over the organizations. We should have in each case an organization limited to one matter, and even if the union were swamped by the If I had organization, its rules and duties could not be altered by it .",34
257,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Unde r a subsequent clause it is provided that the GovernorI wish the General may by proclamation declare any union to be an organization within the meaning of the Act. That might enable these persons to swamp a union, and do what they pleased with it.",34
258,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That provision could not stand if the amendment were carried.,34
259,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment would permit that to be done.,34
260,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The provision would have to be altered.,34
261,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment goes so far that it is only fair that some explanation should be given as to what other proposition is subsequently to be made.,34
262,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should absolutely oppose any proposal which, under cover of doing a union no harm, would seriously interfere with it. It would be absolute treachery on the part of any honourable member to try, under cover of some.generality, to i njure some principle which he declared would really be benefited by it . I am speaking now not of the Bill but of the amendment. If the amendment or some other proposal that would embody in the Bill what I have in mind were carried, I should join with the Government in seeing that proper amendments'were'made to avoid the defeat of the object in view by some side wind. My point is that no trades union could be expected to give up one shred of its individuality, its membership, or its rules, or its funds, in coming under one of these organizations. I cannot talk so confidently upon these subjects as can some other honourable members. most serious matter for those who know nothing about trades unions to suggest something that would alter their internal composition. We are not competent to do anything of the k in d ; but the reason why I press this matter so strongly is that the organization I have in mind is in the direction of an ideal trades unionism. Just as it is well for all trades unions relating to the same industry in New South Wales to be united, so for the purposes of a Commonwealth Court it should be equally good for all unions relating to the same industry in Australia to be one. Why should it be a good thing for Commonwealth purposes that all the waterside workers of New South Wales should belong to one central union, with local branches, while the waterside workers of Victoria belong to a separate union ? This measure will apply only to Inter-State disputes, ancl if we had a chain of unionism extending all round the Commonwealth, instead of five different chains stopping at the borders of each State, the unions would stand before the Court on a much stronger footing. The Court will be very jealous about one matter. It will be very jealous about two unions which are not connected getting up a dispute in order to take advantage of the law. No Court will allow itself to be humbugged in that way. Whereas if the unions were all one, a dispute affecting unionists in Fremantle would touch all the members of the union, and become an Inter-State dispute.",34
263,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment of honourable and learned member for Angas does not regard a union as an organization under the Bill.,35
264,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that that provision is framed in the interests of the unions, and my reason for thinking so is this: A Commonwealth Court ought, if possible, to control Commonwealth unions, or, at any rate, unions extending over more.than one State.",35
265,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There are a number of such unions now in existence.,35
266,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is a good thing for the purposes of trades unionism. The more the trades unions have of a Commonwealth basis, the more sure will be their position in the Commonwealth Court.",35
267,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the amendment does not regard unions as organizations under the Bill. The only organizations for which it provides are organizations created and It is a formed solely for the purposes of the Bill.,35
268,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; and that is a convenience to the unions. I am assuming a case in which the unions of an industry in different States are not united, in which there is no federation extending all round the Continent. The work of a union qua its district is local, and there would be no sense in having a central Australian administration to deal with the cases of William Smith or John Jones, who were applying for sick pay. The cost of such an administration would be ruinous. For all the main purposes of unionism, whether militant or benevolent, you must preserve your internal organization, because you may have local as well as Commonwealth battles to fight. For the very purposes of trades unions you must keep their integrity free from any complication of any kind. Your unions lose nothing by becoming organizations under the Bill, because in that way they keep out of the Commonwealth Court altogether. A Court cannot touch them qua trades unions. But if they are allowed to register under the Bill as organizations, they will be subject to the Court.",35
269,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I thought that what was aimed at was the obtaining of stability and responsibility.,35
270,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have no such idea in this particular matter. I wish to fight fair in this matter.,35
271,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not see that any organization short of a trades union is likely to be a responsible body for the purthe poses of this Bill ; that is, a body which can enforce the Court's decisions.",35
272,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will give an illustration of what I mean, which may remove the honourable gentleman's difficulty to some extent. We have now in all the States ' a peculiar provision of law which enables an individual to sue the Government. He does not sue the Government in that title ; he sues what, is called a nominal defendant. Various Acts provide that the Governments of the States or of the Commonwealth may name a person to be the nominal defendant in any action. The late Principal Under Secretary in New South Wales was Mr Critchett Walker, and he was named as nominal defendant in many - actions. In this case the - unions will be in the position of a Government which is being sued. They will preserve their integrity, and all their executive and other powers, and will come into Court only as organizations specially registered under t'le Bill. The same men would be affected., but they would come into Court merely as an industrial organization, without bringing the union with them. unions would be free from the Court altogether. The Court's decisions would affect only the organizations, and then only so far as they were concerned in any dispute. If there was no trouble, the organizations would not come within the Court at all. There would be no need for them to do so. It is only when trouble begins that there will be need for the members Of the present unions to come before the Court. Then, under the amendment,, they would register as industrial organizations. Not a single rule or regulation of the present unions could be altered by the Court. The unions would keep out of the Court, and that would not be a bad thing for them. They would keep themselves free from the legal meshes altogether, and make the registered organizations their fighting force for mere technical Court purposes. The organizations would represent nominal defendants or plaintiffs.",35
273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And could join them without joining political bodies.,36
274,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I intend to come to that point. The position to which I refer would be a grand thing for those whom my honourable friends opposite represent. I have said to-night will, I think, carry some'weight; but every objection which I have enunciated with the desire to be thoroughly impressive would' be answered if what I suggest were done. The trades unions would preserve their militant force and their internal organization, and the grievance of those who are not in the unions would be removed. In all fights the best men come to the top, whether unionists or any other classes of men are concerned. The trades unionists know their leaders. There are half-a-dozen leaders who could carry all the unions in Australia with them. Why? Because the members of those unions know them, and would follow them. So would it be with the organizations. The non-unionists who come into the organizations will be deprived of a grievance, and they will not be able to affect the trades trades unions concerned. Their grievance would be absolutely gone, while the trades unions would remain as strong to fight as ever. What I suggest would, I think, be a grand thing for trades unionism. It would lessen the gap between the unionists and the non-unionists. If I were the most rabid unionist in Australia, my supreme object would be to build The a golden bridge, to enable all the men who are not in the unions to associate with me in fighting my battle against the employers. In the battle against the employers the interests of all the workers are common. Why, therefore, should they be separated on some internal point of politics, when they can be joined in an organization under the Bill, the trades unions still preserving their identity, and remaining as strong to fight their battles as they are now ? The trades unionists will, under this arrangement, obtain a grand new ally in their battle against the capitalists. They will gain the support of the non-unionists, and by getting them into the industrial organizations, will have made the first step towards getting them into the unions.",36
275,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The amendment does not : suggest that the unions are to escape responsibility under the Bill .,36
276,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am sure that that is what is meant. men Mr Glynn - Unde r the Bill they must escape responsibility.,36
277,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the right honourable member say that they would escape responsibility ?,36
278,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should like to point out What where I think my - honourable friend is wrong in thinking that they would not escape responsibility. In the first place, an organization cannot be registered unless it has been formed and exists solely for the purposes of the Bill . Therefore, the measure cannot interfere with trades unions, which have'not been formed for those purposes. At the worse, the Commonwealth Court could not touch the unions.",36
279,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If a union has a beneficial interest in any fund, it will be liable under the Bill , just as a legal interest would be liable.",36
280,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,An organization registered under the Bill will have nothing to do with any trades union; but if there is any doubt on the point it can be set at rest. We will all co-operate with the Government in setting it at rest.,37
281,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I distinctly stated that, the amendment were carried, other provisions of the Bill would have to be amended.",37
282,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We.mus t have no doubt upon the matter.,37
283,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will co-operate with the Ministry in protecting the trades unions of Australia from the Court. I always objected to the provision in the New South Wales Act, and warned the trades unions in that State against it.",37
284,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the attitude of the right honourable gentleman in regard to clause 69?,37
285,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will come to that. The Minister of External Affairs seems inclined to consider this matter, if the Bill can be so amended as to make the position of the unionists perfectly fair.",37
286,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not know that I am willing to consider it ; but I wish to know exactly how far the amendment goes. If it goes as far as I think it does, it takes away with one hand, but gives nothing with the other.",37
287,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I and a number of other honourable members intend to vote for the amendment; but we do not wish to sav that it will not injure the unions, and then allow the Bill to pass in such a form that it may do so. Therefore, we shall be with the Government, instead of opposing them, in trying to secure that what is my view of the effect of the amendment shall be the correct view. My opinion is that the trades unions should be left absolutely independent of the Court, as they are now. That would remove a serious difficulty, and a great grievance, from the minds of non-unionists. Without imperilling their property, or the integrity of a single rule of their trades unions, those who are now members of the unions could form industrial organizations, and thus remove the grievances of non-unionists - The industrial organizations registered under the Bill will, of course, begin with members of the unions, but they will be open to every man in the industry which they affect, and the men who are not unionists, and who join these organizations, will have no power in regard to the unions. They will be merely members of the organizations, which must be formed solely for the purposes of the Bill.",37
288,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not see how it is possible for the Government to accept that proposal.,37
289,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If there is a chance of the acceptance of any reasonable proposal, I shall be happy to help the Ministry in the if matter, instead of being antagonistic to them. I think it is worth considering.",37
290,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not see that the sug-' gestion of the right honourable member differs from the proposition contained in the first paragraph of the amendment.,37
291,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It does not. But the Minister of External Affairs seems to think that if the Bill were so drawn that the integrity of the unions, in regard to the management of their funds, and in other respects, was preserved, and they were kept outside the Court altogether, the Government might consider the amendment.",37
292,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the right honourable member's suggestion differed from that of the honourable and learned member for Angas, Ave might consider it ; but I do not think it takes us a bit further than does the 1 amendment.",37
293,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The first paragraph of the amendment raises the question Will which I am dealing. The Avords ""unless it has been formed, and exists solely for the purposes of this Act,"" invoh'e Avhat I have said about the independence of the unions in respect to the Court.",37
294,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is the amendment which Ave are noAV debating. The Chairman is. putting the paragraphs of the proviso separately.,37
295,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My vieAv is that if industrial organizations are formed under the Bill, the trades unions are bound to be the back-bone of them, because of the metal they carry, and the men they have, and because they are organized. They Avill be the predominating factor at the start. But the unions will not be imperilled even if they are at fault. In any case, they are in the hands of the Court, which Would do justice, no matter who the members of an.organization might be. Therefore, I earnestly suggest to the Government that this proposal should be considered. I do not mind giving them the benefit of my opinon, that if the Bill is passed as it stands, their opponents will have a tremendous weapon to use against them. I Would rather see matters put right than be given any such political advantage.  able member think that if a union passed a resolution declaring it to be an organiza* tion for the purposes of the Bill it would comply with the amendment?",37
296,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that that would be legally efficient.,38
297,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course, it would not.",38
298,Mr REID,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not see how it could be. But this is the point. union met and carried such a resolution, the secretary a cheap circular to every member of the union conveying to him a copy of the resolution arrived it, and stating that it was the intention to register the members as members of an organization for the purposes of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, and asking them to intimate whether or not they were in favour of being registered. B v ' t h is means all members favourable to registration could be registered as members of that organization, and all the unionists not favourable to it would not be registered. The identity and integrity of the union would be preserved. It would not be split , up, but the liberty of the members of the union to join the organization, or not, as they pleased, would be preserved. Those in favour of registration would join the organization, and the grievances of the people outside of the union would be removed. If such an industrial organization were formed the unionists would be brought into touch, from time to time, with all the men who worked in a particular industry. If all the men were gathered together in an organization, and were interested in fighting a common opponent in the Arbitration Court, they would gradually come into the trades union-fa r more rapidly than under any other circumstances. I do not know much about unions, but I think that the best way of persuading men to join is by fraternizing with them. No men could stand aloof from the unionists if , as members of the organization formed for the purposes of the Bill, they hacl to make common cause with them. They would have no excuse for doing so. I think that the more this amendment is looked at-whateve r may be its intention-the clearer it must be that it would work better for the unions than would the clause as it stands.",38
299,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I wish to - out to the honourable and learned member for Angas a few practical difficulties. the case of the Australian Workers' Union. bers by If the amendment were carried we should have to form another union solely for purposes of the Bill . We should have to thority. call a meeting of the executive and agree to recommend the. formation of a new organization. We should have to enrol members and issue to them certificates of membership in the new body; also to adopt rules, which would have to be approved of by the members. These operations would occupy fully twelve months. We could If a trades enrol members only at meetings, and we could hold meetings only during the shearcould send ing season - We should have no other means of issuing the necessary certificates. Although we should require only 100 members in order to enable us to register as an organization under the Bill, .we should not be able to go to the Court and ask them to adjudicate with regard to any grievance we might have. We could not, with such a small membership, ask them to apply a common rule which would cover the whole of the shearing operations in three of the States. What would take place in the meantime? In the meantime a bogus union might be registered. I know that practically the promotersof such a union are waiting in Melbourne now. If they succeed in obtaining registration they will shut out the union which has worked in the interests of the shearers for years past, and the Australian Workers' Union would probably haye to apply for the cancellation of their registration. Whilst we were proving our bona fides by means of our large membership, and taking all the other steps necessary to form an organization for the purposes of the Bill, the other union could step in and forestall us - The honourable and learned member for Angas misleads the Committee when he says there are no practical difficulties. We know that there are very grave obstacles. We do not object so much to the proposal that an organization shall be formed for the purposes of the Bill , as to the necessity which would arise under the^ amendment for forming an absolutely new union. That operation could not be carried out so easily as has been represented. Certain unions are now waiting an opportunity to bring disputes before the Court. Take the case of the Seamen's Union, for instance. That union would be situated similarly to the point Australian Workers' Union. We should have to wait for the shearing seaTake son before we could consult our memmeans of a referendum. Otherwise we should have to ignore the the vast majority and act without proper auAs a matter of fact, probably two years would elapse before we should be in a position to bring a case before the Court. If we were not properly constituted as an organization for the purposes of the Bill, we should probably find ourselves upset in the Court. We should be opposed"" there by the most powerful employers' organization in the Commonwealth which would be advised by the ablest of lawyers, and which would probably do everything it could to defeat our objects. proposal embodied in the amendment is impracticable and unnecessary, and would operate unfairly towards the existing' unions. If it be carried we shall bably find an organization which is only a shadow - of the employers' union behind it forestalling the legitimate trades union, which embraces the main body of the workers. A good deal of discussion has turned upon the positions which would be occupied by unionists and non-unionists if the Bill were allowed to pass in its present form. In this connection I would point to the experience which has been gained in New Zealand, wliere preference has been given to unionists. We find that there has not been an increase in the number of urtiionists, and that no complaint has ibeen made by those who do not belong to the unions. Therefore, all the fears expressed that the men outside the union will be condemned to starvation would appear to have no substantial foundation. Some apprehension appears to be felt owing to the political aims of the unionists, and yet those honourable members who oppose the recognition of trades unions as organizations for the purposes of the Bill admit that the unions must go on, and still perform their political work, as previously. The desire, however, is apparently to crush out the unions by gradually sapping their influence. They will be shut out of the Court, and the place which they should occupy will be taken by bogus organizations. did not hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Wentworth with regard to the Machine Shearers' Union. I do not desire to refer to that body, except by way of illustration. I can assure the honourable member that there is a great deal more than he is aware of behind that organization. The Machine Shearers' Union has been characterized by the right honourable member for East Sydney as the outcome of a conspiracy, ancl we know that the influences which are at the back of it extend even as far as England. Messrs. Burgon and Ball, of Sheffield, did a large trade for years in sheep shears. When their employees formed a union, the firm locked them out. The men communicated with me, and I suggested that they should form a co-operative company to manufacture shears. The men took my advice and manufactured shears of such a quality that they captured the whole of the Australian The trade, and knocked Messrs. Burgon and Ball out of the market. That firm then took up the manufacture of shearing machines, and they are behind the firm of Messrs. pro- Young and Co., the principle organizersof the Machine Shearers' Union. I have' the report of that union, which is registered in Sydney. This shows that they have received a number of anonymous contributions, and it also demonstrates that their books are kept very loosely, because there is no means of tracing several large items of expenditure. The auditor reports that there are no vouchers for many payments. The whole of the circumstances surrounding the union are suspicious, and its membership is, to a very large extent, bogus. A number of men have been compelled to join, because the station-owners make membership of the union a condition of employment. We also know that many men have been enrolled as members without paying any subscription whatever. Even with all these influences at work the membership has not reached more than 1,800.",38
300,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I did not discuss the bogus character of the Machine Shearers' Union, but the conduct, of the Australian Workers' Union in connection with it .",39
301,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am pointing out the difficulties with which we should have to contend if the amendment were carried. It would operate to the advantage of the bogus union, which having its rules speI cially designed to meet the purposes of the Act, could become registered long, before the Australian Workers' Union could take the steps necessary to form an organization such as is suggested. I do not propose to reply to the long address which was delivered by the right honourable member for East Sydney, because I recognise that it was merely intended to impress persons who are outside of this Parliament. It was a kind of second-reading speech. I intend to deal only with that which I conceive has a bearing upon the amendment under discussion. I claim that if the amendment be carried the Bill might as well be cast into the waste-paper basket. Further, its adoption would necessitate provision being made for additional penalties. The honourable and learned member for Angas would need to make it a penal offence for employers to dismiss men from their employment because of their political opinions. In the present age unionists are chiefly victimized on that account. Some years ago I was associated with a liberal organization which was established in Victoria. When it was formed, its secretary was earning a livelihood by carting goods to various mines. - Shortly afterwards, the chairman of the 'board of directors and the legal manager of some of these mines visited the firms who had previously forwarded their goods by the carrier in question, and induced them to discontinue the practice. The man was made the subject of a straight-out boycott, merely because he was the secretary of that organization. In the district of Maryborough within the past fortnight men have been discharged from their employment because of the action which they took during the recent State elections.",39
302,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is that wrong?,40
303,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member knows that it is wrong. I am sure that he will echo the sentiments of his leader in denouncing such a boycott. Does the honourable and learned member for Angas believe that a political organization would be less effective as such merely because its members went through the sham of forming another organization under this Bill ?,40
304,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the employer have no political opinions?,40
305,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Exactly . I ask the honourable member for Kooyong, who has voiced the opinions of the Federated ployers' Union, to consider what is volved in the amendment, because I hold that the principle of fair play should embodied in this Bill. The honourable and learned member for Angas imagines that secretary for many years. he has evolved a scheme which will entirely exclude political considerations from organiare zations which come before the Court.",40
306,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I did not say anything of side of their ranks. the sort. I do not want men, by the mere act of joining an organization, to accept the ment to employees. opinions of the trades unions.",40
307,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I exposed that fallacy the other night. I think I am correct in than ^ 5 . saying that in the district which is represented by the Minister of Home Affairs some of his strongest political opponents join ? are .members of his own union. It is not right to urge that the members of these organizations are not free agents. If the industrial organizations are to have no political opinions, we shall require to apply the same condition to the employers.",40
308,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Quite right.,40
309,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then , as an employer, the honourable member for Kooyong must cease to hold any political views. The more the amendment is examined the more it will be seen that it is both impracticable and unnecessary. It will accomplish no good, but will create trouble. The only time that an industrial organization will meet will be when it desires to frame an application to the Court. It will deal with that particular business, and-if the amendment be adopted-wil l immediatelv afterwards meet as a trades union. How can the two bodies be separated. The unions always deal with their industrial business as industrial unions. What sense is there in a body of men meeting today for one purpose and assembling tomorrow for another 'purpose? The same remark is applicable to the employers. We do not deny them their political rights or privileges. We do not deny them collectively the right to take an active part in politics.. At the same time we shall not change the existing condition of affairs by enacting that the employers, for the purposes of this Bill, must form a separate organization.",40
310,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is overlooking the cardinal difference that the trades unions exclude members, whilst these industrial organizations will be open to all. Mr .SPENCE - The trades unions do not exclude any individual. They are only Emtoo glad to enrol men. Their ideal is to inenrol every bond fide workman. In manyunions they haye accomplished that. Every be man working in a certain district was a member of the organization of which I was The unions which will come within the scope of this Bill so strong that there are practically no men engaged in the same industries outI t can clearly be shown that unionism offers a good investI demonstrated the other evening that, for an annual payment of ios.. the members of the Australian Workers' Union received a dividend of more",40
311,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then why do not all men,40
312,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Simpl y because they do pot realise the obligation which they are under to the union. The older the unions get the fewer becomes the number of individuals who stand outside their ranks. repeat that the trades unions have limited their operations to industrial matters, and do not engage in political work. Of course, when we are organizing we always put the political side of the case before intending members. In other words, we show them that it is to their advantage to establish organizations, because, collectively, they can accomplish things which they cannot achieve individually. We emphasize the benefit of standing solidly together, and selecting our own parliamentary candidates. is the political side of the labour movement, but it is associated with the Political Labour League. The point I wish to urge is that trades unions accomplish an industrial work quite apart from that - just as much apart from it as any they would perform if the amendment were carried. That amendment would tend to the serious disadvantage of trades unions. present time unions do not exercise any coercion. A worker would be as free under the Government proposal as he would be if the amendment were carried, and, therefore, I should like to know what reason can he urged for the adoption of the amendment. It would revolutionize trades unions and introduce much friction in their ranks. The union of which I have spoken has its rules registered under the Trades Unions Act of New South Wales, and no complaint has been made to the Court that it interferes with the carrying out of the decisions of that tribunal. Our rules are ready for registration as soon as this measure becomes law; but the amendment would practically render it impossible for the union to come under the operation of this measure for the next two years. The union could not carry out its objects in the slipshod way that has been suggested. If it did not conform to the legal requirementsit would experience a difficulty similar to that which arose in New South Wales. Ip that case we made a change in the rules, in accordance with the practice of the union, and unionists were perfectly satisfied with the constitutionality of the proposal. The Registrar, however, held that the practices of the union were not fully set out in the rules, and therefore gave his decision against it. The same point would be taken if this amendment were carried. The chief object of the Bill would be defeated, and so far as I have been able to learn no practical good would result. It has simply been said that politics should not be associated I with unions. I have shown that if this amendment were carried it would make no alteration in that respect; that trades organizations would continue as at present to attend to industrialmatters, leaving political bodies to deal with the political side of their existence. Men would continue to dissociate political questions from their unions. We are attempting to do byAct of Parliament what is now voluntarily accomplished. In the interests of the in-; dustrial side of a union a sensible man That would refrain from introducing any likely element of discord into its deliberations. It is for that reason that such matters as the fiscal issue and sectarianism are carefully excluded from trades unions. The misconception which arises with regard to the political labour movement is due to the fact that the unions do not technically separate industrial and political matters. At the This amendment would technically separate such questions, so far as unions are concerned, but would accomplish nothing that had not already been secured. If existing trades unions were registered under the Bill as it stands they would be com. pletely under the control of the Court, and when they did anything calculated to interfere with industrial peace, they would be dealt with by it. The real reason why many unionists objected to legislation of this kind was that they feared that it might restrict their powers to an extent that it was impossible to foretell. They did not know how far the Arbitration Courts might dictate their management. Unionists have always been' very sensitive and independent; they have always held that they should be allowed to manage their own business in their own way, and it would be much better for those who think that unionists might go too far to allow them to go to the Court and be guided by its decisions. The application of this amendment to the larger unions would be impracticable. The larger a union the greater is the difficulty associated with its administration. It would be a small matter to form a new union or organization if only small bodies had to be considered, but the operation of this amendment would be very serious so far as the large unions are concerned. There is no call for the proposed amendment, and I hope, therefore, that it will be withdrawn. I think that the honourable and learned member for Angas will see that the objects at which he aims would really be met by the clause as it stands.",41
313,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I should like, at.the outset, to refer to one or two observations which fell from the lips of the - honourable member for Kennedy, and to strongly dissent from the suggestion made by him, that I supported what was really a subterfuge to undermine the existing trades unions. My record in connection with industrial work in the 'various States in which I have different interests, will, in itself, afford a complete contradiction of that assertion. A man who would have the audacity to say that he would take steps to interfere by legislation with the existence of trades unions, or to prevent their progress, might well be said not to know what he was talking about. Every honourable member must admit that trades unionism, for the protection of the various industries to which it relates, has not only come to stay, but will progress and expand, and the only hope of those associated with enterprises giving employment to large numbers of men is that the representatives of these industrial unions will not, in their desire to advance their interests, take steps that would be really against the best interests of the community, and against that which must ultimately be to their own best interests'. I wish to make it clear that, in my opposition to one or two clauses of this Bill , I have had no desire, by means of any subterfuge, to give the great principleof trades unionism a back h it ; I resent any such suggestion. My desire is that this measure shall be made effective and workable. Whilst conciliation and arbitration is ostensibly the purpose of this great measure, we are forced to realise that underlying many of the aspirations of those who support it is one dominant object, that through this measure, which has pacific, humane, and high aims in view, they will secure another end-the strengthening of these industrial organizations as a great fighting force for political purposes. have consistently set my face, and will continue to do so, against the attainment of this last object by means of the Bill . I believe that the measure is a necessary addition to existing State Arbitration Acts, and is required to carry into effect the provisions of the Constitution. But my desire is to make it a workable measure, and I shall oppose and resist every effort to secure by it other advantages than those which are legitimately sought for, because, in my opinion, to do so would seriously undermine the great pacific effect which is desired. The honourable member for Darling has had direct association with trades unionism, and is in a position to speak with knowledge and authority as to the practical result of any amendments which may be proposed. Other honourable members are in a similar position. I can speak only from the knowledge which I possess through my association with big companies, employing large bodies of men, or which I have gained through having been unfortunately connected with one or two large industrial struggles. I desire to give to the views expressed by the honourable member for Darling the fullest respect and consideration. It is unwise for any of us to regard as belligerent and hostile suggestions which come from the other side, and are directed to show how an amendment may prove ineffective. But nothing has been said, either by the honourable member for Darling, or any other honourable member, to remove from'my mind the feeling that the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Angas is a pacific one. It is true that many of the existing trades unions are not governed by political considerations. The. Minister of Home Affairs told us that the members of one union voted against him during the recent elections.",42
314,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I said that some of the branches of my union are opposed to the Labour Party.,42
315,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is a very singular circumstance.,42
316,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is not at all singular.,42
317,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have always regarded it as a most exceptional thing that the members of a union should oppose one associated with' them and belonging to their own side. But I unhesitatingly accept the assurance of a gentleman for whom I have always had the greatest respect. The point I wish to make is this: The aspiraI tions of honourable members opposite have been unfolded step by step. At the beginning of our consideration of the Bill we were told that it was unlikely that it would give much business to the Court; that probably only three great organizations-the Seamen's Union, the Shearers' Union, and the Waterside Workers' Unionwould be affected by it. Since then, however, every detailed provision has been sugother gested that would be necessary for a State Act. Honourable members opposite have been urging that the provisions of the sure should apply as completely and as fully in limited cases as would the provisions a State Act. It is a matter of regret that it has been suggested that the Chief Justions tice of New South Wales was biased in or a statement which he recently made. a similar thing has happened in New Zeaferred land. There the award of the Court challenged by the Painters' Union,' and, subsequently, by the Waihi gold-miners, one of the leaders urging his fellow unionists to resist the award of the Court, on the ground that there were not sufficient gaols New Zealand to hold them if tried to imprison them for doing so. Western Australia, too, the timber labourber ers have shown themselves unwilling ply with the awards of the State Court. So that, while honourable gentlemen site cry with one voice, "" Trust the Court"" --whic h we may thoroughly do in a British community-w e find some of them accusing a Chief Justice who has a long and orable record, and is known throughout length and breadth of the Commonwealth, of bias, while we hear of unionists in Zealand and in Western Australia opposrepresent ing the findings of the local Courts. Is it reasonable, therefore, to expect that awards of the Commonwealth Court will not be disputed when they do not the views of my honourable friends ? To my mind, the purer we can keep the ences that are made to the Court- I use the word without the slightest suggestion so far as trades unions are concerned-the better it will be for all. I the organizations of employers and. ployes are politically antagonistic, it will be impossible to prevent the engendering of ill-feeling. The instances to which I have just referred should be a guide to us. I , for one, believe that there is great merit in the amendment, and after the protestations which they have made, it is difficult to understand why my honourable friends opposite do not support the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Angas, to keep the system which we are creating' pure and free from .political feeling.",42
318,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the amendment really mean?,43
319,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will give a concrete ample, which may be more valuable than an explanation in so many words. day I quoted statistics supplied to me by the chief officers of the various mining companies at Broken Hill , which meashowed, speaking from memory, that about 2,000 of the miners there belong to various of unions, while the remaining 3,000 are non-unionists. If a question affecting condiof contract; wages, hours of labour, some other matter in which all the miners But were interested arose, and was properly reto the Court, the honourable' and was learned member for Angas proposes that the 2.000 men who are in a minority should not be able to say to the other 3,000, "" We intend to apply to the Court for an award which, if you will not join our unions; will in give us preference of employment against the Court you as non-unionists."" In Mr ISAACS - Does the honourable memthink that the Court would make such an to comaward merely for the asking?",43
320,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Court has given that oppopreference in a large proportion of cases. It has been shown beyond the possibility of contradiction that an overwhelming majority of the workers of honAustralia are not members of unions. the The. whole of the 5,000 men employed on the Broken Hill mines have a New common right to go before the Court and their views, irrespective of any trades union. They are entitled to ask the the Court to treat them as one body of men, and to lay down reasonable terms and conaccord with ditions of employment.",43
321,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How could they do referthat if they-were not organized?,43
322,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We propose that they invidious shall be organized.,43
323,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Are we to understand f that the honourable member is burning with ema desire to organize the workers?,43
324,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member cannot say that I have ever done anything to oppose the organization of the workers. I have stated more than once that the unions have accomplished immeasurable good for the workers, and I believe that they will confer further benefits upon them. Any one who attempts, by legislative enactment, to stay the advance of the great trades union movement is a fool.",43
325,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the honourable member anxious to help it along?,43
326,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , I am. I am anxious; so far as this Bil l is concerned, to act fairly exto both sides, and to make such provision that the 3,000 non-unionists to whom I have The referred shall be free to go to the Court, without having to submit to the coercion of a trades union. No union has any right to say to men who are outside its pale, "" Before you go to the' Court you will have to come into our union and comply with all our rules, whether you like it or not."" Mi. THOMAS - If 3,000 men were to join a union which had only 2,000 members previously, the new members could mould the others to their will.",43
327,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I acknowledge that the honourable member has a close acquaintance with trades unions. When there was trouble at Broken Hill, the honourable member took an active, but a moderate and just part, on behalf of the men.",44
328,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That was the reason I was boycotted.,44
329,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I had nothing to do with that; and I have no personal knowledge of it in any shape or form. I think that the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas would guard against interference with the liberties of individuals, and preclude the unions from exercising coercion.",44
330,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How far does the proposed amendment go beyond that adopted at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corinella?,44
331,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The amendment referred to provided that a majority of those engaged in any industry must approve of the reference of a dispute to the Arbitration Court. The amendment now before us goes a long step further. It makes provision against the application of coercion the part of a union, and leaves a man absolutely free to exercise his discretion as to whether or not he' shall subscribe to the political aims of the union. If he allies himself with the majority of those engaged in any particular industry he can obtain the benefit of the decision of the Court with regard to the conditions under which he shall sell his labour to his employer.",44
332,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Unde r the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, a workman need not become a member of an organization, whereas under the present proposal he would be forced into an organization of some sort.",44
333,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When we come to analyze the principles which underlie this Bill, we can see that the measure is not intended for the benefit of individuals, but is designed to deal with men who are gathered together in large organizations.",44
334,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On the one side only, because one'employer alone can become a party to a dispute.",44
335,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If he employs 100 men. That distinction has not been overlooked. One honourable member stated that I was the employer of a large number of men engaged in mining at Broken Hill. I am only a member of a large company, and as an employer I represent on the one side shareholders more numerous than are the employees engaged on the mine at Broken Hill. These shareholders would, of course, appear under the measure in their collective capacity. 1 quite recognise that in some cases a somewhat anomalous position might arise, because one employer might be the party to a dispute in which hundreds of men were engaged on the other side. This 1 matter deserves the serious consideration of the Committee. I wish to remove from the minds of honourable members the idea that I shall allow myself to be led into supporting any amendment which may be proposed, for the sole purpose of defeating the objects of the Bill, or of hampering the trades unions. If any honourable members adopt such an attitude, I say that they are wrong. We should deal with this measure as one which is intended to effect a peaceful settlement of disputes which might otherwise result in much loss and suffering to workmen and their families. Our object should be to devise methods of peacefully adjusting all the differences which may arise between employers and employees on the lines of justice and equity. The honoron able member for Kennedy uttered one or two threats, but I trust that the views expressed by him are not shared by any more than an insignificant minority of honourable members opposite. If we desire to make this a good workable measure, we must secure the co-operation of the trades unions. If these great organizations stand aside, it will be useless for us to provide this machinery. The Bill should be so framed as to insure justice to both sides.",44
336,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not that represent the whole scope of the measure?,44
337,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , that is the great purpose underlying it ; but behind that pure and high motive there appears to be a desire, on the part of some honourable members, to enlarge the scope and powers of the trades unions, and to make them stronger, as political fighting forces, than they are at present. I shall do my best to prevent the use of this Bill for that purpose.",44
338,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Surely there is no warrant for the honourable member's statement in the speeches which have been delivered from this side of the Chamber.,45
339,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The resistance which has been offered by some honourable members to this and other amendments is sufficient to justify my statement. It is quite clear that they expect to be able to use the measure as an instrument for forcing men to join the trades unions.,45
340,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think so.,45
341,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hope that the honourable member is right, but I must confess that that impression is forced upon me.",45
342,Mr BAMFORP,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that any honourable member on this side of the House has any such idea in his mind.,45
343,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member and those who share his views desire that a preference shall be granted to unionists in order that they may coerce men to join trades unions.,45
344,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not from political motives.,45
345,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will any one tell me that the Employers' Union is not a political organization? Of course it is. I believe that honourable members opposite would be acting in .their own interests if they accepted the amendment.,45
346,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The proposal which is now under consideration is intended to strike a serious blow at the principle of granting a preference to unionists. It has been said, during the course of this debate, that the members of the Labour Party desire to secure that preference so that they may compel men to join trades unions for political purposes. I say that that is not the reason we ask for it. We are riot asking those organizations to become political machines. Personally, I believe in allowing unions to take an active part in politics, and I shall deal with that aspect of the question presently. But the chief reason why the Labour Party urge that a preference should be extended to unionists is because the latter are compelled to bear the cost of bringing disputes before the Court. Surely they ought not to be penalized or boycotted after gaining an award? Let me state a concrete case. A short time ago the New South Wales Arbitration Court met at Broken Hill , and made an award. On that occasion the unionists who took their case into Court were required to pay about ^ 8 0 0 in legal and other expenses. Not a single penny of that amount was contributed by men outside of the Amalgamated Miners' Association. I hold that it is only fair that those who incur the expense involved in getting their disputes determined by the Arbitration .Court should be granted the preference sought.",45
347,Mr MCCOLL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How does the honourable member account for the expenses aggregating such a large sum?,45
348,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In the first place, we had to obtain the services of a barrister from Sydney. He did not charge an excessive amount; but owing to the legal union which exists, we were unable 'to secure a barrister from Adelaide. Then there were other expenses involved. I understand that the action cost the Proprietary Company more than ^1,000. I venture"" to say that the members of the organizations which are required to bear this expenditure should receive some consideration. I further claim that it is possible for employers to boycott men who have taken an active part in bringing any dispute before the Court. I am aware that the Bill provides that employees must not be dismissed because of any action which they may have taken in that respect; but that provision can be easily evaded. For instance, at Broken Hill there is a miner named George Dale, who is an active member of the Amalgamated Miners' Association. He took a very prominent part in bringing the recent dispute before the Court, and tendered a considerable amount of evidence. Yet, although he was previously engaged in the mines at Broken Hill , he is now unable to gain employment there, and when I saw him last he was acting as a sewing-machine agent. The general manager of the Proprietary Company, who is chiefly responsible for carrying out the terms of the award from the stand-point of the employers, is Mr Delprat. He is an entirely fair and honourable man. The secretary of the Miners' Association told me, upon my last visit to Broken Hill , that Mr Delprat was honourably observing the terms of the award. He further informed me that he had brought the case of the miner Dale before Mr Delprat, who replied that he had been dismissed, not because of any action of his in bringing the dispute before the Arbitration. Court, but because he had been insubordinate to 'one of the shift bosses. Assuming that the reason offered is.the true one, the fact remains that the man is unable to obtain employment in the mines of Broken Hill , where he was previously engaged. It is easy to conceive, therefore, that, if the manager of the Proprietary Company were not so willing to observe the terms of the award as is Mr Delprat, he could penalize men because of .their actions before the Arbitration Court, despite any statutory provision to the contrary that we might choose to make. It is well known that men have been boycotted in Broken Hill . A few years ago a man named Williams had a contract with the Proprietary Mine. The contract was broken by the company, and Williams successfully applied to the Court for redress. As the result of that action, however, he was dismissed from the mine, and a circular giving the name, approximate age, and a general description of the man, was sent to the manager of every mine along the line of lode, with a request that he should not be employed. One of these documents was lost by a mine manager, and. was picked up by a representative of the workers. It furnishes an example of what has been done and may again occur in connection with mining operations. We do not ask that men shall be compelled to join unions for political purposes. A union consisting of a few men who have voluntarily joined is for all practical purposes of much greater value than a union consisting of a large number of men who have been forced to join it . That has been our experience on the Barrier. Years ago it was not a question of whether a preference should be given to unionists in the Broken Hill mines. The unionists had a monopoly. Under an agreement made between the miners and the mine-owners no man was allowed to work in the mines unless he was a unionist; a man refused to work with a non-unionist.",45
349,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why was that practice discontinued ?,46
350,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Kooyong said that it was discontinued because unionists abused their power. That is the contention of the employers, but miners do not agree with it . In those days every miner had to join the union, and was, therefore, nominally a unionist; but we have found that for all practical purposes the union, consisting as it now does of men who have voluntarily joined, is much stronger than it was when every man was really compelled to join. All our unions are today more alert and more effective than they were when every man was absolutely compelled to be a unionist if he desired to secure work in the mines. I am strongly in favour of unionists taking part in politics. If trades unions could not take an active part in politics they would not be so strong for all practical purposes as they are. If this Bill declared in effect that trades unions, as such, should have nothing whatever to do with politics, I should prefer to do without it. I would sooner have unions taking part in politics than an Arbitration Act which prevented them from doing so. Some honourable members say that it would be veryunjust to debar a man from earning a living unless he joined a union. The Bill does not provide anything to that effect. It is merely proposed by the Government that the Court shall have power to grant a preference to unionists. It"" is not said that, after men have obtained work, they shall continue to be members of unions. The New South Wales Arbitration Court, in an award applying to the miners at the Barrier, gave a preference to unionists, and, from information I have received from the secretaries of the unions there, I am able to say that the mine managers are honestly observing that part of the award. When workers arrive at Broken Hill they realise that it is better for them to join a union than to go direct to the offices of the mining companies to seek employment. A list of the unemployed unionists has to be sent every week to the mine managers, and strangers therefore find it desirable to become members of these unions. On joining the Amalgamated Miners' Association they pay a subscription of 4s., and work is found for them. I am sorry to say, however, that at least 50 per cent, of the men cease to remain unionists. If those men cease to be unionists after they have been engaged, they are not dismissed, and the mine managers could not be compelled to dismiss them under the terms of the award. Even if the clause were carried as it stands, unionists who had obtained work would be able to leave the unions. If the union to which a man belonged took any political action of which he disapproved he'could cease to belong to it without running any risk. If it is decided to give the Court power to grant a preference to unionists, care should be taken to see that any man who desires to join a union shall not be prevented from doing so. I would support any amendment, no matter how drastic it might be, to insure to every man a sonable opportunity to join, a union. When a man joins the Amalgamated Miners' Asmembers sociation at Broken Hill , scription of 4s., and that money goes into the general fund, out of which the costs, amounting to ,£800, incurred in connection with the application for the recent award, had to be paid. The award is a most reexpenditure of time and money. markable one, since it pleases the workers, the mine-owners and residents of the town generally. Each party seems to think that it has the best of the deal. If we ways have such an award, it would be a very good thing.",46
351,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It would have a most soothing effect on all parties concerned.,47
352,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I admit that I do not think all awards would have that effect. In the case of the Broken Hill mines neither the mine-owners nor the men got all they desired, but what is considered a fair compromise was arrived at. If , as a result of this award, the relations between the mine owners and the men have been improved, while the stability of the town has been increased, it is only fair that those w;ho have been benefited should pay something towards the cost of securing the award.",47
353,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No one objects to that.,47
354,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Once a man joins a union, the chance of securing his adherence to the principles of unionism is improved. Even if 50 per cent, of those who join union leave, the result is not unsatisfactory. When 50 per cent, can leave within a day it must be seen that every unions; member of - a union could' leave it, if he desired to do so, with equal facility. If we had today in Broken Hill some the mine managers of the past men would still be boycotted there. If the made by the Court had not been as satisI factory as it is there might have been a preference to unionists. temptation to deal perhaps harshly with the men who had been responsible for the applieffect cation to the Court. The employers, hownected ever, do not entertain any feeling of bitterwish ness towards the men who brought the matcurrences. ter before the Conrt. They say that unfor most people. der the award they will have peace for the next two years, and that that is worth the expenditure of the ^ r . o o o which the proceedings compelled them to incur. The award is probably worth £ £ 0 0 to the men, ence to unionists. and we contend that every man benefited it should contribute to the cost.",47
355,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Does not the honourable reamember see that, under the proposed new scheme, all persons in an industry would be of an organization and would conhe pays a subtribute to its funds?",47
356,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why not allow the organizations at work at the present time to .continue ? The work of carrying on some of these organizations entails a considerable I believe that I am right in saying that the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Broken Hill pays £ j ios. or £ 8 a week by way of seccould alretarial and office expenses.,47
357,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should be prepared to allow the existing unions to do'this work, provided their rules were framed in accordance with this amendment.",47
358,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Why not allow the existing organizations to carry on the work ? The New South Wales Arbitration Court disallowed certain rules ih the case of the Australian Workers' Union, and if the rules of any of the existing unions provide that members shall take part in politics, they can be varied. I should be quite prepared to trust the men when they joined the unions. At the ballot-box every man is free to vote for whomsoever he wishes to see elected.",47
359,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member appears to be with us in spirit.,47
360,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The existing unions can do all that is necessary to carry into effect the 'provisions of the Bill, and something a more, and therefore I ask why should fresh organizations be required? Any man wishing to do so can join any of the existing but no man is bound to join them. If the rules by which the unions are now governed are, in the opinion of the Court, of objectionable, they can be expunged. That has been done in the case of a New South award Wales union by a Judge of the State Court. feel very strongly. upon the principle of I would rather have no Arbitration Bill at all than not see given to that principle. I was conwith one big strike, and I do not to have any more to do with such ocOne big strike is quite enough But, although I favour arbitration, I would rather trust to strikes than to an Arbitration Court, if the Bill is Court so amended as to seriously interfere with the application of the principle of preferWe have had many by strikes in the past, but the workers have never yet had the Administration on their side. If , during the progress of two or three strikes, those in office were on the side of the strikers, the employers would tell a different story from that which they are telling today. If no police had been sent to Broken Hill, and the New South Wales Government had not taken the side of the employers, but had let us light it out amongst ourselves, the employees would have won fairly easily. Some time ago, the Sydney ferry men threatened to strike for higher wages and shorter hours, because they were being very poorly paid, and were working very long hours. Tbose in control, however, retorted that they would lock them out. The Honourable E. W. O'Sullivan was at that time Minister of Works, and he told the managers of the ferry steamers that if they took extreme steps he would employ Government steamers to compete with them. They, therefore, withdrew - their threat of a lock-out, and the men won the contest. If the amendment is carried, and the application of the principle - of preference . to unionists is seriously interfered with, I hope that the Ministry will drop the Bill. Personally, I would rather trust to strikes than to an . arbitration measure which did not recognise that principle..",47
361,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Althoug h I am in favour of the principle of the amendment, I do not like the terms in which the honourable and learned member for Arigas has clothed it. It seems to me that, as drafted, it is open to an objection which has been very properly taken by the honourable member for Barrier, namely, that it ignores or destroys existing machinery and organizations. Seeing how difficult it is to get the workers to organize in any direction, it would be very unwise for the Committee to insist that the existing organizations shall go for nothing, and that new . organizations must be formed purely to carry out the purposes of the measure. I am in favour of the principle of the amendment, however, because, while I do not think it necessary that the organizations registered under the Bill should have been formed solely to carry out its purposes, I think that they should exist solely for that object. If existing organizations purge themselves of their political and philanthropic characteristics, and become organizations existing solely to carry out the purposes of the Bill, I would have no objection to men being compelled to join them, and my objection to the principle of preference to unionists would at once be removed. That, I think, is the general feeling of the Committee. I suggest, therefore, that some such words as these should be usedUnless in the opinion of the Court or the Registrar its rules and objects are intended solely to carry out the purposes of this Act. If an amendment of that sort be carried, I should have no objection to a recommittal of the Bill with a view to rescinding the amendments carried last week by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. . Mr CONROY - What the honourable and learned member proposes would have the same effect as the amendment now before the Committee, so far as existing trades unions are concerned.",48
362,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . It would only mean that they would have to do what the New South Wales Arbitration Court has insisted upon the Australian Workers' Union doing. They would have to purify themselves of their political rules.,48
363,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Any trades union formed under a State Act must go beyond the purposes of the Bill we are now considering.,48
364,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There are organizations in the nature of trades unions under the New South Wales Act which are purely of an industrial character, and have no political or philanthropic characteristics. I think that such organizations should be competent to register under the Bill, and that other existing organizations which are willing to remove objectionable features from their rules should be able to do so too. The honourable member for Darling has courteously handed to me a copy of the rules of the Australian Workers' Union, to which is attached a certificate of incorporation signed by G. C. Addison, the Registrar of the New South Wales Arbitration Court. I intend to read some of these rules, because they seem to me to be distinctly political in character, and illustrate the reason of my objection to the principle of preference to unionists as effect is given to it in the Bill as originally introduced. The first rule which I will read is headed "" Political Fund,"" and is numbered 48. It is as follows':Where any Branch has, by a two-thirds majority on plebiscite, authorized the expenditure of any sum not exceeding one shilling' per financial member per year for political purposes, the committee thereof shall from time to time, as it sh.all think lit, set aside from its general funds, and place to the credit of a Parliamentary Fund such amount as it shall deem necessary for the purposes of political organization, and for securing the return of Labour representatives to Federal or State Parliaments; provided the amount so set aside shall not exceed the aggregate amount of one shilling per year per financial member from the time of the last appropriation, and provided also that the vote authorizing such expenditure may at any time be revoked by plebiscite of the members of the Branch upon the question being so submitted by general meeting of the Branch. The Parliamentary Fund available at the time of an election shall be equally distributed amongst the various electorates within the Branch boundaries in which there exist duly constituted leagues running candidates who have been duly selected and endorsed by the Political Labour League, and approved by the Union. Then comes rule 49, which is headed by "" Political Labour League Representamembers. tion ""Each branch of the Union shall provide, for the nomination and election of delegates to the Annual Conference of the Political Labour League, and delegates to the Trades and Labour Council at the same time, and in the same manner as for branch omcers. For the purpose of this rule the Broken.Hill District of Adelaide Branch, and the Riverina portion of the Victoria-Riverina Branch, shall be considered as separate New South Wales branches of the Union. Rule 51 is headed "" Maintenance of the Worker."" There is a copy of that newspaper in the library, and dn reference, to it I have discovered that it roundly abuses any one who dares to say anything against the existing Federal Ministry, and deals severely with any one who ventures to praise the leader of the Free-trade Party in this Chamber.'",48
365,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Freedo m is not a strong point with honourable members opposite.,49
366,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The newspaper is distinctly a political newspaper. In my electorate there are a number of small farmers, who, in their spare time, before harvesting begins, go shearing in Riverina and Western Victoria. If effect be given to the principle of preference to unionists, and they remain non-unionists, they will be unable to continue to get employment as shearers whenever there are unionist shearers unemployed; or, if they wish to become unionists, may have to subscribe to the maintenance of a newspaper such as this, to whose political principles they may be opposed. Rule 51 providesBranch secretaries shall each month deduct from the moneys received in respect of members' contributions during that month an amount of 5s. per contribution, and forward the same to the Worker manager. Cheques for the payment of the same shall be signed by the officers and trustees empowered to operate on the Branch Account, without requiring the authority of the Branch Committee.",49
367,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The members of the union pay 5s. a year, and obtain copies of the newspaper free.",49
368,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so, but why should a man who detests the politics of the Worker be compelled, by joining this association, to pay 5s. yearly to its maintenance. Rule 52 deals with the distribution of the Worker. Rule 54, which deals with educational literature, is as follows :- : Pamphlets treating on political and social subjects from the Labour stand-point may be provided each branch, and distributed amongst the The amount each branch may spend for this purpose shall not exceed one penny per member per annum. Then comes rule 58, which provides thatWith a view of further consolidating Labour's forces, branches in very State shall affiliate with and bear their proportionate shares of the expenses of any form of Labour Federation endorsed by Conference. I think that that is dangerous. At any rate, as a representative of non-unionists as well as unionists, I do not think I should vote for a provision which might compel non-unionists to join an organization having rules similar to those which I have read. Unless an amendment such as the honourable and learned member for Angas has proposed, amended somewhat in the direction I have suggested, is carried, I cannot go back upon the vote which I gave the other day in dealing with clause 49. But if the Bill is amended to provide that only organizations whose, objects and rules are framed solely to carry out the purposes of the Bill may register, I - shall be prepared to vote for the preferential treatment of unionists, I could then readily do it, as, if an association is purely industrial, I believe in preference to unionists. It seems to me that what I have suggested is a compromise to which the Government might very well consent. If the unions turn their attention to industrial matters, apart from any political objects, there will be no desire to prevent unionists from securing preferential treatment. The Government have gone so far as to state that they will accept an amendment to the effect that, unless in the opinion of the Registrar, the rules of the union are intended mainly to carry out the purposes .of the Act, he shall not register the union as an organization for the purposes of the Bill. The difference between ""mainly"" and ""solely"" might involve 2 8 6 3 Conciliation and all the distinction between a political and a nOn-political union.",49
369,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does the honourable and learned member call political?,50
370,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have been endea, vouring to show honourable members the political character of the Australian Workers' Union",50
371,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Would a union have a political object if it supported a newspaper ?,50
372,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If it supported a political newspaper it would have a political object. The Worker deals with politics of an almost entirely party character, and is very severe in its comments.",50
373,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is a trade paper a political organization?,50
374,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think necessarily so. I should regard as an industrial journal one which dealt entirely with industrial technical matters. A newspaper would partake of a political character if it treated of party politics and dealt out severe treatment to all those who differed from those whom it was professing to support. .,50
375,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Who is to - judge what is political and what is not?,50
376,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Trus t the Court to do that.,50
377,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Attorney-General says that Ave cannot separate industrial from political matters in connection Will the carrying on of a neAvspaper. In that should'stop the issue of any journal supported by an industrial organization from funds subscribed for an organization under this Bill .,50

379,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Attorney-General had is probably acquainted Will the neAvspaper called The Traveller. It is the organ of the Gommerciai' Travellers' Association, and, although it is outspoken, and can be with advantage by those Avho travel, strictly avoids taking up a party attitude with regard to free-trade or protection, other political matters, and therefore is to be regarded as a political paper. I mento tion this as an example of a trade nonbody political paper.",50

381,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a side to inconferred dustry which has nothing whatever to do Will the fiscal question. The Court Would have to decide Avhether an association Avas maritime strike of 1890. formed solely in order to carry out the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. poses of the Bill . If a trades union newspaper made an attack upon the right honourable member for East Sydney, it could not be said that the union which supported the paper Avas being conducted solely for the purposes bf the Bill , and therefore such a journal should not be associated Will any purely, industrial organization. I shall support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas, although I think it is.rather unfortunate that he cannot modify it. I - do not desire to destroy the existing organizations, and if the honourable and learned member can alter his amendment I shall support it Will all the greater pleasure. If the Ministry accept the amendment they wil l really strengthen their position^ because many honourable members will support the .proposal for preference to unionists, in conjunction Will a fair and reasonable provision such as is noAv before us.",50
382,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas has giA'en rise to considerable discussion. I think it may be said that it is primarily an academic amendment. My chief objection to it is that it is impracticable, and that it involves a departure from the whole spirit of the measure. If it Avere adopted ,1 cannot say case, I that it Would affect the unions prejudicially ; it might do so, but it certainly AA'ould affect the public in that way. That is very much more to the purpose. Until I listened to some of the orations delivered by honourable members in this evening and last night, I had the impression that honourable members opposite constituted themselves the special guardians of those persons Avho are not members of unions^-that is to say, of the general body politic. I am noAv, hoAveA'er, read driven to the conclusion that those it honourable members Avho are opposed to the spirit of this measure have peror mitted themselves to favour the amend not ment to an extent which has blinded them its probable disastrous effects upon the politic outside the unions. The intention of the measure is It is noAV being discussed by virtue of the poAver upon the CommonAvealth by section 51 of the Constitution, which provision Avas made directly as the consequence of the That Avas a purstruggle betAveen members of trades unions and their employers, and it was in order to prevent struggles between bodies of men massed together in organizations, which are called trades unions, or unions, that this measure was introduced. Now it is proposed to disregard such associations altogether, and to bring into existence some shadowy organization which will have the power neither to prevent a strike nor to mitigate its effects, nor can it be held effectively responsible. However, if that will suit honourable members who are in favour of the amendment, I shall offer no objection on the part of the unions. I do object, however, on behalf of the general public, whom I represent to the same extent as do other honourable members. I would remind honourable members that in spite of what has been said with regard to unionism and our party, that it is possible that the honourable member for South Sydney polled a greater number of union votes than I did. I am quite sure that there are many men in the union to which I belong who would not vote' for any laboui candidate, and that there are thousands outside the union who have always supported me. I feel quite sure that the honourable member for Wentworth received many union votes.",50
383,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There are unions and unions; some of the unions could be recognised as organizations For the purposes of the Bill.,51
384,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is altogether a mistake to assume that "" the unionist vote "" and "" the labour vote"" are synonymous terms. At the beginning of the labour movement in New South Wales the Political Labour League embraced very few unionists, but comprised men who, whilst not opposed to unionism, went far beyond the members of the unions in their political views. In the beginning the unions strove to achieve their objects by non-political means, .namely, by representations made fo their employers or by striking; and it was only when the pioneers of the new political crusade came forward and showed them other methods that they saw the possibilities before fhem in ths way of political organization. These pioneers, to whom we all owe an eternal debt of gratitude, were the employers who fought us in 1.890. The labour leagues owe to them all their present power. We can never sufficiently' express our thankfulness to them, and if ever I have the power to immortalize them, their names shall be inscribed in brass. I have been connected with two or three unions, and not one of them would vote ""any money for political purposes. The union with which I am now directly connected has an income of ^1,600 per annum, and it pays only some £ 2 ios. per annum as a subsidy towards the labour movement in New South Wales. It was only after a great struggle that it was induced to contribute even that amount. With this exception, its funds are spent solely for industrial purposes. I know of no unions except the Australian Workers' Union ' and the Barrier Branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association, which spends any money whatever for 'political purposes in New South Wales, although some of them contribute towards the expense of sending a delegate to the Political Labour League. They pay, in some cases, £,2, ancl in others as little as ios. per annum. When a suggestion was made at a recent conference' that the unions should be asked to contribute so much per head in order that some one might be sent amongst them to spread the glad tidings, they almost as one man refused.",51
385,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If so few unions have political rules, it will be all the more easy for them to become recognised as organizations under the Bill.",51
386,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Why should a trades union not do what it pleases with its funds ? Why should compulsion be used in regard to it? A great deal has been said about compulsion, and invading the rights of individuals by imposing upon them certain restrictions entirely repugnant to the ideas of"" free men, and yet the amendment would compel the members of a union, whether they liked it or not, to abstain from political propaganda work.",51
387,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The trades unionists might still have their organizations within those necessary for the purposes of the Bill .,51
388,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There are some mysteries which defy the most agile intellects, and the idea of the honourable member is one of them. If honourable members care to adopt the amendment, they can do so. It will not hurt the unions, but it will hurt the measure. It will bring it to ruin at a critical period, but if honourable members are bent on preventing the spread of political views in which they do not believe, and are prepared to wreck the Bill , their blood will be on their own heads, and not on ours. I think that honourable members sometimes forget the purport of this Bill . speak of coercing men to join trades unions. I would point out that the only persons the word "" political."" whom it would be possible to coerce be those who joined the unions after an award had been made granting a preference to unionists. Consequently, .what could we utilize for political purposes that we have no right to appropriate? ously only the funds which were contributed by those who had been induced, or, if like, compelled to join the unions. But amendment proposes to prevent the moneys of those who are already members of these organizations from being so utilized. would further point out that under 69 any association can be mad'e an organization within the meaning of the Act.",51
389,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am quite aware of that.,52
390,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Ye t not a word was uttered by the honourable and learned memknew ber in reference to that matter. his amendment is so far-reaching, he vote. should have indicated that he proposed to move consequential amendments to render it harmonious",52

395,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If my proposal is carried, I shall endeavour to modify clause 69, so law. as to make their admission by the President dependent upon the fulfilment of cersatisfaction tain conditions.",52
396,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then we have to connied template the possibility that a union will not be brought under its operation. In its present form any association can be brought within its scope, irrespective of whether it registers or not. It is now posed to compel unionists to join these sociations. The amendments suggested the honourable and learned member for Corinella and the honourable and learned member for Corio would prohibit the penditure of money for political purposes, and occupy an - altogether different plane. They The question which they involve is the interpretation which would be placed upon That is a very would difficult question to decide.",52

The honourable and learned mem187,903 ber for Werriwa has reminded me that the Balmain case the patients recovered, and we could not improve on that. Victoria the two branches of the legal whilst profession have been amalgamated. A barrister is also, legally, a solicitor, yet there is a ring drawn, ancl no man of the profession can step inside or outside of that ring Avithout being overage taken by' an inexorable fate. If he does he loses caste, and is no more the man for Galway, in Victoria. E\'ery trade profession resorts to this system, if it chance to do so. The right honourable mem18,507 ber for East Sydney made certain statecandidates ments as to the number of unionists in AusA'otes, tralia. He said that the Labour Party apparently represented them, and no else - I have taken the trouble to compile a few figures bearing on the subject, think that they will at least refute such statements. Some honourable member has said during the debate on this Bill, that there are 120,000 unionists throughout AustraSouth lia. When that statement Avas made, pointed out. that a large number of unionists do not vote for the Labour Party. In making the calculation which I am about to put before the Committee, I haA'e ascandidates sumed, however, that all of them do, and that none of them A'ote for any one else. As a matter of fact, that is not the case. The unionists, according to my right honourable friend, are about one-fifth or one-sixth of the population of Australia. I Avish show that, at the last general election for the House of Representatives, the Labour Party candidates polled 205,030 votes. Some five honourable members were returned to this House unopposed, amongst them being the honourable member for CanoTasmania bolas and the Postmaster-GeneraJ. Three anti-labour out of five Avere members of the Labour Party. There may have been more, but cannot for the moment speak authoritatively on this point. In addition to this, 65,878 A'otes Avere polled by successful candidates, Avho, although not members of the Labour Party, sit behind us, and are supporting.this I am not taking into account those Avho Avere returned unopposed in this particular connection. It will thus be seen that be the Government and their direct supporters polled 270,908 votes, and that Ave must represent far more than the unionof Australia. The position in relation to the Senate is still more striking. In New South Wales the successful antilabour candidates polled an aA'erage of A'otes, whilst the labour candidate in polled an average of 107,083 votes. In Victoria the successful anti-labour candiIn dates polled an average of 95,121 votes, the successful' labour candidate polled an average of 88,614; in Queensland the anti-labour candidates' average Avas 45,554, whilst that of the labour candidates Avas 64,079 A'otes.

In Tasmania the anti-labour secured an aA'erage of 15,515 Avhilst the labour candidates averaged 9,945 A'otes. The total of the average votes one polled in respect of successful antilabour candidates Avas 373,186, and and in the case of the successful labour candidates 315,741. The average of all candidates for the Senate SIIOAVS still more clearly the position of parties. In NeAv Wales the average for all the antiI labour candidates for the Senate was 74,420.

In the average votes polled by all the candidates Avas 10,9 71, as against an average of 9,945 A'otes for labour. I The total number of A'otes polled by the successful anti-labour candidates for the Senate in New South Wales was 563,709, in Victoria 182,980, and in Tasmania 46,547, making a grand total of 793,236. In Victoria the aggregate vote secured by the successful labour candidates 88,614, Queensland 192,239, South Australia 82,541, and Western Australia 55,522, making a grand total of 428,916. It must be borne in mind that there were three successful anti-labour candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, and that only one candidate stood on the labour ticket, and could not be expected to poll as much as did the other three. averaged 187,903 votes each, while there were 107,083 votes polled for the labour candidate.

420,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They received large proportion of labour votes, but not of the caucus-bound labour votes.",55
421,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not deny that; but it was not merely the free-trade vote which returned the honourable member and his party.,55

423,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member has his own opinion. Mr Griffith, the Labour Party's candidate, polled very much more than did the protect! mist candidate. I think I am correct in saying that he was 30,000 or 40,000 votes ahead of him. We may fairly assume that while in many cases the protectionists voted for Mr. Griffith the Labour Party did not in all cases vote for the protectionist candidate. 5E We may assume that they voted for Griffith, Neild, and Pulsford, or Griffith, Gray, and Pulsford, as the case might be.",55

426,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,55
427,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that our candidates polled on an average about 37,300 votes. So far from the Labour Party in They the Senate representing only about one-fifth or one-sixth of the voting strength of Australia, the returns show that over 50 per cent, of the total votes recorded at the Senate elections were polled, by our candidates.

432,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He scored particularly against the Government candidates. The .fact remains that, notwithstanding the opposition to the Labour Party, we polled more than 50 per cent, of the total votes cast for senators throughout Australia. To say that we represent only 120.000 unionists is - on the face of it, absurd, since we polled 400,000 votes in the Senate elections alone. However, I do not wish to take up time further, because I feel that the matter is now susceptible of adjustment, and that it is merely a question of getting parties to recognise the effect of the amendment. I hope that the honourable ancl learned member will be able to recast it in a form which will make it less objectionable, and quite as effective for good.",55
433,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have no objection to allowing existing organizations twelve months to reform for the purposes of the measure,- with priority of application. That will get over some of the objections which have been expressed.",56
434,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not regard that suggestion as likely to remove many of the objections to the present amendment. I understood the honourable and learned gentleman to take his stand upon the contention that the industrial organizations registered under the Bill would have nothing to do with the existing organizations.,56
435,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,After registration they would have nothing to do with existing organizations.,56
436,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Bill has nothing to do with anything but registration, and is drafted with special reference to it. Let the honourable and learned member read sub-clause a of clause 62, which says thatAny association of employers in or in connection with any industry, who have in the aggregate, throughout the six months next preceding the application for registration, employed on an average taken per month not less than one hundred employees in that industry. Does not that contemplate a pre-existing or' ganization of employers? If not, what does it contemplate? The provision shows that the Bill is drafted to take advantage of existing organizations. Then paragraph d, of schedule B, speaks ofThe mode in which industrial agreements and 1 other instruments may be made by or on behalf of the association. . The registration of industrial agreements is one of the chief methods by which the Bill hopes to be effective.' Industrial agreements between whom ? With an industrial organization other than a trades union? Would that benefit an employer?The employers desire industrial agreements with responsible bodies which can give an assurance of industrial peace. honourable and learned member's amendment were adopted, an emplover might have an industrial agreement with"" an industrial organization registered under this Bill, and be defied by the members of a trades union. The trades union is the body which controls the men, and directly an industrial agreement ceased to suit them it could do as it pleased, and there would be no remedy. Then paragraph i of schedule B deals with the control of the property and the investment of the funds, and the periodical auditing of the accounts of the association. How can that have reference to any. but existing organizations ? The organizations which the honourable and learned member contemplates would have little or no funds. He does not understand the practical difficulties of the situation. I know that he has no desire to wreck the Bill, and that when it is made clear to him that his amendment 'will have that tendency, he will withdraw it; or, at any rate, recast it, so as to make it more effective. The Government has no objection to safeguard the political rights of every member of a union so that their political actions may be absolutely unfettered. As for the funds of the unions, it is only the funds subscribed by men who are compelled to join that we should consider. The funds of the unions now in existence can be no concern of ours, because the members of those unions were not compelled to join them.",56
437,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I wish, in passing, to refer to a matter which came up in the course of the discussion this afternoon, and to enter my protest against the unfair strictures made by the honourable member for Kennedy upon the Chief Justice of New South Wales, because of the opinions which he has recently expressed from the Bench. So far from the Chief Justice being in any sense a political Judge, he has never, so far as my knowledge of his career goes, occupied any more active political position than that of a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. I believe that he has never been a member of the popular branch of the Legislature of that State, and it is generally admitted that in the discharge of his duties he has been conspicuous by his fairness and the integrity of his administration. I agree with honourable members opposite that it is undesirable that we should have political Judges, especially for the admi listration of legislation in the framing of which they have If the taken a prominent part. I hope that honourable gentlemen who have expressed themselves so strongly on the subject of political Judges will unanimously resolve that no political Judge shall be appointed to administer the piovisions of this Bill.",56
438,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hear , hear. The President of the Court will have to abstain irom politics, which ever side he may come fiom.",56
439,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainly . I could name several legal gentlemen who are eminently qualified for the position in question ; but it should be a clear line of policy with every one who believes in the impartial administration of justice that the interpretation of laws should not be given to men who have had a hand in the making of them, and must necessarily, from that very fact, be consciously or unconsciously biased. Coming down to the matter which we are now discussing, I should like to refer to some of the arguments of honourable ngembers opposite. The Minister of External Affairs asked just now why should not a union-do what it likes with its own money ? There is a species of sophistry underlying that question. point out to the honourable gentleman that there is no objection to any union or any organization of any kind doing what it likes with its money, within certain recognised bounds. But we, on this side of the Chamber, hold that those who are compelled to subscribe to the funds of unions should not be coerced in the exercise of their franchise. This is a Bill for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, not a Bill for the settlement of political disputes, or for political purposes. sonable members opposite must - agree that it is not desirable that, where an organization exceeds the functions for which it was called into existence, and assumes a political as well as an industrial character, it should come within the scope of the Bill, or within the purview of the Court. I have listened with very great attention to the attempts, on the part of the honourable member for Darling, to show that industrial unions really do not take any interest ih politics, and that there is no reason to apprehend that they will use their funds for political purposes. Whenever I listen to the honourable member I cannot help being reminded of that individual whose smile was described as child-like and bland, but whose ways were somewhat peculiar. At the same time, I must admit that the placidity of countenance, which characterizes that honourable gentleman when he beams upon those who are opposing him in this Chamber, might disarm all suspicion, on the part of those who do not know of the Machiavellian artfulness underlying that seemingly artless exterior.",56
440,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member has never known the honourable member for Darling to do anvthing dishonourable.,57
441,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have never imputed to the honourable member any dishonourable action; but I say that he knows better than to believe that which he is endeavouring to persuade honourable members to accept as 5 E2 the truth. He knows, as well as I do, that the present idea of a great many of those who are connected with industrial organizations is to blend them into one concrete political entity. Honourable members must know of the efforts which are being made to amalgamate the Trades and Labour Council, and all the associated organizations, with the Political Labour League. No exception can be taken to that scheme, provided that we are not required to legislate specially in the interests of its promoters. We have to safeguard the interests I would of the public, apart from the trades unions. Above all, it is our duty to protect the great masses of the people outside of the unions. We have been described as the champions of the non-unionists. I admit that we are, but we are equally the champions of the unionists. We do not advocate that any special privilege should be . accorded to any one section of the community, but we stand up for equal rights for all. We desire to see equal justice done to all, and special privileges given to Rea- none. An attempt is being made to legislate, not in the interests of one particular class only, but in the interests of a section within that class-a n inner circle repre- , sented by honourable members opposite. Therefore, I hold that their position is not that of even representatives of labour generally. The position, developed during this debate, has made it clear that they represent only those sections of workers who are embraced within the ranks of the trades unions. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber, however, represent, not only the workers inside and outside of the unions, but the community generally. Honourable members opposite are very fond of asserting that those who are attempting to improve the Bill desire to destroy it, but I would remind them that the Bill is theproperty of honourable members in all .parts of the Chamber, and does not belong to any one section. Although I have expressed my disbelief in the efficacy of a Bill of this kind as a cure for all the industrial evils by which we are surrounded, I am by no means' opposed to trying the experiment now proposed. At the same time, I desire to feel assured that the Bill will operate as fairly as possible to all sections of the community, and that under the guise of a conciliation proposal we shall not bring into operation a measure which will be an instrument of tyranny in the hands of any one section of the community. When I fight ngainst what I regard as a perniThe cious clause in the Bill I am honestly deavouring to carry out my duty in this reoperation spect. The amendments which have been adopted up to the present time have, vastly improved the measure, and I trust that when we have finished with it it will prove much more acceptable to the community at large than it would have done if it had been passed in its original form. A great deal of capital has been made of the fact that trades unionists would by accepting the Bill give up their right to strike. That trial organization. has been the main argument used by manyambiguity honourable members, particularly in referguide ence to the provision for granting prefergeneral ence to unionists. As a matter of the unionists have not given up their to strike, and therefore the argument which some honourable members have lied loses the whole of its force. Even the Bill trades unions could, after giving the requisite notice, cease work at any time, f would ask honourable members whether non-unionists have not enjoyed the same ganization rights as the unionists so far as striking is concerned, and whether they would not make an equal surrender under the Bill. They would occupy exactly the same posithemselves tion as that of the unionists, and therefore the special plea put forward by many honercion-eithe orable members on behalf of the unionists cannot be upheld. The honourable member for Darling, the Minister of External fairs, and others declared that there no desire on the part of the unions to use their funds for political purposes, but would point out that that statement flatly contradicted by the honourable ber for Kennedy and the 'honourable member for Barrier, both direct labour representatives. Both these honourable members declared that the one purpose view was to enable the funds of the unions to be used for political purposes. I should like to know which of these conflicting statements is to be accepted by us. Obvibe ously, they cannot both be correct. would be advisable for honourable members belonging to the Labour Party to arrive at some kind of agreement, among themavail selves as to the intentions of those who responsible for our having this Bill before us. Something should be done by them to prevent, conflicting statements bf this kind from being made by honorbe able members who are in the one fold, whose conduct is regulated by the same caucus. This question may very well considered at the next meeting of the caucus. Mr Johnton. crux of the whole question is : Are these enorganizations which are to come under the of the Bill to be industrial or political unions? If , as some honourable members assert, it is not desired that the trades unions should be political organizations, there should be no hesitation on their part in accepting the amendment, because it could do no harm. It would make it perfectly clear that no industrial organization recognised by the Bill could apply its funds to any purpose other than those of an indusThere should be no upon that point, but a specific should be given to the Court. The trend of trades unionism.at present, fact, so far as we can gather from reright cent events, and from the views exupon pressed in the Labour journals, such reas the Queensland Worker, and the under Sydney Worker, which are largely sub. sidized by the unions, is towards the concentration of the whole of the affairs of labour under the contra! of one grand orfor political purposes. If the ^provisions of the Bill are to be so applied that industrial organizations can convert into political organizations, we know perfectly well that a system of cor active or passive coercion, or both-wil l be introduced, in connection with the preference to unionists, to induce those Afwho desire employment to join a union of was some kind. I object altogether to anything in the nature of coercion, but I beI lieve that every reasonable inducement, was not involving any attempt at compulmemsion, should be held out to all those who are engaged in an industry to join an industrial organization. The act of an individual in joining a union in should be purely voluntary. The benefits to be derived from joining the union could be fairly pointed out, and if a man con- sidercj that he was better outside he should at liberty to remain there. If it could It be shown !o any ordinary man that it would be to his advantage tojoin an industrial organization, he would himself of the opportunity to do so. are If the unions are made attractive to the workers generally, the latter will not need much persuasion to induce them to join them. Under the Bill, however, they will coerced into joining trades unions, and and if those organizations are subsequently transformed into political bodies they will be be morally bound by their rules. A man may have a particular hobby, which he desires to see represented in the Legislature. For example, he may wish to support a temperance candidate or a representative of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, but when once he is roped in by these industrial organizations, he will come under the operation of their political rules, and will feel morally bound to vote in favour of the candidate selected by them, even though he may entertain diametrically opposite opinions.",57
442,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What will coerce him into joining them ?,59
443,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The .knowledge that the joining of a union will afford him his only opportunity of gaining a livelihood.,59
444,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is discussing the preference question?,59
445,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am making an incidental reference to it, because it seems to me to be almost inextricably interwoven with the other matter.",59
446,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The question of whether a preference shall be granted to unionists is quite outside the scope of this amendment.,59
447,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think so. One is practically involved in the other. At any rate, as it has been discussed by honourable members, I presume that I am justified in incidentally referring to it. When once a man becomes a member of a trades union, which is also a political body, he is bound to support the labour candidate, otherwise he will be called a "" black-leg "" and a "" scab.""  the society with which the honourable member is connected.",59
448,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But there is this very marked distinction between organizations which are purely political and industrial organizations which subsequently become political bodies. If a man joins a Socialist League he does so because he is a Socialist. Naturally he will support a Socialist candidate. The same remark is applicable to a temperance organization, the Licensed Victuallers' Society, or a free-trade organization. Individuals join - these institutions because their views harmonize with those of a number of other people who have voluntarily associated themselves for the purpose of getting those opinions embodied in the legislation of the country. Their actions are voluntary, as distinguished from the compulsion which will be brought to bear under the operation of this Bill. We know perfectly well that at the present time there is not an absolute unanimity of opinion amongst members of trades unions themselves. Many of these members have assured me that they joined the unions only because they were ""forced to do so, in order to obtain employment. 1  remark made in regard to free-trade.",59
449,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The idea of a protectionist being forced to join a free-trade association is altogether untenable. Even if a man were coerced into joining such an institution, he would be at liberty to withdraw from it at any moment. During this debate reference has been . made to the Machine Shearers' Union. Personally I ' do not object to trades unions or to any organizations which are conducted upon voluntary lines, though I believe that the Machine Shearers' Union is purely a bogus workers' union.  ried, will play right into the hands of that bodv.",59
450,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Nothin g of the kind. It will not in any way prejudice industrial organizations. It is only when they overstep their proper bounds and become political organizations that they will be affected.  shut out everv bond fide unionist.,59
451,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think so, because men will still be at liberty to exercise their individual votes, and to join political organizations. The members of trades unions may hold very diverse views upon political questions. All that diversity of opinion can find expression at the ballot box through the political organizations which are already in existence. That, however, is a very different matter from including all the members of trades unions in political organizations. In my judgment the amendment perfectly safeguards individual liberty. Under its operation a man will be free to join the Employers' Federation, the Pastoralists' Union, or a free-trade, or protectionist, or temperance organization. It is purely a matter for his own judgment. I have no desire to see the amendment applied only to unions of employees; I make no distinction between employers and emploves. Such organizations as the Employers' Federation and the Pastoralists' Union ought to come under the operation of the amendment.  member know that the Employers' Federation does not favour this class of legislation?",59
452,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That does not enter into my consideration at all. It is a matter for themselves to decide.,59
453,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is not necessary for any employers' organizations to exist.,60
454,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that. I do not claim that it is necessary for an employer to join an organization. He may employ a large number o,f men, and may exercise full control over them. whilst he would be able to take action individually, it would be necessary for his employees to do so collectively. The honourable member for Darling referred to individual employers, and to the effect which the amendment-would have upon them. He maintains that if it is right that industrial organizations shall be prevented from becoming identified with political organizations, individual employers should be equally restrained from voicing their political opinions. To my mind that is a redtictio ad absurdum style of argument, because the employer who engages a thousand men can express only one opinion. giving expression to that opinion he does not coerce any one else into accepting it. Similarly the thousand employees are at liberty to express their individual opinions.",60
455,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The same principle should apply to a union of employers.,60
456,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Unquestionabl y it should. If they seek to convert their organizations into political unions they should certainly come under the operation of this amendment. That is only just and.reasonable, and would be giving effect to the principle for which I stand, namely, equal liberty and equal justice to all. In this connection, perhaps, I may be allowed to refer to some of the statements made by the Minister of External Affairs, in regard to the Wharf Labourers' Union. great stress upon the fact that for a long time past the members of that union have not earned more than 15s. per week. wonder if honourable members opposite have reflected upon what such a revelation discloses? Does it not show at once the utter inadequacy of this kind of legislation as a means of ameliorating the condition of the workers? The Wharf Labourers' Union is one of the closest labour corporations in existence. It practically enjoys a monopoly of a certain class of labour. Does not the fact alluded to conclusively demonstrate that the trades unions, as such, cannot ameliorate the conditions of the working classes, even when backed up by direct labour legislation? For the past eleven years we have had the State legislation of New South Wales largely dominated by - members of trades unions.",60
457,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Was it so dominated during the time that the right honourable member for East Sydney held office as Premier of New South Wales? Thus, Mr JOHNSON - I repeat that the legislation of the S'tate was for a great portion of that time dominated by the representatives of labour. Whilst the right honourable member for East Sydney held office as Premier, he certainly had the support of labour, but thelegislation passed by him was not dominated by it, because he had a majority quite independently of the Labour Party. '",60
458,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A very small majority. Did he have a majority independently of the Labour Party during the last twelve months of office?,60
459,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I shall not say that By he had; but, even then he was not dominated by the Labour Party. As .honourable members have good reason to know, he is not the kind of man to accept the domination of any party. If he were Prime Minister, and found that the majority of the people were not favourable to any legislation proposed by him, I am perfectly certain that he would have no hesitation in immediately resigning his office. We never had a greater period of prosperity--wage s were never higher, or employment more plentiful - tha n when the right honourable member held office as Premier of New South Wales.",60
460,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Wage s are now higher in New South Wales than ever they were.,60
461,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And yet the honorHe laid, able and learned gentleman has said that wharf labourers cannot earn more than 15s. per week. I Mr HUGHES - I say that wages are now higher; surely that is clear enough.",60
462,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That may be the case in one or two instances ,60
463,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So far as I-know, they are higher than they were two or three years ago.",60
464,Mr MCCOLL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And the unemployed more numerous ?,60
465,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Exactly . Wages may be higher in some occupations, but employment is more limited, because many persons have been forced out of work by legislation of this class.  with the clause?",60
466,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Honourable members opposite have been allowed to introduce matters having only an indirect bearing on the question immediately before the Chair, and surely I should have the right to reply to them ?  has not yet referred to the clause.",61
467,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I shall not take my cue from the honourable member. The figures which I propose to quote may not be particularly palatable to him, but I shall put them forward for the information of the Committee. I am informed, on authority which I have no reason to impugn, that whilst the right honourable member for East Sydney was Premier of New South Wales, the various branches of the iron industry, conducted by Vyle and Son, Ritchie and Sons, and the Clyde Engineering Company, employed some 1,200 men, and that these firms now employ only about half-a-dozen men and a few apprentices - There must be something radically wrong when so disastrous a change in an important industry takes place. This change has occurred in spite of direct labour legislation. I have no objection to such legislation, but am strongly opposed to all restrictive legislation which, under guise of benefiting the people generally, really dislocates industries from one end of the country to the other. If honourable members would allow the scales to fall from their eyes, and look at the matter in a reasonable way, they would recognise that, as the result' of these well-intentioned efforts to legislate upon restrictive lines, thousands of people have been thrown out of employment. Such legislation has prevented the expenditure of a great deal of money on industrial enterprises which would otherwise have been in full progress, and would be now absorbing a large section of that labour which is at present seeking in vain for employment. I have spoken of the tendency to throttle freedom, and to deny equal justice, which legislation of this kind involves. As reference has already been made to the Colorado strike, I should like to quote a statement made by the President when a deputation of the employee's of the Government Printing Office waited on him in regard to the "" open shop "" question. The followingis an extract from a letter dated May 23, by the New York correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald, dealing with the position of the unionists in connection with the Colorado strike :There is not now, and there never has been, embittered controversy about wages or hours'; the real fight is over the right of the union to forbid open shops, and to invoke in some petty squabble in a single small trade by ineans of a sympathetic strikeIt would be a sympathetic dispute in our casethe aid and the power of all organized labour, on the familiar theory that an injury to one is an injury to all. The open shop matter recently came to a crisis in regard to the management of the Government Printing Office, and the President, in saying no to the demands of the union, reaffirmed established doctrines with great emphasis, saying, among other things :"" Every man must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to do as he likes with his property or his labour, so long as be does not infringe the rights of others."" That is the principle for which I am contending, but which is denied by those who object to the amendment.",61
468,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member objects to unions spending their money in a way which they consider to be legitimate.,61
469,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I object to their spending, not their own funds, but the money contributed by others for a specific the purpose, and who are thus coerced into joining an organization of a character that they never intended to join. A man contributes to the funds of a trades union to secure the advantages which it will afford him in carrying on his trade, and not to gain political advantages - or, as they might prove to be, political disadvantages. If money is to be paid into unions for political purposes, that fact should be known to those who are called on to join them. Funds should not be obtained on some system of misrepresentation, which amounts practically to a false pretence. The President, continuing, saidIn the employment and dismissal of men in the Government service, I can no more recognise the fact that a man does Qr does not belong to a union as being for or against him than I can recognise the fact that he is a Protestant, or a Catholic, a Jew, or a Gentile, as being for or against him. It is an infamous thing in our American l if e, and fundamentally treacherous to our institutions, to apply to any man any test save that of his personal worth, or to draw between any two sets of men any distinction save the distinction of conduct, the distinction that marks off those who do well and wisely fiom those who do ill and foolishly. These are statements with which I am fully in accord. They seem to me to express the right of individual freedom- a freedom which, I think, it would be well for honourable members to recognise the Avisdom of preserving. They should seek to preserve it, not only for the sake of those institutions which they are so anxious to retain, but for the Avell-being of the whole community. I have already pointed out that it is only Avhen Ave depart from the principles of freedom and adopt those of restriction and coercion that Ave become involved in all sorts of political and economic difficulties. It is only by folloAA'ing principles of freedom that Ave can hope to secure social and industrial regeneration. It is only by folloAving the ideals of freedom that labour itself will be able to Avork but its own emancipation. Under the conditions of freedom which Ave should seek to establish, legislation of this kind Would be unnecessary, because it deals only with effects, leaving the primary causes untouched. One might just as Avell attempt to reduce a bank oA'erdraft Will a mustard plaster as try to bring about social and industrial regeneration by legislation of this kind. The amendment does not really meet the case fully. It is Avanting in some respects, because it does not go directly to the root of the matter. I gave notice of an amendment some three Aveeks ago in relation to this clause, but haA'e no desire to complicate the position by attempting to bring it fonvard at the present juncture. I shall aAvait the result of the deliberations which I understand have been going on in regard to the amendment noAv before the Committee, and I shall for the present resen'e to myself the right, to support the amendment as moved, unless some other understanding is arrived at which will make the proposal acceptable alike to the Ministry and their supporters, as Avell as to the Opposition.",61
470,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The clause, speaking in general terms, says in effect that any existing association may register under the Bill. Of course, there are a good many limitations in various parts of the measure \vhich apply after registration to existing organizations, or organizations which may hereafter come into existence. The amendment goes to the other extreme. While the clause says that any existing organization may register, the honourable and learned member for Angas practically says that no existing organization may register; because the first paragraph of his proviso enacts that an association shall no!, be registered unless it has been formed for the purposes of the Bill. Obviously, no existing organization has been formed for the purposes of a non-existent Act. Therefore, every union, Avhether of employers or of employee's, and Avhether a trades union or any other kind of industrial organization, Would be prevented from registering, that is, from coming into legal existence so as to be able to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill. That seems to me to go too far. Such a proposal might afford some ground- I do not the say full justification-for the suspicion that the clause as amended deliberately ignores and practically destroys to a large extent the industrial existence of the present unions. I do not think that Ave should adopt' this attitude. It is one which I would be loth to take, though I can imagine circumstances AA'hich Would compel me tc adopt it. We should, if possible, regard existing organizations as organizations which may be registered under the Bill. The honourable member for Darling stated certain objections to the amendment AA'hich are AvelJ worthy of careful consideration from a practical point of view. It is not desirable that a great union, Avhether of employers or of employees, should, feel that it must re-organize in order to register under the Bill. But the clause goes too far in providing that any union may register and become a union under the Bill, and then proceed Avithout any further limitations than are imposed upon organizations formed solely for the purposes of the Bill. I propose to move an amendment of the amendment, which at any rate, expresses my own A'ieAvs. I therefore move That the amendment be amended by the insertion, after the words "" Provided that,"" line 1, of the following words, "" No such organization shall be entitled to submit any industrial dispute to the Court when, and so long as, its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political nature."" In spite of much that has been said from the other point of vieAv, I feel strongly that we must keep the Bill one of an industrial character, that Ave must as far as possible avoid mixing up political and industrial affairs under a measure, purporting to deal Will industrial affairs only. I think that that principle is noAv practically recognised by all sections of the Committee. The adoption of my amendment will produce the following effects:-In the first place, it will alloAV any existing organization to register. In the second place, no existing organization which registers will have power to submit an industrial dispute to the Court - that is. it cannot become what is ordinarily known as a plaintiff, so long as its funds may be diverted to political purposes, or its members may be compelled to political action. I think that that is a reasonable limitation. Until the union, or association, whatever its nature may be, which has become an organization under the Bill, has divested itself of any political character that it may possess, it should not be permitted to move the Court. We are told that the great bulk of the industrial unions now in existence in Australia have no political leanings, so far as their organization is concerned, whatever the views of their members may be.",62
471,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No political objects.,63
472,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would not put it so generally as that. According to the testimony of the Minister of External Affairs, it seems to be the practice of unionists to vote against labour candidates, though, I must confess, I was surprised at the statement, because I had not suspected the facts to be as he represented them. The amendment which I have moved clearly provides that political and industrial purposes must be kept separate where it is sought to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill.",63
473,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How could they be kept separate in the case of the employees of a Public Works Department?,63
474,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I hold, perhaps rashly and wrongly, a very confident opinion as to what the views of the High Court would be upon the validity of a provision bringing public servants within the scope of the Bill ; but it would be the easiest thing in the world to separate political and industrial purposes, even in the case of a union of State employees. The mere fact that they were State employees would not make their - organization political.",63
475,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable and learned member's amendment would prevent - a deputation approaching a Minister.,63
476,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No . An association of public servants which approached a Minister to ask for an increase of wages would not have a political purpose, but if it asked for an alteration of the franchise, it would 'have a political purpose. An industrial purpose would not become a political purpose merely because it was pursued by the - employees of a State.",63
477,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It would be difficult - to determine what was, and what was not, - a political purpose.",63
478,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That would be a matter for the Court. If I were asked to define the term "" political,"" 1 should find it a difficult task; but if I were asked whether any specific action was political, I should find the question a fairly easy one. It is difficult to define the term "" goodness,"" but if one asked whether a certain action was a good action he would probably get a correct answer from most of those to whom he put the question. A special case is always more easily determined than is the enunciation of the general rule. The matter is one for the Court, which we are intrusting with much more important and difficult duties. A provision enabling existing unions to register after expunging political objects from their rules, would, in my mind, not be sufficient. I object to any provision which prevents existing organizations from registering. I wish the members of these organizations to feel that they can be registered under the Bill. They might not unnaturally resent any action on our part which would prevent them from registering. But it is fair to require them, once they have registered, to submit to whatever rules may be necessary to divest them of their political character. It has been suggested that aunion may have benefit objects, and that it would be hard to compel men who already subscribe to benefit societies to join such a union.",63
479,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is my chief objection. ; I do not pay much attention to the political objection.,63
480,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not with the honourable and learned member there. He seems to forget that the Court has absolute control over the entrance fees and annual subscriptions, and in New South Wales has in more than one case fixed a maximum rate. That objection could easily be met by an amendment of schedule B, or an amendment of some of the later clauses of the Bill. The clause under discussion relates to the great question, who shall be allowed to register? I say that every union should be allowed to register, with the proviso that having registered, and having thus prevented the bogus registration of an alleged union which those could join who wished, it must divest itself of any political character it may possess, before becoming entitled to set in motion the machinery of the Bill. I feel it difficult to support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas, even with the suggested addition, and it would also be difficult to support the clause as it stands. My objection is not to political unions, I object to such unions putting the provisions of the Bill.. My objection is deeper than the principle of preference which was embodied in the clause which we have already dealt.",63
481,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It will be resurrected.,64
482,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I trust that it will to life in the form in which it has passed co its temporary rest, because I think it more beautiful now than it was originally. I regret that the Prime Minister differs from me, because if I could only induce him to agree with me I should attain ject. The proposed amendment of the amendmember ment is sufficiently germane to the object of the clause, and to that of the amendply ment itself to come well within the rules the House. I move it in its present form because I do not desire to position of baldly voting for the clause or for the amendment, neither of which exmust presses my views. I wish to have an opamendment portunity to vote for that expression gislative intention which accords with my of .views. The reference to binding decisions would cover the case of the of the members of a union arriving at certain decisions, and quietly proceeding conduct all sorts of political operations, which no provision was made in the rules. I do not think that any trades union would amendment, try to circumvent the provisions in that way, because I understand that they are like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. shall be glad if the Government accept amendment as a reasonable compromise. I clo not suppose that we shall come to a sion to-night.",64
483,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think it would be a fair thing to do so.,64
484,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not suggesting tha* . we should not do so, if the debate has hee*i desires. exhausted. The Prime Minister must remember, however, that some honourable members have spoken at considerable that length, and that, consequently, those who have been waiting for their turn may care to address the Committee at this hour. The question which we have been discussing is one of great importance. and there in the Bill we come across matis ters which cannot fail to impress us as of the greatest importance, both in prinlearned ciple and operation. The measure tains half-a-dozen principles in addition the main principle, and it is not unreasonable that it should be disin cussed at considerable length. I am quite sure that much better work will be done but by allowing ample time for discussion than into motion by hurrying into divisions.",64
485,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Upon a point of order,' I desire to say that, although I do with not wish to prevent the honourable and learned member for. Corinella from taking a test vote, I object to the test being apcome plied in the way now proposed. The honourable and learned member is raising a quesis tion entirely different from that dealt with in my amendment. My proposal deals entirely with the conditions under which unions shall be registered, whereas the my obamendment of the honourable and learned introduces the question of the conditions with which unions will have to combefore they will be entitled to submit of industrial disputes to the Court. In May's Parliamentary Practice it is laid down at be placed in the page 287 thatIt is an imperative rule that every amendment be relevant to the question on which the is proposed, except in the case of of leamendments moved to the question for the Speaker's leaving the chair for the Committees Supply, or Ways and Means. majority Standing order 130 providesEvery amendment must be relevant to the questo tion to which it is proposed to be made. for Standing order 138 also providesAmendments may be proposed to a proposed as if such proposed amendment were of the Bill an original question. II submit that the clause and my amendmy ment deal simply with the conditions of - registration. A fair test vote could be taken diviupon the amendments, of which notice has already been given by the honourable member ber for Wentworth, and the honourable memfor Lang, or by the amendment of ableclause 27, on its recommittal, if the honour and learned member for Corinella so",64
486,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It appears to me the question before the Chair relatesprimarily to the registration of organizanot tions. The honourable and learned memlate ber for Angas has moved an amendment, which I feel sure he will maintain is quite Here relevant to that matter. His amendment a qualification of the provision at prebeiig sent in the clause. The honourable and member for Corinella desires to conmove an amendment upon that amend to ment, and I . think I have only to show that his amendment is germane to the clause general ih order to prove also that it is relevant to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas. Although I must say that I do not think that this is the most convenient or most appropriate place to move such an amendment, yet, regarding it as a qualification, or proviso, I consider it is quite relevant original clause. It is not an absolute negation. If it were the point might be further considered. The result of the adoption of the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella would not be to close the door absolutely to members of the existing organizations, but would make it necessary for them to go through a further stage before they could become plaintiffs before the Court. If the amendment were carried it would still be within the competence of the Court to make them defendants. Under these circumstances, I rule that the amendment is relevant."" Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). . - I think that it will be admitted, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella has stated, that we are now considering one of those points in the Bill which stand out from the body of the measure, and require the most careful consideration. Therefore, I do not think that the discussion which has taken place upon it can be in any way regarded as having involved a waste of time. At present I feel a certain degree of doubt as to the wisest course to pursue with regard to the two amendments now before the - Committee. The amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Angas is the outcome of a suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney, with which I coincided, although I fel t the difficulty of embodying it as a vital principle in the Bill at the present stage. I cannot help feeling that if those honourable members who earnestly desire to see this class of legislation in operation had fully considered the advantage of having comprised in a union all those employed in a certain industry instead of only the members of the existing unions, they would have been induced to adopt it'. If we are going to avoid serious disturbances in our industrial life, we must have unions representing the whole, and not merely a section of the employees engaged in any industry. The further I look into this matter the more difficult it seems to believe that the supporters of the clause could really have meant all they have said in opposing the proposal. Their main idea is to ultimately bring within the limits of the unions all those that are employed in an industry. That is the ideal of unionism. The intention, and the practical outcome, of the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney would be, in one operation, to bring every man withto the"" in the bounds of the organization.",64
487,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That could not be done unless we gave preference to unionists. Mr G. B..EDWARDS - What would be the object of preference to unionists, if every man employed in an industry were included in the union. It would be impossible to exclude any one from such a union. The members of the present unions could come over to the more comprehensive organizations in a body, and in nine-tenths of the cases would dominate them. With such organizations as I have indicated, the Bill would prove more effective than under any other circumstances. The whole body of the employees would be ranged on the one side, and the whole body of the employers 011 the other. If necessary, territorial limits could be defined, and we should thus have a ready, direct, and efficient means of attaining the ends which are aimed at under the Bill. I have been provoked to speak in regard to this clause by the repeated taunts of honourable members opposite that opposition to any portion of the Bill emanates only from those who desire to wreck the measure. I deny that absolutely. No man on the Government side-no t even the draftsman of the Bill , or the Prime Minister - is a warmer supporter than I am of the principle of settling industrial strife by peaceful methods. Similar measures to this have been introduced by one or two States Governments, and we have not yet had sufficient experience to guide us in preparing the most perfect measure that can be obtained. But we have had some experience, and it behoves us to act carefully if we desire this legislation to prove effective. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie last night said that the speeches of some of us on this side of the Chamber with regard to this measure were totally different from our speeches on the hustings. So far as I am concerned, from start to finish, my speeches in this Chamber, with regard to conciliation and arbitration, have been in accord with every iota of my speeches on the hustings. I have maintained the same attitude all through. But I said when the Bill was introduced, that I had considerable doubts with regard to some portions of it. If my mind with regard to the question was Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought - whic h some people would describe as a ""Yes-No attitude""-it was because the problem is so vast, the interests affected are so great, and the legislation in itself is so new, that all of us who have an honest desire to do something which will be effective ancl beneficial, must be oppressed with doubts. While I committed myself to attempt to do something that would give us some practical method of putting an end to strikes and bringing about industrial peace, I stated boldly that there were many proposals in this measure which, in Committee, I should have to oppose, and that I did' not know whether even in the end I should not be found voting against the third reading. I desire to vote for the third reading Of the Bill ; and it is for that reason that I am so anxious that the Government should give way. on points where they lose nothing of the efficacy of the measure, but are enabled to bring scope the whole of the employees and employers. The amendment is a fair and square attempt to bring an effective measure into operation. It is for these reasons that I ask the Government to consider the unwisdom of rejecting a proposal which many of us firmly believe would add to the efficiency of this legislation. The honourable member for Barrier argued that if we were not to give preference to unionists he would prefer to go back to the old method of strikes, of which the honourable member himself has had as bitter an experience as any one amongst us. He must have come to that conclusion without considering the change which the amendment would make. The honourable member's ideal as an advocate of unionism is to get the whole of the workmen into the unions. We show him a way by which the whole of the men will not ultimately but straight away be brought into the unions. ' The amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney would have that effect, and the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas attempts to go as far as possible in that direction.",65
488,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They would merely be unions in name then, I think.",66
489,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They would be unions for purposes of this measure; and a union for the purpose of this Bill, including - all employees, is the most perfect attainment of the trades union ideal which honourable members opposite can expect to get. Returning to the honbr'able member for Kalgoorlie, he asked last night why we Mere proposing to deter from preference r those members of unions who had borne "" the heat and burden of the day,"" and had worked for years and years with this legislation in view. He contended that the unions had worked for industrial conciliation, and that, consequently, their members ought not to be shut out from the special benefits of such legislation. But as the honourable member for Lang has pointed out, diametrically opposite views have been expressed by honourable members opposite. We were told the other night that the unions all along have been opposed to compulsory arbitration, and that it was with the greatest difficulty that they could be persuaded to consent to such Bills as are now before the Committee.",66
490,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Who said so?,66
491,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister said, in the course of one of the biggest fights we have had over this Bill , under its that he knew there was great difficulty jn persuading the unionists to consent to this legislation. Similar statements were made by witnesses who gave evidence before the Royal Commission on Strikes in New South Wales in 1890. The honourable member for Darling said so then, and he said so in this Chamber last night. He asserted that it had been only with the greatest difficulty that the union leaders could be induced to accept such legislation. Yet the honourable member for Kalgoorlie tells us that this is the object for which they have been working for years past, and that we are attempting to deprive them of their legitimate rights. When he asks why we should give special preference to thoseunionists who have borne the . "" heat and burden of the day,"" I reply that if men are actuated in their aims by high ideals, they will be only too glad when they have achieved them to allow others to come in on the same terms. In the very parable from the Scriptures which was used by the honourable member, the first employee who was engaged in the vineyard received his penny for the work which he did, and the. last 'employee"" who worked upon the vineyard received the same payment. The first man received all that he was entitled to, and the last man got that sum for which he engaged. And so.in regard to this legislation. No true democrat can ever set up a claim for a privilege to anv man, no matter how ably and well he may have worked in the cause. I ask those who so manfully worked for Federation if , having achieved it, they thousrh't that they should be the only ones to enjoy the Federal franchise? I worked hard in the neighbouring. State to have adult suffrage made the law of the land, but I did not want to get any special privileges for those who worked for that principle. I was only too glad to see every one come in on the same terms as myself. It is a wrong principle that causes those who have been doing this pioneer work on behalf of the trades unions, to seek to obtain any special benefit from the ultimate carrying out of the legislation for which they have laboured.",66
492,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Do we not advocate the keeping open of our doors, so that others mav enjov the same privileges? Mr G! B. EDWARDS - I will deal with that position shortly, ancl will show organizations of the workers. what will be the position of those who forced through these so - called "" open doors."" They will be in the miserable tion of being outcasts among unionists. ask the honourable member to recollect what far better chance of success. it is that we on this side of the House pose. We want to enrol all the employees, that we can obtain a consensus of their opinion. There is no more compulsion in enrolling them than there is in enrolling the citizens of the Commonwealth, so that they may vote for members of this Parliain ment.",67
493,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And the employers will an organization. pay the fees.,67
494,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At the present time many employers pay the fees of some of their workmen who belong to unions. They are not bogus unions at all. , I man comes to an employer and represents that he wants work, and must become member of a union, it is frequently the that the employer pays the entrance-fee. That is done now, and will be done again, and there is nothing degrading to 'a man accepting a loan or a gif t in order to legally entitle him to enter a union.",67
495,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the amount stopped out of his first wages.,67
496,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And quite right, too, if there has been a loan. We another one. want a workable measure, and that can be got only by amendment. It is to accuse all those who wish to carry amendments of a desire to .wreck the Bill. for complying with the Bill . The first great amendment proposed was the question of including railway employees, unions. and I voted for that amendment. never accused, then, by honourable members opposite, of attempting to wreck the B i that was an amendment they all wanted, and one which I thought was required. was my opinion, and is so still, that we have the constitutional power to include those employees; and it was thought that the amendment would improve the Bill. And in my opinion the present amendment will also be a great improvement if . in some form, we can pass it. We are guided in this matter to a great extent by the experiencein New South Wales. I do not think that the most ardent advocate of compulsoryconciliation and arbitration can say that this sort of legislation has been an undoubted success in that State. I have advocated this legislation for many years, but I clo not regard the New South Wales Act as a success. That Act has failed to some extent simply because it took over the unions as If , under are the Act, as this amendment proposes, all those employed in the industries hacl been positaken over, and all political objects of I unions eliminated, there would have been a We must prohave organization; the idea of this Bill is so founded on organizations of employers and employed. If there cannot be an organization of employers by reason of the magnitude of some man's trade, or by reason of there being only one man in the'trade witha certain area, the Bil l very properly regards a single employer as tantamount to While that is so, it seems to me that the only logical course is to get an organization of all that are employed. We could then get a real opinion as to what is required in a certain trade f a by those who are earning their living in that trade; we should get any step opposed a or consented to by the whole of those who case are employed. But honourable members opposite want to see a Bill which will provide for representatives of an association in of employers on the one side, and on the other side of a certain section of employees. It would be no hardship to those unions to is be told that if they wished to take advantage of the Bill they must, as it were, come out of their present shell, and get into That could be done by the members en bloc, following a simple resowrong lution; and the separate organization could some be constituted under conditions necessary God forbid on that I should say anything against trades No man knows better than I do I was the benefit of such organizations. I have suffered the feeling of bitterness, and the l l ; sense of injustice, which arises from a man being paid less than he is entitled to. I It have seen unions obtain for working men better wages and better conditions, and I have seen men educated by them in industrial matters. These are great benefits, and we cannot disguise for one moment the great and noble work that unions have done in the past in these respects. But our little systems have their day, and cease to be. The moment we have legislation of the character proposed, the ' reason for trades unions will pass away at once. Many of the unions have useful functions, such as benefit funds, the spread of political propaganda, the instruction of members on industrial questions, or the perfecting of them in handicraft; but all, those purposes, while useful, are not required for this legislation. What are the objections which have been raised to unions ? I have told honourable members what I think of the great work which unions have done; but, viewed from the stand-point of this Bill, there are serious objections to the tion of the unions as they at present exist. In the first place, they mean an unnecessary fax on the worker. It has been pointed out, over and over again, that there are large bodies of casual workers who pass from one calling to another, who may be wharf labourers or bricklayers' labourers one day, and blacksmiths' strikers or drivers of drays the next day. Are such men to be called upon to pay an entrance fee into each union ? We do not want anything of that kind; and under some such amendment as that submitted by the honourable and learned member for North Sydney, we need have no entrance fees. The simple monthly or half-yearly subscription would confer the power to transfer from one trad? to another, so that a man would not be hampered in any direction, but would be able to seek for work where he could best obtain it. One of the greatest objections which have been mentioned to the Committee is thab unions are to a large extent political organizations. Some of the unions, I admit, are not political, but the great majority are strongly political, and have a tendency to become more so day by day. It has been said that the unions amalgamate with the Political Labour League and affiliate one with another, and I cannot understand how we can expect to carry out this measure if we are to have a number of industrial organizations which are amalgamated for political purposes. We might have the same units entirely in another organization, just in the same way as I have belonged to a free-trade organization, and also to a union of manual//-. G. B. Edwards. facturers. There is nothing to stop men from belonging to both bodies, and it has been pointed out forcibly that the subscriptions required for carrying out this measure would be so small as to present no difficulty. We could, I say, do away with entrance fees, and give a man a clearance certificate from one trade, to another, so that he could make as many changes as he liked. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that the Government propose an amendment in a subsequent clause to open the doors of the unions. I suppose that means that we are to force the doors of the unions open, because it is thought the unions are inclined to close them. But even the Prime Minister admitted-and he could not do lessthat he is determined to have the doors opened. What, however, would be the position of those men who are sent into unions with the Judge's mandamus in adoptheir hands? What sort of industrial life would they have under such terms and conditions? We know very well what would happen. There would be in the union, as it were, a double body. There would be an esoteric and 'an exoteric union - one , the inner secret circle, where politicians pull the strings and exercise all the influence and patronage for the benefit of the original "" pure merino "" unionists; and, another, the outside pariahs, not entitled to those great advantages, and only admitted with the Judge's orders in their hands. That is unthinkable. Mr..FRAZER - Is it not a fact that there is only one union in Australia which has closed its doors?",67
497,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have sufficient knowledge of human nature to know that if we give trades unions the power to close their doors by granting a preference to their members, those doors will be closed, and the entrance subscription will be made prohibitive. That is a power which none of the so-called democrats in this House would ever dream of conferring upon the employers as a class. I hold that it is a power which ought not to be given to any man-eithe r employer or employ^. It is a bad feature in the history of the ancient Grecian cities that when Demos obtained certain privileges he speedily began to deny similar privileges to others.",68
498,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member form his opinion from his association with honourable members opposite?,68
499,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have formed my opinion as a man of the iworld. I know perfectly well that individuals will act fiom motives of self-interest. If we fer upon any men special privileges, we shall find them using their power to gain an advantage over their fellows. It is the duty of the Legislature to guard against such an abuse of power or privilege. In some quarters it has been denied that trades unions exercise political power. I hold in my hand the report of the New South Wales Royal Commission upon strikes. it I have read the evidence of two typical unionists. I refer to the honourable member for Darling and Senator Higgs. From their evidence it is abundantly clear that all organizations are permeated by political considerations. As the honourable member for Darling admits,' the old trades unions steer clear of politics, but the new unions are bound to take up political matters, must continue to do so more and more, time goes on. Both witnesses expressed the same view. They affirmed that the mate outcome of the new unionism will an attempt to achieve State Socialism. I not condemn Socialism. I am one of .the greatest Socialists upon this side of the House. The only difference between hona orable members opposite and myself is that I desire to proceed at a slower rate than they do. I do not wish to usher the millennium the week after next. From the testimony of the two representative - leaders of unionism to whom I have ' ferred, it is evident that trades unions acutated by political motives. It could well be otherwise. At the period of which I speak--som e twelve years ago-bot h honourable member for Darling and Senator Higgs declared that it was useless to tempt to settle industrial quarrels by ciliation and arbitration. They merely aimed at the achievement of State Socialvictories ism. Unionists were always opposed to arbitration. They are now in favour this Bill. On the other hand the employers, who were always in favour of arbitration, are now opposed to this Bill. The reason is to be found in the origin of this measure, which was drafted under the-influence political labour bodies. I hold that should endeavour to guard the interests only of unionists and non-unionists, the great masses who are not included either of these categories. We have guard, them against becoming a seroffice, vile section of the community. As legislawithin tors, we are bound to steer a medium course in the interests of the general body of people. I think that some such amendsure ment as that which has been submitted &'5S' conthe honourable and learned member for Angas is absolutely necessary. Our duty is to do our best to secure a workable measure, and that can be accomplished only by excluding political considerations from industrial organizations - For what do trades unions exist? Do they not aim at securing shorter hours, increased wages, and better conditions for the workers? Are those In not the very matters which we expect to settle under'this Bill? What further, then, is required from these unions as industrial organizations? To obtain the .best results these under this Bill, we must provide for an entirely new organization, although, the - members of the present trades unions will be at liberty to become members of it.' It has been urged by the supporters of the and clause that unionists have given up. the as only weapon in their power-the power to strike-and that consequently they should ultibe granted a preference. But I would ask, be "" Have not the employers given up theii do power to lock out?"" Moreover, in foregoing their power to strike, unionists have abandoned very little, because, after all, it wa& two-edged sword. Though it was a great power to possess, it was one which had to be kept in reserve as long as possible. On in the other hand, the employers have given up their right to freedom of contract. I freely admit that it was a serious evil rethat disputes could never be amicably are settled so long as that right existed. not The employers have given up just as much as have the workers. It was absolutely the essential that both these powers should be surrendered, if we were to carry'out legisatlation of this kind. The power to strike conhas done incalculable harm to the workers themselves. Unions have achieved morefrom time to time by silent moral force than have ever been achieved by means of of strikes. I can only say, in conclusion, that. I never addressed myself to any measure with a greater desire to see some tangible result than I entertain in this case. Honourable-members who are in mv political of confidence-wh o are personal friends, of we mv own-kno w that I have committed mynot' self over and over again to support such but of a measure, and have been doing my best into secure the passing of a workable .Bill. to If the party to which I belong were in and would not. make some attempt our constitutional limits to solve the question of how to secure industrial peace the - o r if it wished to vote, against this meain its final stage, although it had been by made as nearly perfect as possible- I should be prepared to leave it and to vote for the Bill, because I conscientiously believe that some serious attempt should be made in this direction. I have not been influenced by the threat that has been held out that we "" shall suffer for this."" - I care not twopence for such threats. I am ready to take whatever gruel may be served out to me. I have not applied for a certificate - from the party opposite, and if I obtained one I should probably be opposed by a labour candidate just the same. .It has often .been said that the bitterest opposition is generally encountered by - men whose aspirations, in the main, most nearly approximate to those of the Labour Party, and, as I am mostly in accord with the party, I may have to encounter some hostility in my next campaign. I do, however, what I consider to, be right, and. am prepared to put up with the consequences. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.58 p.m.",68
