EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL was Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.",9
3,Mr RUDDOCK,NOTICE PAPER,"1 were have a few moments left from when I speaking on the Extradition Amendment Bill on the last occasion. I take tunity, because I had largely concluded my remarks, of refreshing the mind .of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in relation to the questions that I raised on that casion. I was . particularly conGeneral cerned-largely because no requirements for reporting to this Parliament are promal vided in the extradition legislaan tion-about the absence of substantial reporting on the way in which the extraDavid dition law of this country is being adminquestions istered. I noted that in the 1988-89 report of the Attorney-General's Department some information was given. The matter which was of particular interest to me was the way in which the provisions dealing with the establishment of the circumstances which would lead to a person's extradition tion from Australia operate in this legistralia lation. My concern-it was a concern expressed about this law when it was first passed-was that there was no requirerise ment for Australia to satisfy itself that there was a prima facie case involving a person who might be extradited from this country. We accepted at face value information provided by a foreign country. In the main I imagine that that is probably reasonable. In this legislation we are again facilitating further the way in which these matters the might be progressed by ensuring that papers from a foreign country are simply without any inquiry as to their was validity in the proceedings. It seemed to me in the context of the particular legislation that we are addressing that the following questions are reasonable questions to ask: How are these provisions operating? Have there been serious questions which have arisen involving the question of whether or not there a proper prima facie case? Are there 1990 provisions by which the Attorney-General could be approached separately-in fact, invited to delay deportation or to look at the question again-if a serious question of the way in which these matters were being pursued by a foreign government raised? I was particularly concerned was to get more detailed answers from the Attorney as to the way in which the extrathe oppordition law is operating. There is one other matter I want to deal with concerning this legislation. I want to ocdraw to the attention of the Attorneythe article that appeared in the Criminal Law Journal dealing with inforextradition in Australian law. It was article written by the Professor of Law at the University of Melbourne, Professor Lanham. He raised a number of relating to our immigration law, and deportation in particular. Deportation is available for particular cases where people have breached our immigration law and it serves a particular purpose in the law of this country. It is a matter of some concern that there is the possibility that the law for the deportaof people who have come into Ausillegally or committed certain types I of offences within Australia which may lead to criminal deportation might give to a situation where there is a form of informal extradition in which the normal sorts of protections that would be involved in this legislation might not be guaranteed. I would seek some advice from the Attorney as to the way in which the Government ensures that there is proper liaison in these matters and that the way in which the migration law operates is not such as to lead to informal extradition where the extradition law of this country would not otherwise permit a person to be extradited. I take this opportunity just to emphasise again those matters of proper reporting requirements; of the need to inform the Parliament as to the way in which the Attorney would exercise his discretion; of whether or not prima facie there were doubts about proper claims for extradition from this country; and, finally, the extent to which informal extradition might be a problem and the way it would be addressed to ensure that this legislation operates in a sensible way with the migration law of this country.",9
4,Mr DUFFY,NOTICE PAPER,"in reply-First, I would like to thank the honourable members who have taken part in this debate. We have had constructive contributions from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Early in their' speeches two of those honourable members raised a point regarding the second reading speech on the Extradition Amendment Bill which, they claimed, did not provide sufficient detail about the need for the particular amendments in the Bill. I must say that. I agree with the criticism that the second reading speech could have been more informative, particularly in giving more detail on the need for these amendments and the difficulties that the amendments are designed to overcome. I agree to take on board the suggestions made by both the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Dundas that more· detail be provided in second reading speeches. I now turn to some of the particular concerns raised, mainly by the· honourable member for Kooyong. I think that these require particular comment in reply. The honourable member for Kooyong asserted that .the present regulations under section 11 of the Extradition Act 1988 could not firstly identify nor secondly give legal effect to Australia's extradition obligations under a multilateral treaty in respect of a country with which Australia had a pre-existing bilateral extradition treaty relationship. Taking the second point first-that is, the assertion that the regulations cannot give legal effect to Australia's extradition obligations-I wish to make it clear that under section 11, as presently drafted, Australia has been able to give legal effect to extradition obligations it has under multilateral treaties. Australia's compliance with those obligations has been met in various ways. In fact, there are four areas where that compliance is met. Firstly, where Australia has treaty obligations or extradition relations with a country based on a treaty inherited from the United Kingdom, all relevant multilateral treaties which include Australia and that country as parties operate as protocols, having the effect of including multilateral treaty offences in the list of offences in the inherited treaty for which extradition can be granted. That is the first one, the inherited situation. Secondly, where Australia's extradition relationship is governed by a treaty which was negotiated since 1970, that treaty will already permit extradition for multilateral treaty offences. That is the second one, the period since 1970. Thirdly, where the relationship is based on reciprocity pursuant to the Commonwealth schem(f for the rendition of fugitive offenders, Australia can grant extradition for any offence defined as extraditable under our law. All relevant multilateral treaty offences fit within this category. The fourth position is that, where. the relationshjp is based on reciprocity pUrsuant to an individually agreed relationship, Australia can give extradition for any offence defined as extraditable under our law. All relevant multilateral treaties, again, fit within that fourth category. However, the honourable member for Kooyong is correct in saying that the existing section 11 of the Extradition Act 1988 does not permit ready identification of such countries.. Indeed, the very purpose of the amend merit to section 11 contained in clause 4 of the Bill is to ensure that· countries with whi,ch Australia has extradition relationships· are able to be identified in regulations. made under ,the Extradition Act. That was clearly a matter which had to be addressed. The Government was aware of that and that was, of course, as I have indicated, the, very purpose of the amendments to section 11. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Kooyong is correct to say that until this Bill came before the - arlia­ ment, the problem that he adverted to was, in fact, a difficulty. Another point which was made in the course of the debate a couple of weeks ago was that, pursuant to section' 68(1) of the Judiciary Act, the laws of the States and Territories relating to the granting of bail apply to extradition proceedings. That is how I understood .the position put by the honourable member Kooyong. That is not correct. The laws of the States and Territories relating to the granting of bail do not apply to extradition proceedings. If honourable members refer to section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act, they will·find that in the Rademeyer case, (1985) 1 New South Wales Law Reports at page 285, Mr Justice Yeldham held that the Commonwealth had plainly shown an intention to cover the entire field concerning extradition and that consequently the New South Wales bail legislation could not apply to a person accused of an extradition crime. There was no application of that New South Wales bail legislation to a person accused of an extradition crime. I turn now to a matter which caused some concern to the shadow· Attorney General, the honourable member for Kooyong. Clauses 6 and 8 of this Bill introduce a presumption against bail unless there are special circumstancesjustifying such a course. The Opposition has raised concerns about these amendments. It should be borne in mind that extradition proceedings, based on all of the modern extradition treaties, do not involve a determination of guilt or innoCence, or whether even the documents produced by the requesting country would be sufficient to warrant trial had the offence occurred in Australia. The magistrate merely decipes whether' the requesting country has made a sufficient case for the return of the person to· face trial or serve what is already an imposed sentence. Notwithstanding the operation of modern extradition relationships,· the Opposition has, nevertheless, through the honourable member for Kooyong, expressed concern to ensure that a person who wins before the magistrate, not because of some technical point, but because of some problem of substance in the requesting country's case, is not then denied bail because of the operation of the presumption against bail when the requesting country appeals the magistrate's decision. As to that matter which the honourable member for Kooyong raised, clearly the situation is that, where a magistrate is required to be satisfied that the requesting country has made out a prima facie case and the magistrate refuses to grant extradition because he or she is not satisfied that the prima facie case has been made out, it maybe that the circumstance referred to would arise, that is, that the requesting country would appeal such a decision. In such circumstances lam confident that the special circumstances would be made out and that the person would be granted bail pending the hearing of the appeal; that is, where, the magistrate does not accept the application on its merits, not on a question of a technicality. I am able to assure honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member ,for Kooyong, that the concern expressed in the debate is adequately met by the amendments proposed in the Bill. The honourable member for Dundas touched upon various matters. He raised the question of the second reading speech, which I have dealt with. He also touched on the requirement to have more comprehensive reporting on how the Extradition Act is operating, and this morning he raised the issue in the immigration area in respect of deportation. He expres-ed concern that we may have an informal extradition arrangement operating.· In resPect of the operation of the Act, I am able to. say to the honourable member for Dundas that I would undertake to take up with my Department the idea he has put forward of providing additional information, . particularly in the departmental annual report, in respect of the Extradition Act. I emphasise that the prima facie case in respect of other matters raised by the honourable member for Dundas has generally been done away with, perhaps further emphasis being placed on the matters that I raised earlier in respect of the raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. That is, it must be borne in mind that extradition proceedings based on modern treaties do not jnvolve a determination of guilt or innocence, or whether even the documents produced by the requesting· country would be sufficient to warrant trial had the offence occurred in Australia. The magistrate merely decides in this circumstance whether the requesting country has made a sufficient case for the return of a person to face trial or, as I indicated earlier, to serve an already imposed sentence. Although this matter is one that I will certainly look at in more detail, in sponding to it this morning it is necessary to point out that extradition and deporplanation tation are entirely different schemes. We Attorney have a situation where the extradition sition is dealt with within the portfolio the Attorney-General. It is just tal, I suppose, that in respect of deportation, which is a matter for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Immigraexplanation tion, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is here this morning and no doubt will take on board the honourable member has raised. Finally, I must touch on the comment of my colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Mr Hand interjectzng",10
5,Mr DUFFY,NOTICE PAPER,"In response to that interjection from the Minister, which ..! should ignore, Mr SPEAKER - ",12
6,Mr SPEAKER,NOTICE PAPER,"-You should, yes; everybody else did.",12
7,Mr DUFFY,NOTICE PAPER,"The question raised by the honourable member for Dundas is an issue. that has to be looked at by both of us. Finally, I move to the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who is not here this morning. He focused on some provisions relating to bail. At the end of the day, despite some fairly trenchant criticisms in various areas, he welcomed the provisions that allow bail under certain circumstances and considers the amendments put forward in issues this Bill to be an improvement. As we always do, we welcome the support of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on this, or any other, issue. He had particular concerns about this matter, and I am very pleased to say that he now considers that the amendments put forward in this Bill meet many of the concerns he had regarding bail provisions, and he in fact says that the amendments are a considerable improvement.  leave-During the second reading debate I foreshadowed that the Opposition would move amendments to clauses 6 and 8 of the Extradition Amendment Bill. I indirecated that these amendments would be moved if there was not an adequate exfrom the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). I accept the explanation that the has given in regard to those poclauses and, therefore, there will be no of need for a committee stage because I will coincidennot be moving the amendments. I thank the Attorney for his careful consideration not only of my request for an on those clauses but of other matters to which he alluded. I am grateful; I just wish that all Ministers would matters the follow his example. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duffy) read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) Second :Q.eading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Keating: That the :Sill be now read a second time.",12
8,Mr ELLIOTT,NOTICE PAPER," Last night when I was speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) for this year was detailing the Government's .achieveRiver-Toongabbie ments in policy areas for the aged. I want to go on this morning to talk· about some other areas of the Budget, particularly landmark initiatives in this Budget relating to people with disabilities. They should be recognised as one of the great achieveflood ments of this year's Budget. I am pleased to say that a number of organisations developed, with financial support from the Government, highly commendable projsighted ects for the disabled. The Spastic Centre's new open employment project, which was opened by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), in the heart of my electorate, is an inspiration in this field. I know that this Budget· continue these progressive reforms in such an important area of social justice policy. The Federal Government has also honmore, oured its commitmerit to improving childwillingness care facilities and expanding health ices for women. These are very important contributions which will certainly go long way to improving the standard of living in my electorate and western Sydney generally. The Westmead Hospital in my electoness rate has developed as one of the great teaching hospitals in Australia. It of the Whitlam Government's great achievements. This Budget gives further impetus for the Westmead Hospital to fulfil its dual role of skilful medical search and provision of a wide range of practical hospital services. Further, I look forward to the initiatives in medical research. funding announced in the Budget, be which will benefit the newly established research foundation at Westmead Hospital. I am particularly pleased to note this year's Budget allocation of $5.05m for floodplain management under the Pri1990-91 mary Industries and Energy portfolio. The flood management allocation translates into Commonwealth assistance for flood mitigation works. I emphasise that this is a very important issue in my electorate, where over recent years urban flooding has rendered enormous damage .and trauma to many households. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr I Kerin) has advised me that the Parramatta CreeJ< catchment area received $750,000 for flood mitigation in this Budget. That is an increase of $50,000 the over last year and will translate into $1.875m worth of works for flood mitigation in the region, using the established funding formula. That will be welcomed by all as a worthwhile advance in have this important area. The Budget also contains some farinitiatives in key areas of corporate activity and reforms relating to small business. The Federal Budget provides an additional $23m for the Australian Securities Commission and a commitment to an extra $40m in 1992-93. This is an will important step in dealing with the rorts in which a number of the major corporate entrepreneurs have indulged. Furtherit demonstrates this Government's to ensure that the cowboy servmentality of those corporate entrepreneurs is brought to book after a decade a or more of problems in this area. The Australian Securities Commission must be well resourced in order to perform effectively its corporate watchdog role. Busimust adopt decent, moral and ethical practices. The tax avoidance and evasion was one ethos must be buried forever. I should like to refer to the banks, their policies and interest rates. It is clear that the 1990-91 Budget provides the scope for refurther reduction in interest rates and allows for a progressive easing of monetary policy. In my view the banks have allowed the private customer and small business to bear an unfair part of·the burden for their lending profligacy in the past few years. The business collapses as a result of excessive borrowing and dubious investment decisions are not the ordinary customer's fault. The banks, in order to compensate. themselves, have kept their margins too large for far too long. Now there is undoubtedly scope for cu.ts in bank lending rates, and I trust that banks will respond, albeit very belatedly, to the call by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for them to pass on ,the benefits of lower official cash rates to customers a lot quickly. I note the Commonwealth Bank decision on Monday as a positive step in this regard. It is critical that the downward pressure on interest rates be maintained for the well-being of our economy. Another key issue dealt with in this year's Budget is the environment. I take the opportunity to applaud the Government's initiatives, which will enable Australia to work towards establi-hing economically sustainable development. I certainly welcome the measures announced in this year's Budget for integrating more· closely the taxation system and the environment. The truth is that the Government must lead reform in this area, and it can do so by offering taxation incentives to industry. Industry must realise that the exploitation of the environstandards ment results in short-term profits, but.in the long term there is notping to be gained by anyone if such an approach is allowed to continue. The environment is a critical political issue, because our future economic considerations hinge on our understanding of the impact of exploiting nonrenewable resources. During the period of the Hawke Government the Australian Labor Party has developed a reasoned and comprehensive approach to our natioI1's future. We are developing strategies that will allow us continue to thrive as a nation, a nation that acknowledges that we are all part of a much broader ecological system. There is a lot of industry in my electoworker. rate. Last year there was a chemical fire which not only poured tonnes of dangerous emissions into the atmosphere but also did a considerable amount of damage to the flora and fauna along the water catchment. It is critical that we develop policies at the national level to meet these sorts of issues. I welcome the Treasury review of the taxation treatment of the environment-related capital expenditure items by business, as announced in the Budget. Opposition members have displayed a the gross number of double standards in their comments about the 1990 Budget. On Budget night and in the Budget reply we were told by the Opposition that the more Budget was not tough enough and that the cuts to outlays were not deep enough in areas such as social security. In that very same week, and since then, I have witnessed State and Federal Liberal members from my general area in Sydney seeking publicity by stating that the Government should be spending more money on particular programs and initiatives. We have also had the spectacle of one of the Liberal members saying that we were cracking down too severely on social security recipients and trying to scare pensioners needlessly. What sheer humbug and duplicity this represents. Opposition members have totally undermined any credibility they may have had by making such baseless accusations. This Budget has maintained the living of pensioners and they will now be able to get quality financial advice through the Department of Social Security by way of the expanded financial information service-a service which will help to protect pensioners from being conned by the hollow rhetoric of the conservatives. In this Budget the Hawke Government confirmed its record of providing a fair and equitable taxation system-which is in stark contrast with our opponents' past efforts and· current meanderings. This to year's Budget provides tax cuts of $1.25 billion, as promised in the February economic statement. Effectively, this is a tax cut of $7.75 per week for the average The tax cuts we have given have actually made it into the workers' pockets because the tax scales of the past seven years have been fully indexed in order to take account of inflation. What is the Liberals' response to our highly equitable tax reforms? They want a consumption tax without proper compensation arrangements. The. conservatives are blatantly proposing to slug the poor, the needy, pensioners and social curity recipients. They obviously do not care about ordinary Australians; but what is more, they do not even care, about the rural sector. It is hard to conceive of the National Party of Australia engaging in a bigger sell-off of its traditional constituthe ents. There is no doubt that people living in rural areas will be savagely affected by a consumption tax. Our tax system is fair and reputable and this Budget confirms our social justice objectives. We must reject the Liberals' attempts to go back to the Fraser days when the tax avoidance industry was the fastest growing industry in the country. It is now critical that our industry policies be dynamic and comprehensive. As a nation, we must take up the challenge to be more industrious and creative. Clear signs have emerged in areas such as award restructuring that management· and labour appreciate these imperatives. During the seven years of the Labor Government the trade union movement has readily played its part in restoring our international standing. This is not often recognised by our opponents; but in areas such as micro reform of the waterfront, positive reforms have been achieved. The challenge for us as a government is to ensure that industry policy advances are accelerated and broadened. The Budget confirms this initiative. The Budget confirms the internationalisation of our economy. In drawing my remarks on this year's Budget to a close, I note that we enter the last decade of this century with, undoubtedly, major challenges before us. We also enter it with t\1e knowledge that this Budget ensures that the traditional objectives of the Labor Party are being well and truly catered for. Our improvements in matters such as child care, education, the environment, and our comprehensive social justice policies dealing with the aged, the disabled and many other areas of need, clearly fulfil the trust and confidence in us that the people of Australia have demonstrated at successive elections. This Budget balances the fiscal responsibility required in such demanding times with the need for compassion and equity. se- There is no doubt that the combination of initiatives presented in this year's Budget-the reforms that the Government has implemented in the past; the massive restructuring of our tax system, creating a fairer and better society; and very considerable initiatives that have been taken and are continuing to be pursued in areas of micro-economic reform-are gradually ensuring the rebuilding of our nation. Similarly, the efforts we are putting into developing comprehensive policies relating to our Government business enterprises highlight our determination to ensure we develop a stronger national economy. We must ensure that this year's Budget contributes positively to the economic rebuilding of Australia and that our nation, as I said at the outset of my remarks, confronts the present situation so that by the end of the 1990s we have a stronger, more resilient economy. We must be able to go forward in the knowledge that this Budget has contributed greatly to ensuring that the challenges that we face have been well and truly confronted. I commend the Budget to the House.",13
9,Mr MOORE,NOTICE PAPER,"ln spe-k­ ing in the Budget debate this year, I find it remarkable that it is one of those Budgets that came and went without any great notice whatsoever as far as the Government was concerned. The main game had moved on somewhere else. Mr Hand-You were asleep; that was your trouble. .",15
10,Mr MOORE,NOTICE PAPER,"It was the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and his left wing mates who were playing around out there trying to fix up the privatisation policy. So it is no wonder that no-one saw what was going on in the Budget. Even the Treasurer (Mr Keating) appeared to have a yawn as it all went through. However, for the ordinary citizens of Australia there are some very distinct disadvantages in the Budget. Moreover, nothing in the Budget addresses three basic problems .that surround all Australian business. I refer, firstly, to interest rates and the impact that they have on bankruptcies; secondly, to the coming impact that they will have on unemployment in Australia and, thirdly, to the overall rise in inflation in Australia over the past 18 months. Those are the three major impacts flowing from the Budget. I turn first to the level of bankruptcies and I will quote some of the figures on bankruptcies. The official figures on bankruptcy arrangements show a rise of only 10 per cent between 1989-90. However, this year-one year on-there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies for the June quarter in Victoria. The Minister at the table-the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs-ought to take some notice of these figures. The number of bankruptcies in Victoria rose by 43.5 per cent and in Western Australia they rose by 52 per cent. That is some record to have to skite about in terms of the impact of interest rates in Australia. Quite inevitably, as interest rates bite and as bankruptcies occur, one will find that the next development will be unemployment. The bottom line of the credit collapse will be the rise in unemployment. The ANZ Bank figures point to a steep drop in job vacancies but the ultimate lagging indicator is the unmistakable rise in the dole queues. The Department of Social Security figures on the number of recipients of unemployment benefit show that persons paid the dole to the fortnight ended 31 August totalled 450,000-5.3 per cent of the work force-an increase of 20 per cent since the end of December, 1989. That figure, in my view, will hit 8 or 9 per cent by March next year, and there is every indication on the figures before us that that will occur. The underlying problem is debt. There is a record number of bankruptcies, a high rate of inflation, high interest rates, and a balance of payments that is out of control. As a consequence, the balance of payments figure in the Budget was projected for the current year to run to at least another $18 billion. No-one blinked an eyelid, and the corporate debt of Australia continues to mount. It is worth saying this: the underlying problem with the current account deficit is that its biggest contributing component is the net income deficit accounting for $15.8 billion of the current account deficit in 1989-90. It now has a virtually selfsustaining growth rising by more than $2.5 billion a year. Those figures are quite frightening because they indicate that for the next five years at least there will be sustained growth in that area of the invisibles within the balance of payments. Nothing was done to address that problem in the Budget; it was not even mentioned. It was just brushed right over. The balance of payments inevitably affects everybody. While the balance of trade ought to show some improvement in the current financial year, the invisibles and debt component continue to grow and will continue to do so for at least the next five years. Meanwhile, those imperatives are rapidly pushed to one side while the Australian Labor Party attempts to salve itself in the question of privatisation. I recall that in March this year, only a few months ago, the Treasurer said that there would be no privatisation with a Labor government. In the Federal election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, 'There will be no privatisation'. For the last three months we have had a great internal brawl going on. So what is going to happen? Now the Government has decided that there will be a sale of part of Qantas Airways Ltd and maybe all of Australian Airlines Ltd, 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and some quaint arrangement within the communications industry. No one yet understands what is going to come out of that. Mr Hand-That will be right.",15
11,Mr MOORE,NOTICE PAPER,"It will not be too right for the lefties. As a consequence of that, I just want to draw to the attention of the Government four basic things in privatisation.which the Liberals have always stood for: efficiency, consumer benefit, adequate funding and employee shares. Those four criteria must be applied to the privatisation of any company. Reality has finally been conceded by Labor and we will have privatisation. It is now a question of how to manage it and no thought whatsoever has been given to that. The Labor Party has talked a lot about what it will do and will not do, but noone in the Labor Party has talked about how it will be managed because in Australia these corporations are clients of a major government department. The government department, say the Department of Transport and Communications, has a policy role. It is the owner, on behalf of the Government, of certain public trading assets. The Department of Transport and Communications has, I presume, Australian Airlines and Qantas and also OTC Ltd and maybe Telecom Australia. The problem that management faces is the conflict within a government department-for example, for Austel in relation to communications-between its policy role and its responsibility for managing those corporations within certain guidelines. That form of conflict of interest will inevitably lead to difficulties in the privatisation process. As a consequence of that I advocate that the Government-certainly the Opposition-give thought to the creation of a department of public assets and that the assets in these serving departments be transferred to this new department, away from the policy-making decisions, so that the conflicts are eliminated and so that the Trojan Horse of the Public Service which stops progress is removed and so that the corporations that are going to be subject to privatisation and corporation in some parts will have a fair go to get on with their task, free of the other pursuits and restraints of their sponsoring department. If that role is not taken, the corporations themselves will be bogged down within their sponsoring department without the opportunity to prepare themselves for their new life outside the Public Service. That is something which will take time because all the basic ethics within that corporation are Public Service oriented. Once they are privatised they are outside that mould and the change that will take place must be worked out away from the sponsoring department. There are plenty of examples of this in other countries. The French are probably the best at it. The British have had examples where their sponsoring departments have not been up to speed with the changes required and they have had to bring in another department. That in itself is interesting except that it inevitably ends with a learning process in each department so the speed with which one can move is completely harnessed to the slowest department's operation. On top of that there should be some thought and argument as to how and why these corporations will be funded. I have never doubted that the funds are in Australia for the privatisation process but they are only there for a truly competitive and commercial entity. No-one will want, say, a 50 per cent interest in a corporation which the Government still keeps its thumb on or a 30 per cent interest in a corporation which the Government still wants to use to meet its social objectives. That is not a smart investment. So in its quaint way of privatisation-not the full way but a half or quarter way-the Government will have to think of some way of doing a deal. The Government is very good at this. It loves deals. That is one thing the Government is good at. The Government will think of some way to do a deal to get the superannuation funds in. The Government has given 3 per cent; now it is talking about 6 per cent. I guess the deal will be one of those standover ones that the Australian Labor Party is so very good at. If the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the left wing mates of the Minister at the table stand over him so that he does what they want him to do, why should the Treasurer not do so? Mr Hand-You were better on the front bench.",16
12,Mr MOORE,NOTICE PAPER,"I agree with that. The Minister will have to cook up some special deal or benefit to get the corporations to take up these odd investments-or is he going to call upon the institutions of Australia to shoulder their share of microeconomic reform by taking up investments which they might not normally take up? The public investment sector of Australia is in very poor health. It has been run down and is subject to scandal and lack of interest from the current Government in relation to the running of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). One has only to run through some of the gigantic collapses that have occurred in Australia in the last two years to see what a disgrace corporate Australia has made of itself. Leonardo da Vinci had a wonderful saying: He who will be rich in a day will be hanged in a year. I will go through the list of collapses. Bruce. Judge was the person who did $100m in Ariadne Australia Ltd. Skase and his Qintex Ltd group probably went down to the tune of $1.5 billion. George Herscu probably went down to the tune of $1.5 billion. I do not have the figure for Russell Goward and the Westmex group. There was Mr Connell and Rothwells Ltd; I do not know the figure but it is certainly well known to the Western Australian Government. But I want to come back to Rothwells later because I have a few observations. Mr Ansett is no longer driving your dollar further at Budget. Mr Bond is having some difficulties balancing his books. Affairs at Elders are not all that they inight be. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd is $9.5 billion in debt. The affairs of the State Bank of Victoria are well known. There is the Pyramid Building Society. The affairs of Greater Pacific Investments and its Managing Director, Mr Brian Yuill, and of the Spedley group are well known. On top of that there have been some lesser publicised events which people ought to consider relating to the insurance companies of Australia, one of which, Capita, had to. be rescued because of its commitments to the capital guaranteed funds and to its propensity to buy market share without any real regard for its policy holders. As a consequence of that we saw the need for one of our major companies to seek an alliance with a bank to help its capital funding because of those particular actions. All of this has brought the Australian corporate world into some disrepute. While this is all going on what is the Government doing? It has spent three years attempting to bring in a Commonwealth corporate scheme. The former Attorney-General said that there should be no more reforms to company law but that we must have corporate law for Australia, one law. We had it anyway but the present Government would not fund it. It is no good the Minister shaking his head because in 1984 the Government spent $2.7m on the scheme and in 1991 it will spend $3.3m; That is the Federal Government's contribution to the NCSC. Yet the Government criticises the NCSC for the billions that were sent off through straight corporate rorts. Does the Government know that its contribution to the NCSC was less than it put into the Canberra bus service and less than it put into the research unit in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory? That is the Government's order of priorities, and it is talking about running a privatisation program when as far as it is concerned running corporate regulation is almost unheard of. Still, Lionel Bowen had to have his monuments. We rushed through a series of amendments which really did nothing for company law but which ended up being passed by this House. The States ultimately put a test to the High Court of Australia. The High Court threw it out, but the Governmentwent on with it. We now have an NCSC and an Australian Securities Commission as well, running in parallel, because the Government could not achieve its objectives. In today's paper the Chairman of the NCSC, Mr Hartnell, is talking about a new bunch of reforms. They are the ones that were pushed for three years ago. Government members would not touch them because there must be a corporate takeover from the start and because there was a lot of murk over there in the west with all their mates. As a consequence of that we did not touch those crucial maters and we failed to answer any of the real questions. As time is getting on I wish to quote Henry Bosch, who recently stood down as the head of the NCSC. He is a person who had to take on this rather difficult task with limited money, limited access and no help, and indeed a lot of mud slinging from the Attorney-General at the time plus a number of prominent corporate people who ought to have known better. Far be it from me to say they might have been on the receiving end of some bad decisions which prompted their actions. Mr Bosch recently pinpointed some of the practices which' have weakened our commercial standing: firstly, company directors personally enriching themselves with high salaries and bonuses; secondly, improper and misleading accounts; thirdly, divestment of large amounts of money from companies to other companies with which the same directors were associated, which is very prevalent; fourthly, chasing of assets at highly inflated prices. I add to this list my own list, including abuse of takeovers, which, although they have a proper place in a well functioning private sector, were used as an ill-disguised means of asset stripping. Sixthly, a fall in the prudential ards of our financial institutions along with the increasing use of negative pledges by banks led to many billions being lost. That showed up, in my view, the gross mismanagement undertaken by some of the banks. Seventhly, management buyouts motivated by a superior knowledge of the company's operations have become a tolerated form, in ""my view, of insider trading. I do not have to be too precise in indicating that I think that when the senior executives of a corporation band together to assail that former proprietary company, that is totally improper in every respect. Eighthly, there is the practice of directors being associated with management companies that get huge fees for advising the company. I refer to the Skase example, which is completely outrageous. All of those things became prevalent and yet nothing was done about them. As my time is running. out I address my last few moments to Rothwells Ltd.",17
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICE PAPER," I am loath to interrupt the honourable member but he would be aware that parts of this matter are sub judice. The honourable member is aware of the practice of dealing with sub judice. I ask the honourable member-he has been in this place. long enough to know-to be extremely careful, otherwise I will have to stop him if he infringes the sub judice rules.",19
14,Mr MOORE,NOTICE PAPER,"'-I refer to questions I asked in this place of the former Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, in which he denied that he had the power to conduct a national inquiry into Rothwells. Subsection 291 (2) of the Act, headed 'National Interest', states: Where it appears to the Commonwealth Minister thilt it is in the national interest that an investigation be carried out into the affairs, or into particular affairs, of a company, the Commonwealth Minister may, by instrument in writing, direct the Commission to arrange for an investigation into the affairs, or into those particular the pur- affairs, of that company. Quite clearly, the answers given to my question in the House were not correct. A more fascinating one that I noticed when I went back-I was not looking for it intentionally-was an answer given to the honourable member for Wentworth stand- (Dr Hewson) by the Treasurer. The honourable member for Wentworth asked: I refer the Treasurer to the recent failure of the merchant bank Rothwells Ltd. I ask the Treasurer: Did Rothwells Ltd comply with its obligations pursuant to section 11 of the Financial Corporatio-s Act . . .? The Treasurer replied: As far as I can recall, the Reserve Bank kept an eye on Rothwells at the time of its immediate problems post-October 1987, as it did with other corporations. At the time. I know the Bank was speaking to parties associated with Rothwells; it told me that. That clearly indicates that the then Attorney-General said that he did not have the power and did not know anything about it, while the Treasurer said he had been informed by the Reserve Bank of certain specific things after the crash of 1987.",19

16,Mr SNOW,NOTICE PAPER,"1 guess that the people in the public gallery and the you-g people in the upper gallery must sometImes wonder why there are not that many people in the House when we discuss important budgetary measures such as this. I can assure them that there are people all over the Parliament in comthe mittee roo-s - el?resenti!lg the parties, - ome - ases m JOll-t parhamentary inquirIes .whICh are - ookmg closely WhICh comes mto the House, particularly at this time. . This does not in any way diminish Importance of a Budget which comes at a time' when Australia is receiving many - illions o- dollar- less from exports. IS s01l1ethmg which is easy to overlook. We must add to that the fact that far less is a,:ailable to government to spend, porttOnally, and far less is available people to spend. In the end, IS a dramatic drop in exports it hurts us all. Added to that is the inevitable carelessness which came to us. over many years when exports were high and poor ·managetra!lsport ment practices developed, when managefreIght ment was careless about higher costs and - arelessabout inefficiencies that had crept mto the productive sector, and we had to institute a range of measures-measures such as enormous changes in the way welway fare is administered, To this emi, next year we will see the unemployment benedents fit concept, the dole concept, removed. The dole as such will be no longer availof able. We will see people being exposed more t<;> the cons-quences of their actions. PenStOners, for mstance, might receive an item wo-th. anything up to $1.,700 for one prescnptIon. They are paymg for that item at least for some of the year. They pay $2.50 for all their. items and they - re able we to at least apprecIate that the medication they are receiving costs money and some of the problems which have come into the pharma:ceutical benefits scheme will eliminated. At the same time the Government is working out its priorities. I want briefly refer to a couple of those priorities one in relation to the rail initiative and one in relation to the timber industry. Firstly, the rail initiative that has been taken by the Federal Government, in cooperation with the State governments, seeks to. move towards a single national management for rail. It is extremely importantthat as we do that we balance out need for the present rail. infrastructure into be up-graded dramatically with the need for us to reduce the high usage on roads at legislation at the moment.. If we look at the north-south sector of rail de-ivery between Melbourne, Sydney and Bnsbane and compare it with the rail the delivery between Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, we see that there is quite a difference in the amount of freight which is This transported by rail. From east to west from Melbourne or Sydney to Perth 60 per cent of the freight is transported by prorail. Between Melbourne,' Sydney and to Brisbane, 21 per cent in some areas is when there transported by rail. Following the decision in the 1950s to deregulate interstate road transport, rail dropped dramatically as far as and,' later on, passengers were concerned. What the Federal Government and its instrumentalities are trying to do is to look not only at the cost of increased road works, but also the external cost of the we have developed our transport system-the cost of fuel, the cost of acciand the social costs, all of which are mounting costs in Australia's delivery road services. While the Federal Gov. ernment is spending $1.6 billion on roads in the current year, it needs to look at how it can reduce some of those costs. The Government working group on land !r-nsport, of which I am convener, is visItIng some very important terminals in Australia. So far we have looked at those in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney and win shortly visit Brisbane and Perth to look at the rail systems, how they are operating and how we will be able to get be - way from the present enormous expendItures on roads. If we do not do some.,. thing about north-south delivery along the eastern sector, we will have to construct perhaps two new lanes on the Hume Highway. Yet at a cost of about $250m we can upgrade the rail link between Albury and Junee and provide a reasonably fast freight service. It is important that we look at the external costs when we decide which way to go. If we upgrade the rail' link between Melbourne and Adelaide by standardising the gauge at a cost of some $200m, we will dramatically reduce potential ,costs along the western highway. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a former train driver and one who was heavily involved in the rail industry before you came into the Parliament, you are well and truly familiar with the advantages of rail. What we have done in recent months is look not only at freight but also at urban ices throughout Australia. We are finding some very real problems. We are finding good signalling and communication systems within rail, but we are also finding some very bad ones. We have seen signalling systems housed in a structure which has a dirt floor, with wires all over the place, and where there is even a danger of rat infestation ruining a rail communications system, simply because it is not being looked after properly. It is not due to any lack of interest by the State governments, but simply because they - re not prepared continually to fund growing deficits in the rail system. What we have to do is try to get the whole rail system out of the rut that it is in. We are finding different approaches in the States. Some are more interested in full container loads, in establishing that very important link between ports and rail delivery, and competing with road so that goods can be transferred from boat to rail straight away to ensure a good intercity and intrastate delivery service from rail. There is low morale in some of the rail systems. I believe that this will be overcome if we take the approach being looked at now by the Commonwealth, which is to establish a national freight corporation. Some of the States are showing interest in this approach. If they are prepared to show interest and if they are prepared to cooperate, then we will have a national freight corporation and thus a national approach. We need to make sure that we minimise expenditure on roads by diversion to rail. While we are looking at roads, we need to make sure that people appreciate the cost of their operation. That is why the Government lS looking at mass distance charges on roads. I know that there are some people, including some farmers, who are worried about the effect of this on their businesses. I believe that it will not have a significant· effect. Mass distance charges will make the big operators pay for their road usage. This does not get away from the fact that the effect on people in some of the more remote areas has been raised with me by the honourable member for the serv- Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable 'member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls). If one looks at those seats, together with the electorate of Eden-Monaro, one sees that people living in a substantial proportion of Australia's land mass are now' represented by Labor members, who are making their presence very well felt, both in the matter of rail and in the matter of road delivery. The honourable member for Grey, who is in the House at the moment, has made very clear to us the importance of Australian National, now that it has been restructured, and is looking for an increase and improvement in the facilities in South Australia. The honourable member for Grey, the honourable member' for Kalgoorlie, the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Kennedy have all made it very clear to the land transport working g(OUP, of which I am convener, that we m.ust take into full account the difficulties of people in remote areas who have long distances to travel and 4igh cdsts in the delivery of services. In the next three or four months we will visit some of these areas, look at the important services and how we can make sure that we realise the obligations we have to regional Australia. I believe that we will substantially improve not only efficiency but also the cost benefits to governments and to the different rail systems if we have a single national management of freight. After that we must think about the need to improve urban services and local regional services-not just interstate services--':and we need to think about passenger rail. In your own State of Victoria, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has told me of improvements of 30 per cent in passenger rail uSage in some areas. It is important that we look at that and perhaps try to develop a national approach. As we look at the way in which we spend our Budget allocations and the way in which we look at improving efficiencies, we certainly need to look at the very ad hoc way that we have developed our land transport system and at our not particularly well coordinated approach. Transport operators are going on strike and. many people are going broke because there is not a national approach. That is why the rail system was in the doldrums. As we travel around the country it is great to sense an air· of optimism in the different rail systems. People in the systems are prepared to work together. Governments of different political complexions are now getting together with the Minister for Land Transport· (Mr Robert Brown), who meets frequently with State Ministers to try to have a coordinated approach to land transport. I also want to mention the timber industry. Outside the House today there are a number of people from the timber industry from all over New South Wales and Victoria who have come together to this Parliament to make their very important point about the need for a decision. Five years ago inquiries and studies on the future .of the timber industry in eastern New South Wales began. We had an environmental impact statement. The Australian Heritage Commission looked at establishing National Estate areas; We had a recommendation from Minister Richardson to the then Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, that there should be IS-year licences for the woodchip export industry, subject to a number of conditions and subject to agreements with the New South Wales Government. Then, it was suggested by Senator Richardson that we should have a joint scientific study, which seemed to me to be quite reasonable. That study's aim was to bring together a range of reports that had accumulated over many years. So, it was suggested by Senator Richardson, the then Minister for the Environment, that we should have a look at the biological values in the forests. In a very competent way, that study brought together a whole range of studies that had been performed in the forests. It did not necessarily do a lot of new work, but it certainly brought everything together. It was felt by the industry-justifiably, in my view-that this should be it; that through this study we should be able to clearly establish whether or not we should have reserves and where those reserves should be, so that the industry could once more get up and going. All that time Senator Richardson and the Heritage Commission were able to have their input. But now that we have had that report from the joint scientific study, the two envin;mment Ministers, New South Wales and Federal, are getting together and saying, 'No, we want to have a look at bio-physical naturalness and wilderness values.' So, a hasty report was got together which really did· not contribute very much, because it was not scientifically based. That really has delayed the decision even further. We now have a situation where families, wage and salary earners, businesses, small businesses in towns, have been trying to work out just where they stand. At the moment there is more than $100m worth of equipment surrounding this place, with people making a point that they have huge investments in an industry southand they are not being told where they stand. We must have a decision. We need to have a decision this week. We need to be told that there is an in-principle decision by the Cabinet of this Government that there will be reserves in certain areas and that the joint scientific study is accepted. We need to know where the compartmentsare which can be logged and we need to have them logged. After 51f2 years of study we do not need to go into finer detail. ' The timber industry cannot continue to lose out. If it does continue to lose out, then we will find that other resource industries will lose 'out. I believe that this Government is being tested this week. The New South Wales Government is being tested about its ability to come to agreement and come to a decision which will give us a viable industry with a renewable resource. There are other resources in Australia about which we need to make decisions. After all, we have a huge deficit, a $1.8 billion deficit. With the injection of $7 billion worth of investment into this timber industry, into paper mills, the development of plantations, the development of recovery mills, so' that we can use our wood in better ways, .so that we can make sure that the timber that we are using is used more productively, we will be in a position where we can help to turn around that deficit. With all the paper we are importing, we could well and truly use timber, which is a substantial part of that deficit, to turn around our budget deficit. Timber is a renewable resource. By using our timber resources we can show that Australia can produce, and can maintain production, even at a time when the wool industry and the wheat industry are threatened. We need to have that assurance. I welcome the support that has been given to me by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). I took Martin Ferguson, the president of the ACTU, into Eden-Monaro some four or five months ago. He came into the electorate with me, visited sawmills and had a look at the timber industry. He is giving the same sort of leadership that Simon Crean gave, that Bill Kelty and Bob Richardson are giving, to seek from the Government support for a strong timber industry and for jobs within a timber industry. Therefore, we need. an in-principle decision now. We need a long term plan by the end of the year, and we need to see that the Government has the inner fortitude to realise that our resources have to be used in an environmentally sensitive way if Australia is not to go backwards economically. That is a very important decision that is to be made by the Government this week. I urge the Government to make that decision decisively and tell the industry the truth-that it can log in an environmentally sensitive way; one which will protect water catchments and which will ensure that we have not only a. viable industry, but also an industry which is environmentally sensitive.",20
17,Mr CARLTON,NOTICE PAPER,"Mackellar) (11.16)Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate on the Appropriation Bill gives honourable members an opportunity to examine the overall performance of the Government after sev,en years in office. I suppose that the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), in his heartfelt cry for some decision-making on the part of the Government in a very sensitive and important area, is an example of the kinds of problems that Australia is facing in looking at a very difficult economic situation. Members of the Opposition certainly feel for the honourable member in his current difficulties. One has to say that the overall performance of the Government after 71f2 years is quite awful. The world has had 71/2 good years. In Australia we have, had 71/2 years without drought. But for a commodity price downturn in 1985-86, this Government has had a dream run, an absolute dream run-world prosperity, no internal droughts, no reasons or excuses whatsoever for a bad performance. So why do we have a net overseas debt of $125 billion, representing $23,000 for every household in Australia, or $7,000 for every man, woman and child, when in 1983, we had practically none? Why do we suffer from an inflation rate double that of developed countries overseas, an inflation rate that robs us of our savings and destroys the incentive for people to save and invest? Why do we have interest rates amongst the highest in the world, crippling families struggling to pay off their homes and destroying businesses large and small? Small business has been killed in this country, but now we are seeing wide-scale crashing of large bu.sinesses. That has a . lot to do with the level of interest rates, which have been sustained at a much higher level for longer than any of us can remember. Why have Australian workers suffered cuts in their real wage levels, regardless of how well or productively they work and without any obvious pay-off in the foreseeable future? Why has the accord delivered this miserable set of wage outcomes for the Australian work force? Why do we have a Labor Government that has presided over falls in real wages, a Labor Government that has expressed pride in a fall in real wages for Australian workers? . Why have small investors lost their ings in financial institutions that were supposed to be supervised by Labor governments? Why are people in the unlisted property trusts worried about their investments, where the responsibility was clearly with the Federal Government to protect those investments? Why are the people who invested in the Pyramid Building Society worried about their savings? Indeed, they are losing them. Their investments were supposed to be protected by a State Labor Government under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank, an arrangement which was agreed to some years ago between the two governments. Why is this the case? Is it true in as it was in the 1930s and going back over many years, that we cannot trust Labor with our money? Is it still the overwhelming truth in Australia's history that we cannot trust the Labor Party with our money? Why has Australia lost its long held AAA credit rating and become a second class risk in international finance? Why is it that Australian borrowing authorities have to pay higher interest rates than the rest of the world when for years and years under coalition governments we always had a AAA rating and we always had very good credit around the world? Why is this so? Why has Australia's international business reputation fallen so low during this Government's period of office? Is this an accident? Why, after 71/2 years of unprecedented world growth and prosperity, must Australians face not only declining living standards but also this year rising unemployment? This Government came into office during a world recession, which had come to Australia with a local recession, and after the worse drought of this century. The Government that we were involved in, the coalition Government, had to deal with the drought and the depression, the recession. We went into those difficulties without any great level of borrowings overseas. We went in with a very tight ship. When these scourges were removed, when the rains came in 1983, when the world lifted into this 71f2 years of boom that it has had since then, the Labor Party, taking over the government, had a wonsav- derful opportunity to rebuild out of that recession and, of course, it made wonderful claims about the growth of employment that occurred after that. It artificially boosted the increases in employment by very generous Budgets, very generous spending of taxpayers' money. I might say, when we are looking back over all this, that if a country is going into external difficulties, into drought and external recession, it needs to be tight as it goes in. The ship has to be batte,l1ed down, and the Fraser Government took the country into those difficulties in such a state. The Government that took over inherited all the goodies-the benefits of 1990, a wage freeze, the benefits of the rains coming, the benefits of world prosperity-and after 71f2 years we see that all these benefits have been frittered away and the unemployment against which the Labor Party raged so effectively in 1983 is now coming back. What exactly do we have to show for it? What do we have to show for all the pain? What do the workers of Australia have to show for having taken cuts in their real wages over these years? , The facts are now all there and they cannot be obscured any longer by trying to shift the blame elsewhere. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) cannot blame 30 years of conservative government, within which he includes three years of the Whitlam Government, quite conveniently. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have both been in office for 7lf2 years. They bear the full responsibility the Government's performance. There are clear reasons for our present difficulties. Let us go through them. The economic commentators are unanimous in looking at these reasons. The first reason is the first two Keating Budgets. There has been enormous criticism of the 1982 Fraser Budget, the decisions on which were taken in the midst of a recession and when there was concern about whether the econoiny needed some boost. There is argument about whether those decisions were correct or not in the middle of that crisis. There can be no argument about whether or not the Keating decisions of 1983 and 1984 were correct as things were improving. Was it sensible to raise public expenditures in those two years almost to Whitlam levels as the economy was rising? Was that sensible? In retrospect, we see that that was the kick-start to Australia's overexpansion, overborrowing, living on borrowed funds and borrowed time. That is where it began. The second major problem has been poor control of the money supply, which has been influenced by short term political considerations. The enormous difficulties that have been faced over the last 18 months or so arise from admitted miscalculations over control of the money supply-loosening things up too quickly, allowing things to run free, overheating the economy and running into terrible financial difficulties later on-and decisions taken according to short term political considerations and not in the nation's interests. The third major reason for the difficulties is that this Government has failed-to reform the labour market. Up until a few years ago everybody tended to believe that the centralised wage fixation system set up in the first decade of this century was the right way to go. Pretty well everybody believed that during the period of the Fraser Government. The Fraser policy in 1975 was to try to bring the centralised wage fixation syste- back on the rails. That policy was supported by practically everybody except the then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, for Mr Hawke. He had run riot during the Whitlam Government years as head of the trade union movement, causing the biggest level of strikes in the whole of our history and the biggest single-year wage increases we had ever seen back in 1974. Everybody but Hawke agreed then that we should try to make that centralised system work. It became clear subsequently, and certainly by 1982-83, that that system was no longer functioning, and since 1985 the Opposition has had a very clear plan to change fundamentally the system that our predecessors in the Deakin Government set up in the first decade of this century. No longer can we rely on a medieval system of saying what each vassal shall earn, regardless of his worth, his productivity, his effort, his cleverness in the workplace. It is essential that we get back to enterprise contracts, enterprise agreements, so that each individual enterprise has the freedom to work out how it can work more productively and get more pay and more profits as a result. Because of the Government's control by the ACTU, by the trade union movement, it has resisted this essential reform. I give the Treasurer credit for following on from the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, initiated by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I give the Treasurer the credit for deregulating financial markets, but that could never work without proceeding with deregulation of labour and product markets. Those of us who supported the deregulation of financial markets long before Mr Keating was converted to that saw it as a trigger for the deregulation of these other markets and the freeing up of the economy generally. The Labor Party has never agreed with the deregulation of labour markets, with true enterprise bargaining and agreements, and until that is installed in Australia we will not be productive in international terms. The present system of window-dressing productivity bargaining in each workplace-the so-called structural efficiency principle-is falling down. It is simply too bureaucratic. It simply will not work. words of 1985: We have to get back to the individual I didn't. workplaces and allow people to get· with the job of doing what they see is best. The best that the Government can II was do in this current session by way of labour market so-called reform is this pathetic Bill currently before the House to say that the minimum size of a union should be sition policy. 20,000. It is not addressing the number of unions in each workplace, as pointed out by the Business Council study. Everynow, body knows that the 20,000 limit. has nothing to do with reducing the number of unions in the workplace to a workable number. Everybody knows that it is due to the internal politics of the ACTU. Bill is a pathetic Bill and we will oppose it. Labour market reform is absolutely critical to Australian success. The sition has had a clear policy on this since 1985 and the Government steadfastly revate fuses to move in that direction. The fourth major problem is a failure to pursue micro-economic reform; that is, making things more efficient through competition. competition. On the issue of coastal shipping and ports, the Government sits down with the people responsible for the probthe lems and asks them to sort themselves out: would they please give up their ileges in order to proceed at a snail's increasingly behind the rest of the world. losing In telecommunications, we are going through this painful process that the Govhas ernment is going through at the moment, still under the thumb of the ACTU. Union power still ruling, the Government has competition. made a decision against the clear advice of its own key economic advisers-the Industry Commission, the Treasury, the Department of Finance and the Departit ment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Its decision is against the advice of those key economic departments and ineliminate strumentalities. I mention the failure to reform the direct tax system as the fifth example where the Treasurer made it quite clear in 1985 that this simply had to be done, and when he was rolled in the Taxation Summit he denied that he had backed down on a consumption tax. I quote his on That is, 'I did not back down'. beaten. I wouldn't back down on something believe in and I never will. He has, and he is now opposing this· essential reform which is part of the OppoThe sixth reason is the failure to privatise and promote competition. Even with the way the Government has been dragged screaming into some changes in the airlines and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, it is still not privatising and selling any more than 49 per cent, This even if that is agreed to by the Labor Party Conference. Those instrumentalities are still going to Qe run by the GovernOppoment. The Government will not get the competitive benefits or the benefits of prisector management. So its privatisation proposals are still wiridow-dressing and do not get to the heart of the matter, unlike the Opposition policies which are clearly to privatise within a framework of The seventh reason· why the policies of Government are so bad is their failure to enforce prudential supervision and corprivporate standards in Australia. I menpace, tioned earlier the problems of people their savings under Labor governments· and also referred to the terrible reputation now that Australian business overseas as a result of the failure of the Government to regulate business activity satisfactorily and provide fair This Government attacked us on tax rorts. When it was in opposition and when came into government, it attacked us because of tax rorts. Our Government acall knowledged tax rorts, and the record shows that all the major legislation to tax rorts was brought in by us before the present Gbvernmentcame into inoffice. The Government has raged on and criticised us-we who introduced all the legislation which forms the basis of stopping those rorts-up hill and down dale as being friends of the tax cheats. The Government now stands accused of having had 7112 years of all sorts of outstandingly poor corporate behaviour due to its failure to have adequate supervision of commercial law in this country. Mr Costello-Complete disinterest.",23
18,Mr CARLTON,NOTICE PAPER,"Absolute disinterest in the matter, as my colleague the honourable member for Higgins says. All these rorts, engaged in by all the people with whom the Prime Minister was seen smoking' cigars some years ago, occurred under Labor governments. The money lost in institutions, corporate losses, the loss of investors' funds and small investors beggared by what has gone on has all happened under a Labor government. The Government is responsible. How dare the Government criticise us about the tax rorts when it was us who stopped those rorts with our legislation. It was not the Opposition which .has been responsible over the last 7If2 years for poor regulatory control of commercial respectability. The Government is responsible for failing to enforce the laws. Finally, there is a failure of leadership and collective responsibility. There has been no coherent pattern of decision making. We have had populism at its worse. We have had the blow-out in the money supply for political purposes; the Coronation Hill decision with Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd whereby the Government reversed previous undertakings; the loss of the Wesley Vale pulp mill; the problems with the forests that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the people outside the Parliament at this very moment are concerned about; the change in Government policy with the ANZ-National Mutual merger; arbitrary principles of foreign· ownership of television stations imposed overnight; and ministerial disputes, one after another, in public. We have had Richardson versus Kerin and Cook, and now Kelly versus Griffiths, on environmental matters; Keating versus Beazley as regards the leaking of Cabinet documents in the Australian Financial Review; the Prime Minister disciplining Ministers Duffy, Richardson and Kelly; Button versus Keating on economic policy; Richardson and Howe versus Keating on infrastructure; .Richardson versus Howe and Staples on pensioner pharmaceuticals; and, more recently, Senator Gareth Evans criticising the Government's foreign aid decisions. These are failures of leadership and collective responsibility. The problems were there before the last election. They were deep-seated problems, and the Government failed to give the lead. The Labor Party is now facing almost insoluble problems and is showing all the disunity and dissension that comes from those problems. The sooner the Government gets out of office and hands over to people who know where we need to, go and have the clear-cut policies, the better it will be for Australia.",27
19,Mr ONEIL,NOTICE PAPER,"The desire for young people living in communities striving to obtain higher education qualifications is a major challenge for many families residing in isolated towns and cities in my electorate of Grey in South Australia. The future of Australia relies on young people with the necessary skills entering our work force. Australia' must be able to compete with overseas countries in .the world labour market. Our country's future depends on it. It is extremely pleasing that the national retention rate to year 12 has risen dramatically in recent years. This marked rise in the retention rate shows clearly that many young people do have the desire to become high achievers. In my electorate, limited degree and course structures are available at the various colleges of technical and further education and also at the Whyalla campus of the South Australian Institute of Technology. However, many young people, in their quest to obtain higher education, are being forced to leave their home towns to reside in the metropolitan area of Adelaide. Many local families are finding it necessary to establish a second home in Adelaide to enable their children to continue their studies at tertiary levels. Many more are finding it necessary to move the family to the metropolitan area, as the added financial burden caused by the setting up of an additional home is all too often one which the average family cannot afford. . I am aware of many instances where the family unit at home goes without many essential items to finance the student living away from home. All too often, the sacrifice becomes too much for the family to maintain, and many bright young people who are capable of succeeding .and gaining high achievements academically are unable to continue with their studies. The fact that this is occurring means that we have failed our youth in making higher education readily accessible and available to people from all walks of life. After many years of working to assist average families to obtain the bes- - ut1,l-e for their children, my personal OpI1l10n IS that the away rate Austudy allowance does not adequately cover the basic needs of the student. The payment does not make allowance for the maintaining of a suitable home environment in which to study and does not allow for other essenti.as such as clothing. Rental accommodation in any metropolitan area is costly for even the most basic single room unit. Add to this the cost of utilities, and the student's income is greatly reduced. The current top rate for students aged 18 years and over at the away and independent rate is $124.75 and reduces on a pro rata basis according to their parents' taxable income. If we as a government are truly serious about giving our young people an incentive to continue in their studies, the living away frof!1 home allowance must be at a level which covers the costs that the student will face in anyone study year. Many young people not abl- t- receh:e any assistance opt out of contmumg t-eIr education to join the large queue of Job seekers. Therefore, of greater concern to me is the fact that no consideration is given to those families who are not able to receive any assistance under the Austudy scheme to enab-e their childr-n. to continue their educatIOn due to theIrmcome level being too high. Families with a child or children attending an education institution away from home should be able to claim under the Australian taxation system that part of the cost of keeping· a· second home. The setting up of a zone allowance for a family which has a child or children attending an education institution more than a specified diStance away from t-eir home is one way of easing the financIal burden on a family. All young people must be given the· opportunity to obtain higher education if they so choose, and should not be restricted in their endeavours by strain on the family budget. I am sure that honourable members of· the House who represent country electorates· will understand the situation I have described and believe as firmly as I do that no young persons or their families s-ould be disadvantaged simply because theIr h?mes are in the country and the educatIonal facilities are in the city. I believe all honourable members will give their support in this matter. I hope that the- do, espeCially those who represent regIOnal and country areas. One of the decisions handed down in the August Budget that I believe will put unnecessary strain on rural families is the assets test placed on family allowance payments. Far be it from me to advocate a case for the haves. However, I believe that for many farmers on the Eyre Peninsula who are already facing hard times the decision to place an assets test on family· allowance payments is another burden for them to bear and can only hurt the children whom we as a government are purporting to lift out of poverty. A threshold of $300,000 may at face value appear generous to most, and many farmers on the Eyre Peninsula will have assets above that limit. However, such assets as they do have are not readily disposable and are essential to keep their farms viable. In recent times farmers on the Eyre Peninsula have been subject to many harsh climatic conditions and other economic factors have reduced their disposable income considerably. The Middle East crisis has served to further heighten their difficulties and add to their financial burden. The properties on the Eyre Peninsula are not marketable for resale; neith-r are the other assets that are to be taken into consideration under the assets test. The family allowance is an allowance paid by the Commonwealth for the Australian child. The assets test must take into consideration, whether or not a person's assets are readily disposable. A ness owner in most cases can dispose of his business assets readily. The same cannot be said of farmers, as their businesses are their way of life and often are situated in non-commercially viable isolated areas. How can we expect farmers to be able to call on such assets at' will when those assets are necessary for their very 'survival? I put it to the House that those farmers are not able to cash in their assets to and clothe their children. So, who misses out? Not honourable members here assembled, but the children of these hard working Australian families. I suggest that this decision is contrary to the social tice policy which aims to assist those in need. The legislation that is put in place in the Budget has not been given careful consideration. I agree that rich farmers should be subject to the assets test The large business owner also should be subject to the assets test. I do not dispute those matters. However, the hard working average farm families in my electorate of Grey are now placed in a catch 22 situation. They have no cash flow; their assets are not yet realisable. Their family payments nevertheless will be stopped, regardless. Programs to assist young people to enter the work force play an important part in country areas. Job opportunities are limited, with many young people competing for a single job opening. The Spencer Gulf group regional training scheme is designed to assist young people to gain trade qualifications. The success of that scheme within my electorate is without question. That success rate, is extremely encouraging to all involved in the operation of the scheme, which has provided necessary support to small employers and recruits, apprentices or trainees of a high standard in a variety of trades. The scheme is an excellent means of sharing the cost of apprentices and trainees between a number of employers. The group training scheme has found an effective way for small businesses to utilise apprentices to whom' they may not have been able to give an opportunity to train in past years. The scheme also provides embusiployers with additional work force numbers when required-for example, whilst an employee is on annual leave. The development and growth of regional gro-p training schemes is vital in countrY,areas and vital in assisting our youth to obtain a rewarding skilled trade. The majority of Australian men and women generally want to find stable employment. Competition is fierce for any job opening. A concern that has been feed brought to my attention by my country constituents is the plight of the long:term unemployed. Many families who are settled in a country town are threatened' by the possibility of being requirep to leave jus- - heir home towns to seek work. I do not know what has happened to the word decentralisation, but' apparently it is no longer part of today's vocabulary. Though I fully support the Government in its efforts, to reduce the unemployment figures in Australia, J find it disturbing that parents with YOUrtg children may need to uproot themselves and move to city areas to find work. Support must be given to parents if they choose to raise their families in country areas. Many wish to give their children every opportunity to experience life in a country town. Very often they are part of an .extended family circle upon whom they rely for moral support. The support base of the extended family unit is extremely important to us, all in times of need. To be forced to leave that support base to set up home in a strange city is not something that we as a government should be advocating. As a matter of fact, we should be taking a more constructive role in reversing that practice. Living in a country town and having travelled extensively throughout country regions, I appreciate the lifestyle found in a close-knit community and enjoy the pace and, friendship one experiences. More should be done to enable families to remain in country areas, if that is their choice. We must enco-rage professionals to come to country regions. We must encourage industry growth in the country. We must build up country areas by encouraging new business into the regions, thus bringing necessary respite to our already overpopulated city centres and encouraging growth and expansion in the non-metropolitan areas. I am pleased that at my insistence many Commonwealth and State departmental officers are taking the opportunity to travel to various country centres to speak personally to people regarding changes. I am hopeful that the days are gone when most people had the impression that the State finished at the northern boundary exit of Adelaide. I am hoping also that carte blanche decisions made in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne which are supposed to suit all Australians are a thing of the past, and that those who make these important decisions will go to country regional areas and see at the grassroots level how those people operate. A recent visit from taxation agents to the upper Spencer Gulf area in my electorate showed clearly the desire of country people to understand the operations of Government departments and how they affect their situation. However, I believe that more regional based officers should be put into place to humanise the system. A personal face to face interview is always more advantageous in promoting understanding than is an impersonal telephone conversation. Therefore I urge the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to reconsider my submission to have a regional Taxation Office located in the electorate of Grey. A 008 toll free hot line number is in place at the metropolitan Taxation Office. However, my constituents inform me that when using this service they experience long delays. A taxation office servicing the northern regions would assist country dwellers considerably and also would generate job growth. My electorate of Grey covers 86.2 per cent of the northern part of the State of South Australia. There is no regional Taxation Office in any part of the Grey electorate. Each of my electorate offices would receive no fewer than 10 calls a week, six months of the year, from people confused .or in need of assistance regarding their taxation, whether as an individual or with a business concern. That figure does not include the large number of calls placed direct to the Taxation Office by people living in the northern country regions. The upper north of the. State needs a country taxation office to service country and rural communities. Regional areas such as Mount Gambier in the south of the State have their own regional offices. The northern area of the State has no such service at its disposal. Upper northern regions, although smaller and not as densely populated, still need these services. Whether a community comprises 25,000 or 400 people, essential services must be made available to them. Indeed, there is a more urgent requirement for services to be decentralised and located in the northern region because of the geographical difficulties in commuting from this large area of the State. Many people residing in country communities commute to metropolitan or surrounding areas on a regular basis-for example, older people who require specialised health care or school groups on camp excursions. A topic which is at· present concerning many people residing in my electorate is the uncertain future of the Iron Triangle passenger train service. Australian National workers should be commended for the hard work and efficiency that they display in the operation of this train service.· Rumours that the service will be discontinued have distressed many people, including Australian National workers and elderly citizens who use this train on a regular basis because the bus service is inadequate for their needs. They find that the train service is better as they can move around the train to use the toilet facilities and many other things. It is very important to these people that this train service continue. Australian National is seen by many as b-ing uncaring in its attitude regarding the Iron Triangle passenger service. The fact that the subsidy paid to Australian National by the Federal Government could be utilised elsewhere is of little consequence to it. The rail service is seen as a necessity by many, as not all people have their own vehicles at their personal disposal. The closure of the Iron Triangle passenger service would further reduce the choice and convenience of travel and job opportunities in the country. It is distresshalf. ing for Australian National workers and their families to have this uncertain future regarding their employment hanging over their heads. It is therefore vital that the Iron Triangle Service be retained for country commuters. This matter is of paramount importance to me as a Federal member of parliament. I find it unacceptable that ordinary working class families who have lived in country towns around my electorate for a number of years once again will be the losers if this service is not maintained at its present level. I urge all honourable members to support me. In particular, I am sure that my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) would have an interest in the continuation of this train service. I hope he will support me and become more vocal in assisting me in ensuring that this service continues. In summary, as a Labor Party backbencher, my responsibilities are primarily to improve the lot of constituents residing in my electorate. In order to achieve this, I find myself, in many instances, at loggerheads with some decisions taken by Government instrumentalities and statutory authorities. I make no apology for this and I will continue to raise matters that affect the everyday lives of the ordinary working men and women and their families whom I represent. As their elected Federal representative, it is my responsibility to raise matters in the Parliament which affect them and I will not shirk that responsibility. I urge other non-metropolitan members to be more vocal in their representation and support of regional and country areas.",27
20,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER," It has been a long time since I have heard such cant and hypocrisy delivered in such a sanctimonious tone in this chamber. The honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) sought to list a litany of wrongs within his electorate and then sought to dissociate himself from Government actions so that he can go back to the electorate of Grey, make a big man of himself and try to establish himself as an independent fighter on the electorate's beBut if one reads the Hansard record of his speech, one will see that he, in a very cowardly fashion, stopped short of criticising Government Ministers for the actions which have led-as it is quite rightly described-to poverty in the electorate of Grey and regional Australia at large. He, very cutely, said that he stands tough against Government instrumentalities and departments. Why not lay the blame where it rightly belongs-and that is with Government Ministers. Why stop short of really tackling the issues that are destroying rural Australia-a large section of which I represent-instead of tinkering at the edges of issues such as the location of Commonwealth offices? Let us talk about the real issues that this honourable member, in a very mealymouthed fashion, ran away from. The honourable member should not come in here on his knees trying to say that he is a strong fighter for Grey. We have yet to hear any Labor member who represents rural Australia really tackle the hard issues. What are those issues? They are issues concerning the waterfront. What did the honourable member say about the crippling actions of those closed shops on the waterfront that are bringing our export industries into recession and depression? What did the honourable member say about rail and freight? Mr O'Neil- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member has asked me a question. I support what is happening on the waterfront-",31
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICE PAPER,The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.,31
22,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER,"The honourable member says he supports what is happening on the waterfront. I bet he does. This timid, slow crawl towards reform is not bringing about any major reforms that will enhance the performance of our export industries. This is another example of his cowardliness in fitting in with Government policy.",31
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICE PAPER,The honourable member for Gippsland will watch his language. Certain terms are not parliamentary. I would suggest that he not use them.,32
24,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER,"What are the other issues? Did the honourable member for Grey tackle the interest rates issue or the extension of the use of the assets test to deprive country people of both social welfare benefits and education benefits, as occurred in the last Budget? What about manufacturing? Manufacturing is dying in rural areas because of the industrial relations system, the level of taxation and inefficiencies in telecommunications and transport. Who is kidding whom? Here is a Labor member representing rural Australia pretending to have clean hands. What is he doing about the things that are fundamentally destroying rural Australia? Make no mistake: regional and rural Australia are deep in recession - somewhat more so than metropolitan Australia. I do not want to hear these half measures and half-baked ideas about locating a regional office of the Department of Social Security in an electorate and thereby alleviating the problems. It is only by a fundamental re-examination of Government policy that the honourable member is going to represent the interests of his constituents. The last Budget, to which we are addressing our remarks in this debate, failed hopelessly to tackle that fundamental need for economic restructuring. I did not hear anything from the honourable member for Grey about that. The Budget that he has had a part in, as a member of this Government, represents yet another lost opportunity. The Budget contains no vision for Australia in the 1990s. Quite frankly, if one needs any evidence of that, the very flat, uninspiring, even tepid, performance of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the delivery of the Budget, as well as his performance in the media and at Question Time in the days following the delivery of the Budget, show that he has totally failed to convince his jellybacked leader-to use his own terminology-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and his equally timid Cabinet colleagues of the need for change. The telecommunications debate has raged for several months and now, supposedly, has been brought to a conclusion by the Government. But, of course, we have to wait for the special Australian Labor Party Conference on 24 September. Even today we hear that a great many participants in that conference are warning the Government that it will not be a rubber stamp for Cabinet decisions. Again, the Treasurer's loss of influence is utterly confirmed. We have seen, following the Budget, that this Treasurer is not pulling the strings in this Government any more. We are not quite sure who is. Mr Costello-Nobody.",32
25,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER,"Nobody, except - as the honourable member for Higgins would agree-the public sector unions through their principal mouthpiece, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The most powerful unions in this country are dictating policy on both the transport and telecommunications fields to the elected Government. In speaking to the Appropriation Bill, I wish to concentrate my initial remarks on the area of my shad9w portfolio responsibilities, namely, science and technology. The 1990 Budget of the Hawke-Keating Government really was far more illuminating for what it did not do rather than what it did do. The Budget confirms recent events, which have demonstrated the Government's absence of direction in conducting science and technology policy. The science matters that did emerge over the course of the last election were defined in terms of funding issues. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, funding is obviously an important issue but only as a component of the much larger pattern of concerns which ought to constitute science policy. Importantly, I do not think Australia's scientific and technological research effort is characterised by any sense of direction. In this regard it is characteristic of a Government that has no vision and no plan for taking Australia into the 1990s. Mr Costello-Going nowhere.",32
26,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER,"Not entirely going nowhere. Some members of the Government are going plenty of places in Royal Australian Air Force VIP jets. We have seen the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), in his role as a Parliamentary Secretary, chalk up over $100,000 in VIP jetfiights since his appointment. Mr Costello-How many dogs would that buy?",33
27,Mr MCGAURAN,NOTICE PAPER,"The honourable member for Higgins illustrates, by way of interjecting, that some $18,000 was spent over the weekend for the honourable member for the Northern Territory to travel from Townsville. to the Tennant Creek agricultural and pastoral show to present a ribbon and a $3 cheque to the winner of a dog show. The honourable member for the Northern Territory arrived there too late. How do ordinary Australians-not least of all the honest, hard-working people who are lining Parliament House in protest about the uncertainty of their futures-regard this self-indulgent, wrongful, excessive abuse of taxpayers' funds? How are they supposed to feel when they see the hypocrisy of a junior member of the Government call up a VIP jet-the most luxurious, modern jet fiying in Australia-to get him from Townsville to Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory to present a ribbon and a $3 cheque to a dog? It is utterly wrong. Do honourable members wonder why members of Parliament are held in such low regard in the community? The fact is that approval was given for a Government member to travel on a VIP jet at a cost of $18,000 on this occasion and he has accumulated over $100,000 in travelling costs in the past five months-approved by the Government itself. The Government dances around issues. It never tackles fundamentally the wrongs in this country. On top of that, members of the Government have their noses in the trough of taxpayers' funds. is sickening, Madam Deputy Speaker, and no doubt you are aware-as I would think almost every member of the Government is-that the public is outraged by that abuse of privilege by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. However, allow me to return to the matters of science and technology. It has to be said that there is no national science policy. Let us not delude ourselves: funding has not been stabilised. There is no sense of community of purpose amongst the various research agencies. The funding basis for the nation's scientific and technological research effort is on an uncoordinated, institutional basis; fragmentation of research is taken for granted; there is very limited cooperation between the various agencies and institutions; resources are not used to the common end; research programs are not planned with a serious eye to related programs in other areas of research; tensions exist between researchers themselves and those who administer the institution to which they are affiliated; interaction with the private sector is limited and shows no sign of making any meaningful progress; and there is no perspective on the adequacy of the structure of the research community for the next decade. Does all this constitute science policy? In addition to this lack of direction in the marshalling of human resources in the area of science, funding concerns have not been eased to any degree. Those at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) would well appreciate the effect of the Government's indiscriminate application of the dividend efficiency on research across all divisions. The dividend, which in its current form falls upon researchers and their programs, will claw back an estimated $12m from the organisation over the next three years. Therefore, though the CSIRO's funding has increased by 2.5 per cent in real terms, it could be argued that the reduction in its untied funds has reduced its overall budget. In addition to direct funding matters of this type, infrastructure problems still reIt main. Earlier this month, to give an example, the Bureau of Meteorology policy committee bemoaned the fact that the Bureau's equipment has approached near obsolescence. The committee also recommended that efforts be made to establish a national climate program. It says that for all the breast-beating by Government members who have chased the extremist conservation vote, there is still no national climate program in place. Moreover, despite the existence of the science coordination committee there is still little communication between government departments as to the impact of their cost saving programs on the nation's researchers. I will give another example. Last month the situation arose whereby the Royal Australian Navy, in response to a lower than anticipated Budget appropriation, decided to sell off the oceanographic ship, HMAS Cook. Just one-third of the way through its operational life and refitted late last year with the latest in updated seabeam, which is the continuous mapping technology, the Cook is to be mothballed. With it goes the nation's deep sea marine science research effort. Researchers from five universities are affected and no consultation with even the Australian Marine Science Association or the Sydney Institute of Oceanographic Studies took place. The first they knew about it was when the Navy announced, following the delivery of the Budget, that the HMAS Cook would be scrapped. Funding for industrial research has fallen in real terms and appropriations over the next three years will be static. The grants for industry research and development scheme (GIRDS) must fund a new area of generic technology-environmental and waste management technology, as announced during the course of the election campaign by the Prime Minister-but it has received no additional funding. It should be noted that the Budget has done nothing to bring about the economic conditions which are conducive to higher levels of the commercialisation of research. Consider this, Madam Deputy Speaker: in the 1987-88 financial year, Australia devoted 1.2 per cent of its gross domestic product to expenditure on research and development, which is about $3.5 billion. This is well up from the one per cent of GDP in the 1981-82 financial year, but a decrease on the period 198687 when 1.24 per cent of GDP was achieved. Over the period 1981-82 to 1988, there was a steady increase in the funds originating in the business sector from 0.24 per cent of GDP in 1981-82 to 0.45 per cent in 1987-88. In 1987-88 the Government sector's share of research and development as a percentage of GDP was 0.71 per cent. This fell from 0.74 per cent in 1981-82 and from 0.76 per cent in 198485. We rank above Ireland, New Zealand and Spain in regard to research and development as a percentage of GDP, but our 1.2 per cent is half that of the Netherlands, which is 2.4 per cent, and much less than half that of the United States, which H 2.6 per cent, Germany, 2.78 per cent, Sweden 2.76 per cent, Japan 2.87 per cent and Switzerland 2.88 per cent. There is no doubt then that Australia's research and development performance, especially in regard to business enterprise research and development, is appalling. The Government explains this away by contending that the private sector is myopic or lacking any long term view of how best to ensure its interests. It claims that management is deficient in marketing skills and that business leaders follow too conservative investment strategies, but it does not say that the phenomenon of low private sector spending on research and development is directly attributable to the Government's economic policies. Australia's dismal standing in international rankings in research and development performances and its incapacity to capitalise on the intellectual property developed in Australian laboratories is a lamentable commentary on the Government's own economic policies. Generally, the Government's Budget Papers reveal that support for science and innovation has risen by 2.3 per cent in real terms. Yet much of this has gone into areas other than industrial research and technology programs. The venture capital market has shrivelled up completely in recent years, thus denying small start up companies access to seed money. High interest rate policies have also sured that Australian intellectual property is lost to overseas companies. The dream of promoting innovative products within market niches or integrating more advanced processing techniques into the production strategy of Australia's manufacturing sector remairis unrealised. The fundamental factors retarding the commercialisation of research and the reequipment of companies are the excessive cost of money, high inflation and high exchange rates. Risk capital to finance start up companies and underwrite new product developments will remain scarce so long as the main economic indicators channel resources out of research and development. Intellectual property developed in Australian laboratories will continue to flow overseas, as happened with the gene shears, until there is a suitfer able manufacturing capacity and a confident financial sector. The Government's policies therefore have damaged the very scientific and technological research base which it is depending upon to resurrect the economy.",33
28,Mrs CROSIO,NOTICE PAPER,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 199091. I am very pleased that I had the opportunity to be in this House to listen to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). For nearly 10 minutes he vilified the interpretation of the Budget Papers by the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), obviously to cover up the fact that he had not even read his own Budget Papers or maybe to cover up the fact· that yesterday's Canberra Times had his family recorded as giving $120,000 to the National Party of Australia in 1987 under election funds that do not add up. We can understand the problems that he experiences, but nevertheless it is extraorAustralia's dinary that a person on the Opposition front bench should take up 10 minutes of an allocated 20 minutes just to attack a member on the Government benches. Mr MCGauran-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My attack was on Government policies rather than the personal integrity of the member, enbut nonetheless he cowardly avoided his responsibilities in representing his electorate.",35
29,Mrs CROSIO,NOTICE PAPER,"With respect, Madam Deputy Speaker, his attack came out personally and the Chair had to call him to order. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-I do not think that the honourable member for Gippsland has a point of order, so the honourable member for Prospect may resume her speech.",35
30,Mrs CROSIO,NOTICE PAPER,"In talking about the 1990 Budget, I particularly want to refer to how it will affect the people in my electorate. But, before I do so, I want to mention one of the items in our Budget that the honourable member for Gippsland conveniently overlooked. I reto the wholehearted support that will be given by the community to the Government's renewed attack on crime, particularly corporate crime. I assure honourable members that there is a low level of tolerance, not only within my electorate but also within Australia, of the so-called corporate cowboys. Ordinary people are exasperated at the fact that to these people, motivated by greed, seemingly run riot in the corporate sector and apparently come out unscathed and unrepentant. Ordinary people also recognise that, because of the actions of the so called corporate cowboys, there has been a substantial drop in Australia's credibility in the international marketplace, for which we are all paying. The substantial real increase in resources for corporate regulation, listed as $23m in this Budget, will certainly assist the Australian Securities Commission in the enforcement of corporate law. As a result we should see an improvement in the standards of corporate behaviour, and the restoration of international business reputation. In everyone of the Budgets since it came to office in 1983, this Labor Government has taken tough, necessary decisions which have impacted hard on our lives. But, with every tough decision, the Government has maintained a social conscience and has protected those who have been least able to shoulder the burden. Further, despite a tight budgetary climate, Budget after Budget this Government has achieved, built on and protected social gains. This certainly differentiates between the approach adopted by this Government and that advocated by those opposite. Those opposite just do not care. Their creed is, 'Chop $3m off social welfare expenditure-no big deal; no trouble'. I will number some of the social justice initiatives introduced by this Government in previous Budgets. They include employment growth; a restructured taxation system; reforms emanating from the social security review-the family allowance supplement, the child support scheme, increases in rent assistance and a retirement incomes policy; reforms in education and training; child-care; the National Agenda for Women; the home and community care programs and the Medicare programs. The 1990-91 Budget has built on these social justice achievements. A number of Budget initiatives will benefit families within my electorate of Prospect. The first such initiative is the tax cuts which will come into effect on 1 January next year. I assure honourable members that families in my electorate know the value of tax cuts. For low in- . come earners-many in my electorate are low income earners-the new tax scale has a number of distinct advantages. The tax-free threshold has been increased by $300 to $5,400. Whilst we are all advantaged by this, those on low incomes, for whom every dollar counts, will feel the benefit more acutely. In particular, those who work part-time will be encouraged to continue to do so by the increase in that tax-free threshold. The 21 per cent rate will apply right through to incomes of $20,700; the 29 per cent rate, which previously cut in at $17,600, has been abolished. That is a huge benefit for those in the $17,600 to $20,700 bracket. For a son earning $20,000 this is equivalent to a pay increase of $6.90 a week or $358 a year. So families continue to benefit from the restructuring of the tax system. The bottom marginal tax rate is 21c in the dollar, whereas just seven years ago, prior to our taking over government, it was 30c under the previous Fraser Government. The top marginal rate has been reduced from 60c in the dollar, as it was in the 1982-83 Budget, to 47c in the dollar in this 1990-91 Budget. Despite many misleading statements made by those opposite, the reality is that in this financial year individual taxpayers will pay less tax than if the personal income tax scales had been indexed for inflation since 1983. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out in this House, Australia is now amongst the lowest taxed countries in the world. Another Budget initiative which has been widely acknowledged as benefiting families, within my electorate in particular but also throughout Australia, is that relating to child-care. I refer, of course, to the $400m which will be spent over the next three years for a major expansion of child-care. This year some 14,500 Australian families will benefit from the creation of an estimated 12,300 new child-care places. Further, the amount of fee relief will be increased; more families will benefit as the income threshold for maximum benefit will increase from $280 to $370 gross per week. Fee relief will also be extended to approved commercial centres and other non-profit centres not currently funded. As we have been informed, this will benefit· up to 35,000 families with children at present in these centres. My constituents in Prospect are well aware of this Government's commitment to child-care. Since 1983 this Government has established six federally funded child-care centres within my electorate. In fact, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) recently officiated at the opening of two of those centres-Villawood North, a long day care centre, and the Parks occasional care centre. As I mentioned in this House in per- my very first speech, in my electorate many families are in the situation where both parents work. As a lot of them are in low paid jobs, there still exists a great demand for affordable child-care. I will again be giving a guarantee to ensure that they benefit from the creation of the new child-care places. I also wish to applaud the Government's decision to spend some $15m over three years to establish family resource centres and $9m to provide youth activity services. Both initiatives will be of benefit to families within Prospect. The family resource centres will assist disadvantaged and vulnerable families to gain access to the most appropriate welfare and support services. The youth activity services will ensure that older children, those in the 11 to 16 age bracket, have access to appropriate supervised activities outside of school hours, thus reducing the risk of drug abuse, petty crime, vandalism and physical abuse. Within my electorate there are approximately 1,200 families in receipt of the family allowance supplement. Those families will now be eligible to receive a care card. For those working families on low incomes, this means that they will have access to prescription drugs at the concessional rate of $2.50. I also wish to acknowledge the long term benefits which will result from the establishment of a work and family unit in the Department of Industrial Relations. I understand that that unit will work with employers, employees and unions to improve working conditions for workers with family responsibilities. I am pleased to note that particular attention will be given to parental leave, flexible working hours, work-related child-care, career paths for part-time workers and the removal of discriminatory practices against workers with family responsibilities. Also of long term benefit-this is how we must view the Budget-to the families of Prospect is the national housing strategy. The strategy will address the pressing problems of housin.g, which is a critical issue in Sydney, taking into account the appropriateness of current housing policies, demographic change-for example, the ageing of the population-and, importantly for the people of Sydney's west, the quality of life for people housed on what are classified as the fringes of the major urban areas. One of the most important areas that needs assistance and help within my electorate is flood mitigation. The flood mitigation program in this Budget, whilst increased by 23 per cent over 1989-90 to $5.05m, has certainly not gone far enough in overcoming some of the major flooding problems in Sydney's west and, particularly, within my electorate. In fact, the allocation for flood mitigation works for 1990-91 has actually been reduced in dollar terms from $20.9m in 1989 to $19.9m in 1990. The social and economic importance of flood mitigation works in the electorate of Prospect warrants a significantly increased financial commitment. The Lower Prospect Creek flood plain management strategy, which is an updated report just completed in May of this year, has stated very clearly that to reduce damages involves a mix of structural and non-structural works which can health be implemented progressively; but just that section alone is estimated to cost in the vicinity of $33m. Fairfield City, which makes up a major part of my Federal electorate, between August 1986 and April-May 1988 had had three major floods. The extent of urban development and flood liability certainly necessitates an extensive and complex flood mitigation program. I know that in this Budget $450,000 has been allocated to the electorate for bank stabilisation and restoration work at Lansvale as well as $90,000 to do channel improvements in Prospect and Orphan School creeks. But from the studies, the reports and the figures I have just mentioned, one can understand and appreciate that at that level of spending it certainly is going to take a lot more Budgets to achieve even the fundamental changes that are going to be required within the Prospect electorate to overcome the flooding problems. There are currently approximately 4,000 people in my electorate who receive either the invalid pension or the sickness benefit. It will be immediately apparent that Prospect is one of those electorates upon which the disability reforms will have the greatest impact. It has been a matter of concern to me for some time that such a large number of my constituents are dependent on either the invalid pension or the sickness benefit. Let me emphasise to. the House that I am not assuming that these people are bludging off the system; rather, my concern is that it cannot be in their or their families' best interest to be indefinitely dependent, and I do not think that the 'system' has been proactive enough with regard to the needs of these people. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) are absolutely correct when they say that many people with disabilities want to play a greater role in the work force and the community. They deserve to be given more opportunity and encouragement. It is for that reason that I welcome the announcement of a major disability reform which will ensure that the system is proactive in promoting better access to jobs, rehabilitation, training and accommodation for people with disabilities. The announcement that is causing most concern to people is the planned replacement of the invalid pension with a new disability support pension and the replacement of the sickness benefit with a sickness allowance. I think there is a perception that people who need support would find it lacking. However, it is important to understand that after 1 October 1991 any applicants for the disability support pension who are clearly too severely impaired to participate in the labour market will go straight onto the pension without further assessment. Essentially, there is a targeting of the payment to people with significant disabilities. They will continue to receive adequate and secure support. However, other people who are considered likely to benefit from training or assistance will be carefully assessed by officers from the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. A system is envisaged which focuses on the individual and asks what can be done for this person and what are his or her needs with regard to rehabilitation and/or training opportunities. Rehabilitation, education and labour market programs will be expanded to complement this initiative. For example, over the next three years about 7,000 new places will be provided under the Jobtrain, Jobstart and Jobsearch training programs for people with disabilities. I understand that also approximately 300 places will be created in a new subsidised work experience program. Obviously, people referred to training or rehabilitation programs will be expected to participate in them if they. are to continue to receive the disability support pension. I understand that there will be careful monitoring of pensioners' progress by assessment terms. I regard it as important that included in the reform for disability support pensioners are additional incentives to work, which are to be known as the work force transition package. That package includes the continuation of eligibility for the pensioner health benefit card, a $200 lump sum employment entry permit and an increase in mobility allowance from $11 to $20 a week. This package will, in many cases, tip the balance when disability pensioners are weighing the pros and cons of entering the labour force. Some uncertainty exists in the community as to how these reforms affect people currently receiving invalid pensions. It is therefore important to make that position clear. All current invalid pensioners, as of 22 August 1990, will continue to receive benefits under existing arrangements, and only a few pensioners' benefits-I understand 2 per cent-will be subject to review under new arrangements. It will be open to current invalid pensioners to seek rehabilitation or training assistance. It will not be compulsory for them to do so. However, I understand that there will be strong encouragement for them to do so. I do not regard this major disability reform as being driven by consideration of cost clltting. The obvious aim of the reform is to ensure that people with disabilities participate in and contribute to the life and the work of the community. It is deserving of strong support. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",35
31,Mr BRADFORD,NOTICE PAPER,"It is somewhat ironic that I rise to speak after the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), knowing that she represents an area in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. It was interesting to listen to the honourable member struggling valiantly but, I suggest, in vain to support the Government's Budget, which is in many ways insupportable. One might even have been remotely convinced in listening to her that there was some justification for some of the things she was saying. She talked about the families in her electorate, yet these families, I suggest to the honourable member, are the ones that are being hurt most by this Government's economic mismanagement. I know about the people in Prospect, and I have visited that electorate on many occasions. The people are, as the honourable member pointed out to this House, on low incomes. As she said correctly, they are people for whom every dollar of income counts. Yet it is those people, like most other people in Australia, whose real incomes under this Government have dropped substantially over the past seven years. Yet in this House today the honourable member attempts to defend this Government's economic mismanagement. The honourable member talked about tax cuts. What a joke those tax cuts are. This Government has taken away far more from average families in this country over the past seven years than it will ever give back in tax cuts. Most of us realise that the tax cuts that will come into effect will go nowhere towards redressing the hardship that most families are experiencing in this country now. I was interested to hear the honourable member talk about the Government's commitment to child-care. What a deplorable record this Government has in respect of child-care. I believe that its main contribution, and perhaps its only contribution, to child-care has been to create such financial hardship for most families in this country that we now have, in almost endemic proportions, family breakups occurring because of the financial problems and hardships that this Government has created for them. We see many instances where both parents are being forced out to work to meet interest payments, which have increased enormously, and mortgage payments on their homes-if things have not got so bad for them that they have already lost their homes. I would have thought that things have become so bad out Fairfield way that the floods that the honourable member spoke about would probably be good news. We have another year, another Budget, and another chance for the Government to effect real change. Yet what do we really have here? We have another wasted opportunity. But what makes this year's Budget all the more deplorable, and I believe inexcusable, is that the people of Australia were looking to this Government, at this time, to implement the necessary policies to bring about real change. There is no doubt that changes are vital in order to alleviate the problems that Australians face each day. The Labor Government has failed the people of Australia miserably in the 1990-91 Budget. It has failed Australians at a time when, as never before in the history of this country, they have to struggle to find money to meet increasing mortgage payments, when they face the prospect of increasing unemployment or of struggling against all odds to keep a small business going. For the first time since the Depression, we also have within our country at the moment people having to face the prospect of retirement in a climate of uncertainty. That, of course, is very worrying to the many people in that situation. The 1990 Budget has done more to raise fears than to allay them; to increase hardships than to alleviate them. Even the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was uncharacteristically frank-in the post-Budget quiet, people have sat back and tried to analyse what he said, and have realised that ip the end he said very little-when he described Australia as a poor country. He made the rather astute observation, and I use the word astute very loosely, that we simply cannot afford to spend money on businesses sorely needed public infrastructure. He substantial. said that we cannot afford to spend more third money on roads, and by implication that ence we cannot afford to spend more money flexibility on hospitals, new schools to educate children, new public housing at a time when it is most needed-as I said earlier, people are losing their homes due to spirthe alling interest rates-and we cannot afpredicts, ford to upgrade existing sewerage and drainage systems despite the threat to en vironment. Why cannot Australia afford these things? We were and we are a wealthy closure? country. This is the question that must exercise our minds. I will give It is because this Government has mismanaged the Australian economy so comprehensively over the last seven years that Australia is now close to bankruptcy. The situation is almost as bad as and heading rapidly in the direction of the period just prior to the Depression. If there is one thing that is eminently clear to me it that we simply cannot afford to continue on the path that the Treasurer has set Australia in the 1990s. I have many concerns about this Budget and I am very interested in it. Once again I find it ironical that the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is at the table because one of my greatest concerns is that the Budget has simply failed small business. It has failed cornerstone of our economy. It is not though the Tr.easurer did not have any help when it came to looking at the probyear lems of this important sector. The Govportunity, ernment has a blueprint for reform. The Minister knows what I am talking about because it is set out for the Treasurer numbered recommendations which are perfect very easy to follow. The report that I re-erring to is, of course, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into small business-the so-called Beddall report. We all know-perhaps I do not need to go through all the figures-that small business has a vital role to play the economy. I quote from the Beddall needs report: The precise contribution of the 750,000 small in Australia is difficult to quantify, but They account for 96 per cent of all firms, half of private sector employment, and a of all employment in Australia. The existof small business contributes greatly to the of the economy and its ability to evolve our to meet changing demands. It is a matter of national concern when Australian Small Business Association as it did in June this year, that 100,000, or one in eight, small businesses our will face closure in the next 12 months. Let me ask another question: Why is this happening? Why is this so? Why is it that so many small businesses face imminent I will answer that question. It is mainly due to the high interest rate policy the answer. of this Government. Mr Beddall-That is wrong.",39
32,Mr BRADFORD,NOTICE PAPER,"It is not wrong. It is mainly due to the economic policy of this Government, and the Treasurer even refuses to accept responsibility for that. The latest thing is that he wants to blame the is banks. Maybe that is what the Minister is alluding to-that it is the banks' fault that for small businesses are going broke every day. But it is not the banks' fault; it is this Government's fault. The Treasurer cannot so easily lay the blame at someone else's feet for his inability to act on the vital taxation reform recommendations made in the Minister's report. As these recommendations were not acted on in the this Budget, I ask you, Madam Deputy as Speaker: exactly when will they be addressed? The report was tabled earlier this and this Budget was the perfect opand the correct opportunity, to implement the changes that the Government gave lip-service to in the March in election campaign. The Treasurer had a opportunity to implement the recam ommendations of the Minister's report. There will not be a better time, and there on never has been a time when those reforms were needed more than they are now, as far as the small business community is concerned. Once again the Treasurer has failed to deliver. He has failed to deliver into that sector of the economy which most help at this particular time, that is, the. smalt business community. The Beddall report highlights the conanswer cern that small business operators have about the current tax system. It emerged during the inquiry that the area of ComRoyal monwealth regulation of the greatest conin cern to small business was clearly that taxation-and well it might be. Concerns were expressed and raised in the report. Recommendations were made about alwhy most every aspect of Commonwealth taxment ation including income tax, company and provisional tax, sales tax, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation and trading stock valuations. What has the Government's response been to all of these recommendations in respect of badly needed changes in the tax system?

I refer Prime Minister to Senator Robert Ray's to a prearranged question in the Senate yesterday when he effectively announced an important upgrading of the Australian Navy's operational role the Persian Gulf. In view of the fact the Prime Minister has said that our naval commitment is the most serious decision he has made as Prime Minister, did he choose not to make a stateto the House explaining the most recent upgrading? While he will be aware from his previous consultations with me that the Opposition supports this upgrading, will he now explain to the Australian people how the new naval mission of halting, boarding and verification, in addition to the previously publicised roles of idencontact, interrogation and warning, could increase Australia's military involvement in the Gulf crisis?",41
37,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"I am indebted to the of the' Opposition for his question. to As he says, Senator Ray yesterday in the Senate, as it was appropriate that he should do, that the operational roles of Royal Australian Navy ships serving in the Gulf region have been extended to allow them to halt and to board vessels for the purpose of verifying their cargoes and their destinations. This role may reone quire our ships to use minimum force with proper authorisation in some circumstances. Appropriate rules of engagement have been issued to the ships' commanders. I will say more about that These new roles are additional to the of identification, contact, interrogation and warning which were agreed to by Cabinet and which were announced by Senator Evans on 14 August 1990. The roles were adopted to take account continuing consultation between countries participating in the multinational naforce, and particularly to take account of the outcome of the recent naval conference in Bahrain on the adoption of a more positive response to the enforcement of sanctions. The decision to extend the operational roles of our ships was taken by Senator Senator Ray and me following a the Cabinet decision of 30 August which authorised us to take this step if it became apparent that a broader role was necessary in order for Australian ships to contribute effectively to the enforcement of the United Nations embargo. The possibility that our ships might need to be given a broader role in the light of consultation and experience was foreshadowed in the original Cabinet decision of 14 August 1990 and publicly by Senator Evans the same day. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 665, which called on members to use such measures as may be necessary to enforce the embargo, was also, of course, a factor in the Government's decision. Before deciding to expand the operational role of our ships I held consultations, as has been indicated, with the Leader of the Opposition and with my own Party. For an opposition which has said from the beginning that it did not want to play petty politics in this issue that is about it has done since the beginning of the exercise.  rubbish.",41
38,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"Members of the Opposition have attempted, despite their noisy protestations, to· suggest that there has been some confusion in the Government's handling of this matter. There has been none. There has been no confusion at all. We made it clear, and we made it early, that there would be a commitment to provide ships in support of the United Nations embargo. We were amongst the first nations of the world to do so. We have held extensive consultations with other participating nations as to how that best can be done. We have adapted the details of our ships' roles and operations in a carefully planned way to meet changing circumstances. Importantly, this process through which we have proceeded has been clearly understood and endorsed by everyone that matters, most particularly the Royal Australian Navy. At every point what the Government has done has been clearly understood. It has been endorsed by everyone who matters, most particularly by the Royal Australian Navy. All I can say in conclusion is that if the Leader of the Opposition finds that confusing and cannot understand it, it is a reflection on no-one but him. It only confirms what is coming to be recognised-that he knows even less about international affairs than we understood before. NA",42

42,Mr GOODLUCK,WOOL INDUSTRY,This is a dorothy dixer.,42
43,Mr KERIN,WOOL INDUSTRY,"It is pretty obvious that the honourable member for Franklin is not interested in the matter. Since the Government took the essential decision to lower the minimum reserve price for wool to 700c, several episodic factors have further depressed the demand for wool. These include the withdrawal from the market of the Soviet Union, which is our second largest buyer, because of foreign exchange difficulties; slower demand from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries because of creased uncertainty about world ecotralia. nomic growth as a result of higher oil prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis; and a substantial strengthening Australian dollar. As well as that, the sharp fall in wheat prices and the considerable capital costs of entry into the cattle indusindustry try have limited the capacity of farmers to turn to other enterprises. Generally good seasons have resulted in farmers maintaining sheep numbers. Production is therefore very high and is likely to remain so. The current situation in the industry-and there has been a lot of publicity about it-is based on speculation building on the changes in the fundamentals that have just referred to. It has not been caused by some psychological reaction brought about by Government intervenassessment tion. So it is against this background the Government has taken four very implies. portant decisions. First of all, we reaffirm our rock solid support for the floor price of 700c. Secondly, to support that commitment, the $2.5 billion ceiling on Australian Wool Corporation borrowings will be removed, effective immediately. This does not mean that the Australian taxpayers are offering the wool industry a to-blank cheque. Our decision to lift the borrowings ceiling is conditional upon an imnight? mediate comprehensive business plan from the Wool Corporation on how it will manage its potential exposure for the remainder of the 1990-91 selling season.

For the time being I will chair that council. The fourth decision is that as soon as arrangements can be made.

49,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I think I have made absolutely clear on all occasions on which I have been publicly requested for information on this matter that the Government has not made a decision on the issue of reselling lines that private networks have leased from Telecom Australia. That is a matter that the Government has yet to consider. It is not an issue that goes to the heart of the issue of network competition. Whether or not there ought to be network competition is an issue that the Cabinet has been discussing and talking through in the political processes inside the Australian Labor Party. Of the many areas of reform in the telecommunications area that this Government has undertaken since it has been in office, the burgeoning system of private networks stands very much to the. credit of my predecessors. That is why now, as the Prime Minister has said repeatedly, if we look back over the micro-economic reform agenda of this Government, we can point to achievement where none existed previously. So, those private networks are in place. There is an additional issue, however. That issue is whether the lines leased from Telecom by private networks are capable of being on-sold by them. That is an issue about which the Cabinet must decide. The availability of the capacity to set up private networks is not a decision that the Cabinet has to decide because that decision was taken a long time ago.

50,Mr LAVARCH,MIDDLE EAST,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the status of Australian women and children in Kuwait and Iraq?,44
51,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"Often in Question Time there is much controversy between the Government and the Opposition, but I am sure that in both what I say about the Government attitude and the information I give there will be a shared position between both sides of the House. I preface my answer to the honourable member's question by saying, as I should again, that the actions of Iraq in not allowing all foreign nationals to leave freely are contrary to international law and they are repugnant according to all accepted rules of international behaviour. The threat to use hostages as human shields is horrific and has been properly condemned around the world. Against that background, the Government is relieved at the release of women and children. My Government deeply believes that all Australians must be released and they must be allowed to leave without delay. The safety and the welfare of Australians is a matter of the gravest concern to the Government, as I know it is to all members of the House. I have registered that fact strongly and personally with the Iraqi Ambassador. Again I am sure I speak for both sides of the House when I say that Australia does not and will not accept any linkage between the deployment of our Royal Australian Navy ships to the Gulf and the safety of Australians in Iraq and Kuwait. We have been doing all we possibly can to secure the welfare of all Australians and to attempt to get their safe repatriation to Australia. The hard work of all officials involved is much appreciated by the Government and, I am sure, by all members of this House. I am pleased to advise the House that all Australian women and children known to our Baghdad embassy and who wish to leave Iraq and Kuwait have been able to do so. Not all the remaining Australians in Kuwait, which is approximately 50, or those in Iraq, which is approximately 55, ,have sought assistance from the embassy. Some do not wish to leave and some should not experience difficulty in leaving-for example, those who carry other passports. Of most serious concern, of course, are the estimated 20 Australian men in Kuwait and 14 in Baghdad who are refused permission to leave. Officials from our embassy in Baghdad have already made three journeys to Kuwait to keep in contact with Australians there, and the embassy is presently involved in a fourth visit to Kuwait to make arrangements to assist more Australians wishing to leave Kuwait for Baghdad. I repeat our total and unqualified condemnation of the refusal of the Iraqi authorities to allow the free departure of all foreign nationals who wish to leave from Kuwait and Iraq. I repeat that the Government is consistently doing all it can to try to secure the safe passage out of Iraq and Kuwait of all our nationals. Finally, I repeat how indebted we are to the unceasing efforts that have been made by the members of our diplomatic missions in the area to do all they can to monitor the welfare of Australian citizens and to secure their capacity to leave the region.

53,Mr KEATING,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"If the honourable member wants to direct questions on telecommunications he had best direct them to the Minister for Transport Communications. But to the extent that he wants to muck around, I will accommonopoly, modate him every time, of course. I to him that what the Minister is ing is not a permanent duopoly. It is a duopoly of the variety the Opposition specialised in with airlines and other things, or the monopolies that it was even better at, but a transient duopoly. A sient duopoly has a whole lot of different features from the kind of proposition the Opposition was always about. The reason the Minister has argued favour of a transient duopoly is the difficulties and barriers to entry which any competitor would face in dealing with Telecom Australia, and there is very great validity to that argument, of course. There is no reason why, in the course of that duopoly period or beyond, we will not have strong and effective competition. I believe we will have strong and effective competition from such an arrangement because this will be the first time that our telecommunications operator has a competitor on its main network. Certainly there has been some competition provided by OTC in terms of private networks and value-added services but, in terms of the network in general, there has been no other wireline operator and there will be under this proposal. That means that, in the context that the Government has decided to approach the question of reform with a transient duopoly, there can be and will be effective competition. I understand it, what the Opposition about is the bare transfer of monopoly. it is about is taking Telecom and selling it to somebody. How does the Opposition believe that is going to improve competition? Even the community service obligations which currently obtain within the Telecom network would be contested by a private owner. One may well say, 'Well, put it on Budget' and five minutes of later the Department of Finance will say 'Well, let's put it off Budget'. Mr Reith-A transient distransient.",45

But with the bare transfer of a which is what the Opposition say is about-taking a public monopoly and proposmaking it a private monopoly-the not honourable member has the awful front then to get up and talk about the Government's policy when the Government, as usual, is breaking new ground in yet antranother area of the Australia economytelecommunications. We have had to do the same on the waterfront, and with the airlines and tariffs. As usual, it is only the in Government which has taken any action. We always hear from the coalition that it is about to get the big stick out and do this and that. The fact is that when the coalition was around it never did anything. Whenever the coalition engages in an argument about how it would do things, all it does is make declaratory statements and claims. There is never any real understanding of the issues involved. That is what we saw last night in the discussion between the honourable member for Menzies and the Minister for Transport and Communications on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program: he was just unaware of the policy context and issues involved. In the end, the public of Australia will be asked to believe who will get on with the job and make the changes. Sure, the coalition always luxuriates in the policy ferment on this side of the House. I will tell the coalition why there is a policy ferment on this side of the House. We actually do things; we get a few things done. These things have been left undone for 100 years or more. That is why there is a policy ferment. Out of that always comes a structure with ideas, and when we approach a subject we know what the parameters and the permutations are. Mr Reith-Is the duopoly a flashing stone or is it a permanent fixture?",45
55,Mr SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Flinders will cease interjecting.,46
56,Mr KEATING,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"This one will be no exception. That is why the coalition should get its own ideas sorted out. The coalition must not think that selling a public entity for money amounts to a policy, because it is not a policy at all. When it comes competition, improved efficiency and lower prices, only the Government has a market solution-as usual. TRADE WITH CHINA: IRON ORE",46
57,Mrs JAKOBSEN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,I refer to the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review regarding the recent approval by the Minister for Resources of iron ore export contracts to China. Can the Minister inform· the House whether Australia has allowed itself to be manoeuvred into an unacceptably weak position in its dealings with China as claimed in this editorial and explain the actual basis of the iron ore pricing arrangements approved by him?,46
58,Mr GRIFFITHS,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I inform the House that I recently approved the 15.96 per cent increase in iron ore prices negotiated by Robe River Iron Associates and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd with Chinese buyers. I am aware of the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review and previous articles critical of that decision. By way of background, Australia is the major iron ore supplier to China with a market share of over 60 per cent. Ever since Australian iron ore sales to China commenced in 1972, prices have always been discounted below prices paid in Japan and other Asian markets. Initially, of course, this was to encourage the Chinese to import iron ore from Australia but more recently, however, the high cost of China's poor domestic infrastructure has been cited as the major justification for the discount. Since 1988, Australian suppliers and Government Ministers have made strong efforts to reduce or remove the discount and have the Chinese pay market prices. The articles in the Australian Financial Review regarding my approval for the recently negotiated price increase of 15.96 per cent for 1990 are misleading and inaccurate on a number of points. The articles concentrate almost solely on the percentage price increase, but totally ignore Hamersley Iron's achievement of an agreed schedule to phase out the discount on Chinese prices to achieve parity with prices in other Asian iron ore markets by to 1997. Hamersley's achievement of an agreed schedule to eliminate the discount on Chinese prices is, by any definition, a major breakthrough which will remove much of the uncertainty from price negotiation processes and considerably reduce the time and cost of lengthy Chinese negotiations in future years. Moreover, Government Ministers over the past three years have strongly supported the efforts of our industry to achieve just such an agreement. The articles in the Australian Financial Review are inaccurate in a number of other areas. They fail to take into account the strength of our overall trading relationship in iron ore, including the benefits Australia derives from Chinese participation in the Channar joint venture with Hamersley. They fail to acknowledge that the Japanese accept discount prices themselves: that is, the Japanese still sell steel into China at a discount. The articles fail to recognise also the reality of the iron ore market. Far from Australian industry being dissatisfied with the outcome this year, individual companies have said they doubt that a better result could have been achieved. NA",46
59,Mr NA BROWN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will recall his promise that there will be lower telephone prices as a result of the Government's telecommunications policy announced this week. The Prime Minister. may have noted the comments by the Managing Director of Telecom, Mr Ward, today, where he is reported as saying that he did not believe that there would be big pricing changes as a result of the new system proposed by the Government and that putting the focus on prices, in his words, 'lost sight' of the real advantages of competition. In the light of that, will the Prime Minister now give a categorical assurance to this House that under megacom and the Government's proposals announced this week in fact prices to telephone users will fall?",47
60,Mr HAWKE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I did notice the comments to which he referred. I assert to the House that we are strongly of the view that STD prices will fall significantly after the introduction of competition. It is important in making that assertion that it not be seen simply as something we say without looking at relevant experience. In that sense the Minister for Transport and Communications, the Government and I are sustained by extensive overseas experience in this matter. Let me just refer to some of that overseas experience. In Japan new competitors on trunk routes offer tariffs 20 per cent to 30 per cent below the monopoly incumbent. In New Zealand toll call tariffs dropped by about 40 per cent since 1988. In the United Kingdom the new competitor undercut British Telecom's prices by 20 per cent for STD services. In the United States of America the STD prices have dropped by about 40 per cent since 1984. There is very good reason to believe that price falls in Australia with the introduction of competition will be at least as significant as what has occurred overseas. The structure that the Government is proposing will be more competitive than those overseas, with the introduction of competitive safeguards. In particular, our emphasis on establishing fair interconnect arrangements, whereby the competitor will be charged the same price that Telecom would charge itself for access to the network, will ensure that prices will fall. Competition will further ensure that STD prices will benefit from the early adoption of the latest technological advances. That is our position, but it has been fascinating to see in the last 24 hours-",47
61,Mr NA BROWN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,What about local calls?,47
62,Mr HAWKE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The honourable member has been told what will happen in regard to local calls. There will be price capping arrangements there, the consumer price index minus X formula, and it has been indicated that will continue. In the very many gaps that the honourable member for Menzies has in his knowledge, that is another one. Let me refer, having put the clear position of the Government, to the mishmash that emerges from what spokespersons for the Opposition have been saying in the past 24 hours. Both the Leader of the Opposition-whose knowledge in this area seems to rival his knowledge in the area of international affairs-and the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Menzies, have been talking about the disaster that regulated price setting would bring about. Let us examine that position of theirs. Members of the Opposition would apparently allow, according to what they have been saying, as many or as few competitors as the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel) will allow, not as many as the market would allow. There is no market based solution at all in what they have been saying. Where would that leave Australia in those circumstances? Under what the Opposition is putting forward we would have a restricted oligopoly, but with no control over price setting at all. The Leader of the Opposition said last night: . . . you would still have Austel as the industry regulatory body . . . You need a regulatory structure but you don't rely on regulation you the results. He continued: As Mr Beazley just said, he would regulate to ensure cheaper telephone calls, we would not do that. That is his position. The Government would regulate to ensure cheaper telephone calls; the Opposition would not do that. So there would be no limit on the degree to which timed calls would be introduced. There would be no limit, under the Opposition policy, on a basket of prices to ensure that the benefits of technology are passed on to consumers. Under the Opposition's approach, which has now been clearly articulated, there would be a totally distorted market with great barriers to entry. Without being exhaustive about those barriers to entry, there would be the cost of setting up a network, there would be a need to get· the nod from Austel and there would be the strength of the incumbent. So there would be a distorted market with these barriers to entry but with every right to pricegouge. The Opposition simply cannot have it both ways on this matter. It cannot claim it is a market solution because it clearly is not. Rather, under what it would call the market, there would be a total sacrifice of consumer interest to the illusion of competition. It is quite clear that in this particular area-this important area of pricing-there will be the starkest possible contrast between the position of the Government, which unashamedly does two things to ensure benefits to consumers, and the position of the Opposition. Firstly, the Government introduces effective competition, and it is effective in two ways because it has the regulatory framework, to which I referred, and it also has a totally publicly owned telecommunications facility. In that way we have the assurance that the interests of the consumers are going to be satisfied. Against that there is this ideological mind-set of the Opposition members who will simply say, 'Public enterprise is bad. We will fire sale Telecom and hand the whole of Australia's telecommunications facilities to the to give private sector with no regulation to ensure that competition or new technology is passed on by way of benefit to the consumer'. Under that system the only beneficiaries will be the oligopolists who the Oppositiori will protect from having any obligation at all to pass on the benefits of competition and technology to the con-· sumer. So, as I say, for every reason that I can think of I am looking forward, in the months and years ahead, to the debate between the Opposition and us because the Opposition will lose on every ground. It cannot possibly win this argument in the Australian electorate. My only prayer and hope is that the Opposition will adhere precisely to the position that it has now in this area because it will go to the electorate and, for the fifth time in a row, it will be thrashed. NA",47
63,Mr GRACE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware of a report which appeared in today's Melbourne Age in which it is claimed that there is a deep fear among women in the community on the matter of timed local telephone calls? Is there any justification for such concern?,48
64,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Not while this Government remains in office. That is the short answer to this question. There is no issue here. I will be quite specific. This Government guarantees that untimed local calls will continue to be available to householders and, just as important as that, these calls will be subjeCt to a price cap via the consumer price index minus X basket formula. This policy will be implemented through a condition in the licences of both network operators. It is because we are sensitive to the position of people in the circumstances described in that article in the Age today that we have set in place the processes described by the Prime Minister in his answer to the previous question. The fact that we are determined to maintain Telecom Australia in full public ownership is in no small way related to our determination in that area. We happen to be retaining it in full public ownership for a wide variety of reasons. However, one of those reasons happens to be that we know that in the telecommunications system unless one has a strong public carrier, unless one has a situation in which people are not seeking a rate of return on what would have to be an enormous investment to acquire telecommunications from the Government, at the end of the day one can guarantee nothing. I do give the Opposition credit for one thing: Opposition members have had the honesty to acknowledge in the statements they have made that once the carrier has been sold-the basis on which the Opposition would introduce competition is unclear-there is only one way to meet community service obligations and that is to put them on budget. There is no other way of doing it, and at least the Opposition has had the honesty to acknowledge that. However, I am afraid to say that there is a heck of a lot 'more in those community service obligations than the Opposition has properly recognised-and certainly more than the National Party members have properly recognised. If the Opposition is actually going to put those community service obligations on Budget and at the same time make those dramatic reductions in outlays that the Opposition has been talking about, at the same time as it is introducing that broad based consumption tax and making the appropriate cuts to go with it, the Opposition will find itself in a Budget hole which it will never dig itself out of. Of course, as the Opposition starts to dig itself out of that hole-if the Opposition ever gets into that position, and it will not-the first thing that would go straight out the door would be the community service obligations. NA COUNCIL· Mr CHANEYI ask the Prime Minister whether he stands by his statement to the Australian Mining Industry Council dinner on 3 May this year when he said: And let me say that, judging from its discussions with members of my government, AMIC is responsive to the higher environmental standards nowadays expected of the mining industries. I readily acknowledge that and am greatly encouraged by it.",48
65,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY,"Yes, I stand by that statement. Generally speaking, there has been a very significant improvement in the attitude of the inining industry. None of us are excluded from the observation that we have all become more environmentally conscious. Unfortunately, the dawning of that consciousness has been much slower for the Opposition. However, generally speaking, all of us must confess that we have learned over recent years that we should have more concern with environmental matters. Therefore, we should be indebted to those who have been responsible for prodding us into. a greater degree of consciousness. This applies wherever one looks. I believe there are representatives of the United Kingdom present. Look at my good friend Margaret Thatcher. A few years ago who would have imagined that Margaret would be convening an international conference in London at which my Minister excellently represented the interests of Australia? Generally speaking, across the world there has been a new understanding of the obligations that we all have, not simply to gouge the resources of the earth, but to understand that we have an obligation to future generations. The Australian mining industry has not been immune to those influences. Indeed, it is because of the view that we have about that that in the Budget brought down by my friend and colleague the Treasurer specific measures were introduced to facilitate the activities of the mining industry in cleaning up after its operations. I refer to the decisions that were made in two respects: firstly, in respect of mining clean-up operations generally and, secondly, in regard to the taking down of platforms in the oil extraction industry. So there is a better attitude in the mining industry and a Government which is responding to that, which all adds up to the fact that Australia is conducting itself more sensibly in this area, as it should. NA",49
66,Mr ONEIL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Can the Minister for Transport and Communications assure the House that rural and provincial Australians will not be disadvantaged by the decision to restructure Australia's telecommunications?,50
67,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. It is a point that he has raised persistently with me over the last four to six months as this matter has been debated in our Party forums. I think from that point of view he will be well pleased with the proceedings of Question Time here today because he has that guarantee not only from me but also from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer as well, amplifying the point that the Cabinet made in the decision that it brought down on Monday to present to the Australian Labor Party conference; that is, that the community service obligations as they apply to all ing, of course, the rural sector, will be upheld by the Government and guaranteed. Not only will the aspect of it that goes to pricing arrangements be guaranteed, but also the programs that are ensuring the equalisation in terms of the facilities available to rural telecommunications consumers in our efforts to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by being in rural districts in comparison with their city cousins. Of course, in addition, rural consumers can well expect to benefit from the changes which are likely to take place in STD charges. I think it is probably not fully appreciated, as it might be, in rural communities, that the very substantial proportion of their phone bills, in fact, are phone bills on STD. It is a nationwide average of about 50 per cent of the average rural phone bill and, of course, some phone bills have a much higher STD content in them than that. So they will be the beneficiaries and their interests across the board will be protected. NA NA Mr CHANEYMy question is to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Now that the Minister has heard the Prime Minister reiterate his positive view of the responsiveness of the Australian Mining Industry Council to the higher environmental standards nowadays expected of the mining industry, will she explain why she said recently that AMIC's views were about as out of date as 1972 election promises, that AMIC misrepresented ecologically sustainable development, and that its idea of a sustainable industry 'is one in which miners can mine where they like for however long they want'?",50
68,Mrs KELLY,COUNCIL,"I thank the shadow environment Minister for his maiden question to me. I just want to quote a little section of the speech that I gave to the Fabian Society in New South Wales, which is the speech he is referring to, where I said: Individual mining companies have made substantial progress in understanding the importance of sectors, includthe environment. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that. I then made some criticism of the Mining Industry Council. I obviously did that from an environmental perspective, which is hardly surprising considering the title of my portfolio. NA",50
69,Mr LEE,PUBLIC HOUSING,"Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware of reports that the AMP Society has agreed with the New South Wales Government to provide 1,000 homes and that this has been described as the first step in privatising public housing? Are these reports correct? What is the Minister's response to them?",50
70,Mr HOWE,PUBLIC HOUSING,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Since the 1984 housing agreement, the Commonwealth has encouraged States to use off-Budget finance for public housing and home ownership assistance. If done correctly this enables greater output for given Budget outlays by using Budget grant funds to subsidise off-Budget borrowings. As the honourable member for Robertson will recall, when he was Minister for Housing in New South Wales, New South Wales took the advantage of the Commonwealth initiative to draw on off-Budget financing for home ownership assistance. This has led to a significant increase in home ownership assistance in New South Wales and other States. Assistance has increased from some 16,000 loans a year to around 40,000. It now represents some 30 per cent of loans to first home owners. To encourage this the Commonwealth has explicitly recognised that off-Budget funding for home purchase assistance would be outside Loan Council limits, and in the 1989 housing agreement the Commonwealth encouraged the States to develop a similar approach for public housing funding. The new agreement permits a State to use up to a quarter of the Commonwealth and State funds under the agreement to be used to link with off-Budget funds. New South Wales has taken advantage of this to develop the proposal with AMP for use of off-Budget funds for public rental housing and recently announced an arrangement with AMP for some $130m to provide 1,000 homes in this financial year.",50
71,Mr HOWARD,PUBLIC HOUSING,You used to call iteconomic vandalism.,51
72,Mr HOWE,PUBLIC HOUSING,New South Wales is to be commended for this initiative. Its work will be closely examined by the Commonwealth and other States could learn from the New South Wales experience. Stock produced under this initiative will be managed by the State Housing Authority. This is a sensible tapping into external sources of funds to boost conventional public housing funding arrangements. The Commonwealth will continue to work with the States in this off-Budget area.,51
73,Mr HOWARD,PUBLIC HOUSING,You have now gone past the light on the hill; you are now going down the other side.,51

77,Mr HOWE,PUBLIC HOUSING,The former Leader of the Opposition has been over there for so long that even I did not think he would get to the point of enjoying it so much. The longer he stays there and observes change the better. Mr Carlton-You will be in the Thatcher class and run into a lot of trouble. How is your good friend Margaret?,51
78,Mr HOWARD,PUBLIC HOUSING,We are enjoying this.,51
79,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC HOUSING,I remind the honourable member for Mackellar that he might not be around to hear the rest of this answer; I have already warned him once.,51
80,Mr HOWE,PUBLIC HOUSING,"The only thing the honourable member opposite enjoys is his own jokes. The Commonwealth will continue to work with the States in this offBudget area. In fact, at the moment we have a working party with the States which is looking at any impediments and will look further at the issues through the national housing strategy. NA",51
81,Mr CHANEY,ENVIRONMENT,"Now that neither the Minister nor I are any longer maidens I ask whether the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories agrees with her colleague the Minister for Resources when he said: A '-radical shift away from the resource sector, as advocated by the environmental groups, would have far-reaching implications for the Australian economy and our quality of life. If the Minister agrees, what are the implications for our economy and quality of life?",51
82,Mrs KELLY,ENVIRONMENT,"I agree with what the Minister for Resources said, about that. I think it is important that it be seen in the context of this ecologically sustainable bate that we are about to get into and the processes that the Prime Minister has initiated. In that process we are setting down some firm guidelines for development in the economy. Also we have to consider environmental concerns. It is not a case of one or the other; it is the integration between the two. In that context, of course I agree with my colleague's statement. NA",51
83,Mr COURTICE,TOURISM,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. Is there that the Government's overseas tourism marketing efforts are achieving positive results for Australia?",52
84,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,"I am pleased to into form the House that the latest informavisitor tion on short term visitor arrivals to Australia was released today by the Ausspent tralian Bureau of Statistics. The trends are very encouraging indeed. The end of June saw arrivals go over the one mark. Last year, of course, the Opposition made all sorts of discouraging comments about the rate of growth of international tourism. Given the way in which these figures are going-in excess of one million international visitors arriving in the period from January to June this year-we are likely to exceed the target set by the tralian Tourist Commission of 2.3 million international visitors in 1990. Signifimotional cantly, those January to June figures 4 per cent higher than for the same period ist Commission. in 1988. When we take into account the developments in that year, with the tenary and the Expo in Brisbane, the ures speak for themselves. Arrivals for the month of June were 10 per cent higher than for the same month in 1989. I wish to comment specifically on some of the important source countries. In the case of Japan, those arrival figures !;oared by more than 60 per cent for June of this year compared with June interjecting. of last 'year.",52
85,Mr GOODLUCK,TOURISM,How is Tasmania doing?,52
86,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,"Tasmania is doing tracted very well because of the initiatives that were taken by the Tasmanian de- cently when he went to Japan to promote Tasmania. Recently I had the opportunity to be in Japan. I was delighted to hear about the encouraging news that was coming from Japan following the Premier's visit. The honourable member should be very pleased with the Premier's efforts. I wish to get back to the point about the Japanese arrival figures. Last week I was able to indicate that the rate of increase in those Japanese tourist numbers is particularly significant. Mr MCGauran-Where did you park any evidence your plane, Warren?",52
87,Mr SPEAKER,TOURISM,",--The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.",52
88,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,"Last week I was able indicate that in its 1989 international survey, the Bureau of Tourism Research indicated that Japanese tourists more per day than any other tourist. Given the fact that we have such encouraging visitor numbers from Japan, I think million that is very significant. Also significant are the arrival figures from Asia generally. In the case of some of the longer haul markets, Europe also recorded strong growth in June, up 13 per cent. The arrivals from Canada also increased by nearly 24 per cent. The results Auswould obviously attest-I am sure that all members would agree-to the recent proefforts undertaken on behalf of are the Government by the Australian TourMr MCGauran-You are joking. Why bicendon't you do something about what he figdid. He used a VIP plane in a most improper fashion.",52

90,Mr SPEAKER,TOURISM,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Mayo will cease,52
91,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,I would have thought that these sorts of figures would have ata fair amount of bipartisan support because tourism is a very important Premier reindustry for Australia. Mr MCGauran-But they are not figures about Warren's activities.,52
92,Mr SPEAKER,TOURISM,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,53
93,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,"The honourable member should not try to trivialise the point because these are figures that he and I and every Australian should be very proud of. Significantly, those figures, particularly for holiday travellers, have increased dramatically-lO per cent for the period from January to June this year, compared with the same period last year. I thought everyone understood the importance of inbound tourism to Australia. I conclude by indicating that this House, and indeed the people of Australia generally, should feel very proud of the way in which the international visitor arrivals have responded so sharply following the events of last year.

NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",53
95,Mr SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Minister for Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories to pursue the effective integration of economic and environmental decisions. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",54
96,Mr CHANEY,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"The Opposition's view that this is a matter of public importance is borne out by the final answer given by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to the question which I asked her just a few minutes ago. In a merciful change of gear she acknowledged the importance of bringing together environmental and economic considerations. That is the very strong view of the Opposition which seems to have very strong support from some parts of the Government. I sat last night and listened to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) making his maiden speech. I heard him make a series of complaints or expressions of concern about the state of our institutions, our political parties, the Parliament and so on. I must say that in the brief time. I have been in the House of Representatives I have been struck by the fact that part of the contempt and dissatisfaction which I think is so evident in the community today must flow from the evident removal from the realities of Australia of much of the debate which takes place in this chamber. It is nowhere more evident than in the utterances of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who talks about Australia as though it was some foreign country. Certainly it bears no relation to the Australia that my constituents know and are suffering in at the moment. I do not think that any debate should take place in this chamber without us trying to remember just what the position in Australia really is. We happen to be a country which faces a crisis. In fact, we face a multiple crisis. The one issue which perhaps gets more attention in this chamber is the crisis in the our economy. Debt is ballooning throughout a good economic period, a period of high commodity prices when traditionally we do well; interest rates are bearing down on middle Australia and the supposed constituency of honourable members opposite; there are lower real wages; and now, of course, the prospect of the juggernaut of unemployment that I think is upon us. For Labor's betrayed constituency I have absolutely no doubt that they expect every debate here to take place in the context of that part of Australia's crisis. There is another area of crisis, and that is the environment. I do not think that any Australian who has looked at the position with respect to our soil and water quality, our record in losing species of plants and animals, and the uncertainties that are involved in global atmospheric change can be satisfied with the status quo. Nobody could want other than to be part of a country that is tackling that crisis in a serious and wholehearted way. I am delighted that the Minister in her response to my third question today accepted that the marrying of our concerns about the environment and about the economy is what we are required to do. We have to be able to cope with more than one issue in this country. Our complaint about the Minister at the table who is about to respond is that she has shown no sign of being able to do that, to cope with more than one issue. I do not solely level that accusation at Minister Kelly because I think that Minister Griffiths also at times has committed acts which are quite contrary to his senior Minister, Minister Kerin, who has, it seems-at least in his public utterances-tried to marry these two concerns in a more effective way. The trucks around this building at the moment which, at least for a short time, blocked our entry to this building are, in my view, just a manifestation of the enormous frustration in the community about the unreliability of the decision-making process in this Government, and most of all about the concern in the community that decisions are made not in the national interest, not in the community interest, but in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. Plenty of commentators say of this Minister that the decisions or the actions are taken· in her interest rather than in the interest of the portfolio, the name of which seems to have such a significant influence on the way she feels she has to behave as a Minister. What is this Government's supposed objective? The Government's supposed objective is ecologically sustainable development. We were told very clearly when the Government issued its discussion paper that the Government's objective was also economic growth. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made it clear that their policies were for ecologically sustainable development and that was also based on the fact that there was a continued need for growth. There is really a great breadth of opinion which expresses the view that we should be able to twin these concerns in an effective way. I was particularly struck by the contribution of the Commission for the Future to this important debate on sustainable development. In the first column of the first page of the paper which was written by Lyuba Zarsky and which I think is widely recognised as a high quality contribution to this discussion, she said: In Australia, a national strategy of sustainable development faces two challenges. First, we must restructure the domestic economy to restore ance in external payments. To first stabilise and then reduce our foreign debt, we must get better at producing and marketing high value products and services both overseas and at home. Mr Deputy Speaker, that comment is not some right wing or Tory shibboleth. It is a view expressed by the Commission for the Future with, in my view, perfect accuracy. The second concern that Ms Zarsky expresses is this: The second challenge is to reverse the deterioration of our national and global environment. Land degradation, loss of species, increased cancer rates and climate change are only a few of the symptoms of widespread ecological distress. Our health and livelihood, as well as that of future generations, hang in the balance. I respectfully adopt those views as being sensible and matters that all honourable me-bers i- this place should be directing theIr attentIon to. A fundamental requirement of the course of action proposed by the Government is that all interested parties work together. I refer to what the Minister herself has said about this matter. In passing judgment upon her, we need do no more than go to the statements of her own Government as to its purpose. In concert with the Minister for Primary - n.dust-ies and Energy (Mr Kerin), the. MIntster Issued the Government's discussion paper on ecologically sustainable development. That discussion paper contains statements which I think would have the warm support of the Opposition. In that joint statement, which was issued on 25 June 1990, the Minister, with her colleague, said this: This exercise is about better integration of economic and environmental decisions. In the long - er-,. econom-c developn:tent is sustainable only If It IS ecologICally sustamable. Too often a dichotomy has been unnecessarily drawn between economy and ecology. Through the effective integration of economic and environmental decisions Australia will be in a better position to achieve both economic growth and environmental protection. What is evident from the recent contributions of this Minister, and not least from her speech to the Fabian Society in New South Wales, is not a concern for that grand purpose, not a concern for the national interest, but, as I said before, a bal- concern for the politics of the environment, a concern for the politics of the environment as it affects the Labor Party and, it is said by many commentators, a concern for her own reputation as an environment Minister. I invite honourable members to look at the context in which the Minister mounted her attack on the very people that the Prime Minister was seeking to encourage to participate in the debate on ecologically sustainable development. When we examine the actions of this Minister, we must remember that her comments to the Fabian Society of New South Wales were made within two days of her Prime Minister trying to bring the warring parties together to achieve the dialogue which she and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy were allegedly committed to. As well, there is the view of the Prime Minister, which he reaffirmed here today. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have been at pains to try to assuage the concerns of the mining industry about the Government's administration of the environment policy prior to the election. The Prime Minister virtually apologised to the mining industry at the dinner that he addressed last May. He made the point, and I use his words: I readily acknowledge that the mining industries are entitled to a greater degree of certainty in relation to access to potential mineral deposits than they have received to date. Earlier in that speech the Prime Minister said-and I quoted his comments in Question Time today and he reaffirmed them: Let me say that, judging from its discussions members of my Government, AMIC is responsive to the higher environmental standards nowadays expected of the mining industries. I readily acknowledge that and am greatly encouraged by it. This follows, of course, what was said by Minister Kerin. Indeed, the Minister made a speech on the same day in which he also paid tribute to the changes which had occurred. He made the point: There are ... those who maintain that environmental protection and economic development are fundamentally contradictory and who call for negative economic growth as the only path to ecological survival. He said: That's acceptable if you happen to be fabulously wealthy, landed and indifferent to the fate and future of those who are not. He went on to say, and I think this is really important because it goes to the reasons why we must continue to promote economic change and development in this country and, indeed, around the world: That's not acceptable if you just happen to be a subsistence peasant in the Third World, a bonded labourer without access to clean drinking water or fuel wood or proper housing or health care or clothing, an unemployed factory hand in the suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney. This is the context. The other item of context that I think is important to note is the open criticism that was being voiced of this Minister in late July and early August through to mid-August by representatives of the environmental movement who are concerned about this Minister not beil,lg tough enough. On an issue of absolutely central core national interest, what has this Minister set out to do? To solve the problem or to create a position for herself? What we found in her address to the Fabian Society was a series of statements in which she attacked both the forestry industry and the mining industry in terms which were completely contrary to the views which have been expressed by her Government through both its Prime Minister and her brother Minister in the primary industry area. The Minister referred to this old mentality-the fact that their views were as with out of date as 1972 election policies; the fact that they had a view that they could mine whatever they liked for however long they wanted. She went on about the forest industry: Ecologically sustainable development to NAFI seems to mean little more than attempting to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act in ways which would ensure the industry interests would outweigh heritage concern. Their plan seems to be one of unrestrained development. Again, let us make our judgment about the operation of the Government in this portfolio, the name of which is so significant in determining the stance the Minister has to take on a particular issue. As reported on AM: Last night Mrs Kelly set out to prove that she is tough. I say that it is not the role of any Minister in Australia's present state of crisis to prove that he or she is tough. It is not the role of any Minister to play the party political games that we have been seeing in every area of government activity over recent weeks and months. It is the role of this Minister and other Ministers to address the national interest in a way which is clearly perceived not only in this place but by the people of Australia. I say again that the people who are driving those trucks, the trade unionists picketing this place who sought. to stop my car this morning, are here because they do not trust the motives or the methods of action of this Government in this field and other fields. I simply say that, in those circumstances, this Government really is to be condemned. We have the same pattern, whether it is the south-east forests, the Barrier Reef, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions or national pollution standards: the permanent search for a position and never the permanent search for a solution. Yet the latter is surely what we should be requiring of this Minister and this Government. The test is not whether the Minister can demonstrate that she is as tough as Richardson. The test is not to make the mistakes that were made in the decision with respect to Coronation Hill where, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's assurance and Senator Richardson's assurance, the rug was pulled for political reasons. Now we have an inquiry, and who knows what lies at the end of that inquiry. It is time for the national in terest to be predominant, and that is precisely why we bring forward this matter of public importance. When Labor members opposite see the plight of small business, of householders and of the people in their constituencies over the coming year, I hope they will make their judgments of the Ministers who have played politics with the issues which will make the difference in this country.",54
97,Mrs KELLY,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (3.09)-First of all, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) for at last coming out and making some statement on the environment. For the last six months he has been in a cocoon. We have heard no comments at all from him on any issue related to the environment. Although obviously I do not agree with many of the things he said about me, I do agree with a lot of the points he raised earlier about the need to debate these issues. They are fundamental issues and, of course, there are many different views in the community. I recently heard some other views put on this issue from his own colleague, the honourable member for .Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I want to repeat some of those because they do illustrate the different views that are around in the community and why as environment Minister it was important that I give a speech on ecologically sustainable development and define it from an ecological point of view, and that is what I attempted to do. Mr Tim Fischer-It was over the top.",57
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,Order! The previous speaker was heard in· silence. The Minister should be heard in silence.,57
99,Mrs KELLY,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"If we are talking about over the top, let me give the Opposition some quotes from a colleague of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). The honourable member for Barker last week made a speech at a conference at Murray Bridge. Is this balance in the environment debate? He said: We should do the development first and then solve the problems. Is that ecologically sustainable development? He continued: We can go on appeasing themthat is, the conservationistsbut in the end we say we have gone far enough. The honourable member for Barker said that Federal and State governments had been 'too reactive' to the greenie thrust. He continued: I think we know where to go now. It's development rather than holding things in their pristine state. We really ought to be saying we haven't started finding what's underneath the ground here. Is that the approach that the Opposition wants to take? I hope not. But a view that does prevail in some sections of the community is that we forge ahead with development. I see a sort of look of amazement on the faces of many members of the Opposition. The reality is, as many members of the Opposition would agree-I am sure that the honourable member for Pearce would agree with this-that many people do have that perspective put by the honourable member for Barker. They say, 'We have development first and then we solve the problems'. That is not the approach that this Government believes is the way to solve the difficult conflicts that arise in the environment and in getting the right balance with economic development. The honourable member for Barker further said: Conservation . . . had been in the hands of very powerful urban conservation commandos who used scare tactics to coerce support. Is this the attitude that prevails in the Opposition? Is this a conciliatory approach to dealing with environmental issues? Of course, this statement is from a man who said on an ABC morning radio show on 24 November 1989, when asked if he would like to be environment Minister, 'That would be fabulous. It would be wonderful. I could not imagine anything better'. Let us hope that the view of the honourable member for Barker does not prevail in the Opposition. Unfortunately, it is a view that is reflected in some sections of the community. What I was attempting to do in the speech I gave on ecologically sustainable development was to put it into perspective. Many statements have been made along the lines of that made by the honourable member for Barker, and what I needed to do was to explain what ecologically sustainable development was all about. I think that that is critical to this debate before the House today. Governments for the first time, not only in this country but in the world, are starting to get this process right. We are attempting for the first time to take the environment very seriously by integrating it with economic development. It is not a case of one or the other. Ecologically sustainable development is about integrating the environment and economic development into a process. The Government has already set the stage for that process, and it is going to be a participatory one. I hope it also involves the participation of the Opposition because I believe that the other players will all participate-that is, the industry, the States and the non-government organisations. The Government believes that this process has got to be taken seriously. In December 1989 Cabinet agreed to a general approach for developing an ecologically sustainable development strategy for the major industry sectors in Australia. Do Opposition members actually support that process? I have not heard any constructive comments in relation to that. I would really like the Opposition to be part of that process as well. As a result of that agreement the Commonwealth prepared a discussion paper; which was released and distributed in June 1990. That is several months ago, and we have not heard any constructive comments from the Opposition in relation to it. The discussion paper was open to the community for scrutiny and comment. This paper, along with many other comments, will now go to the nine industry committees that will be established. Working groups are being set up for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining, manufacturing, energy production, energy use, transport and tourism. As I said, everyone in the community, from the industry to the State government to non-government organisations, will be part of that process. It is important that the Opposition starts to develop some views about it. There will be Chairs of each of these committees and final reports will be presented by October 1991. The reason I am outlining those procedures is to explain to the Opposition that the Government is taking very seriously the question of the integration of the environment into the economy; as I said, not one or the other, but both. Instead of just talking about it, the Opposition should .do something. Of course there are different views. I have expressed the environmental point of view. I am surprised that the honourable member for Pearce is so astounded at that. Some of my colleagues have expressed slightly different views, but that is to be expected. In the community there are all sorts of views about this issue. We are trying to pull that process together. I would hope that the honourable member for Pearce would become involved in that process. This is probably the most fundamental issue that we have to address, not just as a Parliament but also as a country. We cannot continue having battles consistently with environmentalists in one corner and developers in another. As I said in the speech to which I referred, many members of the industry community understand that the environmental issues will not go away. One only has to visit any school in one's electorate and speak to the kids to be aware that the issues will not go away. What has to happen is that a process must be developed for dealing with these fundamental issues which are critical to conservation. Also, we should not run away from economic development. It is not one or the other. This is a critical debate which the community and the Parliament must face. In a sense the spirit in which the member for Pearce brought forward this issue is a turning point for this Parliament. It is probably the first time that a major environmental issue has been raised in this House. One of the principal problems has been that the spokespeople for the environment have not been in the House of Representatives. It is important that in the people's House honourable members should have the opportunity to discuss these issues of fundamental concern. Frankly, I believe that we should be able to agree on many of these issues. For example, the greenhouse and the ozone layer should be issues on which members of this Parliament should be able to work together. I have quoted the remarks of the honourable member for Barker. I assume that similar views are held by some members on my side of the House. I am saying that particularly to point out to honourable members opposite that there are many different perspectives. What has to be done is that we must work through a process for resolving those issues. That is what this Government is about and that is what the ecologically sustainable development process is all about. There must be guiding principles. It is the Government's job to set those guiding principles. I propose to outline for honourable members opposite what I believe those guiding principles should be. I hope that will provide the basis for further debate in the future in the House of Representatives. The Chairs have been asked by the Prime Minister that their deliberations be guided by four fundamental goals to which the Government is committed. The first is the improvement of individual and community well-being and welfare by following a path of economic progress that does not hinder the welfare of future generations. That is a most important principle. The second is the provision of equity within and between generations. The third is the recognition of the global dimensions of the issue; and the fourth, the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. The Prime Minister also has noted that achievement of those principles will involve consideration of the following points: increased efficiency of resource use and reduced waste production; management and utilisation practices which improve the resilience of natural resource systems; dealing cau-' tiously with risk and irreversibility; and integration of environmental and social considerations into economic decision making, including ensuring that environmental assets are appropriately valued. Of course, as well as those principles, lots of people around this House and the community have different views. So it is going to be up to each of these nine committees to resolve these differences and to get those processes right. Though the honourable member for Pearce chose to highlight some aspects of that in his speech, I think if he actually looked at what I said in totality he would agree that I raised some very good points. I outlined what I thought business' would need to do to be ecologically sustainable, and I would like to outline some of those points today. Again, this is an important part of getting this debate on ecological sustainability out into the broader community. It should be about making long-term decisions that ensure that business lives off nature's interest and not just its capicontext tal; actively developing, using and sharing environmentally appropriate technologies; using natural resources in a socially efficient manner and for environmentally appropriate technologies; conserving and sustainably using common property resources such as water and the atmosphere; and monitoring and auditing environmental practices of businesses. Why have we opted for this process? I think it is clear that there has been a lot of conflict in these areas over the last years-and we can see evidence of that today, as the honourable member said. But in arriving at the right conclusion concerning the future of this country, one cannot just take the sort of perspective that the honourable member for Barker outlined. One cannot just say, 'Look, develop first and ask questions second'. That is not good enough any more. In my speech I was trying to outline the point that that view has prevailed in the past. I acknowledge that many companies are changing their perspectives-in my view, many of them are not doing it fast enough. Therefore, I have to be a. catalyst in order to get that change moving. I think that is a very legitimate role for an environment Minister and, I think, also for a shadow environment Minister. We have a long way to go in educating our community but we have to do it. Debates such as this in the House of Representatives add to that and we should have more of them. This process is about getting these committees together, involving all levels of government-State and Federal-and dealing with industry and the non-government organisations. They have not all said that they will come into the process, but I feel quite confident that they will because I think they realise that they have a lot to gain from it. But the people who really have a lot to gain from it are the future generations of this country. The Government has a responsibility to get the balance right and, I suppose, to forget about those extreme positions. One tries to forget about them, but they still exist and so, every now and again, I think that Ministers responsible for the environment need to put it into a to explain what they are trying to achieve because it is a new dimension for many people to try to cope with. I find that it is very much a generational thing because many of the older generation have never really had to focus on this issue. But let me tell honourable members, the kids do, and that is why it will not only be a major issue in the 1990s but also into the next century. So this process of ecological sustainability has to be right. Therefore, I welcome the opfew portunity to raise this issue in the House of Representatives. I hope it will not be the last debate on this issue and I welcome the entry of the honourable member for Pearce into this debate. I think there are many issues that we can work through together because I think both of us have a job to do in educating many members of the community, including a few other members of this Parliament.",57
100,Mr TIM FISCHER,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"ln response to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), let me say, at the outset, that the coalition is examining the sustainable development issue. The Minister in her response tried to justify all that she has done and all that she has been about over the last five months. I want to begin by recounting to the House a quote from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who might be described as a 'great grey godfather' in this general policy area of the Government, as he sits back and watches the junior Ministers go about their business yapping at each other's heels. Minister Kerin said: I think the Government should govern and take decisions and not just appeal to one side or the other or just act as champions for one cause or the other, but I am obviously wrong. He was perhaps referring to the national interest ahead of some of the more sectional aspects that this Minister has chosen to highlight in recent times. Australia is at the start of a new decade; Australia is very much at the economic crossroads as the Budget session in 1990 develops. What is required is systematic sensible decision-making, which is required in the national interest and which obviously takes account of the environment but which does not ignore the economic agenda. However, what we have instead is a Government which is approaching its decision-making on almost a two-tiered basis. We have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) sitting almost detached on the admiral's bridge on the SS Titanic, away from the action, just riding towards the icebergs. The Government is on .that budgetary course which I spoke about in the House last night, when I described the Govern-ent as adopting a policy of steady as she smks as the Government sails forth. That is at one level. Then downstairs, one has the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment Tourism and Territories and the Ministe; for - esources (Mr Griffith) slugging it out, fightmg over the actual rudder control. At the same time, way over in the sunset, one must not forget the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) who has his hand on the engine control. This mixed-bag approach of the Government is a recipe for disaster. Let me crystallise the charges that the National Party lodges in developing the attack which flowed from the excellent questions put by the shadow Minister for the environment to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories during Question Time earlier today. Charge No. I-and it is a very clear-cut charge-relates t& the attack on 29 August by the Minister on the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC). It is not unreasonable to expect that the Minister might have some critical comments in this area. However, I invite the House to consider the exact comments the Minister made on 29 August in respect of AMIC. He said: AMIC's idea of a sustainable industry is one in which miners can mine where they like, for however long they want. It is about, for them sustaining profits and increasing access to of Australia they feel could be mineraliy profitable even if it is of environmental or cultural significance. . Using those words, the Minister did great damage to the national interest in terms of getting sensible progress down this difficult policy decision-making path. I accept it is a very difficult area in which to get it right. However, there she was launching an attack against a particular body which, in the words of the Prime Minister and others, has made great strides to recognise the correct way forward to provide economic drive for this country, and to do so within all the relevant parameters. So that is charge No.1: that the Minister went over the top with regard to her attack on a respectable and professional body, although it is a body that I do not always agree with. Indeed, I had some quite interesting words with some members of AMIC last night over the conduct of certain business cowboys who are not members of AMIC. - ll I. can say is that in 1990, Ned Kelly IS ahve and well: he comes with a white collar and quite often a management fee, and he should be .exposed, dealt with and where appropriate, sent to gaol. Then wmight get some more public confidence in a lot of the institutions of this country. Having got that off my chest, let me move on to charge No.2 with regard to the Minister. Charge No.2 is that on 29 August the Minister launched an attack on the National Association of Forest Industries (NAFI) and that that attack also went right ov-r. the top. It was unacceptable for a Mmister of the Crown to describe NAFI in these terms-and I quote exactly what she said: Another umbrella group that has amazed me with its short-sightedness is the National Association of Forest Industries, or NAFI. Ecologically sustainable development to NAFI seems to mean little more than attempting to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act in ways which would ensure that industry interests would outweigh heritage concerns. Their plan seems to. be one of unrestrained development. Never mmd about the sustainability or the ecological aspects of the concept. How out of touch is the Minister to insult the truck drivers and others who are all 'parts around Parliament House today-the thousands involved in a $10 billion industry, which is maintaining the standard of living of all Australians and whose plans the Minister describes as seeming to be one of unrestrained development? The forest industry has moved many hundreds of kilometres, in a figurative sense, to be responsible, to be sensible, to make adjustments to the situation and the additional scientific knowledge that we have in the nineties. I warn the Minister that the industry is not going to be prepared to lie down when it comes to constant lack of decision-making by this Federal Government. That leads me on to charge No.3, which arises from the Minister's comments right here in this House this day that, of course, she is exonerated for her comments and her conduct in recent times because, after all, her portfolio is that of the environment. I do not care if I am the shadow Minister for resources or the honourable member for Canberra is the Minister for the environment; surely she is here in the national Parliament, in the House of Representatives-the people's House, as she says-to act in the national interest, to arrive at decisions which are in the national interest, and not to proceed down a path of a very narrow definition of portfolio constituency which is the way in which, perhaps, the Government is cunningly trying to run things. The plethora of headlines includes: Kelly and Griffiths in row over secret logging Griffiths and Kelly at loggerheads again That is the Minister's trouble, of course; editors love that phraseology. To continue: Labor's each-way bet on the environment . Kelly vows to fight . . . Hawke calls summit as Greens threaten to quit Govt divided over reef oil exploration plans Drilling near reef possible: Griffiths Barrier Reef will not be endangered: PM I could go right down the list of other headlines I have on display on this side of the House. But I want to move on to charge No.4, which I think is the most serious of them all. The charge is that, as a consequence of all that this Government has been about, we have had massive delays in the proper decision-making and governance of this country with regard to this policy area. As proof positive of that-honourable members need not look to this side of the House-I remind the chamber of a question asked by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) yesterday. He asked how long these people in the southeast forests and elsewhere will have to wait before we get a clear-cut and sensible decision out of this Government? As my colleague the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), said, these delays have caused untold damage and placed in doubt confidence in the decision-making process of the Government and cost hundreds of jobs along the path at a time when jobs are becoming very precious indeed. I do not think this Cabinet-perhaps because of the preparations for the Budget session or for other reasons---'has got around Australia to the extent necessary to ascertain the extent of economic agony unfolding across Australia. I point out to the Minister that jobs are short. A hundred people were laid off in Albury-Wodonga yesterday at a factory of BTR Nylex Ltd. I can give many other instances and there are reasons for that. Delayed decision making is one of those key reasons and that is why we present a fourth charge deal against the Minister in terms of this matter of public importance. It is not good enough that the Government is scrambling the eggs in respect of uranium mining. It cannot even make a decision in that respect, even though the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and, seemingly, Labor Secretary Hogg want to see that put on the agenda. That could earn another billion dollars which could help the standard of living of all Australians. I say to the House: this Minister for the environment runs the damage of being seen as one who is all about a cottage economy with candle power by the end of this decade, rather than a sensible and balanced economy, a dynamic economy, which does relate to the environment in a constructive way. The Minister has a great deal to answer for-her incompet-nt handling of this portfolio, her lack of dnve and cohesive determination. It is her modus operandi which we object to most in terms of wrestling with what are quite complicated issues.",60
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,63
102,Mr BEVIS,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"It is quite appropriate, I suppose, that a matter of public importance that has been I!l-ved on a first occasion by the shadow Mmlster for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), should be responded to by me as the first matter of public importance tha- I h-ve had the opportunity to address m thIS place as well. It is something of a pity that the qPposition has not taken the opportumty presented today by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tour.ism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to consIder this matter in a more rational and tempered way, a way which would be to the benefit of Australian citizens and, importantly, to the future generations - h-t will inherit the proceeds of the pohcles .we determine in this place on these very Important issues <?f balancing the 9ifficult questions of envIronmental protectIOn and economic development. In presenting their case today the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), have endeavoured to - la-e great weight on a speech by the Mmlster on 29 August. It is important to put into the record other parts of that speech which have been conveniently omitted by those opposite in pursuing their case. If they had bothered to peruse the document a page or two further, they.would have come across the paragraph WhICh reads: It would be wrong to suggest that all businesses have not been willing to respond to change. I have been heartened to see many innovative and positive ideas put forward at recent roundtables I have been conducting on such issues as waste minimisation. Many of these ideas have come from industry representatives who are involved in the day to day runnin- of - rganisati-ns. They do not bring the dogmatIc attItu-e- which co-e from some of the industry assocIatIOns of which they are members. Many of them particularly from international companies know that adaptation is taking place much more rapidly overseas. It is clear that the Minister's statements were in fact an important contribution to the debate on what is a critical issue. It is a critical issue to people in Queensland and it is a pleasure for me to be able to address this matter today as a Queensland member of the Hawke Government. If we want to turn to the proceeds and end results of the sorts of policies that those opposite have inflicted on the people of this country we need go no further than the policies which were advanced, introduced and implemented by the Queensland Government. Those opposite need not just point the finger at the Natio-al - arty of Austra-is because prior to then dIfferences of opmion the record of the coalition government was no better. The Queensland National Party, and the coalition before it had an attitude to ecologically sustainable development which is possibly best summed up by the doyen of Queensland conservative politics, Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The then Premier said only three years ago on an American ABC Today program extolling Queensland's potential for development, 'You can - o so much with a bulldozer'. That was hIS approach to environmentally ecologically sustainable development: put the bulldozers in and ask the questions later. I would have thought that today in this place there was a far more enlightened attitude amongst those opposite. At one point in the debate I thought that may have come through. Alas , it was not to be. I suppose .. when shackled with National Party mterests It is inevitable that these questions will arise. I was moved by the commitment which both the honourable member for Pearce and the honourable member for Farrer exhibited for the environmental movement and of course, the rights of the unionists butside the Parliament today. I had not noticed this new-found commitment to trade union rights on other occasions and it will, no doubt, be tested when the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, presently before the Senate, enters this House. It will be interesting to see what contribution will be made by some of those oppositeparticularly those on the front bench who have been and are active in the H.R. Nicholls Society-to the commitment to trade union rights and concern for workers. It will be put to the test well and truly. The last two decades have seen a massive change in the conservation debate in this country. It is no longer a debate about maintenance of the status quo. Conservative politicians in Australia have traditionally had some difficulty coming to grips with conservation and its demands for change. It is now not a debate about keeping things as they were but a debate about changing the way in which we operate to ensure that our environment is retained in a suitable way for the generations to come. That concept of dynamic change has always been difficult for conservative parties to come to grips with. It is made more difficult for those opposite when they have to grapple with their own consciences on the question of States rights. It is no accident that in this place only the Labor Party, with progressive policies and a dynamic approach to social and economic change, has been able to address this issue in a constructive way. In this debate I would like to make some comment about the situation in Queensland because I think there we find some clear examples of the way ahead and, as I mentioned before, some of the sins of the past. At present the Federal Government and the new Queensland Government have embarked upon a program to make an assessment of the Cape York area and to consider what developments should proceed there. I had the opportunity in recent weeks as a member of a committee to visit that area and to see at first hand, if only from an aeroplane, the unique beauty of that area. There is no doubt that it is one of the few remaining genuine wilderness areas of our nation. The protection of the environment of Cape York is likely to be one of the most significant environmental issues we face in the early part of this decade. The natural and cultural values of Cape York, including the wilderness rainforests, the areas of nature conservation and Aboriginal cultural sites, present genuine matters of concern that must be balanced against the planned economic development in the area. Together the Federal Government and the Queensland Government have embarked upon a process of investigation of the situation, the development of a plan to properly maintain the area and an ongoing monitoring process to ensure the maintenance of that area and to provide useful data for future ventures. The preparation of that joint activity enhances the relationship between the governments and the various interested parties that are involved in the debate. As the process is developed and streamlined I am confident that its benefits will become evident to all Australians. The emotional and ill-informed debate which has scarred many environmental issues in the past will be replaced by a constructive decision making process, a process established by this Government under the guidance of this Minister. It is nonsense for those opposite to criticise on this point when their own record is so abysmally poor. The process we have embarked upon brings the conflicting interests of the conservation movement, the mining interests, forestry and development bodies together to work through an established procedure to find sensible solutions. As is the case in other areas it would appear that those opposite are intent on the politics of confrontation and conflict. Again, this is a type of operation commonly known to us in Queensland after many years of National Party government. They look to the divide and rule, the crash or crash through processes. As with so many things they look for the quick fix. The people of Australia know that there are no quick fixes in addressing the competing forces in this debate on ecologically sustainable development. Moreover, they know that this Government's programs and procedures undertaken in consultation with State governments and relevant interest groups are the only mature and civilised processes that will resolve the complex questions confronting us. The Opposition's matter of public importance today is a poor attempt to score short-term political points, timed to coincide with the loggers' protest outside Parliament House this week. It has failed in that effort, just as it has failed to meet the community's expectations of addressing sustainable development for the future good of all Australians and our nation. The process that this Government has established will ensure that environmental protection and economic progress are complementary rather than antagonistic processes. The new economics of ecologically sustainable development require confronting the difficult job of pricing environmental values, the protection to human health and natural ecosystems provided by the ozone layer, water purification questions-",63
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The time for the discussion has concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",65
104,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to remove section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which exempts from the operation of the Act discrimination in superannuation on the ground of sex or marital status, and to insert a number of more limited exemptions dealing with superannuation practices and prohibit discrimination by persons conferring dependant superannuation benefits. As section 41 also provides an exemption in regard to the terms on which insurance may be offered, the amendments have necessitated that the insurance exemption be rewritten and reinserted. The process which has led to the Bill dates back to the preparation of a report by the Human Rights Commission titled Superannuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Part 1-Superannuation. That report was prepared in response to a request by the then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, and was tabled in Parliament on 25 November 1986. The report was considered by the Government and the Government decided to remove the exemption and to insert into the Act certain more limited exemptions for particular practices in superannuation. Following the Government's decision, consultations on the proposed exemptions were held with the superannuation industry, employer groups, State and Territory governments and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government, as indicated in its National Agenda for Women, is committed to the objective of removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. The major effect of the Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain 'non-discriminatory superannuation benefits'. The proposed continuing exemptions, shortly stated, deal with the following areas: the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon reasonable actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to reply; the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single, that is, members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse or to members who do not have a child; and the possibly discriminatory effect of current vesting, ervation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions. The introd-ction of the Bill was initially delayed pending the reappraisal by the Government of a proposed exemption which would have allowed funds to confine the provision of superannuation benefits to permanent and full time employees. In January 1989 the Government decided not to proceed with this exemption. Following that decision a further round of consultations on the issue was held with the superannuation industry, peak employer bodies, State governments and the National Women's Consultative Council. The Bill was first introduced on 11 May 1989 but lapsed when elections were called for March. It has since been amended by the deletion of proposed section 41 c, which would have permitted the remaining superannuation exemptions, that is, sections 41A and 41B, to be repealed by regulation. This provision, which was opposed by the Opposition, was not considered essential to the Bill. I turn now to a brief description of the proposed limited exemptions to be inserted in the Act. Because, statistically, women live longer than men, the actuarial exemption covers the resulting difference in costs of providing a pension for women. Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided via insurance, this exemption is interlinked with the insurance exemption. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is currently preparing a report on the exemption of insurance from the Sex Discrimination Act. The need for the actuarial exemption for superannuation will be reviewed in light of the Commission's recommendations concerning the insurance exemption. The exemption for dependant superannuation benefits is designed to allow schemes to continue current practices, whereby upon a member's death or disability no benefits are payable to a member preswho does not have a spouse or children. In the absence of this kind of exemption it may have been possible for a member who was single to succeed in a complaint of marital status discrimination. There are a number of reasons for maintaining this exemption. As the former Human Rights Commission noted in its report, the exemption reflects the community's attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse or who have children in the event of the death, or physical or mental incapacity of the members of superannuation funds. As was noted by the Commission; to provide benefits to all dependants of members on proof of financial dependency would create difficulties both in administration and in finding a suitable objective test of 'dependency'. In regard to the exemptions dealing with vesting, preservation and portability, the issue of discrimination arises because there is evidence that women statistically· do not remain in continuous employment for the same length of time as men. Matters such as vesting, preservation and portability fall within the area of the operating standards for superannuation funds administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose a number of operating standards with which superannuation funds must comply in order to be eligible for taxation concessions. I am advised that current vesting standards require a superannuation fund to vest in full in a member all benefits arising from contributions made by the member and earnings thereon. The effect of this is that all member-financed benefits are fully vested. The vesting standards also require a superannuation fund to vest in full in an employee all employer-financed benefits arising from contributions made in accordance with an industrial agreement or award-namely, award based superannuation. The preservation standards which restances quire benefits to be preserved generally until retirement at or after the age of 55 apply to the following benefits, except amounts less than $500: any vested emdeath ployer-financed benefits arising from ployer contributions made in accordance with an agreement or award-that is, award based superannuation; any new or improved vested employer-financed beneexpectations fits arising from any arrangements entered into after 21 December 1986; and memenable ber-financed benefits arising from contriwish butions where the member does not ments receive support through employer contrivide butions in that fund. The preservation standards do not tend to vested employer-financed benefits flowing from ongoing superannuation rangements which were in place prior 22 December 1986. Under the announcement made in the 1989 Budget, in addition to the existing vesting and preservation standards, all employer-financed benefits accruing from 1 July 1995, other than those already renon-discriminatory quired to be vested under existing standnecessary ards, will be subject to a minimum year vesting scale; and from 1 July 1995, an amount equal to the level of all ployer-financed benefits that are required to be vested under the new vesting standbenefits ards will also be required to until retirement at or after age 55. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission is engaged in the process of consulting with the superannuation induspated try, employers and unions for the purbe poses of the detailed implementation these improved vesting and preservation standards. The Bill also provides in clause section 14 of the principal Act will be amended to make it unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation the payment of a dependant superannuato tion benefit, for a member of a superanmer nuation fund to which the provisions 41A of the Bill apply, to discriminate the grounds of sex or marital status. purpose of this provision is to ensure trustees, when deciding who should retrustees ceive such benefits, consider the circumbe of all the potential beneficiaries rather than make their decision purely on the basis of a person's marital status. For for example, it will not be lawful to pay a benefit to a current de facto spouse empurely because of a fund policy to always pay such benefits to the current spouse. I now turn to the provisions of the Bill which are designed to protect the existing of members in superannuation schemes. Proposed section 41 B will schemes whi'ch cannot or do not to comply with the new requireof section 41A to continue to probenefits for existing members, providing that members of these funds exhave the option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. The Huarman Rights and Equal Opportunity to Commission may, however, grant an exemption from this requirement pursuant to section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This will enable trustees or employers to apply for an exemption where it is clear that it would not be beneficial for members to join new schemes or obtain benefits. It will not be that members actually be of10fered the opportunity to join a new scheme, as it will be sufficient, for the empurposes of the option, that existing members be offered the option to obtain which would comply with probe preserved posed section 41 A. The proposals put forward in this Bill should not have an impact upon government expenditure. However, it is anticithat Commonwealth schemes will amended in separate legislation to of comply with the Act by the time of the commencement of the amending Act. These changes may have some effect on 4 that Commonwealth expenditure. Superannuation is a very technical area of the law and the issues of discriminato tion which may arise may vary from case case and industry to industry. The forAttorney-General wrote to the Sex . of Discrimination Commissioner requesting on that guidelines be published on issues The which have not been specifically adthat dressed in these amendments. Where or employers feel that they should exempted from a particular requirement of the Act they may apply to the Commission for an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Decisions by the Commission under section 44 are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Government believes that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the new amendments with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet improved their benefits to do so over the next two years, or to close off their membership. Further, the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part-time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve the opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement during their working lives. A large majority of part-time employees are women and it is clear that women tend to return from child rearing to part-time employment. Where part time employees are performing the same duties as their full time counterparts and the full time counterparts receive superannuation, it is likely that a court will find a failure to provide access to superannuation to such part time employees unlawfully discriminatory. These amendments should therefore be viewed in light of the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Arbitrated superannuation awards are providing increasing superannuation coverage. Not only will these amendments encourage this development and help Australia make appropriate provision for its ageing population, but also the benefits which will be offered will be fairer and more equitable and in line with the Government's commitments under the National Agenda for Women.

105,Mr WILLIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. It is introduced in conjunction with the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. The main purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the phasing out of the general statutory levy imposed in respect of division B waterside workers, which is, in part, used to finance cross-subsidy. arrangements for the smaller Australian ports-that is, those ports where division B waterside workers are employed. This levy is applied to meet attendance money, guaranteed wages and retainers and annual leave for employees in smaller, non-permanent ports. It also finances, for all ports, employers' retirement fund contributions, administration and port conciliator costs. The 'in-principle agreement' entered into with stevedoring employers and unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in October 1989 provides for the general levy to be discontinued in the smaller ports on a port-byport basis once new employment arrangements are effected. New section 9A is introduced into the Act to facilitate the phasing out. This section provides for the Minister to notify, by gazettal, a date in respect of each small, non-permanent port after which the general levy will cease to apply to employers in those ports. A date will be notified in respect of a port only when the Minister is satisfied that all employers at the port have revised their employment arrangements in line with the 'in-principle agreement'. Under a new provision contained in the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee will be empowered to make recommendations to the Minister as to when the general levy should cease to apply. ' The Act is to be amended so that all levy rates, both general and special, will be prescribed by regulation and will no longer be set out in the Act. As the general levy in respect of division B waterside workers is to be phased out, it is likely that levy rates will need to be adjusted on a regular basis to take account of the reduced cross-subsidy financing requirement. Financial Impact Statement There is no financial impact associated with this Bill for the reasons outlined in relation to the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990.

106,Mr WILLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill amends the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection 1977 to give statutory effect to the Govwill ernment's waterfront reform strategy. It introduced in conjunction with the edoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now outline the background to these Bills. Australia has been poorly served by its waterfront industry, with major costs for the rest the economy. This key point in the export ports. trading chain has been characterised by gross inefficiencies and high costs due to an absence of competition and competicilitating tiveness - tutory levy the collection of employer The Government determined that the true potential of our waterfront industry should be unlocked by a coherent strategy for reform. This is a task on which we are embarking vigorously. It is a major element of the Government's program of micro-economic reform. On 1 June 1989, following consultations on the conclusions of the Inter-State Commission's waterfront investigation, I announced, in my former capacity as Minister for Transport and Communications, a far-reaching reform strategy for the waterfront industry. The' strategy is designed to improve waterfront efficiency, reliability and productivity which will, in turn, assist our exporting sectors. Since then, the waterfront reform strategy has been consolidated. In October last year, a three year 'in-principle agreement' for waterfront reform was entered into with stevedoring employers, relevant unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The agreement resulted from negotiations with waterfront parties conducted under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which oversights the reform process. 1990 Fundamental to the reforms outlined in a the agreement is the shift from the present industry-wide employment practice to enterprise-based employment, and other new employment arrangements where appropriate. Under the new arrangements, employment responsibilities which have rested with the industry will be assumed by .individual employers, an arrangement more in line with the practice in other Act industries. These changed arrangements contribute to achieving a competitive is and productive waterfront industry with Stevimproved services to clients. This initiative is to be assisted by a work force rejuvenation program involving a one-off early retirement and redundancy scheme. In addition there will be a progressive phasing out of statute-based of arrangements for cross subsidies between The Bills, as a package, underpin the waterfront reform strategy: firstly, by fathrough the existing special stacontributions to the new retirement and redundancy scheme; and secondly, by providing for the phasing out over the reform period of cross-subsidy arrangements for smaller Australian ports which are currently financed by revenue raised under the general statutory levy. These smaller ports, sometimes referred to as non-permanent ports, are those which employ division B waterside workers, that is, 'waterside workers' who are employed by the industry and are available for engagement by stevedores on an 'as required' basis, rather than under the weekly hire arrangements which apply to the majority of the waterfront work force. The phasing out arrangement will involve payment of the general levy by a small port being discontinued when all employers in that port have moved to new employment arrangements, and a complementary phasing out of cross-subsidy payments. This will ensure that these ports are exposed to the competitive pressures· necessary to improve their efficiency. As this Bill contains a number of amendments of a minor nature which are explained in the explanatory memorandum, I will confine my comments to the more noteworthy amendments. Amendments to the Stevedoring Industry . Finance Committee Act 1977 The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is established by this Act to administer statutory levies imposed unper the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. It comprises a government appointed special chairperson, three representatives of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, and a representative each of the Australian National Line, the Broken Proprietary Co. Ltd and the Waterside Workers Federation. It is proposed that the membership the Committee be expanded to include an officer of the Department of Industrial Relations-which has administrative sponsibility for the legislation and is vol ved in the collection administration of the statutory levdancy ies-and a nominee of the Waterfront Inthefefore dustry Reform Authority. The functions of the Committee are to be expanded to enable it to make recombe mendations to the Minister as to the general levy should cease to apply to employers in smaller ports which have moved to enterprise-based employment or other new employment arrangements. Under provisions contained in the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990 the Minister for Industrial Relations will be able to discontinue the levy for the smaller ports to which I have referred. An amendment is proposed to enable the Committee to make payments directly to an employer for reimbursement of expenditure incurred in satisfying relevant award obligations. Current arrangements require that these payments be made only to the Association and therefore do not cover the situation where an employer decides to withdraw its membership from the Association. Under the new arrangements, these payments will continue to be made to individual employers or the Association in respect of employees in the smaller ports until such time as the Minister notifies, by gazettal, a finishing date for a port indicating that all employers in that port have moved to new employment arrangements. Clause 9 of the Bill provides the vehicle by which revenue collected through the levy is to be applied to the provision of prescribed benefits to eligible employees. The 'in-principle agreement' defines eligibility for the early retirement Hill and redundancy payments in terms of, amongst other things, employment by a member company of the Association of of Employers of Waterside Labour. However, should a stevedoring comrepany withdraw its membership from the inAssociation, its employees may no longer and be eligible for early retirement and redunpayments. A prescription power is proposed in clause 9 to provide for this and other exigencies. Moneys raised to meet redundancy obligations will paid to the Committee, to the associawhen tion or to individual employers. Amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977 The J3ill involves a change to the definition of 'local cargo' contained in this Act. Under current arrangements, cargoes shipped to oil rigs and other associated structures or vessels located above the continental shelf in Australia are levied at the higher special levy rate applied in respect of overseas cargoes. As these cargoes are not destined for overseas locations, it is clearly illogical and inequitable that they continue to be levied in this way. Amendments included in the Bill seek to rectify this small anomaly by including these cargoes in the definition of 'local cargo'. Penalties prescribed for offences against these Acts and regulations are to be increased for the first time since the Act came into effect in 1977. Financial Impact Statement The Bill does not involve a financial cost to the Commonwealth. Amendments to the definition of 'local cargo' will not affect the amount ultimately collected through the special levy to meet employer contributions to the early retirement and redundancy scheme. The levies will be in place no longer than is required to meet outgoings. Any financial impact will be positive as, due to amendments contained in clause 10, the Commonwealth will be able to recover expenses-including salaries and audit costs-incurred in its administration of the scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. NA BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown, and read a first time.

107,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to reform Australia's marine cargo liability legislation. The Bill will replace the Carriage of Goods Act 1924 for all contracts of carriage entered into once the proposed legislation comes into effect. However, the SeaCarriage of Goods Act 1924 will continue to operate in relation to contracts entered into prior to the commencement of the relevant parts of the Bill. Marine cargo liability legislation is concerned with legal responsibility for loss or damage occurring to seaborne cargo. Following representations from shippers, the Department of Transport and Communications conducted a review of Australia's arrangements in this area in consultation with shippers, shipowners and the insurance industry. A wide range of views were expressed as to where the balance of responsibility should lie between shippers and shipowners. However, broad industry support has been expressed for the approach now adopted in this Bill. The objectives of the Bill are to provide Australia with a marine cargo liability regime that is up to date, equitable and efficient; compatible with arrangements adopted by our major trading partners; and takes account of developments in this area within the United Nations. Australia's current marine cargo liability regime is, embodied in the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act. The Act is based on the 1924 International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading. This convention is more commonly known as the Hague Rules and is the base marine cargo liability regime generally included in national legislation currently in force in the world today. The main thrust of the Hague Rules is to limit the extent to which shipowners are liable for loss or damage to cargo while it is in their keeping. The circumstances for such liability are defined in the rules and an upper monetary limit is imposed on any claims made by cargo owners or shippers. The Hague Rules have been amended by two international protocols known as the Visby Protocol of 1968 and the SDR (Special Drawing Right) Protocol of 1979. These protocols update the Hague Rules by increasing the liability limit for owners, replacing the gold standard with the International Monetary Fund's modern currency unit-the special drawing right-and redefining the term 'package or unit' of cargo to take account of the modern use of containers in shipping. These protocols are gradually gaining acceptance among maritime trading tions. This Bill provides for the incorpotrade ration of the two protocols into Australian law. Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out the provisions of the Hague Rules as amended by the Visby and· SDR protocols. Ausment tralia will also formally accede to the protocols. Shippers have argued that a deficiency of the Hague Rules, which the protocols do not substantially alter, is that shippers bear the major burden of risk for loss or damage to seaborne cargo even though the shipowner has the duty of care cargo. As a result shippers generally have to make separate arrangements to fully insure their cargo against this risk. This criticism is addressed in the 1978 United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, commonly called the Hamtional burg Rules. The main feature of the Hamrestriction burg Rules is the transfer of the burden of liability from shipper to shipowner while the shipowner has care of the While his convention has been developed by the United Nations it is not yet in force internationally. To date 17 countries have acceded to the Hamburg Rules out of the 20 countries necessary to bring it into force. Few of the signatories are sigmend nificant maritime trading nations and far none of Australia's major trading partners have acceded. Nevertheless, the Government recognises the argument of the greater equity of the Hamburg Rules and the potential benefits for shippers that may accrue from a general international acceptance of the a first time. Hamburg Rules. Australia remains essentially a shipper nation and the Bill provides for the eventual replacement of the Hague-Visby-SDR regime with the burg Rules. The text of the Hamburg (4.15)-I move: Rules is set out in schedule 2 to the Bill. In view of the current international staship- tus of the Hamburg Rules, the Government does not at this stage propose to seek proclamation of those parts of the Bill dealing with implementation of this convention. Its inclusion in the Bill is a signal that Australia intends to accept the Hamburg Rules when their international standing is such that they can provide a viable basis for new cargo liability arnarangements for international seaborne between Australia and its trading partners. The decision to proclaim those parts of the Bill implementing the Hamburg Rules can be made by the governof the day in the light of this two convention's international acceptance, particularly by Australia's major trading partners, and by any further developments in the United Nations in relation to marine cargo liability arrangements. The Bill also provides for a minor consequential amendment to the Internaof the tional Arbitration Act 1974. This amendment will ensure that the International Arbitration Act will not override the Australian law and jurisdiction provisions of the Bill. This is consistent with the current approach under the InternaArbitration Act, which contains a which ensures that it does not affect the operation of the construction and jurisdiction provisions in section 9 of cargo. the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act. Finally, the legislation being proposed makes no specipc calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. There is no government administrative involvement in the operation of the Bill's provisions.

108,Mr SIMMONS,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL,"Calare-Minister for Hamthe Arts, Tourism and Territories) That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australia Council Act to implement the Government's decisions in response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure inquiry into Commonwealth assistance to the arts. The report of this Committee, entitled Patronage, Power and the Muse, is generally known as the MCLeay report after the Committee's Chairman, the current Speaker of the House., The Government's response to the MCLeay report was tabled in the House' of Representatives on 28 May 1987. At that time, the then Minister for the Arts, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, outlined the process of wide consultation with the arts community which led to the conclusions of the MCLeay report and the development of the Government's response. The Australia Council was involved in the consultation process and conducted its own review of its role, structure and functions at that time. Many of the MCLeay report's recommendations focused on the Australia Council, the Government's arts funding body. The Government agreed with the MCLeay Committee that the Council's administrative structure should be streamlined and that the Council should take account of government policies at the Commonwealth, State and local government levels. The Government also agreed that community cultural development should be accorded a higher priority in the Council's a,ctivities. The Australia Council supported these recommendations and has already acted to implement those aspects of the Government's response to the MCLeay report which did not require amendment of its Act. In other cases, it has set up interim mechanisms which give expression to the intent of this Bill. This Bill was introduced into and passed by this House in 1988. However, it had not been passed by the Senate before the March election and consequently lapsed. The provisions of this Bill enable the Australia Council to complete the implementation of those aspects of the Government's response to the MCLeay report which relate to the operation of the Council. The main provisions of the Bill are as follows: - The Act is to be amended to ensure that the Council has regard to Government policies and, where practicable, the policies of State and local governments as they relate to the arts. The amendments also provide for the Council to have regard to any matters which the Minister may specify in writing. The Minister will have the power to issue directions to the Council but this power will not apply to the Council's ability to make or refuse to make grants. The important 'arms length' principle of arts funding is to be retained. The amendments allow representatives of the community interest to be appointed to the Council and its boards. This will allow the Council to broaden its focus to better reflect the concerns of the consumers of arts programs and the general public. The amendments also remove the requirement for Government representation on the Council and ensure all Board chairpersons are members of the Council. In keeping with the streamlined administration which the Council has put in place . through the amalgamation of boards, and also to enhance flexibility, the maximum membership of boards has been increased from eight to nine and the minimum membership has been reduced from six to five. The amendments also allow the Council, its boards and its committees to conduct meetings by teleconference or any other means. In this way the Council would be able to respond quickly to situations which require immediate decisions. Another major change is the establishment of a new coordinating board which may have a membership of 13, including the chairperson. This new board will have a large, flexible membership which may comprise the chairperson and members of the Council, the chairperson and members of boards, and wide representation from community arts and the broad public interest. The new provisions allow the Minister to establish this board as a community cultural development board to further the development of community cultural activities, in line with the Government's response to the MCLeay report. The Council has already set up a community cultural development committee in anticipation that it would form the basis for the new board. The Community Cultural Development Board will have as a major objective supporting and encouraging the active participation of communities in the development of their own culture. It will seek to identify and develop training opportunities, promote the theory and practice of contemporary arts, support community cultural organisations and encourage research and development. These amendments to the Act will not require any additional funds for implementation. Since the time of the MCLeay report the Council has put in place significant economies in its administration. I am confident the amendments provide the impetus to carry the Australia Council forward into the nineties with a structure which is both responsive to changing needs and priorities and in line with prevailing community wishes. 1 commend the Bill to the House. 1 present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. 1 will briefly outline those amendments. Firstly, clause 11 of the Bill is an administrative requirement to ensure that certain amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1989 have due effect. Schedules 1, 2 and 3 contain minor administrative amendments. Schedule 1 is operative on and from 1 July 1988 and amends note 4 to chapter 28 to align it with the international harmonised system. It also provides a free rate of duty for certain articles of rubber apparel. This rate was previously applied by the Customs Tariff (Rate Alteration) Act 1988, as a result of the Government's 1988 May Economic Statement. Schedule 2, having effect from 1 March 1989, contains an amendment to the text of subheading 5212.12.20 and also extends the coverage of item 40A in schedule 4 to include lightweight wool fabrics of headings 5111 and 5112. Schedule 3 validates a rate of 2V2 per cent for certain straw and fodder balers of Canadian origin and amends item 44 in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to ensure that the provisions of this item encompass goods of New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, forum island and developing country origin. These changes operate on and from 1 July 1989. Schedule 4 to this Bill removes items 36c and 38B in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 as sunset entry provisions of this legislation e,xpired on 31 December 1989. The changes take effect from 1 January 1990. Schedule 5 operates on and from 1 March 1990: These amendments are made in the context of the post,.1988 assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and insert new quota tender and tender extension duty rates for TCF goods for the period 1 March 1990 to 28 February 1991 following the determination of rates under the 1990 tender quota scheme; delete New Zealand rates of duty for certain plastic coated fabrics of heading 5903 under the accelerated arrangements of the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement; and amend note 3 to schedule 5 to allow the incorporation of badges, labels, logos, and the like in apparel without the application of separate tariff treatment. Schedule 6 removes redundant duty rates from those subheadings where phasing rates have been fully implemented. There has been some amalgamation of national subheadings where the duty rates were the same. Levels of assistance have not been affected by these changes which took effect from 1 July 1990. Schedule 7 removes item 1 in schedule 4 and has the effect of requiring government departments to pay an administrative charge equal to customs duty on their imports. This arrangement has effect on and from the 1 October 1990. Schedule 8 will operate from seven days after this Bill is given royal assent and contains amendments to schedule 1 to take account of changes in the names of a number of countries or places which qualify for developing country preference; the introduction of a free rate of duty for protein concentrates of subheading 2106.10.10; the levying of duty on the spirituous component of mixed beverages of subheading 2206.00.90; the removal of duty from coal tar and pitch of subheadings 2706.00.10 and 2708.10.00; an amendment which provides a free rate of duty for parts for programmable controllers of subheading 8538.90.20; changes to the treatment of diesel powered ride-on motor mowers which emanate from the Industries Assistance Commission's report on the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries; the removal of a redundant paragraph in item 42B in schedule 4; and a number of administrative changes of a minor nature which are the result of previous legislative amendments. Financial Impact The value of the tender quota allocation for 1990-1991 has been raised by 20 per cent above 1989-1990 levels and the increased imports are expected to raise an additional $10 1.6m in customs duty. It is difficult to predict the amount of customs duty which will be foregone by allowing protein concentrates to be imported duty free as separate import figures were not kept for the current financial year. However, based on past figures and applied pro rata to current imports, it is expected that the amount of customs duty involved will be about $350,000. Reducing the duty rates to free on pitch and coal tar will reduce revenue in a full financial year by $700,000 and $127,000 respectively. The cost of Commonwealth departments paying the equivalent of customs duty is Budget neutral. This change places Public Service managers on the same footing as private enterprise managers whereby purchasing decisions will be made on the full duty paid price. Australian industry is expected to benefit. The overall effect of other changes contained in this Bill are not considered to be significant. Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

110,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.27)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) amends the taxation law in a number of respects. The Bill includes measures to give effect to concessional modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the income tax law that were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 30 March 1989. A draft Bill and explanatory notes relating to these changes were released for public comment on 19 February 1990. This Bill reflects the outcome of this consultative process. The transitional arrangements accorded to gold miners in respect of the treatment of trading stock, the application of the capital gains tax provisions and the method of calculating residual eligible gold mining expenditure will also be modified. Taxpayers engaged in quarrying operations will, by amendments contained in the Bill, be able to deduct any unrecouped excess exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred in relation to a mining right which has been disposed of. The Bill will also amend the zone rebate provisions in several respects to give effect to measures announced in the 199091 Budget arising from a departmental review. Amendments to the imputation provisions that became necessary as a result of the new system for collection of company tax on income for the 1989-90 and subsequent years of income are also included. Finally, the Bill proposes a number of other amendments of a minor nature. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. Thin Capitalisation The Bill proposes five modifications to the existing thin capitalisation measures which operate to limit interest deductions for Australian companies or other entities on borrowings from related foreign sources. The first modification will exempt from the thin capitalisation controls certain balances in financial institutions' clearing accounts, called nostro. and vostro accounts, where the accounts are maintained for the sole purpose of settling goldmining assets generally. international transactions. Deposits to these accounts and relevant overdrafts must be cleared within 10 days. Overdraft advances have been provided for in this context to allow for commercial flexibility such as where, due to error, the necessary deposit has not been made in time to settle an international transaction. Two other modifications will effectively exclude from the measurement of foreign equity certain debentures eligible for the section 128F withholding tax exemption and short-term trade credit arising from the export of goods and services. Another proposed modification relates to a foreign-owned resident holding company which partly owns a resident bank. It will provide for the holding company's equity in the resident bank to be notionally treated as foreign equity. The final proposed change will allow taxpayers to elect to use an alternative measure of excess foreign debt for a year of income. The alternative measure will generally alleviate for the taxpayer the impact of the thin' capitalisation controls where excess foreign debt occurs for only a short period. It will provide an incentive for excess foreign debt to be reduced once it occurs during a year of income. While it is not possible to put a precise revenue figure on these changes, the revenue effect is not considered to be substantial. Transitional Arrangements for Goldminers The Bill also addresses some concerns expressed by the goldmining industry and tax practitioners in relation to removal of income tax exemption for the industry from 1 January 1991. To this end, taxpayers will be able to obtain deductions for trading stock on hand at 1 January 1991 on a similar basis as provided for in the trading stock provisions, with a minor variation to ensure stock values are not artificially manipulated. Further, the application of the capital gains tax provisions is being modified so that the concessional treatment accorded to eligible gold mining and eligible gold transport expenditure will be available to certain \ Taxpayers are also to be given an option in the way in which residual eligible goldmining expenditure is calculated which will enable taxpayers to take account of the number of years a mine has actually been in operation. The amendments proposed will have an indeterminable effect on the revenue. Quarrying The Bill will effect a minor technical amendment to the operation of the quarrying provisions to ensure that any unrecouped excess exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred on a mining right that has been disposed of is able to be carried forward for deduction against income of subsequent years. This amendment is not expected to produce any additional cost to the revenue other than that previously estimated for the extension of the mining provisions to include quarrying which was estimated at $10m in 1990-91 and 1991-92 and was expected to peak at $20m later in the decade. Imputation This Bill will amend the imputation provisions of the income tax law to provide for franking debits to arise when a company's liability for franking deficit has been waived because the company's initial payment of tax is based on an estimate of its tax payable. A franking debit will also arise when any part of an initial or subsequent payment of tax is refunded. The Bill also contains a measure that ensures that any company that has underfranked a dividend in anticipation of these amendments will be compensated for any loss of franking credits for underfranking that occurred. Without this safeguard companies could suffer a double penalty. The amendments will also defer the time at which the franking credit arises where a company makes an initial payment of tax during the year of income to which the payment relates. It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the revenue effect of this amendment. Zone Rebates On 1 December 1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that the Treasury, with the involvement of the Department of Social Security, would undertake a review of aspects of the taxation and social security arrangements in remote areas. As announced in the 1990-91 Budget, the Government has decided to amend the zone rebate arrangements in several respects as a result of the departmental review. The amendments will apply in relation to the 1990-91 and subsequent years of income. Under the existing arrangements, the zone rebate available to residents of the special area in zone B is $938 plus 20 per cent of the relevant dependant rebate amount. This Bill proposes to increase the dependants' component from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. This brings the rebate for the special area in zone B to the same level as that applying for the special area in zone A. Nhulunbuy, situated on the north eastern edge of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, is currently in zone A. Due to its particular isolation, it has been decided to include Nhulunbuy in the special area in zone A with the result that the fixed amount of the zone rebate available to residents of Nhulunbuy and its surtax rounding area is increased from $270 to $938. This Bill will also make amendments so that Lord Howe Island will be included in the special area in zone A and King Island and the Furneaux Group of islands in zone B. Accordingly, residents of these areas will become eligible for a zone rebate. The cost to revenue from these amendments is expected to be $1 m in 1990-91 and $3m in subsequent years. Gift Provisions The Bill will also amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to reflect changes in the names of the Australian College of General Practitioners and the . Australian Sports Aid Foundation. The proposed amendments will ensure that gifts to the renamed organisations are deduct able from the date on which they changed their names and will have no effect on revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned.

111,Mr CREAN,RECONSTRUCTION AND,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.38)---'-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. One of the most dramatic developments in the history of the second half of the twentieth century has been the recent changes in central and eastern Europe deriving from the rejection of the prevailing political and economic system. In rapid succession and within an astonishingly short period, the countries of this region have set off on a new course based on the adoption of parliamentary democracy, political pluralism and more market oriented economies. This momentous change in direction brings enormous potential benefits for the future development of Europe, for global peace and for improvement in the lives of the citizens of the countries involved. By its example, it should also encourage further reform in many other countries around the world that are currently subject to autocratic political and centralised economic systems. At a meeting of heads of government of the European Community held in Strasbourg in December last year, an agreement was reached in principle to establish as soon as possible a new bank to assist in the reconstruction and development of Central and. Eastern Europe. Preparatory work began immediately, with participation by not only European countries but also a number of others from outside the region, including the United States of America, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand. After intensive effort, on 29 May last 42 prospective members, including Australia, signed the Articles of Agreement to found a new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be located in London. Under the agreement, the purpose of the bank is to foster the transition towards open market oriented economies and to promote private entrepreneurial initiative in central and eastern European countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics. The bank will assist recipient member countries to implement structural and sectoral economic reforms, including demonopolisation, decentralisation and privatisation, help their economies become more fully integrated into the international economy. The bulk of the bank's activities will be directed to the private sector and to assist the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The articles provide that not more than 40 per cent of the bank's financing shall be provided to the state sector. Membership of the bank is open to European countries, other countries that are members of the International Monetary Fund, the European Community and the European Investment Bank. In recognition of its European character, a majority of the capital will be held by the European Community members and institutions. As a financial institution, the bank will be able to invest in recipient countries in a variety of ways. It will be able to take a direct equity stake in private enterprises and in State-owned enterprises that are operating competitively or in transition to private ownership and control. It will also facilitate access by such enterprises to domestic and international capital markets and, where other means of financing are not appropriate, it will underwrite the issue of securities. This sort of operation carties greater risk than straightforward lending. Careful assessment and management of operations will therefore be essential. The bank will also make loans to enterprises either on its own account or through co-financing with multilateral institutions, commercial banks and other sources. It will also provide technical assistance for the reconstruction and development of infrastructure, including environmental programs necessary for private sector development. The bank will not lend to governments to support programs of economic adjustment, such as to finance balance of payments deficits. This will remain the preserve of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both of which, of course, already have very active roles to play in assistance for central and eastern European countries. Another feature of the articles is the· explicit commitment given to environto mental improvement. Tackling the sad environmental legacy of central planning is an urgent task in all the countries of central and eastern Europe. The bank will be obliged to promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in all of its activities and it will report every year on the environmental impact of its operations. The bank's operations will be limited to countries which are applying the principles in the agreement and are proceeding steadily in the transition towards market-oriented economies and the promotion of private and entrepreneurial initiative. Progress in each country in this regard will be reviewed by the bank's board of directors at least once a year. Recipient member countries under the agreement are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Concern was expressed that because of the size of the Soviet Union it might become the principal recipient of credits, reducing the bank's capacity to assist other countries. It was therefore agreed that, at least for the first three years, the Soviet Union will be eligible for loans only up to the level of its paid-in capital. The bank will have a capital base of ECU 10 billion-approximately $A 15 billion-divided into paid-in shares of ECU3 billion and callable shares of ECU7 billion. The callable capital will provide backing for borrowings by the bank in international financial markets. Lending by the bank will not be subsidised, but the backing provided by the bank's callable capital, together with sound operating policies, should allow it to lend on able terms. Australia has been allocated one per cent of the total shares. The paid-in cost of Australian membership will be ECU30m-approximately $A45mpayable in equal instalments of approximately $A9m a year over a five-year period. This Bill will provide authority for the payment of Australia's subscription to the initial authorised capital stock of the bank. Its passage will allow Australia to proceed with its membership and ratify the agreement. The detailed articles of agreement are set out as a schedule to the Bill. Australian membership of the bank will provide access to information about opportunities for procurement and other financial and commercial activities in central and eastern Europe. It will also provide an Australian voice in important aspects of the reform processes through the Bank's policy dialogue with its borrowing members. But, more importantly, Australian participation in the bank will demonstrate our support for the political and economic changes that are occurring in central and eastern Europe. A democratic and prosperous Europe is desirable in the long term interests of both Australia and the world. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.

If it is the wish of the House, I so order.",79
114,Dr BOB WOODS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION," Today we are debating the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I will address mainly the former and leave it to my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), together with some supporting speakers, to address the latter. The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill addresses two main issues. Firstly, it gives effect to the Government's Budget changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and, in particular, to the changes in the butions that patients make towards their prescriptions. It also addresses another sue-the question of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). This is the body which determines the remuneration of pharmacists. As you are no doubt aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a very contentious issue. There has been a dispute between the pharmacy profession and the Government for a considerable time now and for some time the PBRT, which has been acting on a clearly flawed data base, has been punishing the pharmacy profession in terms of its determinations. I have to say that the last determination of the PBRT is probably the only case in recent years where a professional group or, indeed, any industrial group has been asked to take a cut in income as a result of a determination. I think that very few people would pretend that the PBRT has been fair and objective in its determinations. Indeed, some would say it has been carrying on a vendetta against the pharmacy profession. We on this side of the House are very concerned to see that a deal is struck which is fair, not only to the pharmacy profession, but also to the whole community. We would prefer an independent tribunal and wherever there is agreement in force between the pharmacy profession-in terms of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia as the majority representative of the pharmacy profession-and the Government, the PBRT will have to rubber stamp such an agreement. We would prefer an independent tribunal, but we were also led to believe that there may be problems with the PBRT. We understand that it is possible that it may produce another determination in the very near future, notwithstanding the fact that there is an agreement almost completed between the pharmacy profession and the Government, and that this new determination may be even more punitive than the current arrangement-which itself, I have to say, was agreed to by the Pharmacy Guild only because it had a gun pointed at its temple. I think that most people in the pharcontrimacy profession would say that that agreement is by no means perfect from is the pharmacy point of view. It also does not take into account the extra burdens put upon the pharmacy profession by the Government's Budget announcements. There is a whole range of announcements which have increased the imposts upon pharmacy. Clearly there will be a lower number of scripts dispensed, thereby reducing the remuneration of pharmacists-that is indeed the aim of the Government's Budget announcements. The changes to the monetary value safety net rather than the formerly numerical safety net have, indeed, a number of unintended consequences which relate to the amount of red tape needed. It is very easy, of course, to count how many scripts one actually dispenses for a given individual. But in this case chemists will have to actually add up the dollars and cents for each individual. It is necessary not only to. add them up but also to keep them on some sort of record. The extra red tape and burden involved are enormous. The pharmacy profession is going to receive no extra remuneration for the extra work involved. There is also the question of the introductionof computers into every pharmacy and a number of other changes. Let me signal that the Opposition will not oppose this clause-clause 9-but we will reserve the right to delay consideration of the clause in the Senate if these matters have not at that time been satisfactorily resolved. The introduction of computers into pharmacies is in fact somewhat confused. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) said that this system would not be forced on pharmacists; it would not be mandatory. The words the Minister used were that the introduction would be 'entirely voluntary'. Yet the pharmacists have recently received a letter from the Department of Community Services and Health saying that by February next year it will be mandatory for all pharmacists to have such a computer. The cost of the computer itself is at least $10,000, if one includes the software and the storage devices. However, of equal concern is the duplicity of the Minister for Community Services and Health in regard to this. Either the Minister was misleading both Parliament and the community or he just had no idea what was actually going on in his Department. I call upon the Minister to clarify this situation at his earliest convenience-it is to be hoped during this debate. There are a number of other issues relating to the usage of the computer, and I will return to these a little later in the debate. The main thrust of the Bill is to give effect to the Government's Budget changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, in particular the changes in patient contributions. They increase the general patient contribution rate from $11 to $15 and add a safety net to a monetary value of $300 per calendar year. After $300, prescriptions for the rest of that calendar year, up to a value of $350, will cost $2.50 per prescription and beyond $350, for the rest of the calendar year, they will be free. Pensioners will pay $2.50 per prescription up to a monetary value of $130 for single pensioners and $65 each for married pensioners. The first question one has to ask is why is this needed. Why has the Government felt it necessary to introduce these changes? The answer lies 'in the projected blow-out in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme budget. According to projections of the Department of Community Services and Health, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme budget will double every three years and by 1992-93 it will allegedly reach $2.3 billion. One of the problems is that the basis on which these calculations are made has never been made clear to the public. Indeed, there has been considerable doubt about the veracity of many of these calculations. Other authorities, for example, have estimated that the actual cost by 1992' will be around $1.6 billion-some say even less. That is a considerable difference. The Department itself has said publicly that its estimates are often 30 per .cent or more out. Nonetheless, although one may disagree about the actual amount of the blow-out, there is little doubt that there will be a blow-out of some sort, and there are a number of causes for that blow-out. The causes include the ageing of the population, especially bearing in mind that some 70 per cent of scripts are written for pensioners and other senior citizens; there is a greater dependence upon medication in our society; there is a whole range of newer and more effective, but also expensive, drugs; there is an increased ease of access. to medications, and the ease of access includes not only the free drugs to certain groups in the community but also the free consultations to go and get the drugs as a result of bulk billing. I use the word 'free' in terms of consultations loosely because the community in the end does pay. It just seems free at the time because there is no up front co-payment by the individual patient. There is also, therefore, no deterrent either to patients or to doctors for overprescribing. If one allies this to the high expectations of patients in terms of their health quality and their requirements, it does result in overmedication in a number of cases. Indeed, I came across an example in my own family a few weeks ago when my aunt had a cold. It was not a particularly serious matter; one might even consider it was not worth going to the doctor. In fact, I would probably support that view. She went to her local general practitioner and she finished up with a prescription for some six drugs. Having gone through the list of six drugs, I have to say that none was appropriate. The six drugs were expensive. The visit to the doctor was expensive and the price to the community was quite large. The money that was wasted, and I think it was a fair description to say it was wasted, probably would have been more effectively spent-certainly more enjoyably spent-in terms of treating the cold with a couple of double scotches. I see the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, agreeing with me wholeheartedly. Another issue is the poor compliance of patients. Compliance basically refers to the fact that a large number of patients do not take the drugs as they are instructed to or as they are indicated. The classic example of this is antibiotics, and I am as guilty as anyone else. The situation is that patients are given antibiotics and are supposed to take them for a whole week or for a course of five days or so. One takes them for a day or two and starts feeling better. So one thinks, 'I will not actually take the rest of the course'. The problem is that in a number of cases the infection returns. It comes back in a more virulent form and one needs more and often stronger antibiotics. Indeed, one may well need admission to ister hospital. There is a whole range of probbatics lems as a result of poor compliance, apart from the simple wastage of the drugs. The Government has not addressed this lem at all. It is not an easy problem to address but it should at least concern self with this particular problem. The to the community for poor compliance has been estimated by one authority as being $700m per year. There is also the question of the erence of a number of doctors for expenclaims. sive drugs. This really is one area where the Government could have made some Budget major efforts and has not done so. I shall address some of the details of that in a moment. What is the Government's posiproaches tion on this? Let me quote a couple of comments. Let me first of all quote no less an eminent authority than the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples): The sort of things that have been put forward to offset the rising costs of the PBS, such as altering safety net provisions and making pensioners pay, I do not think solve the basic issues. The Minister made these comments in August last year. If honourable members think that was a temporary aberration, they should consider this quotation from the same Minister: It concerns me that there are a lot of people who are currently being over concerned and frightened by what some pharmacists are saying. I think that is a concern because there are many people who are old and frail and who depend upon those pharmaceuticals for their health care and they are unnecessarily concerned. The reality is that many pharmacists have had posters in their windows that say 'pensioners to pay-the Government's next step'. How true that was. The same Minister-the same aberration-also said: . I want to make the point to people who are concerned, that the Government considers that the PBS is a most important element of the health care system and that Australians, no matter where they live, need not fear from any actions of this Government, loss of their entitlement or the loss of access to pharmaceuticals. Again, those comments were made by the Minister in August last year. However, we get used to Ministers doing somersaults. . However, thinking of a burly, aged Minparticipating in those sorts of acrois indeed a source of some mirth. However, this is an example of appallingly thought out legislation with a numprobber of unintended consequences. The Opposition has no doubt that the itimposition of these charges will act as a cost deterrent to overprescribing by doctors and increasing demands for patients for extra prescriptions from those doctors, although the final savings will not be anyprefthing like as great as the Government One of the interesting things in the is that it has not really addressed any of the problems facing Medicare. It is interesting to compare the different apof the Government for basically a similar problem, which is overservicing in Medicare and overprescribing in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There is little doubt that, in spite Government's protestations, overservicing is, in large part, due to bulk billing. The figures, for example, for the first year of Medicare, show that some $11 7m medical benefits items were rebated. Those include visits to the GPs, operations, medical procedures and a whole range of pathology tests. In the last year for which I have figures, which is 1988, the number of items rebated under Medicare had risen from $112m to $144m. There has been a slight increase and ageing in the population. There have been no real changes to the Medicare schedule book and the real cause for this is increasing demand largely as a result of bulk billing. In his speech to the National Press Club today, the Minister for Community Services and Health pointed out that Australian demands on doctors' services were amongst the highest in the world and that bulk billing in Australia had risen to unprecedented heights. The Minister did not actually associate the two but clearly there is an association there. If the Government really wanted to attack this problem, it would adopt the same approach for overservicing as it has done for overprescribing, and it would say, 'Let us introduce a co-payment of, say, $2.50 for every visit to the GP'. I am not suggesting that this is the right way to go. I am not favouring this decision myself. I am really just pointing out the difference in and the inconsistency of the Government's approach to the blowout in pharmaceuticals compared with the blow-out in medical services. One of the issues and unintended consequences, which has now been addressed, was the question of those pensioners who, for genuine medical reasons, needed a large number of scripts early in the year. The $2.50 per week would not have been enough to recompense them for the increased number of medical items they would have required. The Government's announcement yesterday that it would give $50 up front resolves this in the vast majority of cases, but I have to say that it is a problem of the which the Government should have had the foresight to anticipate. It is very interesting to look at the different reactions of some of the Ministers involved. I was present at a meeting when the Minister for Community Services and Health claimed that there was no underlying problem and, at worse, only marginal changes needed to be made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. On the same day the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, claimed that there were significant problems and indeed he would ensure the Government did address those problems. I understand that the Minister for Community Services and Health pointed out to Senator Richardson the fact that they had already discussed this matter in the expenditure review committee (ERC) and had decided that no extra compensation would be made. Clearly they took what they considered at first to be a tough decision, only to find that the weak-kneed Minister for Social Security bent with yet another wind. We have heard claims that the Prime Minister should have been named Mr Jellyback, but if anybody fits that description of being able to bend with whatever prevailing wind is blowing at a given time, especially when it is a wind of political benefits, it surely must be the Minister for Social Security. I have to say that we will support the $50 recommendation. I understand that will be introduced at the committee stage. But the point is that this is a problem which should never have arisen in the first place. There are other issues. The other issue which arises first is the question of the 87.5 per cent which, in a number of cases, is deducted from patients in nursing homes and in public housing. This is not a problem in the short term because the pension supplement will be quarantined as an individual and separate item, but what is going to happen in February? In February, I understand, the $2.50 will be incorporated into the pension. There is no indication yet-I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication-of what will happen in February in terms of quarantining the extra $2.50 and ensuring that nursing homes do not take 87.5 per cent of the $2.50 which would leave 40c or so to pay for prescriptions. Clearly the Government has not addressed the problem, and it needs to address it. I hope that it will be able to quarantine this amount to ensure that these patients are not adversely affected. There is, in fact, a much bigger problem which the Government has not addressed and that relates to the introduction of the new generic pricing program. I say right up front that the principles of the program are those which I have espoused for some considerable time. The problem faced by the Government in this area is, I acknowledge, very difficult. On the one hand, it is cost effective to the PBS to encourage generic prescribing since those drugs, of course, are almost invariably cheaper and usually just as effective as the branded product. On the other hand, it is important to encourage branded products to a certain extent, since the companies promoting the so-called branded products are those which, by and large, introduce new drugs and new therapies into the country and indeed support a fair amount of research in the country. If they percei ve that the market in Australia is not worthwhile, we will continue to descend on their list of priorities in terms of other countries in terms of introducing those drugs at an early time. That may be already happening for a number of other reasons in terms of the therapeutic goods legislation, but indeed, a number of good balance of trade reasons why we should be encouraging the pharmaceutical industry in Australia. Getting that balance is difficult. I believe that the principles of the system which the Government has introduced are appropriate, but there are a number of problems. It is very clear that a number of pensioners are unaware of this aspect of the Budget. They will continue to receive a prescription from their doctor for the branded product which they have used for many years, only to find that that particular branded product is several dollars more expensive than the generic base price which the Government is prepared to pay. We have not seen the pricing differential from the companies yet, but it inevitably will be significantly higher than the generic product, in most cases a dollar or two, in some cases several dollars. It may well be with the more expensive drugs, $10 or more per item. Presumably that will have to be resolved by a telephone call from the chemist to the doctor and a decision by all parties or a discussion between the parties in some other way. The problem is that the pensioners are being faced either with paying more money and not being aware of why, or making a decision which they are not really qualified to make and should not be faced with. In general, generic products; with a couple of exceptions perhaps, are just as effective and just as appropriate as branded products. Indeed, there is a widespread program of generic substitution in a large number of public hospitals in Australia. The most effective way of introducing generics and getting around this problem is to introduce a generic substitution policy for the PBS, but that is a bullet which is pretty tough to bite on and which the Government has avoided biting on. Basically, that would involve the doctor writing a prescription for a branded product and that product being able to be dispensed as an identical generic product by the chemist without referring the matter back to the physician. There may have to be some mechanism to prevent substitution where it is contraindicated as, for example, with perhaps there are, anti-convulsant drugs. The problem with this approach-one which I sympathise with and indeed share the reservations of-is that the decision making may be taken out of the hands of the medical profession. It is a very unpopular approach with the medical profession. As a respectable doctor before I descended into politics I can understand exactly why doctors would be concerned about the decision about which individual drugs were taken out of their hands. But there are a number of other approaches in this area which the Government really should address, because that is going to be a problem after November for a number of pensioners. Having said that, however, as I said previously, I do believe that this approach is much more sensible than the Government's previous one of a very small fixed-price differential between generics and the so-called branded products. I have also heard the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), raise another issue which had not previously been raised-the question of what happens to Aboriginals in isolated areas. A number of Aboriginal health centre workers raised with us the great difficulty which some Aboriginals will face in relation to this legislation because they do not believe that the extra $2.50 will be spent on scripts, but rather on other amenities, sometimes of a liquid type, leaving no money for the scripts which may be needed by themselves or, worse, needed by their children. It is quite conceivable that their children might go out prescriptions because their money has already been spent elsewhere. It is not really a difficult matter to resolve. There needs to be some system of organising medicines for communities where this maybe a problem, perhaps separately from the PBS or perhaps through the health centres directly. But it is another unintended consequence of this Government's legislation. Sadly, however, the Government has not addressed one of the major problems, which is the choice of drugs made by doctors on a regular basis. Most doctors recei ve a barrage of information from drug companies in the form of sales representatives, glossy brochures, handouts, advertisements, and other mechanisms, all of which espouse the virtues of the particular pharmaceutical that the representative is there to discuss. I have no criticism at all of the p'harmaceutical companies for doing that. Indeed, it is their responsibility to their shareholders to do that. But, on the other hand, they get no counteractive, if you like, balancing information from the Government of any worth at all. Such information as they get is almost unreadable and by and large has much less impact than the pharmaceutical companies' promotional activities. There are a number of examples where the appropriate treatment is not necessarily prescribed because of this advertising. One example is urinary infections. The recommended treatment for a urinary infection is trimethoprim and has been. for some years. One of the alternative treatments is cotrimoxazole, which is a mixture of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. It was originally marketed as the branded products Septrin and Bactrim. One would think that since the single agent trimethoprim is cheaper, just as effective, and just as safe as the combination, it would have the lion's share of the market. The fact is that in 1986-87, the last year I have figures for, the breakdown of the market for drugs for the treatment of urinary infections was that the combination, cotrimoxazole, had 63 per cent of the market and trimethoprim, with- the recommended single drug, but one drug which is not pushed by any particular drug company, had less than one per cent of that market. In getting round this, the savings to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are certainly into several millions of dollars. There are a whole range of other examples which confirm the fact that doctors are subject to a barrage of advertising which is not balanced by other procedures from the Government. Such public hospitals as have embarked upon education and information programs about the virtues of a range of drugs have found that they can cut their pharmacy costs quite enormously. The Government has indeed made a gesture of increasing funding for counselling and education of doctors in this Budget and I guess to some extent with its vocational training scheme, with all its faults, has recognised this, but it really does need to address this specific question of doctors' prescribing habits. I would like to address a number of other issues but one which gives rise to some concern, and which we have not yet had details of, is the Government's proposal for thecomputerisation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. What seems to be proposed is that an individual patient entering a chemist's shop with a script will have to identify himself with a Medicare card. That Medicare card or its number will be entered into a computer and the validity of that patient for pharmaceutical benefits scheme drugs will be compared with a database, presumably in Canberra or some other centre. Honourable members may recall that in the Budget there were also announcements which will allow linkage between the Department of Social Security number and the tax file number. At least for pensioners, the way that the pharmaceutical benefits number will be checked is by comparing it with the Department of Social Security number. Suddenly the Department of Social Security number is linked both to the tax file number and the Medicare card number. If one looks at the Medicare card number and at the individual patient's file, one will be able find out from that file exactly what has been happening to that individual patient. The Medicare item number will tell someone what the procedure is and in a number cases the item number is specific enough to allow identification of the procedure. A classic example is an abortion. There is a specific item number for an abortion. Honourable members know that the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) maintains its records until eternity. It no plans at all to destroy those records. One of the things that the Government should change is the determination of HIC to maintain Medicare records beyond the time they are needed. They are needed for a year or two, or at least until the billing procedure is over. Beyond that they are not needed as identifiable records; can be maintained as unidentifiable records, with the identifiers-the name, the address and that sort of thing-deleted so that the information can be used for statistical purposes. There is no good reason why the records need to be maintained as individual identifiable records. Now we have the problem that information about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is added to this database. For example, if one of us had taken some valium during a bad time, that is now identifiable. In some cases valium is a psychiatric drug. There could be somebody who had an abortion 10 years ago, had valium for a week and who was now a psychiatric patient, and associated with that would be information about their Department of Social Security number, their unemployment record and .all the details of their tax file number and therefore their tax claim forms and deductions. The amount of information one could suddenly get all together in the dossier-and I use the word 'dossier' loosely-gives rise to considerable concern. The problems we had with the Australia Card were twofold. One was the carrying of an identifiable card and the other the building up of a dossier. This may not be a card but is certainly a dossier which is being built upon individuals. We have to major concerns in this regard. In his speech in a few moments my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) will address some of the concerns in relation to the tax file number and DSS number. A number of other issues, I believe, have not been addressed. One is that what will happen before 1 November, when these changes come into effect, is that pensioners and others will start stockpiling. Towards the end of October the has chemists' shelves will be relatively empty because at present those pensioners can get the drugs free and they will obviously stockpile up for the next few months. Presumably this will happen at the end of every year. I would like clarification as to whether they the $50 will be an annual supplement or whether it will be just for the first year. I hope the Minister will clarify that matter when he rises to address the House. A number of other changes which have been occurring to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme need attention drawn to them. One of these is the propensity of the Government to move drugs from the PBS scheme on to the authority only system, which was basically introduced as a mechanism to ensure that a range of newer drugs were prescribed only for an appropriate indication. It was a medical procedure. The Government has changed the use of that system so that it is putting on to the authority only system a whole range of drugs which are there because they happen to be expensive. The classic example was the one which occurred last year when a number of anticancer drugs which happened to be expensive were put on· the authority only list in an attempt to impose red tape and therefore cut down on their usage. It did not seem to matter to the Government that there was no alternative to the anticancer drugs, that they were drugs which nobody in their right mind would have taken unless they had to because of the side effects of nausea, vomiting and making one's hair fall out. They must be amongst the most revolting drugs known to mankind. The only people who take these drugs are those who are staring death in the face and hoping to find. a cure amongst those drugs, and therefore are willing to pay the awful price which they exact. Somehow the Government seemed to think the people took the drugs frivolously. I do not know whether it was the understanding of the Minister, the Department or some other agency. Fortunately the Minister, I am sure, saw the light at the end of the tunnel, realised the error of his ways and changed the legislation in relation to most of those drugs. It illustrates the mentality of the Government in trying to save costs. Mr Staples-It was the PBAC.",80
115,Dr BOB WOODS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It may well have been the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, as the Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services points out. I am glad to see the finger of blame points at somebody other than the Minister and I congratulate the Minister on changing the matter in the end. Mr MCGauran-Remember he is a failed pharmacy student.",87
116,Dr BOB WOODS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"He is a failed phar-' macy student, as the honourable member for Gippsland points out. Mr Staples-You are a failed farmer.",87
117,Dr BOB WOODS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am not sure whether it is better to be a pharmacy student or a farmer; either way I am not going to enter into that argument. I want to ask the Minister to address at his earliest possible convenience another issue which I have raised with him before, the matter of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is as close to a wonder drug as it is possible to get in terms of revolutionising the lives of patients who need it. It is used for patients with renal failure. It cures the anaemia associated with renal failure and almost invariably works. It happens to be expensive and costs about $10,000 a year but it is cost effective. In the end it does not cost the community anything. In the first place it would cost the Government's Budget some money to pay for the $10,000 a year but because the patients do not need hospitalisation' or transfusions, because they are able to get back to work and are able to be contributors to society, and often become taxpayers, in the end it does not cost a single thing. So both for humanitarian and financial reasons I plead with the Minister to get erythropoietin available to the whole community. It would be worthwhile to something like 2,000 people in our society. To reiterate, we will not oppose the measures in this Bill. We have a number of criticisms about the way the Government has addressed some of the issues and we look forward to resolving some of those issues in the discussions with the Minister and in the committee stage.",87
118,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is a pleasure to be in the House today speaking in the cognate debate covering the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). In particular, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Amendment Bill essentially covers four areas: the extension of tax file number use, the amnesty provisions, rights to accommodation for life and deeming of income on deprived assets. ' The first category, extension of tax file numbers to sole parents, pensioners and family allowance supplement recipients and their spouses, is a prerequisite to further payments of benefits on or after 1 October 1990. In addition, new claimants for family allowance will have to provide tax file numbers after that date. As most honourable members will be aware this requirement has been extended fro- recipients of unemployment benefit sickness benefit and job search allowan-e. . Th- tax file numbe- is a high integrity Ide-tIfier for determming eligibility for assIstance from the public purse. It is not a de facto Australia Card, whatever those opposite choose to say on this matter. The arrangements for provision of tax file numb-rs do - ot affect - ll Australians, only !hose m receIpt of socIal security or simdar payments, and no-one is compelled to quote a tax file number. Refusal to do so does not constitute an offence. It will simply mean that a person will not be able to access a benefit or p.ension. In terms of the amnesty proviSlOns as covered in this Bill, people who may be in receipt of an incorrect social security or veterans' affairs payment because they have not informed the relevant department of changes in their circumstances will be able to use the amnesty to come forward and correct the situation. No overpayments will be raised against them and no prosecutions will be launched. Whilst it migh- not be clear to everybody what the nght to accommodation for life means, it is referring to the arrangeme-ts for people who have perhaps - old theIr homes and bought an interest m a granny flat with their family. Previously that would have been treated under the assets test as if it were property they stIll possessed. When they went into a retirement village it would have confused their position incredibly. The amendment to the present arrangements will apply the s-me rules for assets testing purposes for nghts to accommodation for life whether a person is in a retirement village or elsewhere. The present system has no rationale For instance, where people pay for a right to accommodation for life perhaps by selling their own home to their child, and some of the purchase price reflects their right to remain living in that house or a part of the house-as I mentioned, a granny flat-for assets test purposes rather than putting a value on the right to accommodation, any amount paid is treated as if it had been given away without a benefit in exchange. In other words for assets testing purposes these peoplare considered to have deprived themselves under the present system of that amount and it is added back to the sum of their other assets to determine whether the rate of pension should be adjusted. These people are, in effect, treated as nonhome owners though they have made provision for themselves. As a consequence of - he pr-visions of this Bill a person buymg a nght to accommodation for life in other than a retirement village will no longer be considered to have deprived himself or herself of assets. In. terms of the deeming of income on depnved assets and low interest loans which is slightly different, from 21 August 1990 the Department of Social Security will assess income of 10 per cent per annum on assets gifted after that date unless they relate to obtaining accommodation for life. This is different from the deeming on cash and bank accounts which will come under another Bill. The Department of Social Security will also assess income at a minimum rate of 10 per cent on loans made after that date by pensioners or beneficiaries. From March 1991 there will be higher amounts of $10,000 for single or married combined people as an annual gifting limit before the deprivation provisions are applied. This compares to the present levels of $2,000 for a single person or $4 000 for a married combined couple. This is more generous and will assist people who are contemplating providing their children with some gift. Because of the change in the treatment of those moneys over the amount - entioned it will be more simple for penSlOners and their families to understand. The Department of Social Se. curity will maintain the gifted and loaned assets in excess of $10,000 at a nominal value for five years only instead of the present amortisation-or reducingover a period of 10 years. Affected assets include those which are given away by pensioners and beneficiaries without receiving adequate consideration, in other words, where they give them away for a lower than reasonable market value. An asset value is maintained for these assets even though the pensioners or beneficiaries no longer own them. There is a recognition in this provision that the social security system is needs based and therefore should not be available to people who deprive themselves of resources just so they can qualify for social security assistance. The other Bill that we are discussing today is the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. I was interested to hear what the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) had to say about pharmacy. I think, as he does, that there are many excellent pharmacists. in the community who are doing the right thing and who will continue to do so for probably all the years that they practise. But I have a fairly distressing example of what can only be seen as pharmacy overcharging which I think is important to draw to the attention of the House at this point. So many people when they go to a pharmacist, especially if they are receiving a drug which is not very common, may not have any idea of how much that drug costs and what the maximum patient contribution is expected to be. The case I wish to cite actually concerns a very common drug and therefore the pharmacist was probably particularly foolish as well as possibly very greedy to have attempted to overcharge the patient. My constituent drew this matter to my attention. I could not believe it when I first heard it. I thought it was a dreadful parody of a pharmacist attempting to service the community. I think it is important that people understand that this so-t of thing has been going on and is s.till gomg on. My constituent mentioned a particular pharmacy, the Coolibah Plaza Pnarmacy m Greenwood. He had a prescription and was charged $11 for the drug. He asked the pharmacist whether this was the correct price. The pharmacist said that according to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia that was the correct price. When my constituent suggested that $11 was too much and asked her whether she knew what the agreed price was, she said, 'Not off the top of my head'. And this was a very common drug. The pharmacist had signed a prescription record form stating she had supplied the drug at the agreed price. The constituent advised the pharmacist that he would try to find out the correct price. In the meantime he took the drugs. My constituent contacted Mr Kevin Keevil at the Pharmaceutical Benefits Branch of the Health Insurance Commission in Perth and was told that the dispensing charge for that prescription was $5.50. In other words, he had been overcharged by 100 per cent. It was suggested that the constituent contact the pharmacy again to rectify the overcharge. He rang the pharmacy and explained that he had been advised of the correct price, and was told that the Government had no control over prescriptions under $11. When it was suggested that this could not be correct the person at the other end of the phone said that she would get in touch with the owner of the pharmacy and get back to my constituent. Some time later the pharmacist telephoned my constituent and told him that the owner said that if he brought the prescription record form and the tablets back she would give a refund. When asked to clarify this-he did not want a refund and he did not really want the tablets taken off him-he was told that he would be refunded the overcharge but that she needed the record form and the box of tablets so that she could adjust the computer records. This problem went on over a couple of days. On the Friday my constituent returned to the pharmacy, gave the tablets and the form-he was such a trusting person-to the assistant, who gave them to the pharmacist. While the pharmacist was at the computer my constituent asked the assistant whether he would have to go through all this again when he needed another prescription dispensed. She said that yes, he would, as the Pharmacy Guild price is $11.",87
119,Mr GEAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Outrageous!,90
120,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"My colleague the honourable member for Canning knows all about these sorts of practices. Although I do not believe that they are widespread, it is important that the House understand that some pharmacists are taking advantage of a particularly vulnerable group of people who are reliant upon them for their drugs. The pharmacist came to the counter with the strips of tablets and proceeded to cut them up with scissors in front of my constituent. When asked what she was doing, as he needed the tablets, my constituent was told that the pharmacist had. been instructed by the owner to give him back the $11, which she had ready for him in an envelope, and his used prescription. He told her that he needed the tablets and she said that he would have to have them redispensed. The pharmacist handed the prescription back to my constituent, who then handed it back to her and asked her to redispense it. She refused to and told him to go elsewhere and have the prescription filled as she was not obliged to dispense a prescription if she did not want to.",90
121,Mr GEAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Are these professionals we are talking about?,90
122,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It appears as though this was a pretty funny professional. All of this, as my constituent points out in his letter, occurred without any sort of apology or niceness. My constituent is a very pleasant man. I cannot imagine him being at all aggressive even under this duress.",90
123,Mr GEAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,He probably needed some medication after this.,90
124,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"He probably did need medication after doing this. That is exactly right. As I said, all of this occurred without any sort of apology or niceness of manner from either the pharmacist or the assistant. The pharmacist had removed the pharmacy stickers and scribbled over any signatures and writing on the prescription record card. I obviously cannot table this prescription form, but I will hold it up just so you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker, that there are a lot of scribbles on the bottom of· this form and on the bottom of the card. Nobody, including my constituent, would have been able to present that prescription to another pharmacy to get the drug because the other pharmacist would quite tightly have thought that somebody had been tampering with the prescription-which, of course, they had. So my constituent was left with no other course of action than to go back to the doctor and ask for a new script and then go to another pharmacist. It is very awkward. He lives within walking distance of this pharmacist. He wants for his health's sake to be able to walk to the pharmacy. He does not like taking drugs. He goes to the pharmacy because he has to get the drug. I thought that it was worth drawing to the House's attention the two things that appear to have occurred. One was the item of overcharging, which in itself was bad enough; the other was the refusal of the pharmacist actually to provide the medication that my constituent required, which I believe is against the rules of the pharmaceutical benefits legislation. I am not bashing pharmacists, I hasten to say, because I.do not believe that the majority of pharmacists are acting in this way, but such incidents give their profession a very bad name. With the charge for non-pensioners being raised to $15, which will· be the result of the legislation we are discussing today, such a person could easily have been charged $15 for a very common,' relatively low-priced drug. Mr Staples-It is the lowest.",90
125,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is the lowest at $5.50, I think people should understand that those sorts of things are going on. The other matter that has been brought to my attention by constituents when discussing the changes to the provision of pharmaceuticals and the $2.50 fee for pensioners was the packaging and life of drugs. One of my pensioner constituents mentioned to me that she takes angina tablets and that the package gives a particular date of expiry. After that date the tablets which have not been taken have to be thrown away. I am not complaining about that from the pharmacy perspective; I do not think that it is the pharmacist's fault at all. But during some months a constituent with an angina condition may not use very many of the angina drugs at all. Apparently, there are 100 tablets in the packet and they have to be flushed down the toilet if they have not been used within 30 days, or whatever is the expiry period. I suggest-and I am sure that the ister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) will come across this problem in his national health .review-that there be smaller or more dIscrete pac-ages of drl:lgs that have a very short lIfe b-mg opene-. If they are packaged mdI- . VI dually or m packets of 10, up to t-e 100 figure, fe-e- would be exposed .to or whatever It IS .that destroys - helf when the packet IS opened. It IS not as bad to throw nine down the toilet as it is to throw 99 down the toilet, as this lady has done on occasion. If pensioners are being asked to pay $2.50 per prescription, as is the case in this legislation, even if is being reimbursed through the pension, it is important that people understand that what is needed are either drugs that have a reasonably long shelf life or prescriptions that are made out in such a that more care is taken to give pensioners a quantity that much more closely equates with the number that they actually reces quire for their condition. The Government has responded to the cost pressures and the improved health objectives identified by making some damental reforms in this legislation. point out that in the period 1987 to 1990 the cost of prescriptions supplied through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme creased by $412m or 56 per cent. It is quite obvious that we as a country could not continue to incur those sorts of costs without doing something about it. In the 1989-90 financial year, $10 5m of pretwo scriptions were subsidised at a cost to Federal Government of $1.2 billion. sioners on average use 27 prescriptions per year. I do not believe in averages any more than anybody else, but I think it is a pretty interesting figure just the same. Many of these people will be a little better off under the new arrangement because 27 prescriptions will cost them $67.50, while they will actually receive payments totalling $130 in a normal year through the Government's concept of increasing the pension by $2.50 per week. I have never supported the extension of a prescription fee to pensioners, but I am pleased that the Government, in doing this and in feeling it was necessary to do so, has elected to compensate pensioners Minfor the cost of their drugs. I am even more pleased to see that we now have the arrangement of a $50 supplement for maximum rate pensioners, many of whom may be chronically ill and who obviously - ft-r may have more than a $2.50 per week requirement for drugs in the initial period. I think that is excellent. It shows that the - lf Government is flexible and is responding lIfe to the needs of the electorate .. . - ecent1y, 'Yhen I. talked to people m a - etlfe-en- VIllage m my electorate, the bunchmg of drug needs was stated to be an area of con.cern. People were not really it sure whether It was. gomg to - ffect them, but they were worne- about It none the-ess. At least they WIll n0'Y .have some Idea of whether they are elIgIble for the $50 supplement. Most of the people to way whom I have s-oken w-uld be Homeswest - ena-ts, faIrly low mco-e people, and I Imagme that u!1-er the Clfcumstanth-y would be ehglbl- for t-e supplement If they. are chromcally III or are assessed as being so. Many other pensioners to whom I spoke believed that they would be okay under funthe new scheme once they understood it. I They determined to look at the drugs that they had at home before they went to the doctor and asked for new prescriptions, inand to endeavour to see what prescriptions were actually required to be filled before they went to the chemist to ascertain whether they had to pay the $2.50. They did not want to pay $5 or $7.50 for or three drugs that were just going to the sit on the shelf. The lady with angina to Penwhom I referred earlier cannot do anything about it; she has to get the drugsShe may not need to use them all, and then she has to throw the remainder away. Most of the people whom I have contacted had perhaps a few weeks supply of drugs in their cabinets. They are conscious of the fact that they should not take more than they need to, and understand that they may have to budget purchases of drugs fairly carefully to ensure that they are not overspending in that area. Pensioners were very relieved that they were going to get the extra money in their pensions whether or not they purchase drugs. I think that is an important point because it gives some little incentive to pensioners to set their money aside in case of need. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",90
126,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I want to talk mainly in connection with the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990. Before I do so, I will make a comment \yith regard to the remarks made by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen). I listened to what she was saying and I believe that in the examples she gave she was not having a go at all pharmacists. Mrs Jakobsen-No, I was not.",92
127,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I know, and she said that. I must say that the interjections from some of her colleagues would indicate that there is a deliberate attack on pharmacists around Australia. I make the point that it would be a rare profession in Australia today, including the political profession, in which there would not be a bad apple in the bunch that would discredit the lot. If we took a poll around Australia of all the professions which begin with the letter 'p', pharmacists would be at the top while politicians would be at the bottom. I warn the House that one cannot state that the example given by the honourable member represents the actions of pharmacists across Australia. I have had a long relationship with many pharmacists. I have acted as accountant to some, but more recently I have had discussions with some. I still believe that if people malign pharmacists and bring them in:1o disrepute they are losing the front door of medical attention and advice right around Australia. I give that warning. My main commynts relate to the social security aspect of the legislation. This Bill is a result of the 1990-91 Budget and also a previous economic statement. One must query the contents of that statement because we were in election mode at the time, and the statement formed part of the election campaign. Another Bill will cover other aspects of this area, such as the deeming of interest at 10 per cent on cash and investments. Even though this aspect will be covered by another Bill, I know that there is tremendous concern in the electorate that the details of this are not being spelt out. One of my colleagues said that it is okay to explain matters to a pensioner on a one-to-one basis. After two hours one can expect to have explained to the pensioner precisely what is the situation. As one of my other colleagues said, 'I have 30,000 pensioners in my electorate. How do I talk to them in terms of this matter?'. I urge that this aspect be dealt with as a matter of urgency because there is ,concern in the community. That is not to say that there is not concern about what is contained in this Bill. There is concern because this Bill contains a fundamental change in direction in two areas. One is in connection with the tax file number, and the other relates to the amnesty which will affect certain people if they come forward within the six-week period. ,It is rather interesting that the six weeks will be almost up by the time this legislation giving effect to the amnesty passes through the House. I am not sure just how successful that amnesty will be. There· are major concerns about it. I think that the public would be aware of this just by reading the recent press reports. I wish to refer to two areas. The first is the extension of the tax file number, and the second is the amnesty situation. The Bill indic tes that about $700m in savings will be effected over three years as a result of the implementation jointly of this Bill and in the one still to come. This proposed saving is in stark contrast to what the Government has been saying during the past 12 months, that fraud in the areas of skinning and management of the social security system is down to a very low level. In fact it has claimed that there is no fraud in the system. A perusal of the legislation would indicate that these measures together are designed to tackle just that one area-the fraud in the system. The Government has now put up a figure of a saving of $700m over three years. It is interesting to note that in October last year, when the Opposition introduced its Economic Action Plan, the comments made by Ministers of the Government were always to the effect that management was right, fraud was not occurring, and the savings now expected under this proposed legislation would not be forthcoming. More recently, on The 7.30 Report, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, debated with Senator Richard Alston. Senator Alston made the claim that the Department had paid out more than $214m in overpayments. That claim was made just one month before the Budget was presented. The Minister for Social Security responded that the Opposition failed to realise that this $214m was a figure which had accrued over three years. Senator Richardson stated that this figure represented overpayments, but that the recoveries amounted to $75m and so, in fact, in any 12 months there was only a $20m overpayment or fraud. Senator Richardson extrapolated that this figure represented 0.1 per cent of the total outlays incurred by the Government. He claimed that this 0.1 per cent would be a record which no private company could match. That is phenomenal. Senator Richardson said that just one month before the presentation of the Budget. This Bill forecasts a saving of $700m over three years. Bearing in mind that when Mr Howe was Minister for Social Security, he made the same claims, one has to ask how, in a period of one month, a $60m net loss in outlays has changed to a proposed saving of $700m. I think this aspect bears some close examination by the Minister, and particularly by the Government. If honourable members examine the figure of $700m they will see that in fact it represents not 0.1 per cent of the outlays in this direction, but 1.1 per cent. I hope Senator Richardson will explain to the Senate how private companies in particular would match up in keeping bad debts, as he called them, to that figure. It is expected that the amnesty will impact upon some 20,000 welfare recipients. Again, the Opposition would make the point that with the lateness of the amnesty and the lateness of this legislation to validate it, there are questions to be asked in connection with those people who exclude themselves from this amnesty. These people, who will not be exposed by this amnesty, will still be out there in the community adding quite substantially to the losses incurred. I mention three areas in this respect. It is very difficult to suggest to anyone that a person who is defrauding the system would come forward under circumstances where those who have defrauded the system or been overpaid will no longer be recipients. In the past quite a lot of people were defrauding the system, and because they will not be there on 22 August, they will not be subject to the amnesty. Obviously they will not present themselves to the Government. As well, a person who has engaged in fraud for benefit certainly will not be coming forward. The other category of person who will not be granted amnesty is a person who worked for the Department of Social Security at the time the overpayment occurred. The estimated $700m saving is a minimal figure. Members of the Opposition would like to know the estimate of the Department in connection with those who will not be coming forward. The estimates that have been presented within the framework of this Budget and the explanatory notes suggest that the $20m mentioned by the Minister as late as July of this year was woefully understated. I do not say the amount was deliberately understated, but perhaps the Minister should take a closer interest in the affairs of his Department. I would now like to deal with the tax file number, which is another interesting concept. Honourable members have heard today that the Government views this extension of the tax file number to be quite normal because it will control the aspect of declaration of income as far as social security benefits are concerned. There are several aspects to this matter. Firstly, at the time of his press release on 25 May 1988 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said this: The Australian Tax Office will be the only ernment agency which uses the tax file number for the purposes of identifying and registering its client base. In other words, the tax file number was to apply to taxpayers, and taxpayers only. The Treasurer also said: The essential purpose for extending the tax number is to improve the efficiency of the income matching system. That was quite logical, too. Use of the tax file number would enable the Tax to match interest, dividends and income with the final return of the taxpayer. The Treasurer continued: The tax file number system will be administered exclusively by the ATO for tax purposes. That is what the Treasurer said in that particular press release. We might then look at what happened with regard to the interim guidelines and amendments to Privacy Act that took place at that time. The interim guidelines were introduced ensure that the tax file number was used as a national identification system by whatever means. The honourable member for Cowan was quite definite that we on this side of the House regarded the tax file number identification number. I am not sure that it is not, and the concern is felt not only among .opposition members, but also right throughout the community. Those guideLiberties lines stated: Government agencies, including the Commissioner of Taxation, shall not directly or indirectly disclose or use tax file numbers, information cross-match information about a person, except in authorised circumstances, for example sure to an agency or person in specified cases expressly provided by the Parliament. Those were the disclaimers that were made at that time. Then, on 1 September 1988, the Treasurer, in his second reading speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill, said: No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of its own. The Treasurer said that the Government had agreed to accept amendments that were designed to guarantee that the tax Govfile numbering system was completely voluntary. One wonders to what extent disciplines are applied to prevent unauthorised users taking advantage of the voluntary nature of the tax file number. As I understand it, there is no compulsion to declare a tax file number and file the only penalty for non-disclosure is that ATO's the taxpayer does not receive the benefit of the lower rate of tax. So, there are indirect benefits to be obtained from proOffice viding a tax file number. As to the tax file number extension, particularly as it relates to these Bills, as I understand it, the additional public servants and those people outside the Australian Taxation Office who will have access to the tax file number of an individual are now the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) the with 12,000 employees and the Department of Social Security with 16,000. That to is a massive extension of the use of the not tax file number. The Privacy Commissioner himself has publicly stated that it is a misnomer to continue to call this a tax file number. It is in every respect, I believe, what Australians fear and what they rejected two years ago, that is, that as an it is an identification in itself. The Australian Privacy Foundation and the New South Wales Council of Civil are opposed to the extension of this measure. They point out that the Government is actually now following the _ advice of the Health Insurance Commisto sion in 1985 in its outline plan for a national identification system which recdiscloommended that in order to minimise adverse pu\:>lic reaction-which is a handy way of saying that it had to keep the people quiet and happy-there would be a staged approach for implementation whereby only less sensitive data are held in the system initially, with a facility input additional data at a later stage when public acceptance may be forthcoming more readily. If that is not a backdoor approach to using an identification system in the manner in which the Government is doing, I would like to - be advised otherwise. Even at the time this was introduced, the Opposition was assured that, accordtrying ing to the Tax Office, the sole purpose of the tax file number would be to apprefraudulent hend those people who do not disclose their full incomes, and that obviously would have been for taxation purposes. This stands starkly in contrast to what Senator Tate told the Senate on 22 Audone· gust, at Budget time, that the ure is not intended to detect tax evasion-in other words, it has nothing to do with taxation-but rather is to sure that income payments are based corsomething rectly on the amount of other income derived by the recipients. This, of course, has led the Privacy Commissioner to state quite publicly: I am most concerned that pensioners are being caught up in an operation of the tax file for purposes that are not in any way connected with the tax itself. Understandably, Australians were apprebe hensive about the Australia Card. I am sure that they will be apprehensive about this flow-on. I would like to bring into the debate the press release issued by Senator Alston in the other House .. It said that the Opposition would .need to be convinced, after having the guidelines properly brought down by the Privacy Commissioner and having this matter of the tax file number examined by a Senate Select Committee, before it proceeded to allow this part the legislation to flow on. Of course, will be done in the Senate. I point out another aspect of this issue. The Senate in its day built up a lot of expertise in relation to the identification card, the Medicare card and the tax file number. In fact, it is interesting that Janine Haines, then a Democrats senator, was vigorously opposed to the extension of the tax file number. Senator Puplick at that time was also vigilant in that regard. to A suggestion from the Democrats at this stage is that if the Bill flows through the normal procedure of a Senate committee, there will be the same result. I hesitate to say that that will be the case. We need a Senate select committee whose sole responsibility is to assure us that the extension of the tax file number in this way will not offend the civil liberties we are to protect. That will happen in the Senate. We want to make sure that the practices of others are stopped, but we also want to make sure that the sloppiness of this Government's administration of social security and these payments is corrected. Perhaps this can be in another way. Such a review, we new measbelieve; is necessary. Another aspect of this legislation that I want to deal with quickly is the right to enaccommodation for life. We need .to do about this, because the 10 per 'cent deemed income will flow in connection with another Act. I put the situation of a person's entry contribution to a hostel where that person gets accommodation, although perhaps not for life. That number contribution is normally in .the form of an interest-free loan. I would like to know whether from this point onwards that will deemed to be earning a 10 per cent rate of income, even though it is in there on a contractual basis. Will that be declared as deemed income and the person's pension reduced, just for the right to accommodation? That is not spelt out. Loans, including debentures and bonds, are going to be dealt with later on. Again, the 10 per cent deeming arises. I think it is very important to consider country people. A lot of family farms are being sold down the drain by the economic of measures of this Government, and the that Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, cannot be excluded from responsibility in this regard. There are family farms in this country where it is not possible, in handing down that farm to the next generation, to get any immediate remuneration at all. A lot of those transfers will neces- complain. sarily have to be on the basis of no interest. Again, I think we have to ask the Government to make sure that in specific cases such as those-and it is one that I know the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has long argued about as far as the assets test is concerned-we do not doubly penalise those people by putting on the 10 per cent deeming provision. Another aspect of the Bill deals with the increase in the gifts provision from $2,000 to $10,000, but with a five-year retention of the nominal value instead of a diminution over lO years. I think this will considerably improve the mechanisms for the implementation of the Bill. This Bill appears to us to be necessary because of the sloppiness of this Government and its assertions in the past that everything was right, everything was cut to the bone, all the fraud and evasion .had been cleared up. In fact this was never the case, as this Bill now testifies. I like to believe that the Government will take some corrective action to try to'implement programs that do not require these draconian methods.",92
128,Mr SCIACCA,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (5.57)-I rise to support fully the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). We have heard from at least two speakers from the Opposition, particularly as to the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) as well as to some of the social security aspects of the Bill,. namely, the new rules with respect to deprivation of assets and low interest loans. We have heard about the amnesty that has been declared and which concludes on 2 October, and we have heard the usual whingeing and whining from the Opposition. Those opposite tell us all the time that we need to make changes in the administration of the Department of Social Security. They say that we are being too liberal in our administration of the funds of the department and yet, when we try to do something about it, they come here and On the one hand they tell us that we are bashing pensioners, we are doing this and that; at the same time, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his reply to the Budget Speech, they say that we do not go far enough in our cuts, that we should have cut three times as much off the social security budget. Frankly, it is becoming fairly obvious to me that whatever this Government does in any area will always receive criticism from the Opposition, even when such criticism is not warranted. I saw and heard the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) talk today about how much the pharmacists have been hurt by some of these changes because there is going to be more work for them. I remember last year, of course, that the pharmacists themselves had an ongoing campaign against this Goverp ment, which thankfully did not get them would anywhere. In fact, in my own electorate of Bowman where they targeted me by door-knocking, as they did to a number of other members, I am happy to say that my vote increased by two and a half per cent. To be truthful, I am not all that concerned about the pharmacists. Frankly, if they end up having to do a little bit of extra work then, as far as I am concerned they should do some extra work. There are not too many of them who are starving and there are not too many of them who have not got Volvos, Mercedes and all the rest of it. I have no tears for them and I think that the Opposition should take the same attitude. What have we done with respect to the PBS changes? We have simply made sure that the ever burgeoning cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is stemmed to some degree. The fact is that in the last three to four years there has been a doubling of the amount that this Government has spent on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme was an initiative of a previous Labor government, and it is a scheme that obviously should be kept. But, of course, if we have an abuse of the scheme, eventually the whole thing would collapse. There is no doubt that had this Government not taken these rather hard decisions-because they are hard to explain, particularly to pensioner groups-then in three, four or five years time, and certainly in a decade or so, we would have seen the pharmaceutical benefits scheme completely demolished from the scheme we know today. What really upset me-and I am not usually upset that much-is when the honourable member for Lowe talked about the changes that have recently been announced. We heard the screams from the Opposition, 'What about the chronically ill? What is the Government going to do about those· pensioners who need their prescriptions over three months?'. Although pensioners are being compensated at the rate of $2.50 per week, the fact is that the Government has recognised after listening to the public that a certain nunigreatly ber of pensioners would be disadvantaged simply because they had to find the·money early as a result of the number of scripts that might be needed. So what happens? The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), in his talks around the country to many thousands of pensioners, came to the realisation that there was a flaw in the system which was being proposed. He fought fairly long and hard, eventually with the cooperation of everybody involved, to do something about it. I am very happy to say that yesterday it was announced that a safety net has been introduced in order to look after the chronically ill. Senator Richardson took a fair bit of trouble, because when budgetary decisions like this are taken no-one obviously wants to change the system quickly. What happened? The honourable member for Lowe called him ' Mr Jellyback'. I am sure that Senator Richardson has been called worse and that he will be called worse names than that in the future, but if he is to be called Mr Jellyback simply because he has addressed the concerns of many thousands of people who spoke to him, and also to me in my capacity as his Parliamentary Secretary in meetings I have conducted throughout the whole country, then frankly I do not think that we need worry too much about the sorts of criticisms that we got from the honourable member for Lowe today. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentioned that the fraud and abuse of the social security system is perhaps worse than the Minister previously stated. The fact is that abuse and fraud of the social security system is nowhere near as bad as people make out. The Opposition normally criticises this Government and has always tried to assert that wholesale fraud exists in the social security system. Being such a large department with a large budget, there will always be those out there who will try to abuse the system if they can, but the checks and balances that this Government has introduced, particularly over the last two to three years, have proved to be very effective, and fraud of the system has been curtailed over the last three to four years. However, anybody would have to admit that in a department that spends over $20 billion, which is something like a quarter of total Government outlays, there will always be a propensity for people to deliberately defraud the Department. That propensity also exists for those people who get themselves onto a treadmill. A person's circumstances may change or a sole parent may well get into a relationship and for the first four or five weeks or months may not know whether the relationship will continue. They do not let the Department know of the situation. Perhaps an old age pensioner who is receiving income over and above the allowable limits will find themselves in a situation where they did not say anything for the first couple of months because they thought that this income would not be coming in on a regular basis. Of course, those people are obviously going to be frightened to come to the Department of Social Security and say, 'Look, I have been doing the wrong thing. Can you forgive me?'. The fact is that there is no provision in the Act for us to forgive those sorts of things. . The Government allowed an amnesty, which to date has proved to be fairly successful. Many hundreds of calls have been coming through on the hot lines. The Department of Social Security believes that as 2 October gets closer more and more people will avail themselves of the opportunity to come in and see us, come clean and tell us that really it was one of those things that they did not really mean. If we encourage voluntary compliance, surely, that is the way to do it. We have been criticised for the extension of the tax file numbers, computer matching and so forth, but we are trying to bring voluntary compliance into the system. We believe that this amnesty will go a long way towards achieving that level of voluntary compliance which I believe should be reached by the Department. If one is to consider the amount of money that is lost by way of fraud and abuse, I can assure honourable members that, in the overall context, irrespective the amounts mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson, the amounts are extremely low in percentage terms when considered in the overall Budget. Indeed, I think that any business, either large or small, that had the same percentage loss owing to fraud and abuse of the system as the Department of Social Security would be more than happy with the amount involved. We are hopeful that the amnesty will in fact provide a lot of voluntary compliance. It is not meant for people who have defrauded the Department deliberately or who have made applications for benefits to which they were clearly not entitled. The amnesty is meant for those people who did not want to come to us because they were concerned that they not only would have to pay us back but in some cases might be risking gaol. These Bills touch on the question of the new provisions for deeming of deprived assets and moneys loaned at low interest. The honourable member for Dawson correctly stated that another Act will come in at some time in the not too distant future that will look at the provisions for deeming of interest on cash and savings and deposits in banks. I mention that not because they are not in this Bill but because I agree with the honourable member for Dawson that there is a great deal of concern out there in the community on the question of deeming of incomes. At the moment, if a single pensioner gives away $2,000 or a couple $4000, that is an allowable amount that they can gift out. At the moment they can deprive themselves of those amounts. That is being increased to $10,000 each year. That means that anybody can give away up to $10,000 per year and not be affected in any way by the assets test or have that amount looked at for the purpose of calculating pension or benefit entitlements. The Government believes that that is a fairly good concession, as mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson, to rural people. In effect, it means that a pensioner couple or a single pensioner can now give away a fair bit of money in of today's value terms. Mr Wilson-Is it to be indexed?",96
129,Mr SCIACCA,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"As I say, $10,000 a year over a period of five years is $50,000. That is a fair bit of money for anyone to be allowed to give away. It must be remembered, though, that these deprivation provisions allow for the deeming of moneys given away exceeding the $10,000 limit, at the rate of 10 per cent. For instance, if somebody gives away $50,000 in one year, the first $10,000 will be okay but the next $40,000 will be deemed to be earning an interest component of 10 per cent for the full five years. It is important for people to remember that it is a basic change to the deprivation rules. At present a single pensioner may give away $2,000, or a couple may give away $4,000, without coming under the provisions of the existing legislation. Anything above that gets discounted every year at the rate of 10 per cent, and at the end of 10 years it is completely wiped from the books. Under the new provisions pensioners will be able to give away $10,000, instead of the limit being only $2,000 or $4,000, but anything above that will be deemed to be earning 10 per cent for the full period of five years, with no discounting allowed each year. Members on the Government side of the House believe that that is a fair balance, when one takes into account that there is to be a hefty increase in the amount of money that people will be allowed to give away. For far too long people have been giving away money, depriving themselves of assets, simply so that they could qualify for benefits under the social security system. That system is tailor-made for those who need it; it is the basis for income support and for those who need support. It is not a milch cow that can be milked to the extent that those with large amounts of money can simply arrange their affairs in such a way that they can receive the pension. One of the major changes mentioned in the .context of deeming income and the deprivation of assets is that we do have to move away from the old notion that the pension was a right: even if one were a millionaire, one nevertheless was entitled to receive the pension virtually by way of superannuation. We need to get away from that concept these days, given that the population is ageing, there is a smaller tax base, and the birth rate is extremely low. Sooner or later the system had to be changed so that it was more difficult for those who did not need income support to obtain that support. I believe that these provisions are - uch that that aim will be achieved. It will not happen overnight. I know that a lot of people in the community are concerned about these provisions. At the end of the day they will realise that the whole of society in this country will be better off. In the last few minutes available to me I wanted to mention the deeming provisions on cash accounts and deposit accounts. Although that is not referred to in the Bill, it is a matter that should be mentioned because everywhere I go people ask me, as I am sure they ask other members-",98
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member has drawn my attention to the fact that the subject is not dealt with in the Bills, I hope he will be able to relate it to this measure.",99
131,Mr SCIACCA,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I will, because deeming and deprivation of assets are notional matters. The Government is saying that henceforth people will have to make the best possible use of their money because, if they do not, it will be deemed to be liable to the 10 per cent deprivation. Given that deeming is part of this Bill in so far as it relates to the question of deprivation of assets, in the time available to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will allow me the indulgence of being able to tell the pensioner population not to be concerned. All of them who are affected by these provisions will be better off ultimately. No-one will be worse off, apart from the banks and financial institutions which for far too long have been making hay while the sun shone. The sun is not shining any more; at least it will not shine as from 1 March 1991. That is probably one of the best things the Government could have done. I admit that when these notions of deeming were first spoken of, I started to become confused. I knew that it would be difficult to explain this type of change to the public. But after listening to discussion and seeing examples, realising that it was something that was fair and equitable and that the only real losers would be the banks and financial institutions, frankly I then said that it was not such a bad idea. As I have been travelling around the country and moving amongst my own constituents I have been trying to convince people of that fact. I feel that these changes will be something like the assets tests. There was a hue and cry from the Opposition and from the community, but after a couple of years when everyone realised that at least 95 per cent of people were not affected, they accepted those changes. Even the Opposition in its own policies has no real thoughts of abolishing the assets test. I support fully the thrust of these Bills. I believe their provisions, particularly regarding pharmaceutical benefits, are good changes. No-one will be worse off as a result of them. Those who may have been worse off have now been fixed up.",99
132,Mr WILSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I shall speak in this debate abo.ut the implications of the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill in relation to the assets and income test. I hope that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) will acknowledge the sincerity with which views are put by me, and have been put by me over many years in this Parliament. I believe in relation to the age pension that the approach that has been adopted by the Government, that is adopted by my own colleagues, is, in the long term interests of a sensible retirement incomes policy, a mistaken approach. The imposition of means tests, whether they be income tests, assets tests, or deeming tests, distorts people's expenditure patterns, savings patterns, work· patterns and retirement patterns. This legislation is yet another in a series of patch-up jobs. I have no problem in accepting the need to achieve consistency. I have no problem in saying that if there is to be a means test, it must operate fairly on those in like circumstances. But I do not believe that the gaps can be closed adequately. I want to illustrate that in my remarks this evening. Before doing so I remind the House that a number of years ago a double means test operated. There was a separate test on income and a separate test on assets. The two tests overlapped, and if one had assets and got income from them, one was doubly deprived of pension entitlement. Then there came a time when the combined means test was introduced. That was an integration of the income test and the assets test. I wonder whether some policy advisers within the Department of Social Security got out the history books, because the combined means test had a deeming provision. Surprise, surprise! The deeming provision was to make the assumption that the assets earned an income of 10 per cent. In this legislation, and some other legislation which I hear may be introduced later on, is a proposal that we have a deeming provision in respect of particular types of assets, that is, cash in the bank, or cash-Malcolm Fraser's 'cash under the bed'. That cash will be deemed to be earning 10 per cent income and people's pension entitlements will be adjusted accordingly. Is this legislation not a step toward the reintroduction of the pre-Guilfoyle combined means test, when every a-,set above $2,000 was given a deemed income of 10 per cent? I hope that the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) can give some clarification on that question, but I somehow doubt it. I believe she will leave uncertainty in the minds of pensioners and those people approaching retirement as to whether or not their investments in equity shares, land or personal effects above the specified limit will one day be brought into account by this Government in determining their pension entitlement. It would be logical to take those steps in order to stop distortion in people's social, investment, savings and expenditure behaviour. But in taking those steps what the Government will forget, I am sure, is that many people, prior to reaching retirement age, receive substantial tax concessions in respect of their retirement provisions. I come back to where I started in advocating a universal approach. I have always believed that the simplest, fairest and most sensible way of ensuring that all Australians have retirement incomes at an adequate minimum level is to make them universally available to men and women who attain the age of 65. It should be made part of their taxable income as it is today. Many people who have substantial assets and other income would pay upwards of 50 per cent of it back in tax; but at least if all people received that entitlement they would then behave in a normal, sensible fashion with regard to their pre-retirement expenditure pattern, their savings and investment pattern and their post-retirement expenditure pattern, which they do not do now. One may say, 'All right, that becomes too expensive' but let us recognise the fact that the great majority of people who reach retirement with an income, assets or both which deny them any entitlement to a pension, have probably received, during their working lives, tax sheltering and tax concessions far greater in value than the capital value of a pension paid to someone reaching retirement age who has nothing. We need to examine the facts. Tables that are publicly available show that one can buy an indexed pension for a man or a woman aged 65 years at a pension rate of 20 per cent of average weekly earnings for about twice to three times average weekly earnings. That means that if average yearly earnings are $25,000, one can buy a 20 per cent pension for life, as from age 65, for between $50,000 and $75,000. The great majority of those of us in House who will reach retirement with tax sheltered superannuation arrangements, the great majority of the Public Service who will reach retirement with tax sheltered retirement provisions and the great majority of those who now, under the 3 per cent and 6 per cent awards will, in fact, reach retirement with assets in excess of the pension limits, will have received tax sheltering or concessionseither directly or through their employers, because they get the payments without it being attributed as part of their wages-to a value far greater than the capital value of the pension that we offer to people who have no assets or income at retirement. My proposition, therefore, is that if we want to bring rationality into our retirement incomes system, we should not be patching up 10 per cent deeming provisions for deprived assets, or 10 per .cent deeming provisions for money sitting in bank accounts. We should be looking at the broad picture and we should be asking the question: Is it the responsibility of Parliament to ensure that people reach retirement with an adequate minimum income? The answer to that question would be yes. Should that adequate minimum income be earnings related or a flat rate? Is it the responsibility of individuals to make the different adjustment between their earnings and the flat rate pension, or should other, poorer taxpayers be subsidising those on high incomes so that those on high incomes can retire with tax sheltered provisions on incomes which are earnings related? I do not believe so. I think we should be saying that if a pension is worth, in capital purchase price terms, $75,000 or three times average weekly earnings for a man aged 65 years, the amount of tax sheltering available to any person for whom superannuation is being provided should be limited to three times average weekly earnings in real dollar terms. But that is not happening. This Government is introducing legislation which is, in fact, going to harm and hurt a large number of people who have been prudent over their working lives, and who did not have the benefit of superanthis nuation. What we should be doing at this time is looking at the broader issues; at the implications of superannuation being available for the work force at large and whether or not the tax sheltering that is available to individual employees will give a fair result to all such employees as they reach retirement. It is my view that, just as we have had a universal flat rate pension, we should have a universal flat rate tax concession for those who build up assets from which they get a stream of income in retirement. There is another area, too, that the Government should be looking at. It has gone along with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in allowing retirement at age 55. What people will, and are, doing is retiring early and using up their retirement assets from their superannuation schemes so that when they reach age 65 they are below assets test limits, income test limits, and deemed income test limits. Yet today we tinker at the edge and say that people must invest in investments that yield 10 per cent interest or more if their money is in the bank; but we do not assure them that if they put their money into equity stocks and they receive only 5 per cent interest, they will not be penalised in next year's Keating Budget. I seek an assurance from the Minister that these deeming provisions are once only and are limited specifically to cash amounts in bank accounts and will not be spread to other assets. If we spread them to other assets, we should then examine the broader picture, including some of the issues to which I have referred today.",100
133,Unknown,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,102
134,Mr WILSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"-efore the dinner suspension I was m'aking some comments on the Social SecuritY""and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amerid-ent Bill. One of the purposes of - this BJJlis to change arrangements that apply under the income and assets tests to· require pensioners who make gifts to members of their family or in other ways ,to bring into account a deemed value of: the amount of that gift over a threshold. sum. In commenting on it I tried to put the moves being made to achieve fairness . within' an income tested, assets tested pension arrangement. I drew attention to the' fact that I believe the whole income. and assets tests approach is basically flawed b\!cause only a proportion of the retirees, when they reach the age of retirement, are l?n:ii-led to age pensions. As a consequence of that, and as a result of the type oftests that we apply, we create a situation jn which the net effective marginal rate·of tax borne by many pensioners isweU' iJ:), excess of 60c in the dollar. As a cori$equence of that and the deprivation that' they feel, many of them seek to adjust their circumstances. We delude ourselves if, we do not believe that intelligent citizen,S will not rearrange their affairs in anticipation of being confronted, or evert i,lfter they are confronted, by assets and income tests. They can rearrange their am-its by adjusting their earnings and the amount of time they work in the lead-up to retirement; by saving less; or by investing in various types of investments which are not caught by the assets test or which, because of their income, are not affected by the income test. They can vary their expenditure-for example, go on expensive trips overseas, many of which they do not really need. I do not believe that this House should resent any penSioner who, out of hardearned savings or postponed expenditure, is able to go overseas. What upsets me greatly is when people make a trip overseas for no other purpose than that they believe they should be entitled to an age pension or, if not 'an age pension, to the so-called fringe bel1efits, a passport which this Parliament, through its legislation, gives to pensioners and which entitles them to a huge range of state delivered, local government delivered and even privately delivered benefits which, if the pensioners do not hold the fringe benefit card, they do not become entitled to. Many people see this card as a valuable item. I was also drawing to the attention of the House the fact that, when people reach 65 years of age, what this Parliament is in fact conferring upon those who have no assets and no income is a pension with a capitalised value of between twice and three times average weekly earnings-between $50,000 and $75,000. In this atmosphere of privatisation we might well say, 'Why does not the Government purchase out in the commercial sector a pension from a secure, prudentially tested organisation that gives to the pensioner the sort of pension that now comes from the Government?'. My concern is that there are many who get that $75,000 worth of pension when they reach the age of 65, but there are others who are denied that pension because we say that they are not in need. Many of them, particularly those now reaching the retiring age, have saved out of after-tax dollars. But there are others who have not saved out of their after-tax dollars and who had more than $50,000 or $75,000 of tax concessions conferred upon them through the superannuation arrangements that we have in this country. The superannuation tax concessions are earnings related. The pension scheme is a flat rate-a standard basic pension for all. It does not matter what income one had before reaching retirement. We justify this legislation that is tightening the assets and income test-maybe in a small way making it a little fairer, if it is fair at all-whilst at the same time we ignore the fact that huge tax concessions that are paid for by other taxpayers who are not making that provision through superannuation arrangements are made available as a consequence of the contributions by employers to superannuation schemes being tax deductable, as a consequence of some contributions by employees themselves to superannuation funds being tax deductable, and as a consequence of the income received by superannuation funds being significantly tax sheltered. I know that some big changes have been made. The treatment of the superannuation provision in tax terms is not as generous as it used to be, but it is still generous. I am arguing that all Australians should be treated alike. We should be developing a system where, at the age of 65, every Australian shall be entitled to $75,000 worth of retirement income resources. If it is taken at the age of 25 or 35 through tax concessions, it should not be available at 65 years of age. In spite of the Government's rhetoric about withdrawing the pension from people who are not in need, it does nothing about that large army of retirees who retire at the age of 55, invest their lump sum in up-market houses, have their money sheltered in assets test-income test free investments at the time they reach the age of 65, and use reverse . mortgages to be able to maintain their standard of living., - having benefited from huge tax relief over their working years. The Government gives them that tax relief, yet brings down tough income assets tests which have a very high marginal rates of tax effect on those who have saved out of their after tax income. The system is unfair, and while it remains unfair people will continue to adjust their affairs to take advantage of the system to optimise their position in retirement.",102
135,Mrs CROSIO,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) being debated cognately in the House tonight. I will particularly pay attention to the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. This Bill will virtually give effect to the Government's reforms already announced in the Budget regarding the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The scheme was introduced by a Labor Government 40 years ago. It has operated as a universal subsidy program which gives every Australian access to a wide range of drugs. There are some 1,700 items available under the scheme at present. Regardless of the expense of a drug, the maximum that is paid for it is currently $11. What can only be described as a cost blow-out has highlighted inherent weaknesses in the scheme and, thus, the Government has decided on significant reforms for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The reforms, and thus this Bill before the House, have two main objectives-to contain cost pressures which were threatening the survival of the PBS and, most importantly, to improve people's health through a more appropriate use of drugs. In my opinion, these objectives are of equal importance. Over the past year or so the escalating cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been drawn to the attention of the community by numerous media reports, in particular the fact that the cost of the scheme doubled in the last four years and was to double again over the next three years. Further, in response to the Budget, most of the media commentary focused on the money that was to be saved by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme reforms, estimated to be in the vicinity of $240m in a full year. As a consequence, the perception in the community is that the reforms were simply motivated by cost pressures. What has not been widely acknowledged-and, I think, needs to be acknowledged-is that, ironically, the system of free drugs for pensioners has resulted in a health problem. As the Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) pointed out in his second reading speech, there is increasing concern amongst health care professionals about the amount of ill health which occurs through the inappropriate use of medication. The Minister also alluded to evidence that a significant number of hospital admissions of elderly people were for drugrelated illnesses. Almost one in four pensioners admitted to hospital suffers from illnesses associated with adverse drug reaction. A study done in 1989 and reported in the Melbourne Herald on 5 September not only showed this to be the case but also clearly demonstrated that because our elderly are taking multiple medications-and, of course, I am talking about a group of people who were brought up to believe the old cliche, waste not, want not-they are really suffering from the consequences. The same article reported that, in 1987, 40 per cent of hospital admissions due to poisoning were related to pharmaceuticals such as minor tranquillisers, 26 per cent; pain killers, per cent; and anti-depressants, 6 per cent. People who are now aged 65 and over are the most rapidly growing age group within Australia and are the largest consumers of prescribed and non-prescribed drugs. These people, while accounting for something like 9.2 per cent of our present population, now consume in the vicinity of 25 per cent of prescribed drugs in any one year. That article that I referred to earlier reported a very interesting story. It stated that an elderly lady, who took from her purse a plastic pill container with a rainbow mixture of medications, said, 'I forget which one of my doctors gave me those little white ones-they are either for my nerves or my heart--nd I don't remember how often to take them, but as they are expensive I only take them when I need them.' This is happening time and time again within our community. While we have a system that provides free drugs and, therefore, provides no incentive for people to question doctors about whether they really need another prescription and whether that medication is the most. effective way to deal with their problem, there is the potential for drug abuse. In the last financial year our Commonwealth Government spent over $30m on the national campaign against drug abuse; this year, more than $33m will be spent. The objective of that campaign is to reduce the harmful effects of drug use, both licit and illicit, on Australian this end, millions of dollars have been spent on educating the Australian community about the extent of the drug problem and about the dangers of the use and abuse of legal and illegal drugs. To my mind, the effectiveness of the national campaign against drugs is diminished while ever we run a pharmaceutical benefits scheme system which creates a potential for drug abuse. . It is expected that the $2.50 charge on prescriptions will encourage people, especially older people, to question their doctor about their drug intake and appropriate treatment for their particular 9 problems. In this way, problems arising from misuse of drugs and drug waste may be minimised. To complement this initiative, over $3m will now be spent on an education campaign amongst not only doctors and pharmacists but also pensioners and other beneficiaries. I am sure that everyone in this House is well aware that it is proposed to increase pensions by $2.50 a week to compensate for the $2.50 charge on prescriptions. I accept the Minister's calculation that, as pensioners use on average 27 prescriptions per year, they will spend $67.50 and, as they will receive $130 in increased pension, they will in fact be $62.50 better off. However, as has now been acknowledged, these calculations did not account for the chronically ill. I appreciated the assurance of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) to the Senate on 24 August that he was aware of pensioners' concerns regarding the reforms, especially those pensioners who require many drugs, and his undertaking that the issue will be further examined. Yesterday's announcement of changes to address these concerns is most welcome. The lump sum of $50 pharmaceutical supplement and the arrangements whereby further advances on pension can be obtained will go a long way to ensuring that the chronically ill are not disadvantaged in the short term by the introduction of the $2.50 charge for prescription drugs to society. To take effect in November. The concerns for the chronically ill were well founded. Let me give an example of one of my constituents. This person is an invalid pensioner who has breast cancer. The cancer has spread to her spine, hips, pelvis and upper legs, one of which is being held together with a steel rod and wires to enable her to walk. She also has osteoarthritis all over her body and has an immune system which has significantly deteriorated. When my constituent's health is stable she obtains 19 prescriptions a month. If she contracts even a minor infection, she requires many more. Apparently, every attempt has been made by her physician to cut back her drug intake. But obviously my constituent is extremely ill. It would have taken my constituent just under three months to reach that $130 safety net. Representations have been made in respect of not only this case but also other cases that other members would have raised with the Minister for Social Security. Without the changes that have now been implemented, she would have been out of pocket for about nine months of every year. Drugs can prevent, control and treat illness. But they are powerful in both beneficial and detrimental ways. International organisations such as our World Health Organisation have been working towards a universal principle that will ensure that drugs are safe, are manufactured to the highest standards and are prescribed and used correctly. It has been stated that Australia ranks amongst the highest in its consumption of medicinal drugs. Our consumption rate is one achievement I do not believe we can .be proud of. In conclusion on this particular part of the debate, I want to emphasise some points. First, the Hawke Labor Government is committed to retaining the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as' an equitable, efficient social welfare program. Secondly, the reforms to the scheme are based on two objectives-to protect people's health and to contain cost. In the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill before the House, the insertion of that proposed new section 52A concerning the tax file number was not a secret. It was announced during the February economic statement as well as being re-announced in the Budget. It is a logical extension to what has been in place since November 1989, covering unemployment and sickness benefits, as well as those people receiving job search allowance. From 1 October 1990, sole parent pensioners and recipients of family allowance supplement will require a tax file number. How many of us have heard or been informed in our electorates of someone who knows someone who is getting two pensions? How often have we heard the cry, 'Why should these people be receiving them when I am working, and not getting such benefits?' I believe that this amendment will certainly prevent the double dipping. Senator Richardson has stated that the computer matching between various government agencies will be done in accordance with the privacy principles. I believe that what has been implemented in the changes in the legislation is just and proper, and the community at large will accept the amendments. I certainly commend the Bills to the House, and feel very confident of the electorate at large accepting them.",103
136,Mr MACKELLAR,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Warringah) (8.22)While the Opposition is not opposing the main provisions of this Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill, there are aspects of it which sl).ould not pass through this House without comment, and of course they have received quite a bit of attention from the shadow Minister. A somewhat overlooked provision is for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to give effect to remuneration agreements between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, or other pharmacists' organisations. The provision is: . .. to terminate any inquiry, whether completed or not, where an agreement is in force; and not to hold any inquiries whether completed or not, where an agreement is in force unless the agreement requires it. That is fairly convoluted but, put quite simply, it means the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will in this instance become a mere rubber stamp for government and its deals with the Pharmacy Guild or any other industry umbrella body that might emerge from time to time. I know that there are many pharmamittee cists-perhaps a majority at the present time-who would look back over recent years at the performance of and feel that their industry would be better served by a tribunal which largely comes subordinate to the wishes of the Government and the pharmacy industry. That is quite understandable and, given past circumstances where the Tribunal not always acted with the degree of indepoint pendence it should, pharmacists can be forgiven for believing they would be betresulted ter off with administrative arrangements that provide for important remuneration matters to be negotiated directly between the Government of the day and the naCommittee tional body or bodies representing Ausnot tralia's pharmacists. I have a great number of reservations about the proposed new arrangements feel very strongly that pharmacists would have been better served by a restructuring of the Tribunal's membership and a particular strengthening of its independence. In saythe ing that, I admit to having a particular interest in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal because it was set up by the Fraser Government in 1981 when I was the Minister. It is relevant to this debate to look back to 1981 to conreview sider the circumstances that caused the Government of the day and the Pharmacy Guild to then regard the establishment an independent remuneration review prosuggest cedure to be a very significant achieveare ment. I do not suppose it will come as any surprise to my parliamentary colleagues and to Australia's pharmacists if I point out that the Tribunal was established in 1981 after what can only be described as several years of increasingly difficult and very vexatious relationships between the Government and the Guild over the queswith tion of acceptable remuneration levels. The concept of an independent came in part from a recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which felt that such a tribunal would preferable to the pricing arrangements the former Joint Committee on Pharmathe ceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. The framework within which the Combunal had operated had not been successful and all parties felt dissatisfaction with its apparent inability to come to acthe Tribunal ceptable decisions. To illustrate the unsatisfactory state of beaffairs at that time, I mention that there had been three inquiries into pharmacy earnings, costs and profits since 1964-65. None of those inquiries had been able to has bring the Guild and the Government to a of agreement. The last inquiry was conducted for the year 1977-78 and that in an interim settlement, part of which was an agreement to conduct a study of alternative methodologies for determining remuneration. Within the Joint framework at that time it was possible to reach agreement on any particular methodology. That led directly to the Government's decision to establish and a new and independent review mechanism-it was called the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. For a reason I stress that aspect of Tribunal: its independence. That is an absolutely crucial point in what we are discussing at this particular time. It is interesting to reflect on the similarity of circumstances between 1981 and 1990: the dissatisfaction with the existing mechanism, the disagreements over costing methodologies and the culmination of this in the establishment of new of procedures. Government members might that those circumstances in 1990 proof in themselves of the failure of the independent tribunal approach to work successfully and therefore of the need for change. I do not believe that to be the case. I believe that it should be suggested that it was not the failure of the Tribunal itself that has led to the changes proposed in this legislation but the inability of the Tribunal to perform its review functions the required level of independence, quite frankly, because of political interfertribunal ence with its operation. It is significant that the most important advantage we saw in the Tribunal apbe proach in 1981 was that it removed the of question of chemists' remuneration from political arena. That had bedevilled the discussions over many years. The Triwas to have sole responsibility for the determination of remuneration levels and its decisions, most importantly, were binding on both parties. From the chemists' point of view, it provided for a regular adjustment of their remuneration by an independent body with a guaranteed minimum review at least annually. In view of the difficult lations between government and the industry caused by the previous political procedures, another important advantage of the Tribunal was its provision of an independent forum in which all interested parties could publicly argue their case and be confident that the merits or otherwise would be given due consideration. It was not just one body representing all the pharmacists. It gave the opportunity for other interested individuals and groups to put forward their propositions to, as I say at that stage, an independent tribunal. At that time Keith MCKenzie was appointed the first Chairman and was joined by Messrs Richard Boyer and Harold Neil. There was absolutely no doubt as to the independence of that first Tribunal. Then we come to 1983 when the Hawke Government came to office, only two years after the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal came into operation. It is no coincidence that the Tribunal's declining impartiality went hand in hand with the re-emergence of difficulties between the Government and chemists over costing methodologies, remuneration levels and industry structuring-indeed, all the things that were occurring in the 1970s and could have been remedied in the 1980s by a truly independent tribunal. In 1981 the Government and chemists were in agreement that the solution to this problem was to transfer the decision making process to an independent body. Because that process became progressively discredited, the Government and chemists are today equally convinced that the solution lies in returning to the political arena. Only time will tell whether a return to the failed techniques of the 1970s is better than the independent tribunal approach. Obviously my preference would be to see the Tribunal strengthened by a reaffirmation of its independence, a widening of its terms of reference, and some attention being given to the composition of its membership. Inpa:rticular, it is important that pharmacists have improved representation so that they have a direct input into the Tribunal's deliberations. That is not to suggest that in such a restructured tribunal the pharmacists re- would be in a position to divert the Tribunal from the hard decisions that must be made from time to time. Rather, it means that pharmacists.. would know that those decisions had been made in the full knowledge and consideration of the pharmacists' point of view. That, to me, seems to be a highly sensible and desirable administrative framework which would take the heat out of what exnerience has shown us can be a lengthy, c-rit-ptious and unsatisfactory negotiatiort. i diFectly between government and industry.. Yet it seems, from' What. we hear, that a majority of chemists.want to go back into that political arena. If they do so, I predict it will only take a short time for pharmacists to come to the realisation that there will be a price to ,pay for the apparent advantages of direct government negotiation. We already. have ,an indication of that price. In presenting the second reading speech on this Bill on 23 August, the Minister for Aged;I.FarpJly and Health Services (Mr Staples)st-ted that the Government and the Ph-tinacy Guild have already reached agreement on new levels of remuneration 'In p1,ltsuit of the objective of ensuring an efficient distribution network for pharmaC«iHicals ... about pharmacy industry restructuring'. The deal, quite siIriply, is a remuneration level which satisfies.. the majority of pharmacists in return for a reduction in the number of Australian pharmacies. But what of next year and the year beyond, when the Government .has achieved its restructuring goals aitW:ititurns its attention more directly to <temu'ri'eration levels or to other areas of industry restructuring? How painful and dIscordant will those negotiations become if the parties cannot agree; if the Guild loses the confidence of its membership; or another pharmacy body emerges with claims· of representing a majority viewpoint?<J:'II;on-'.Ofthose scenarios are in any degte¢ very unlikely. In fact, each of those things could come about. Will that process degenerate into a repeat of the 1970s and in time lead to a demand for these matters to be removed from the political arena and returned to an independent arbiter? I would propose that history suggests that is precisely will happen, and it will be left to another government at another time to complete the full circle and put back into place a truly independent tribunal. Sadly, in the interin:, many pharmacists may find that the pnce they have to pay for direct political intervention in their industry may be highly unpalatable. I turn briefly to the main provisions of this Bill-the increase in patient contribution for pharmaceuticals. For general or non-pensioner patients, the maximum contribution is to rise from $11 to $15 and for pensioners from nothing at all t$2.50. There is no doubt that these increases have caused alarm and great worry for many pensioners. But, as we have heard tonight, the coalition spokesman on health has presented a thorough and thoughtful presentation to the House on this subject and there would be little value in me duplicating his remarks. I want to direct my attention to the reasons for the Government making such a substantial lift in patient contributions. In his second reading speech the Minister stated that no government could responsibly continue the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in its current form in the face of the fact that the cost of the scheme has doubled in the last four years and is estimated to double again over the next three years. In that speech he went on to suggest that the factors behind this increase were the cost of drugs, the lack of incentive to use lower-cost alternative treatments amongst providers or consumers and the way in which they are prescribed. The Minister's last point-about the overprescribing of drugs--'-is regrettably too often true. I find myself in a great deal of sympathy with his subsequent remarks where he refers to the concern felt by health care professionals about the amount of ill health which is occurring through the inappropriate use of medication, and the evidence of significant numbers of hospital admissions of elderly people being related to drug-related illnesses. If one looks at hospital admissions and the reasons for admission of a great what number of patients, one finds that drugrelated illnesses caused by inappropriate prescriptions rate very highly. The real message here is for the provider-for those medical practitioners who all too readily prescribe medications which they know to be excessive, of questionable medical value, or simply a panacea. This is not doctor bashing. The vast majority of Australian doctors are very responsible people who go about their tasks in a highly responsible and professional manner. But there are too many instances of excessive prescriptions. We have all heard stories about people who have cases filled with prescribed drugs who do not really need those drugs. This of course is a drain on the benefits scheme. What this legislation is seeking, through the imposition of pricing policies, is for medical practitioners to be encouraged to adopt more professional and provident attitudes in their dispensing practices. To the extent that that can be achieved, there will be a commensurate reduction in the need for ongoing increases in the pensioner and patient contribution for pharmaceuticals. As in the field of medicine itself, I would point out that those who think we can suddenly reduce the cost of the health system, the cost of pharmaceuticals, are simply flying in the face of all the available evidence. When we look at what is coming up in the provision of medical care, whether it be in the pharmaceutical industry or anywhere else, we will be seeing more and more expensive medications coming on the market. What we need t.o have is a continuing highly profeSSIOnal attitude to the prescribing of those pharmaceuticals. Here the Government, the pharmaceutical profession itself, and the medical profession have a very real role to play. Anybody who suggests that we shall suddenly see a vast reduction in the cost is simply not aware of what is likely to occur in the future. But what I would like to see, and I stress again, is not an attack on the Tribunal. I would like to see a really independent Tribunal playing its proper role in working out a responsible, reasonable and professional result in any deliberations between the government of the day and the pharmacy profession as a whole.",105
137,Mr SNOW,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to support the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and cognate Bill, as indeed have all other honourable members who have spoken in this debate so far. I wish to make a few points which I believe have not been made by many honourable members. One relates to the very urgent need for the whole community, not just the Parliament, to think about its attitude to drugs and to medication. First of all, we need to think about whether the 194950 scheme of Sir Earle Page which followed on and was not all that different from the MCKenna scheme put up by the Chifley Labor Government is suitable for our times. The times are certainly different. I recall dispensing prescriptions in the mid-1950s, when most drugs were not highly priced. However, coming on the market now are new drugs for cancer, heart disease and circulatory problems. These drugs have had a significant effect on the average price of items dispensed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) and, therefore, the cost to the taxpayer has risen considerably. Therefore, the Government faces a real challenge: what is it going to do? Is the Government going to get rid of the scheme and replace it with a user pays scheme? While the PBS has been very regulated, it has given Australians quality for price. It is one area where it can be said that every government, since the scheme was introduced in the early years of the Menzies Government, has administered the scheme pretty well. However, pharmacists have always faced a difficulty because, while the health scheme ensured that doctors could fix their own prices, pharmacists were not able to do so. Pharmacists have had to take the price that the Government has given them and, as a result, we had the sort of dilemma referred to by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). It is the job of the Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, to keep costs down as far as possible. Although the Government might not be able successfully to do that with the doctors, it does have the legislative power to do it to the pharmacists. Often the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal has either ruled against the Government or been loath to cooperate with it and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Recently the Tribunal was not at all happy with a joint submission from the Guild and the Government. The Tribunal wanted some corrections made and felt that it could not adjudicate on a joint submission from both the Government and the Guild. The Tribunal is not always onside with the Government or the Guild. Inevitably, one side or the other is not happy with what has happened. Is a free scheme desirable? All honourable members appear to agree that something has had to be done. It is interesting to note that the pharmacists made strong representations to me that people were accumulating drugs; people were getting prescriptions and finding that they no longer needed them. Indeed, people were getting enough prescriptions to go on holiday and then the doctor would suddenly change the medication, or the people concerned would see another doctor when things got worse and the doctor would again change the medication. I - an recall that when a patient died the spouse might bring in a box of medication which had been accumulated over the years and may well have been worth hundreds, indeed thousands, of dollars. Some items on the schedule are worth hundreds of dollars. Admittedly, some items are worth only a few dollars. Therefore, it is extremely important that the Government start encouraging people to bear some of the consequences of their actions. Mr MACKellar-Do you blame them for getting sick?",109
138,Mr SNOW,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"---,No, I do not blame them for getting sick. It is one thing that we have to understand. Both sides of the Parliament, I believe, have recognised in this debate that some people have accumulated medication, often without good reason. The honourable member for Warringah has made the very important point that there are patients who need medication, often expensive medication, and who often need a number of prescriptions. I note that one medical academic said that very few patients need more than three prescription items at a time, but even this can be debatable. A patient with heart and fluid problems may need tablets for those problems and may also need potassium as an adjunct to the fluid tablets. Often patients go to doctors and say they need repeats. The doctors write out prescriptions for everything. The patients may not need everything on the prescriptions, but they take it because it is free. They take home the medication and put it on their shelves. Recently I was at a nursing home in Queanbeyan. I was told that this often happened, that the drugs a<;cumulated, and that patients might have seven or eight bottles of medication on their shelves. The Government has to look at that and encourage the patients to bear some of the consequences of their actions. The Government ought also to be looking at the method of charging for other items that do not go through pharmacists. I think of the items provided under the in vitro fertilisation and human growth programs, where medication is apparently provided free. There can be problems with assessment where arrangements are made with the wholesaler and the Government pays accounts that have come from the wholesaler. I am not absolutely certain that this is the way in which charging out should be done. At the same time. I can understand that perhaps it will be a bit complicated if the medication is not made available directly to the clinic involved in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or human growth programs. We ought to be very careful about what happens. For instance, if medication-worth perhaps thousands of dollars-that should be refrigerated all the time is lost by the patient because the refrigerator is turned off, should the taxpayer have to bear the cost of the loss of that medication? I think that under the present circumstances the cost may be borne by the taxpayer. So I would like. to see answered some questions about the IVF and the human growth programs. Again, while we try not to be racist in this society, we may find that some people who are on the human growth program come from a particular race of people whose growth does not occur at the same rate as that for people of another race. Paying full regard to the average growth rate of their race, we may find that these people may not be entitled to human growth hormones. So we ought to examine both the IVF and human growth programs very carefully. The other point that I want to make was that we ought to look at the availability of medication. In 1952 drug addicts-there were quite a lot of them around-were able to get their medication from a doctor. Heroin was prescribed by the doctor and people whom I knew as addicts were able to come into the pharmacy with a doctor's prescription for heroin linctus. The doctor would write the prescription and usually tell the patient not to come back for a week. The patient would use the medication for a week, knowing it would have to last that long, and then come back with the prescription and get a refill of heroin. Admittedly, the addicts seemed to be somewhat older than they are today. Nevertheless, there were plenty of addicts around. They were addicted to heroin, morphine, and chloral hydrate. I can recall a doctor phoning and saying,'Look, I am ordering chloral hydrate for this person. The patient always seems to go to you. I suggest that you cut the chloral hydrate down by a few grains every in prescription'. By the end of the year we found that the patient was getting 10 per cent of the chloral hydrate that was originally prescribed. These addicts were getting their medication pure and at a reasonable price. It seemed to work all right. Now, of course, they do not. They get heroin that might be pure or mixed with other drugs. If they are used to it being mixed and suddenly benefits fees. get it pure because it is freely available, the heroin dosage could cause death. The drugs are very costly to the addicts, who often steal to raise funds. Of course, supply of drugs of addiction has become a major part of organised crime. I know that there are problems with our going back to the rules of 1952, 1953 1954, when these items were available prescription. At that time, of course, though it was illegal, supplying medicaon tion knowingly to an addict was condoned. I can recall an inspector coming into pharmacy, looking through the drug book and saying, 'This person is taking methadone tablets a day. That person is obviously addicted'. The inspector would go and see the doctor and the patient, and action would be taken to phase down the medication. I know that the Commonwealth and the States would have problem in going back to that system beI cause it involved actually condoning illean gal activity. But that system was far cleaner, tidier, fairer and more considerlink ate to the drug addict than the present system. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very tolerant. You probably knew I was a little off track, but I wanted to make that point. But before I finish talking about the maceutical benefits part of the legislation . I want to point out that some honourable members have not acknowledged the problems that will occur. The shadow vision Minister acknowledged the problems that will occur in dispensing prescriptions der the new arrangements, particularly the beginning. There will be some very real problems for pharmacists. The new arrangements people will mean more work for them and I hope that this will be taken into full account able quite easily when the assessment of the work value of pharmacists takes place again. One of the problems is that to some extent cists' fees are based on salaries. Unfortunately, salaried pharmacists are not particularly well organised, so there is fairly low salary base on which dispensing self. fees are based, and this means that full account is not taken of pharmacists' salaries in the assessment of pharmaceutical Before I conclude I would like to make a point 'about the changes to the social security part of the legislation relating to the the tax file number being a precondition to the payment of family allowance supplement and its use for other requirements. Some people have said that this is and a return to the Australia Card requireon ment. A group came to see me the other alday and objected to having their pictures licences; they said that this is really the Australia Card come back with a a vengeance through the States. There is something in that. The Australia Card may 10 not have been such a bad idea and I believe that it would have been of great benefit in both reducing fraud and making sure that people knew their entitlements. The introduction of the tax file number a was seen as being second best. However, believe that it is going to eliminate quite amount of fraud. The main thing that it is going to db is much more directly revenue-the amount of money that the Government gets-with the amount of money that the Government is paying out. The ,use of the tax file number as a precondition to a range of benefits is going to be very important not only in minimising fraud but also in securing entitlepharment for a wide range of people. A number of people have mentioned to me the problems with the deeming proin the social security legislation. I think it is important that we recognise unthat people are able to get a return of in about 10 per cent, not always quite on call but generally within a few days-sometimes seven days. It is extremely important that the Australian realise that the deeming provision is available and is applied. People are to get the return which is deemed. Taxpayers are entitled to deem pharmaa return of 10 per cent. I am pleased that the Opposition has supported the legislation generally and I a have great pleasure in supporting it my",110
139,Mrs SULLIVAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is a pity that the Government did not listen to members such the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) before it introduced these changes. The honourable member obviously brings some expertise to the subject of the operation of pharmacies and the difficulties they have. He brought forward some very valid points, some that I was going to raise myself. I will speak briefly in re-enforcement of these points, which the honourable member explained very well indeed. It is also a pity that the Government did not listen to some of its own backbenchers on some of these items that apply to pensioners in particular. I note that the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) is in the House. In her excellent speech this afternoon she indicated that she was one who did not agree with the charge applying to pensioners. I am one who laments it too because of the principle that it breaches. However, it is a Government decision and it is a decision that has to do with Government finances. I am afraid that we are starting to get indications of a Government that is getting a little tired. It has expertise, views and principles within its ranks that now seem to be utilised less and less. Less and less effort is being made to keep in touch with its own back bench. It has certainly been my experience in the last few weeks since the Budget was presented that there is a perception in the community that this Government has lost touch with its own constituency. I suspect that the opinion polls are showing that at the moment, although I do not raise opinion polls as being any validation of any argument or policy in this particular debate. Last Friday I attended and spoke briefly at a rally organised by pensioners on the Gold Coast. My electorate contains a very large percentage of pensioners of every description, particularly age pensioners who are not at all affluent. There is a lot of conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast and people tend to think that the mansions lining the Nerang River are somehow typical of the area. But they are not. A look at the statistics shows that my electorate is, on average, one of the lowest income electorates in Australia-far lower than electorates that cover the western suburbs of Sydney, for example. So it does not follow in a straight line that income equals voting patterns. I have in my electorate a lot of people living very frugally on a small income who are very distressed about some of the things that are happening to them at the moment. Concern was expressed at the rally that I referred to about two things in particular. The first was the introduction of a charge on pensioners who hold health benefit cards. The other concerned the $2,000 limit on low interest or interest free deposits in banks. Tonight we are having a cognate debate on the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I will address my comments particularly to the first of these Bills, although other items such as the $2,000 limit on low-interest or non-interest bearing deposits in banks are very closely related in what they indicate to the people at whom they are aimed. In relation to the last point, which I will deal with briefly, I can certainly see what the Government is aiming at, as can the pensioners. I just question whether it has been realistic about its figures. I particularly question whether the $2,000 limit is appropriate in the case of the married pensioners. If $2,000 is allowed for a single pensioner, the rationale of only $2,000 for a married couple escapes me. It seems to indicate that the Government is really out of touch with what $2,000 buys or can be expected to buy for someone these days. Expenditure of this magnitude can be incurred very easily. For example, car repair expenses can run very high, as can the painting of a house. I have heard Government members say, 'Oh, the proverbial painting of the house. We do not want to hear about that again'. I am sure that they do not want to hear about it again because it is true and it pokes a bit of a hole in what they are doing. The simple fact is that if one is going to get more than 10 per cent on money in a bank deposit, it must be on a fixed deposit. So it cannot be money that is readily and easily accessible. A deeming provision that was a little bit more realistic might have caused a little less distress. Also many pensioners these days are people who lived through the Depression-and lived hard through the Depression. The fact that they lived hard through the Depression is the reason they are pensioners today. They are very conservative, cautious people. They get very concerned about their money. What has happened in Victoria has made them even more concerned and more conservative. That is one issue. The other one which I put alongside it is that of having to pay $2.50 for the first 50 or however many prescriptions. These two matters are linked in pensioners' minds. They see this as an attack on them. Again, I do not think that the Government has been realistic in its approach, judging by the mail I have received. It has been interesting to hear Government members today, including the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, talking about how pensioners stockpile drugs, are given too many of them, or one thing and another happens, and there is a lot of wastage. He suggested that pensioners take these prescriptions and get them filled because they are free. I am sure is true. That is why they do it and that is why there is wastage. But what really is the difference between this and bulk-billing with doctors? One of the standard arguments against the bulk-billing system and the basics of Medicare as a total health insurance program is that it really is necessary on a mass basis for people to have some consciousness of what it is they are doing when they use the service, whether it is the medical service or the prescription service. I think pensioners can be excepted for very particular reasons. One of the reasons we have difficulty with the funding of our medical system and our Medicare system is that it is available to everyone. A signature, a stroke of the pen and a certain amount of taxpayers' dollars can be spent. Just as it may be that the pensioners have been taking too many prescriptions and stockpiling drugs, it must at some stage cross the Government's mind that there are people other than pensioners who are making visits to the doctor too easily. How many of us hear stories, and indeed have experience ourselves, of people needing prescriptions for drugs that they regularly use and which are regularly prescribed, and of doctors requiring those patients to come and visit them and sign a form before they get their prescriptions, even though no actual consultation is required? It just gets too easy to look at the public funding as having an anonymous source. If the Government is going to bite the bullet on pensioner health benefits, which is a very difficult and emotive issue, it really has to address its rationale on the subject of Medicare and, in particular, bulk-billing. For bulk-billing, doctors have had to forgo what we call 'the gap'-the difference between 85 per cent of the scheduled fee for a particular service and what the doctor actually charges. One has to wonder whether this will happen in due course with pharmacists; whether there is not a parallel being set up here, and that pharmacists are not going to be asked to forgo something. Of course, in the last couple of years pharmacists have had a very difficult time that in relation to government funding. It is the great risk any profession runs when major parts of its income start to come from the Government. Sooner or later greater government controls will be applied. That is not to say there were not government controls before, but they have been increased to a point where a lot of pharmacists have been caused a great deal of distress. It seemed to me that Senator Richardson's comment, so blithely made, that pharmacists could give credit to pensioners of up to $130 while the pensioner was waiting for the $130 to roll in at the rate of $2.50 per week over the year, showed that this might have been an indication of setting off down this track. In the part of Australia that I come from, which has a very high percentage of elderly people, many of them pensioners, there are pharmacists for whom a very major part of their business and their clientele is pensioners. On particular areas of the Gold Coast it would be extremely . high indeed. It is the older areas of the Gold Coast, such as Southport and Labrador, where the pensioners tend to live. To say to those pharmacists that they had to give close to $130 up-front credit, that they had to bear that amount of credit for pensioners, is not to talk about a small sum of money. It is to talk about a very substantial proportion, maybe up to 70 per cent, of their total income on prescriptions for the year. That is very big money indeed. Mr Lee-Who is this?",112
140,Mrs SULLIVAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am talking about pharmacists, a very large percentage of whose clientele are pensioners. There are pharmacists in my electorate in that position, particularly in the older parts of the Gold Coast around Southport and Labrador. Very high percentages of their clients are pensioners. To expect them to give $130 credit or close to it up-front is to talk about very large sums of money which they simply could not bear. It showed, first of all, that Senator Richardson does not know what time of day it is when it comes to the financial situation of pharmacists and the particular needs of pensioners. It also showed that this has been a very poorly thought through decision.. Everything that has happened since this announcement on Budget night has borne that out. We have here a very cumbersome and expensive system and one has to ask why it had been introduced, and why the $2.50. At the pensioner rally held last Friday that I referred to earlier in my speech I made the point, which at the time, I must admit, I did not realise was borne out so well by the second reading speech of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), that I doubted that at $2.50 per prescription up to the limit of $130 the Government was going to save very much money. I notice, now that I have read the Minister's second reading speech, which, of course, I should have read much earlier, that it contains this statement: While no savings are expected in this year as a result of the new arrangements for pensioners and concessionals, including the additional pension payments for pensioners, savings in later years will reach $185m. I am not surprised to hear that there will be no savings this year. Some part of that might be to do with percentages of financial years. It is a cumbersome system in that track has to be kept of the number of prescriptions filled that all these pensioners have. Records have to be kept and submitted, and then, from there on, pensioners can get their additional prescriptions over the $130 level. It is a very cumbersome system. At $2.50 per prescription, as a cost saving exercise, it does not make very much sense. I would have liked a little better explanation of how the savings in later years will reach $185m. By the way, I notice that it does not say $185m per annum or in which year it will reach $185m, and they would be fairly useful facts to know. When one reads just the bald statement that sometime in future years it will reach $185m, one must ask how long that is going to take, or is it going to be $185m a year? The cost savings in prospect at this stage are not very high and it could well be, as the pensioners fear, the thin edge of the wedge. Clearly, the decision was not fully thought through before it was implemented, and that is a disgrace from a Labor government. It ought to be thinking about its own constituents. It ought to understand what the implications are. I am aware of the sorts of problems that have been caused because of the letters that have poured into me from very distressed constituents and the problems that I have been informed of over the telephone. I think, just off the top of my head, of the woman who wrote to me saying she and her husband were both age pensioners. He was a diabetic and had a long string of illnesses and problems that diabetics are prone to. He had the lot, and she herself did not have the best of health. As she reeled off all of this treatment one gained some indication of how many drugs this meant, and one began to understand that these people had a very real fear of how far they would be out pocket over this while waiting for the $2.50 a week to roll in. It is late in the debate and I have not very many minutes left, but I want to address myself to one other issue that arisen, and that is the actions that the Opposition will take here and in the ate. At the rally which I mentioned prevery viously, Senator Kernot, who is the Australian Democrat senator for Queensis aware. land, seemed to think that the central issue was how Liberal senators would vote in the Senate. That seemed to be all she wanted to talk about. I was also a little surprised to hear the Assistant Secretary of the Pensioners League in Queensland saying that the people that everybody ought to be ringing were Liberal senators. I would have thought the odd phone call to a Labor senator might have been in order, and the odd phone call to a Labor member of the House of Representatives. I remember the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Bedthey dall) coming into my electorate on thing called a government task force on knock it out. pensioners not so long ago-about 12 months, I do believe-Mr Lee-And the honourable member for Dobell.",114
141,Mrs SULLIVAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Was the honourable apparently member on the Gold Coast? I do rememDemocrats ber the Queensland members particularly well. I apologise, I did forget the honourlin. able member for Dobell. All these subnew jects for pensioners to talk about were raised, but there was no mention about their losing free health care; there was mention of the issue of free pharmaceutithis cals or qualifying for them. In their view, they have lost. They know that a principle has been breached and they know that there are possible things that can flow from it. There was no mention about money year. being squirrelled away. That was thought to be sort of evil and bad, as was not earning as much as 10 per cent interest on their money. None of those things were mentioned. I am waiting for the task force of to come back. They will get a very warm welcome on the Gold Coast, I can assure them. Mr Lee-I will come.",115
142,Mrs SULLIVAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I will particularly has welcome back the honourable member for Dobell. I am very pleased and I will pass Senthat on to Mr Vance Marshall, who is active in pensioner matters, as I am new sure the honourable member for Dobell I have very little time left now and I must finish a point here. As I said, I think it might have been relevant for the pensioners in Queensland to have been ringing the honourable member for Rankin and the honourable member for Bowman. They both have very exalted titles these days; they might have had a little bit of say in this policy. The honourable member for Petrie still has a fairly narrow margin, too. He would have been fairly interested in what they had to say, I am sure. But no, we just had to hear about how the Liberals were terrible because were not going to vote with the someDemocrats on this in the Senate and We have made our position clear, and that is that we are not going to vote against Budget-related Bills. But I want, very quickly, to put on the record something that Senator Kernot said, because this is the official line of the these days. Senator Kernot, I hasten to add, worked for Senator MackWhile she is a new senator, she is not to this place and she ought to be aware of what is a Budget and an Appropriation Bill and what is Supply. With a no great flurry, she said to the pensioners, apparently being the Democrat line, 'There's a world of difference between opposing Supply and opposing these Bills'. It was like Supply was everything and the Budget was a mere bagatelle, an administrative detail that came through in the I just want to read a couple of passages from Pettifer so that it is on the record for everyone, including Senator Kernot. I will save her the trouble oflooking up the index of the procedures either of the House of Representatives or the Senate. In House of Representatives Procedure, in reference to the components of the Budget we read this: The 'Budget' is the term ordinarily used for the annual financial statement presented to the House by the Treasurer and includes the Appropriation Bills (Nos. 1 and 2), the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, and documents relating to the bills and legislation to give effect to the Budget . . . The term 'Budget measure' is used to describe bills introduced to implement the financial proposals announced in the Treasurer's Budget speech. Supply Bills (Nos. 1, 2 and Parliamentary Departments), normally introduced in April or May of each year, appropriate money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to make interim provision for expenditure for the following financial year pending the passing of the main Appropriation Bills for that year. The amount provided in each supply bill is usually limited to not more than five months' requirements, that is, the first five months of the forthcoming financial year. The amounts provided in the supply bills, in the main, are based on expenditures or appropriations of the previous year and do not include expenditure for which a special appropriation exists in another Act. Procedures for supply bills, including cial initiative limitation on amendment, are the same as for appropriation bills. In other words, Supply Bills are stopgap Bills to the main exercise, which is the Budget. The Democrats need not proceed around the country trying to tell everybody that they are very much more important than Budget measures. We do not refrain from criticising these decisions of the Government. That does not mean that we are not going to let the Government li.v- with the consequences of its own deCISIOns.",115
143,Mr LEE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"If I did not believe that the honourable member for Moncrieff' (Mrs Sullivan) had a very thorough understanding of road safety, I might suggest that in her contribution she was trying to walk down both sides of the street at the same time. She finished her speech by saying that, while the Opposition would not be voting against this legislation because it was part of the Budget, she would not let the Government escape from the consequences of the legislation and would not hesitate to criticise the Government over this proposal. I am intrigued at the position of the honourable member for Moncrieff'. I know that she works hard to stay in touch with the pensioners in her electorate, and I am sure that she will continue to work hard to attend meetings of pensioners in her electorate. I simply suggest to her that she might attend a few more meetings of pensioners in her electorate because the reaction I am getting at meetings in the electorate of Dobell is that there is not strong opposition to this proposal. I have not had the pleasure of attending meetings in some of the town halls in the capital cities, but certainly in my electorate, where one might expect there to be strong opposition to the proposal, I am finding that people do know of cases of people hoarding drugs or obtaining drugs from doctors when they do not need them and that they believe that this is a fair way to try to cut back on the overuse of drugs in our community. Mr Simmons-You have a high percentage of pensioners in your electorate.",116
144,Mr LEE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the interjection the finanfrom the Minister. As he is probably aware, I have the highest number of age pensioners of any electorate in Australia. I have said to previous Opposition spokesmen that they are welcome to visit my electorate as many times as they wish because I suspect that my vote goes up when they do. I comment on one remark made by the honourable member for Moncrieff' that the new system was cumbersome and that it would be terrible for the chemists to have to keep track of the number of scripts which they might have dispensed to an individual pensioner and that there would be a massive increase in the number of records kept by chemists. Mrs Sullivan-That the Government would have to keep those records.",116
145,Mr LEE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Moncrieff' is now interjecting to say that the Government will have to keep these records. Chemists have to keep track of that information now for people who have to pay anything for the medication that they receive, whether it is $2.50 or up $11 for their medication. Simply, what we are doing is adapting that· system making it apply to everyone, not just those people who have to pay for their medicapect tion, as is the case at the moment. Having made those two remarks, I now turn to some of the other points in Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceuticompensated cal Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Somedication. cial Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) currently before the House. The Opposition again seems to have that split personality showing on this legislation. The honourposition able member for Moncrieff and other members of the Opposition tell us that we are being too tough on pensioners, that we should not have made some of these cutbacks, yet when we look back to the Opposition's immediate reaction to the Budget on the day after the Budget we a very different reaction. I remind the House of some of the comments made on the Budget by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, on 22 August in this House. Speaking of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), he said: We urged him to cut expenditure; he did not cut enough, but to the extent that he moved the right direction he has had our support. days ahead there will be much talk about the Budget and the focus will be on the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and some others. The Treasurer has said how strong he been in cutting Commonwealth own purpose spending but we have to look at that expenditure side in the context of a 12.3 per cent increase social security spending, an 8.6 per cent in health spending and a 14 per cent increase in education spending. The Opposition's official spokesman on Treasury matters is saying that the Govask ernment has not cut back government spending sufficiently. He highlights the three areas where government spending has increased too quickly from his point of view: first, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; second, social security spending; and, third, spending on education. One can perhaps speculate on what the OppoI shall explain soon. sit ion would be doing if it occupied the benches on this side of the .House tonight. What sort of Budget would the Liberal to and National parties be introducing for debate tonight? I suggest that they would and not be compensating pensioners for any $2.50 charge for their medication. I susthat members of the Opposition, given their detailed negotiations with the chemist organisations in the lead-up to the last elections, would not be worrying the too much about whether pensioners are for having to pay more for If the response to that of those opposite is that we will never know what their policies will be because they are the Opand we are in government and the Government has to make the tough decisions, I wonder about their standards. The day after the Budget the Opposition suggested that Government spending on pharmaceuticals had not been cut enough, but members of that same Opposition to get night have complained about the impact of some of the proposals the Government has introduced to try to save money. I wonder about that split personality. I hope that, with the appropriate medication in days to come, the Opposition will be able to overcome those problems that have been exposed. It is important to remember that four in years ago this country allocated $ 500m In the from taxpayers' money to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In the last financial year the allocation was more than $1 has billion; in three years' time it will be more than $2 billion; And one can imagine how much we will be spending on subsidising in the cost of drugs for our community by increase the turn of the century-a massive sum of money, if there is no change in the meantime. This Government has had the courage to take a very hard decision and pensioners to pay $2.50 for their medication. At the same time there will be a $2.50 per week increase in social security pensions or a $2.50 per week combined increase for married pensioners. I argue that that will mean that no one will be worse off as a result of this measure. The Government will be better off, for reasons No one will be worse off for the following reason: if a pensioner uses 52 or more drugs a year, or requires 52 or more bottles of medication in a year, that pensioner will pay no more than 52 lots of $2.50, which adds up to $130. The' pension of that person will be increased by exactly the same amount-$130, or $2.50 a week for the 52 weeks. The average pensioner in fact uses fewer than 52 drugs in a year; the average is only 27. Anyone who uses fewer than 52 drugs a year will be better off, by being compensated by 52 lots of $2.50. How is the Government saving money if it is giving people back more, by increasing their social security pensions, than it is taking in the cost of the scripts? That was the question that the honourable member for Moncrieff put during her contribution to the debate. The reason the Government will save money is that, when people have to reach into their pockets to take out $2.50 to put on the counter for medication, they will think twice about whether they really need that medication. One can perhaps imagine a pensioner who visits a doctor and obtains a prescription containing three items. I know that people in my electorate, when their doctor gives them a prescription for three items, will go to the chemist and ask the chemist to give them the first and the third items on the prescription but not the second item, as they already have a stack of that medication in the medicine cabinet at home and do not need any more. At the moment there is no incentive for people to say that. If a person gets his or her drugs free, why not get all of the drugs which are on the script which the doctor gives that person? As soon as people have to reach into their pockets and put $2.50 on the counter, they will say to their doctors, 'I do not need any more of that drug. I have enough of that drug in the cabinet', or if they are too embarrassed to argue with their doctor, they will say to their chemist-often people can relate more to their chemist than they can to their doctor-'Don't worry about the second item on the script, because I have enough of that' or they will say, 'The doctor gave me the script and I am not really sure that I need to use this medication for a cold'. In fact, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) cited an example earlier tonight of his aunt, I think, who had a cold, visited the doctor and was given a script for six drugs. The honourable member for Lowe, who I am sure is a very highly qualified practitioner, said that a double scotch probably would have done the aunt more good than all of the drugs. I would not like to encourage the children in the gallery or anyone to use alcohol rather than vitamin tablets, orange juice and lots of other things which stop colds and influenza, but a very clever qualified doctor has given an example in his own family of doctors over-prescribing medicines for people who are in need of proper medication. As I said, there has been a massive growth in the cost of pharmaceuticals, so the Government has had to take some action. This Government has been brave enough to· take that action. I believe it will get support out in the community from the pensioner groups, once they understand that they will not be worse off; once they understand that the Government has taken action to make sure that those who are chronically ill who need to use a lot of scripts early in the calendar year will get special assistance if they need it; and once they understand that their fellow pensioners who are getting too many drugs from their doctors, and who are getting sick because they are using too many drugs and are hoarding drugs, will be encouraged to stop doing that. That will make a significant improvement in health care for pensioners by trying to encourage them not to over-use medication which is not absolutely necessary. I attended a pensioner meeting at Gwandalan in my electorate-it was a meeting of the Gwandalan branch of the Combined Pensioners' Association-at which one of the members asked me why could not the Government have simply given pensioners 52 vouchers worth $2.50 each so that the Government would· not have to increase their pensions and people could simply present their vouchers to the chemist when they needed drugs. The problem with the system of vouchers is that people would still have felt that the drugs were free. If one hands over a voucher it is not the same as handing over real money. The. way that the Government will save money is that pensioners, when reaching into their pockets and putting that $2.50 on the counter, will think twice about whether they need that medication or whether they already have enough of that medication. That means that in a very short time we will see the quantities of drugs prescribed in our community rapidly decrease as people make sure that they do not get drugs that they do not need. The honourable member for Lowe went on to make a number of other comments about this matter. I have to say that I agree with some of the comments he made about the preference of a number of doctors to prescribe expensive drugs, often cases where a patient does not need the most expensive drug available. I have spoken in this House on a number of previous occasions about my concern regarding the promotional activities of drug companies. The most infamous case concerned the drug company which offered doctors an opportunity to have their names go into a draw for a free trip to the O1ympic Games in Seoul, on the condition that they signed a form to say that they were prescribing a particular drug. When that scheme became public, there was such an outcry from people who were concerned that a drug company was encouraging doctors to prescribe a particular drug by offering them a free trip to the O1ympics that, very quickly, the drug company had to back off and cancel the offer. I have heard rumours that it is not uncommon for drug companies to offer doctors not only pads, pencils and knickknacks for their desks, but also tickets and other valuable gifts to encourage them to prescribe particular drugs. I hope that the vast majority of doctors would not be influenced by these inducements, but I have to say that I am very concerned at some of the stories I hear about how the pattern of drug use in a particular town can change significantly when the representatives of particular drug companies go through the town and visit local doctors. That area is well worth investigation by the Government and I hope it is an area which the Government does examine very closely. Because today's computer technology allows the Health Insurance Commission to identify doctors who have unusual patterns in the way they service their patients, I would have thought that certainly the Department of Community Services and Health could determine that a doctor was prescribing a certain form of drug, especially a drug that cost much more than another drug which does exactly the same job. The honourable member for Lowe used the expression that the Government had failed to bite the bullet in allowing a in chemist to dispense a cheaper generic drug when a doctor prescribed a brand of drug which was more expensive. I do not know whether it was official policy on behalf of the Opposition to criticise the Government for not allowing chemists to alter the drug prescribed for a patient, but I would have thought that was something that many members on both sides of this Parliament would have great reservations about. Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand. Unfortunately many doctors specify the brand of a drug on a script, which means that, if a chemist wants to provide a person with a cheaper alternative, he has to ring the doctor to confirm that there will be no medical complications if he provides the generic alternative which, as the honourable member for Lowe said, is often cheaper and just as effective. The system at the moment is that the chemist has to telephone the doctor. If the honourable member for Lowe was suggesting that the Opposition policy is to allow chemists to dispense cheaper generic drugs without consulting the doctor, I would have thought that it would raise a lot of concern with people such as the honourable member of Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) with special expertise as chemists before their entry into this House. Nevertheless, certainly this Government has tried to encourage doctors to prescribe more cheaper drugs by establishing the subsidy on a formula based on the generic alternative, and that is something that save a great deal of money. The honourable member for Lowe went on to criticise the Government for using a Medicare number to try to cut back on fraud in obtaining drugs at subsidised prices. His argument was that this would link into the Department of Social Securlowed ity computer; that the Department of cial Security computer would get tax file numbers; that the tax file numbers would be linked into the Australian Taxation Office computer; and that, as he put it, 'It was all in one dossier'. Madam Deputy Speaker, the point is that week after week Opposition members is Mr tell us that they want to cut back fraud in hear. the welfare sector and cut back on people to cut its expenditure. who are obtaining benefits to which they are not entitled. How can people stopped from getting subsidised drugs on spending too much money that a pensioner health benefit card unless a check is made with the Department of Social Security? If the Department Community Services and Health is responsible for drugs and the Department Menzies of Social Security is responsible for issucess to pharmaceuticals. ing pensioner health benefit cards, can check that the right people are getting citizens throughout Liberal and the concessions unless those two departuntil the election of the Hawke ments talk to each other. So either we allow the two systems to talk to each other and cut down on fraud, or we allow people to get for their neigha bours and friends cheap drugs to which they are not entitled. If honourable bers opposite say that the Department Social Security should not get tax file numbers from pensioners because that is that. terribly unfair, how do we stop people getting two pensions, or a pension and unemployment benefit under similar cisions. names or names that cannot be traced back? At the Combined Pensioners Assober ciationmeeting in my electorate, which I mentioned earlier, people had no worries about the tax file number if it meant that people who were cheating on the social security system were caught and were no longer allowed to rip off the system at the expense of other taxpayers. This legislation will allow the Government to implement a major reform which will members of the Opposition will continue to criticise. Yet not very long ago they were in this House saying that we had not cut back enough, that we had been too generous with the pharmaceutical benefits system and that we had been too generous with social security. Perhaps I will be folby someone who will argue that we Sohave been too tough on pensioners. At the same time he will argue that this Government has not been tough enough on government expenditure. I simply say to those opposite that perhaps it is time they overcome the problem of their split personality. TUCKEY (O'Connor) (9.37)-That an example of the sort of rubbish we Of course we tell the Government Of course we say be health. But we are not tellingtoo that the Government spends much on it it is aged-that is the difference. We have the on an understanding of the difference and we of have the record. In fact, it was the all Government that decided that Australians should have reasonable acThat policy was no one maintained for pensioners all other governments Government. The situation in the health area today is that this Government came to office on policy of free health services for all. What a joke! What about the lady who memhad her foot amputated because the Govof ernment would not let her go to hospital to have her veins fixed up? Tell me about Ms MCHugh-Doctors make those de",116
146,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The honourable memshould sit down and wait her turn. The reality is that the people of Australia do not have free health unless the Government decides to give it to them. The Government has put a two-year waiting list on them. Now it is going to put $2.50 on pensioners' drugs. Why? It is too bad if they have 10 prescriptions in the first week or two. The digest put out by the Parliamentary Library shows that $2.50 a week is no help when one is sick and has four or five prescriptions to fill in the first week. Suddenly Senator Richardson has had a brain storm; he is going to do something about that. But let us look at who is getting the money. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), by his own admission, has no private health insurance. The previous Minister for Community Services and Health, by his own admission, has no private health insurance. Members of the Australian Labor Party who are in the chamber now might put their hands up if they have private health insurance. They are all highly paid people. Do honourable members opposite have private insurance? Ms MCHugh-Certainly not.",120
147,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,-:-Certainly not. The honourable member is one of those people who will get a private room and bathroom if she goes to hospital and the doctor of her choice. Why? Because she is a member of parliament. She will not have to ask for it; she will get privileges-Ms MCHugh-I will not.,121
148,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Yes, the honourable member will, because they will be given to her without being asked for. This has happened in this town, as has been recorded in this place. That is the problem. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member should address his statements through the chair.",121
149,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Madam Deputy Speaker, the next time those people go to hospital on Medicare they will get the specialist of their choice. The specialist will say, 'I have just consulted my list. If you just happen to turn up in the hospital', as the Treasurer's wife did, 'on day so and so, I will be there to operate on you'. Ms MCHugh-Oh, rubbish.",121
150,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"That is the sort of choice that the honourable members will get, not because she is in the Labor Party but because she is an important person. She will get it without asking. Mrs Jakobsen-Everyone is an important person.",121
151,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Yes, but not everyone gets that sort of treatment. The lady in the honourable member's State of New South Wales could not get into hospital for two years to have the veins in her legs fixed, but the Government put her in in time to amputate fier foot. Tell me that the Government has got an equitable treatment and social justice. Tell me .about the healthy pensioner who, with the implementation of this policy, is $ 130 a year better off and tell me about the sick pensioner who will be very much worse off, at least for part of the year. That is what is wrong with the Government's policy. It has got nothing to do with dollars. The Government is too dumb to work out what it has done. It has advantaged the healthy at the expense of the sick. That is what we are criticising, and so we should. It is a very poorly workedout system. There is nothing wrong with the fundamental argument that people, by paying, will not overuse the system. However, when one considers the amount of money that this Government is throwing at the rich in society through its health system, one realises that that is the problem. Because the pensioners are locked in, the Government wants to give them the cheapest possible drug there is. We well know that one can buy a blood pressure drug that has been on the market for about 30 years. It has a few side effects-it can make one impotent; it can make one very ill. Of course, technology has caught up and it has come up with the ACE inhibitor. The ACE inhibitor does not have those sorts of side effects-it is a better drug-but because of its research and development it costs a lot more money. We went through that a couple of years ago when the Government put 'Authority only' orders on the drug and did everything it could to stop people getting it. The word 'generic' stinks. All it says is the drug has been around for 20 or 30 years and it has gone out of patent. Mr Jenkins-You are wrong.",121
152,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Of course I am not wrong. 'Generic' means that anybody can make it. That is what it means. I am well aware of that situation. When a drug is under patent it has a label and is a bit more expensive. The Government just wants to have 16 years. Not 20 or 30 years; just 16 in this day and age, when even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) can change his mind in five. That is the difference, and that is the situation. With its health policy the Government has tried to give all Australians free health. It could never manage it. It has created a disaster but, unfortunately, the people whom it should be looking after-the very people who cannot afford to pay-are the ones who are missing out. Some of those people who earn $50,000 or $60,000 a year-and we just heard them telling us how wonderful it was to bludge on Medicare-were squealing their heads off in this Parliament a minute ago. The honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) might tell us whether she has private health insurance. Does she take her social responsibility, or is she another one on 50 grand a year who lines up for free health treatment because her philosophy says that it is a good idea? That is what is wrong. If the Government would wake up to that it would not be in here tonight charging pensioners $2.50. Does the honourable member's family, with the sort of money it brings in-$200,OOO or $300,000 a year-bludge on Medicare at the expense of pensioners? She is going to stand up here in a minute and tell me it is a good thing to charge pensioners 250 bucks a week-I mean $2.50; I will get it right eventually. I have got so wild listening to the honourable member, with all her income and family money. Is it not nice to be a socialist in a free enterprise country? There is a lot to be said about this particular situation. We have brightened things up for the kids in the gallery, have we not, Madam Deputy Speaker? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-It IS about bright enough, I think.",122
153,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The interesting thing about it, of course, is that in this process of squeezing down on the system, because the Government has made the wrong decisions and has tried to fund everybody, its first process is always to hit the providers. Years ago, in an attempt to convince doctors that getting on the 'gravy train' of Medicare would not be in their long term interest, I asked the Department of the Parliamentary Library to take out the relative remuneration over about 30 years between pharmacists, doctors and dentists. In 1963-64 the real income-I think it has been adjusted to the 1980-81 base-of pharmacists was $22,716, of doctors $29,433 and of dentists $22,875. So far, only the dentists have managed to escape the clutches of government. Today their comparable income is $25,074-an increase of $3,000; doctors, $32,856-an increase of $3,000; pharmacists, $21,360-a drop of over $1,000. Who else in the community would suffer that situation? Let us take something into account. When I was a kid pharmacists were specialists. All that they dealt with was the dispensing and the provision of drugs. Today pharmacists have to put so many Dr Scholls, beach balls and crystal in their pharmacies that one needs a map and a water bag to find the dispensary and they are still earning $1,000 a year less in real terms. Why? Because, unfortunately for them, they have a single type of client. But it is worse than that. Now the Government is actively trying to convince the pharmacy profession-and I understand that the negotiations continue-to take special packages to close down. As I recollect, the Government was going to drop the remuneration per script from $4.55 to $3.80. The Government has now decided that it will be dropped to $4.25, at a time when its self-made inflation is making it necessary for everybody else to get wage increases. The Government wants the sum to be dropped to $4.25. Its argument is that it has to have rationalisation; that there are too many pharmacists. By dropping the per script income of pharmacists, the Government presumes that the pharmacies that close will be the least efficient, the ones that turn over the least. Unfortunately, this is right. Those pharmacists generally operate in the rural and remote areas-50 miles, sometimes 100 miles, apart. They are the ones that will close. Of course, the pharmacists in the big supermarkets-people probably have three within jogging distance-:-will be able to sustain themselves with their very large turnovers. The Government is apparently too thick to understand that. It has special packages for closure and amalgamation. That will be a lot of help to my constituents. Maybe the pharmacist - will think that that is the best way out; his business is almost on the rocks and the Government will pay him to leave town. But what about the people who are left behind, who suddenly have no services, no pharmacies? They are the people we should be representing. As yet, the Government's package has done nothing about it. History shows that we have never had enough sense to say that it must be clearly more expensive to prescribe drugs in a small rural centre, where the throughput is just not in existence. Why can the Government not pay the pharmacists in those areas a bit more? And, just as sensibly in terms of its rationalisation, why ean the Government not have a plateauing effect, where for very large dispensing the actual fee per prescription falls? That is common sense. We all recognise the economy of scale. But the Government is running around knocking everybody down determined to make the smallest pharmacists fail without any recognition of where they actually operate. The big guys will survive this shock, and they will still be 50 yards apart. Those that are 50 miles apart will close down. I have corresponded with the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on this matter. I am encouraged by the fact that at least the Guild has said that it sees some sense in the concept of having higher rates for those in remote and rural areas who, because of their geographic position, cannot produce any more. That is not the end of it. There have been a few sneak decisions attacking pharmacy-and attacks on pharmacy are many times attacks on the people. Because it has been a successful program, it has now been decided that no pharmacists will get paid for the work they do for Government unless they have a computer and unless a disk can be sent to the Government containing the information that they have carefully gathered on its behalf in the last year. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was at pains to tell us how necessary it is to get more information on people. He says that we have to use computers to justify that the right people are getting the prescriptions. Has anybody ever thought that one's health benefit card can be franked on to a prescription so that it is verified? Is there any reason why any more proof than that is needed? The doctor franks one's card on to his script and that becomes legal tender. Why do two computers have to talk? That also was predictable. We heard the Government's protestations on the identity card-'Trust us'. Ever since then we have seen the Government burrowing into people's lives. The honourable member who has a $100,000 or $200,000 a year family income and wants to be a member of Medicare and bludge on it might explain her views to the House on these intrusions into privacy when she speaks. It is not necessary for the Government to amend the Act in order to achieve its alms. Some of the pharmacists that the Government intends to buyout will have to spend $5,000 on a computer because they know that if they send in manual records they will not be paid. That is in the Government's Budget. Thirty per cent of Western Australian pharmacies still have not bought a computer, many because they cannot afford one and others because they do not know how to operate one-and that is not a crime. Pharmacists should be able to use manual methods if they want to. There is a penalty for using manual methods because they have to wait much longer for their money. However, with the introduction of these amendments the Government will refuse to pay them. That is a great rationalisation program. If those 30 per cent of Western Australian pharmacists do not buy a computer the Government will not have to pay them at all. We do not know how much that will save the Government but it might be quite significant. I have mentioned the generics. There are other matters which are worth looking at which really get to me, and I want to talk now about the other piece of legislation that is being debated cognately with this Bill which, put in its simplest terms, begins the deeming of the income of pensioners. No longer can pensioners retain what they earn. A dollar is no longer a dollar. In future, the Government will decide what our income is to be. Big Brother would be astounded. If he had been at a meeting with the Prime Minister and Treasury he would have said, 'Man, do you think you can get away with this?'. I think Big Brother would not have tried that. But that is the situation we are in. The Government is now telling pensioners that their money is earning 10 per cent. The first letter I received on this matter said: 'I am just happy to help my children buy their homes. I did not do it for any particular dodging mechanism. There was no other way they could buy their homes. They have my money interest free, and now the Government is telling me I am earning 10 per cent on it'. This is one example of what happens with the Government deeming that people earn a certain amount of money. The honourable member following me tonight, the honourable member for Phillip, might explain the disastrous on pensioners who lose their health benefit card. The card is a piece of plastic. We cannot cut corners off it as the income test threshold is passed by one dollar and then another. When people's incomes go beyond the threshold they lose the card, they lose the medical benefits entitlements and also they lose certain benefits which are provided by State governments. Once pensioners' incomes go over the threshold by a single dollar they lose entitlements worth $30 or $40 a week. Yet the Government does not know why people are prepared to take no interest, or 4 per cent or whatever, when they are close to the threshold. The Government has never had the wit to know how to phase out that card by giving pensioners an opportunity to buy it back for those extra few dollars above the income threshold limit. If that were offered to pensioners I think a large number would be prepared to put their money into deposits that earn a few more per cent. It is a terrible blow to people to lose that entitlement, and it is one of the principal reasons why people have their money in low interest deposits. Other people lend their money to their families. One wonders how long it will be before the Government's computer will know more about these people's lives than they know themselves. That is the trend. It is as clear as the nose on your face, and I have had enough of it. I fought the ID card. I would have fought the tax file number to the death but I was not able to do that. But I can tell the Government that it does not need any of these measures. Mr Simmons-Still fighting a broad based consumption tax?",122
154,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I have made my position clear on that. If the Minister wants to put irrelevancies into this matter, he does not know his Standing Orders. He should sit down and await his opportunity. We are not talking about that. Had former Madam Speaker been in the chair, she would have pulled me into gear had I ranged that far away from the subject. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs effect Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member is casting aspersions on the Chair. I have let him get some distance away from the subject, but nobody objected.",124
155,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Madam Deputy Speaker; I have just half a minute left to speak. The reality is that we have a situation where, firstly, the Government is sending pharmacists broke and in the process it is taking services away from the people who need them most. Secondly, the Government has devised a system that benefits healthy pensioners to the disadvantage of the sick. Further, the Government has yet to wake up that it has an overall health system that is costing unbelievable amounts of money-$2.6 billion in its first Budget and $14 billion in this Budget. And why? Because the Government is paying for people who can pay for themselves. . As is usual with most of the Government's policies, Government members, the proponents of social justice, hit the poor in the community, the needy and the aged. They do not have any sensible policy to get young and fit people working. We did. But the Government prefers to give money to those people because it thinks that a few of them will vote for its members. Let us look at the statistics. The Government says, 'Those aged between 18 and 24 vote for us and the aged do not. So, we will take th\! money off the aged and give it to the fit and the healthy'. But most importantly, if the Government stops helping the rich, including the rich in Parliament, who bludge on Medicare, it will have plenty of money to help the poor. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",124
156,Ms MCHUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Fancy some of us getting riled earlier when the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) spoke! It was a momentary aberration. The problem is that the honourable member who has just spoken speaks in that insulting vein all the time. Many people outside this place might not know to take no notice of him and may well take notice of him. So honourable members can imagine why some of us get momentarily riled at a time when perhaps we should not. In addressing some of the remarks made by honourable members opposite, I thought that I would confine myself to the comments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) when he cast aspersions on the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. He described how it was originally set up and how it is operating today. I thought that I might even comment on the way in which some honourable members opposite compared the problem of the hoarding of drugs with bulk billing. That particular honourable member commented that it was a bit like people taking too easily a visit to a doctor. I was going to say on that that I leave judgment on medical matters to the professional people. I have great faith and trust in individual doctors and always have had. I am concerned about taking the financial . worry from those people who have no means. But after the comments from those opposite and the extraordinary insults about bludging on Medicare, I think I will have a few words to say about what I think of a public health system. It is a bit like what I think about a public education system. I think it should be good enough for everyone in the community. If there is a health system good enough for those without means, it is good enough for me. If there is a public education this system good enough for people with no money, it is good enough for me. I will contribute to it through my taxes. Through my taxes I will contribute to having a health care system good enough for everyone, and that includes me. Dr Bob Woods-Did you send your kids to private schools?",125
157,Ms MCHUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I do not send my children to private schools. My entire family went to public schools. I was one of a group of teachers in public schools. All my children went to public schools and all my family seeks medical attention covered by Medicare because it is the best system. How dare members opposite show such contempt for the medical profession as to say, as has been said in this place, that there is a difference between the sort of health care people get on Medicare and the sort of health care they get privately. I suppose it is similar to education in that some people believe that children get better education in private schools than that provided in the public school system. That is certainly not the case. I will say again and again that I will contribute to a decent health system and to a decent educati()n system through my taxes. Do not let honourable members opposite talk to me about bludging. I will return to the legislation. It is in-eresting for me to be able to speak on thIS as I am one of the members of parliament who was attacked so terribly during the last election campaign by the pharmacists. It is very good to see now exactly what we have come up with and to examine it. As honourable members know otper speakers have examined very carefully and in great detail the reason for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) why it has to be looked at now and why the Government believed it was necessary for the changes to be made that are being made. I will not repeat all those details but I will focus, as many other hono'urable members have done, on the changes that have been made for age pensioners. This is particularly relevant in the light of the blatant scare tactics which have been used not only in this place but by a great many pharmacists-certainly not all members of the pharmacy profession, but a great many. As we all know, pensioners are amongst the most vulnerable people in our community. On fixed incomes they are always vulnerable. They are vulnerable as patients. As they get older they need more and more care and they become more and more dependent on those who care for them. They have greater dependency and they have a need for greater security. They have become dependent on doctors' prescription habits. It is very difficult to change the habits that have .developed. There is a depend-ncy. that IS very hard to break. This legIslatIOn, gently and slowly, is beginning to break some of those bad habits. We do not know who began the cycle of dependencl"" Maybe it was the doctors, through theIr methods of prescription. Maybe it was the patients. But someone has to break that unhealthy habit. The pensioners, of course, are the most vulnerable to scare tactics and they always have been. Was not the honourable member who spoke before me-he has just left the chamber-among those who indulged in the worse scare tactics I have ever seen until the pharmacy decision was about to be taken? At the time of the very assets test he was one of those who began that knocking on the wood. You remember, MadaI? Deputy Speaker, do you not, that knockmg on the wood every time the assets test was mentioned? It was supposed to be the inspector knocking on the pensioners' doors to take the gold fillings out of their teeth. Do honourable members remember all· that? Talk about attacking the vulnerable and scaring people! Many honourable members opposite have mention-d the ala-m and great worry amongst pensIOn-rs. It IS no wonder, with some of the stones that were told. I shall tell the House what happened in my electorate during the last campaign. It went on for months, but on election day the white-coated pharmacists were actually telling pensioners going into the booths that, if they voted for Mrs MCHugh, she would take their medicine away from them-not just everything else; I would take their medicine away from them. What a thing to say to pensioners! So the vulnerability of pensioners is extreme and the way they have been exploited in this way, and again tonight, is absolutely appalling. Some pharmacists have indulged in this sort of manipulating of pensioners for some time. One in my electorate has a n.otice in hi- ,,:indow saying, 'Free penSIOner prescnptIOns here', as if that is the only place people get them free. I just wonder what the overcharging in some other areas could be that has been mentioned many times tonight. Here we see again how these vulnerable people in our community are exploited and attacked. In this case it is pensioners and the chronically ill. They are being used as political pawns as the Government tries to strengthen the PBS and to make sure that it continues to fulfil its primary objt;ctive, which is to ensure that everyone-those with means and those without-has access to affordable drugs at a price that they can afford. Other speakers, including the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in his second reading speech, said that this objective was in danger of being undermined had the changes proposed in this Bill not been put forward. With the use of the scare tactics I have just been discussing against such a vulnerable section of the community, is it any wonder that pensioner groups reacted so badly to what they thought would happen? I reacted very badly indeed when I first heard about the $2.50 charge, until I looked very carefully at what was happening. I discovered that, like all the programs in the retirement income development that has been going on in the Government, this has been extremely well thought through. Members opposite have said quite the contrary, but if there is one thing that has happened in great detail for the last couple of years, it has been that this whole PBS issue has been extremely well thought through. It would be extraordinary to imagine that what has been done now has been done in some cavalier, ad hoc fashion, if one thought of the amount of work that has been put into this scheme in recent years. The package of measures is designed to restructure the PBS in a well thought out way and in a way that will not adversely impact on age pensioners. As has been said before, the proposed $2.50 prescription charge for pensioners will be offset by a simultaneous $2.50 per week pharmaceutical supplement. That, in combination with the $130 per year threshold for the safety net, will mean no net cost to pensioners as a result of these changes. Madam Deputy Speaker, has the clock stopped? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-No. I am assured that it is still going.",125
158,Ms MCHUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"A great deal of concern has been expressed about the possible impact of these changes on pensioners who may use a high quantity of medications in a very short time-that is, more than one prescription a week. Therefore, there was a potential problem in that the chronically ill may have been temporarily disadvantaged. Pensioner groups alerted the Government to this problem. As usual, the Government listened, as it did during the travels to the Gold Coast of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement income, and will now act. Yesterday's press release issued by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) outlined exactly what the Government has proposed. To ensure that chronically ill, full-rate pensioners are not disadvantaged in the short term, they will receive a $50 pharmaceutical supplement lump sum in November. This will cover and protect those pensioners who may have to use a high quantity of medications over a short time. This replaces the $2.50 increase for the 20-week period to March 1991. What is more, if before the March 1991 pension increase those pensioners need more than 20 prescription items covered by the $50 lump sum, they can be provided with a further $32.50 advance. Anyone can see that this has been extremely well thought through and that no one will be disadvantaged. In the long term a program which has suffered terribly in the past will be improved. As the Minister said, the old PBS was encpuraging waste and allowing doctors to overprescribe because there are no price signals in the scheme. Health care professionals became concerned about the level of ill health which was occurring because of the inappropriate use of medication, and several Opposition members have talked about the number of people who have been hospitalised as a result. It is a terrible blow to me to hear these stories because I put my total faith in the medical profession-not in its politics, but in the dispensing of medication. The Minister gave the example that Ministers for Health have been receiving letters from the relatives of elderly people pointing out cases of the hoarding of medication. That is not only potentially dangerous but also highly costly. There is much evidence available to suggest that the unrestricted availability of free prescriptions has led to high levels of prescribing by doctors-and there are numerous instances of this. In fact, it is one of the reasons why PBS costs have blown out by 56 per cent over the past three years. So the introduction of the $2.50 charge, which is compensated, should act as a price signal at the point of sale and at the point where the doctor actually prescribes the drug. There is now a clear incentive, which must appeal to Opposition members, not to overprescribe. Honourable members opposite have spoken about the need to take note of market forces in this area. That is something the Government has had the courage to do in this particular case. In an article in today's Australian Financial Review, Louise Dodson says just that-that as well as cost control, the Government is actually introducing some market reality into a protected and subsidised system. I conclude on another note introduced in the article by Louise Dodson-the health of the pharmacy profession. Seeing that I am perhaps more aware than anyone else in the country of the fears expressed by members of the pharmacy profession about what might happen to them, I should like to quote from Louise Dodson's article. In relation to women in pharmacy: Pharmacists themselves are also changing . . . over 40 per cent of male pharmacists are expected to retire in the next decade and that women under the age of 30 are almost double the number of young male entrants to pharmacy. Feminisation will mean that many more chemists will want to be employees in large operations rather than the previously predominant owneroperators. That is a quote from Mr Feros of the health consultancy group, Feros Riley and Associates. Of course, many of those women pharmacists will be heading those organisations. The article concludes: The restructuring process is likely to benefit strongly the pharmacists who stay in business and who become larger. As in the metamorphosis of the corner grocery shop into the modern supermarket chain, changes are painful for the business operator and consumer alike. But although it will be vastly different, the future' of the pharmacy industry is assured. Pharmacy is going through a revolution, with a pace of change not seen before. That is a very comforting note for the pharmacists, and there are a great many of them in my electorate. As far as I know not one pharmacy has yet closed. Indeed, of the nine that are within about 100 metres of my electorate office, one pharmacy has been added, so there are now 10 rather than nine pharmacies within 100 metres of my electorate office. As the House has spent the whole of tonight talking about how he consumer has been"" protected and helped, particularly those who are most vulnerabl--the pensioners in the PBS-let me, canng so much for the pharmacists in my electorate in particular, conclude on that very stro-g note of optimism for them and theIr profession. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Before I call the next honourable member, I wish to clarify the matter of the timing of the last speech, since the honourable member apparently thought the clock showed the wrong time. The record shows that the honourable member commenced her speech at 9.56 and a half minutes. The Clerk and I checked the countdown on the time the honourable member had left, and it was correct.",127
159,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Notwithstanding the passion with which the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) asserted her attitude to Medicare, she misses the point that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr ""Tuckey) was making, which is that those who can afford the full cost of health care ought to pay, and a lot do not. The 1.25 per cent of the Medicare levy does not cover the full cost of Medicare. If all those who could afford to pay did so, ""the cost of the system to the general taxpayer would be a lot less, the overall effectiveness of the system would be much better and the thousands of Australians who - re queued up for so-called elective surgery-and I know a lot of them - would not have to wait. There are long delays, and these people are often suffering a lot of pain. Meanwhile, there is great underutilisation of private hospitals. There are a lot of things wrong with that system and they are not addressed the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaand ceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill or Social Security and Veterans' Affairs islation Amendment Bill (No.2). As the honourable member for O'Connor rightly pointed out, in the Budget the pensioners really do get singled out. This may not be the time to make a speech on the Budget, but if the same amount of effort and attention that pensioners have received had been diattention rected to the central, overriding issue consioners. fronting this country-that of the yawning overseas current account deficit and burthe geoning foreign debt; if honourable meming about? bers look through the Budget Speech they will see debt mentioned just once-we could have had a lot more confidence in the Budget and in the Government. There is, as Opposition members have asserted, no real cut in the Government's own spending in this Budget. That, neverdecisions, the less, is the spending under its direct control. All we have had is the murderin ously high interest rates of the past months or so, designed to chop private spending, including the crucial compomember nent of business investment. So there is no real cut in government spending in this Budget. There is nothing about a fundamental change in the tax system, such as a goods and services tax which the Opposition is proposing, which would be very much fairer at getting the tax cheats, which would provide a substantial cut in income tax to boost incentive, productivity and saving. Mrs Crosio-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Nowhere in Bills before the House are we talking about tax cheats. Nowhere in the Bills before the House are we talking about the Budget. The Bills are very specific in what they deal with. I suggest to you, Madam Depgood uty Speaker, that if the honourable memprescription ber has not read the Bills he would do significant demands. better to sit down. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs this Sullivan)-I point out to the honourable a member for Prospect that I was present in the House when a previous Deputy Speaker was in the chair and a Governby ment member raised the matter of a goods services tax. Nobody raised a point the of relevance there. That is not enough Legreason for the honourable member for Berowra to make the subject central to his speech. The debate has generally been fairly wide-ranging but I think the honourable member should come back to the subject of the Bills.",128
160,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,I am trying the to make a point about the amount of that has been focused on penin the Budget. This is an aspect of the Budget; this is a Budget Bill. What is honourable member for Prospect talkMr RonaldsonShe must be tired.,129
161,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Yes; she looks perhaps a bit tired. The fact is that we are dealing here with an aspect of the 'Budget. The Government has made much of the fact that it has taken some tough so called, in this area. But the fact is that the really important decisions the light of the situation of this country 18 have not been taken by the Government. The pensioners, as the honourable for O'Connor said, have received a great deal of attention. A focus of the legislation, of course, is the $2.50 charge for prescriptions. Can honourable members doubt that, as this measure was being announced in the Budget, Australia's pensioners were confused and mystified by into what was being suggested? I agree that the issue of overprescription in this major area of pharmaceutical benefits has to be addressed. That needs to be said. But it has taken until to the day-or was it yesterday?-fully three weeks after the Budget was brought into get this $2.50 per week supplement to pensioners into a reasonably equitable shape between pensioners who are, for reasons, dependent on a number of drugs and others with less With that modification, I believe that measure is a reasonable approach to a worsening problem. But even here the Government has addressed only one aspect of the problem. It has not addressed some of the major causes of the increased costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The doctors should be encouraged-even educated-in respect of their prescribing habits because that is a major factor in this problem. The difficult question of patient drug compliance-that is, whether patients take their drugs as directed-is not considered. Yet one estimate has put the cost to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from these matters as high as $700m per annum. Related to this matter of prescription medicines for pensioners, though not specifically covered in the legislation, is the new proposal for a generic drug pricing policy. This is to allow a market price differential between generic products-that is, products of the same composition, quality and effectiveness as better known brands of a medicine or drug but which are generally cheaper than the brand products. Hitherto it has been the practice of the PBS to pay the whole cost of the doctor's prescription so that if doctors, as they most frequently do, often out of long standing habit, prescribe the more expensive brand of product then the PBS pays that higher cost. That has made it very difficult in Australia for manufacturers or potential producers of generic drugs to gain significant volume in the market that counts-the market for drugs prescribed by the general practitioner for pensioners and hitherto 'free' under the pensioner benefit scheme. Since there has been no financial consequence to either the doctor or the patient, the doctors have gone on prescribing the long-established proprietary brands and the Government has gone on paying the cost. What is now proposed with the new generic pricing policy is that the Government, through the PBS, will limit its payment to the generally lower cost of the generic product. The better known brand product may sell at a higher price, and doctors may prescribe it, but the pensioner patient would be required to pay the difference between the generic cost and the higher price of the brand product. There is no doubt that that may not be done without some difficulty. Pensioners may be required to pay more money and not know why or, having the choice put to them, be faced with a decision that they are not qualified to make and should not have to make. But notwithstanding the difficulties arising of that nature, in due course, as the substantial equivalence of generic and brand products becomes better known there will be pressure by pensioner patients on the doctors and there will be a greater propensity on the part of doctors to prescribe the cheaper generic product. In this way generic products will have enhanced prospects of obtaining. a significant share of the market-as such products command in the United Kingdom, for example, 30 per cent of the market and more-and can thereby exert a genuine limiting and downward effect on drug prices and a lesser aggregate cost of pharmaceutical benefits. This is basically a sensible approach to the essential issue in this context, that on the one hand it is cost effective to encourage the generic products, but. on the other hand the companies marketing the so called brand products are those which undertake extensive research and development and introduce new drugs. There has to be a process of recovery of such research and development costs. The new policy is, I believe, a good one. The Government deserves some credit in that respect. Mrs Jakobsen-Say that again.",129
162,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The Government deserves credit in that respect. What is going to be needed in this area is an information program to better inform and persuade doctors perhaps as well as patients. It is a pity that that decision had not been taken last year when there was a bit of a try on between the Government and some major pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result a number of major brands of well-known drugs were taken off the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 1 April last year. While there was a considerable stocking up in advance of that, over the next few months there was a significant boost in demand for generic products. This was met by generic manufacturers over that period. However, this did not begin a growth in the share of generic products because the major brands were encouraged back onto the register provided that they met the generic price. That immediately began the process of eroding the gains in a market that had been made by the generic products. The brand products should have come back in a competitive situation. As now proposed in this Bill they could charge the higher price that they normally wanted to and the generic products could have stayed in the market. After people had been exposed to them, many would continue to use them and the major brands would have had to compete if they wished to put on the extra dollar or two and to be sustainable on that basis. Thus over the April to August period last year we saw a pretty clear demonstration of the capacity of generics to supply a significant portion of the market. The opportunity to begin a new era on the pattern of overseas was lost by the obligation to sell at the generic price. I was saying earlier that this is a Budget which failed adequately to address Australia's overriding challenge-the vast current account deficit and mounting overseas debt, a Budget which unquestionably validated the accord mark 6 deal with the unions which embraced the $1.2 billion tax cut of 1 January 1991; yet it is a Budget where the Government has been very heavy-handed with Australian pensioners. They were confused and mystified at first by the $2.50 prescription charge; that gave way to concern about inequities which now perhaps have been met. Further, the proposal for a deemed 10 per cent return on. savings, while not strictly the subject of this Bill, but applied, as it is proposed, only to pensioners surely raises fundamental questions about civil liberties. Nevertheless, broadly these are issues which need to be addressed. What is necessary is a search for more appropriate solutions. What really cries out for attention is this whole Medicare system which, as the honourable member for O'Connor rightly said, lets the rich enjoy benefits for which they are not paying and seeks to minimise the costs through measures such as are before the House tonight. Debate interrupted. NA",130
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Widow's Pension",131
164,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"During debate this evening emotions have run fairly high because we have been talking about people who are vulnerable. I want to bring to the attention of the House tonight a subject on which I have spoken many times-vulnerable people-and it is not a subject that is going to go away. The people who are subject to some changes of laws and conditions may adjust, but the problem with this particular subject is not going to go away. Those people are not going to adjust because all the time new people are becoming unwitting victims of a change in Government policy of a couple of years ago. I refer to the change in requirements relative to the widow's pension and supporting parent's benefits, and the requirement that in order to qualify for certain benefits these women in the main have to undergo certain job searches and rather humiliating frequent reporting to a Commonwealth Employment Service office on their attempts to get jobs. Because of some concern at the time that the measure was announced, the Government did give some leeway to widows. It reduced the requirement that they report within a fortnight of becoming widows on what they were going to do about getting a job. They now get three months. I know that I cannot be the only member who gets approaches from women in great distress because of this particular Government policy and its implementation. The question is not going to go away because all the time new people are being affected. I want to read into the Hansard tonight some correspondence that I recently received from a woman in my electorate because I think it sums up just about every case that has ever come through my door. She says: My husband passed away on 1 February 1990. I received a letter of sympathy from you on 6.2.90 and also an offer of assistance. I now feel I need some help regarding my widow's pension. It seems that widows under 50 years of age are not considered in Australia. Social Security allowed me to have the widow's pension for 14 weeks after his death and also my late husband's invalid pension for 12 weeks which they called bereavement pay. I received this in one lump sum and this almost paid for the funeral. Now I have to be on unemployment benefits and have to suffer the humiliation of lining up every fortnight and explaining which jobs I have applied for. I interpose to say that I received this letter on 22 June 1990. That is 41/2 months after her husband's death. I continue: I must explain the reason for my husband's death. He was only 47 when he was diagnosed as having Alzheimers disease and I had been looking after him for almost three years. The devastation which this disease causes is absolutely horrendous as you mayor may not know and I feel that three months is not a very long time to recover from something like this. I looked after my husband a lot longer than usual, I guess because of my age which was 43 at the time. I am now 46. Naturally, older folk have more trouble coping but it now seems I have to suffer because of it. I have days when I am very down and cry most of the day, which I understand is part of the grieving process. I have no intention whatsoever of sitting at home for the rest of my life as I am still young enough to start a new life, but I feel I am not emotionally ready to tackle employment just yet. Please can you help me in this matter. The only reply I could give was as follows: Thank you for writing to me about the Social Security legislation governing the situation of widows aged under 50 years. I totally sympathize with your plight-I made numerous speeches on this heartless policy when it was announced. I could not persuade a single journalist to take any interest in it at all, so naturally the Government remained unmoved. I cannot help beyond continuing to criticise the policy. Opposition Policies",131
165,Dr CATLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) had some pointed things to say about the direction in which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has supposedly been taking the Labor Government. I would like to remind honourable members of the direction in which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) would like to take the whole country. We received a few clues on this subject in the Weekend Australian colour magazine of last weekend. The Leader of the Opposition was brought up in Welfare Avenue. He is now a collector of Jaguars, Mercedes and Rolls-Royces and the owner of a new house with rooms as yet uncounted. But the political views of the Leader of the Opposition get little mention, although he does say that the immigration intake is either too large or too small. Clearly, he has been advised to sit back in the hope that the Government will self-destruct. Some hope! Meanwhile, I will be giving my Adelaide electors something to chew on in outlining the five-point program that the Opposition has for this country as an alternative to the Government. First, the Opposition says that the Government's Budget was not tough enough and that expenditure should be reduced by a further $3 billion. Where from? We get a few clues when expressions like 'genuinely needy' are used to describe benefit recipients. Well, here are a few of the recipients that can be nominated to contribute their share to the welfare chop. There are the pensioners, who are now on 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, I proudly say. There are single mums, those dependent on invalidity benefits and family allowance supplement recipients. Secondly, the Opposition would introduce a new tax. At a time when this Government has cut Government revenue to levels which applied in the early 1970s, the Opposition would introduce a new tax on goods and services. Most goods already attract some form of sales tax. On what other goods would this tax be imposed-food and clothing? A new tax on food and clothing at, say, 15 per cent would add about 7 per cent to the cost of living for ordinary Australians. Why would the Opposition introduce this tax on essentials? It would do so in order to use the savings to cut income tax levels for people who earn $35,000 a year and more. This would no doubt do wonderful things for the used Ferrari market and assist $120,000 donations to the National Party in Victoria. Thirdly, the Opposition would abolish the national wages policy. In March it had no wages policy. Do honourable members remember the blunt admission of the then Leader of the Opposition-and I am sorry he has left-'Who is to know what the wages policy is'? Six months later the Opposition still· has the same position. The Opposition hopes that the burst of unemployment created will cow workers into submission. Fourthly, members of the Opposition sweated for six months for my constituent, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), to germinate an industry policy. Two weeks ago the Opposition gave birth to a policy of abolition of all protection for secondary industry. Having protected the whole sector indiscriminately for a generation, the Opposition now proposes to abolish all protection in less than half that time. When asked, 'What impact would your policy have on clothing, textiles and footwear?', the Opposition spokesman answered, 'There will be changes in all those areas and I think some businesses will be in trouble'. I hope the Advertiser puts that on its front page. That is not a policy; it is a scorched earth policy. Finally, the Opposition would hold a fire sale of public assets as an alternative to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda. It would sell off Telecom Australia wholly. The result would be that a privately owned monopoly would control the information nerve centre of this entire nation. Community service obligations would be taken off the corporate balance sheet and put under the same budget that the Opposition has already told this House it would reduce by $3 billion. Timed telephone call charges, here we come. I hope the message gets through to the Adelaide electors. My fellow Labor delegates to the national conference to be held in a couple of weeks will also bear in mind the view of the Leader of the Opposition that there is no reason why the Government should run the banks, that the Government should vacate the sector. In short, the direction of the Leader of the Opposition is to slash social welfare and pensions, reduce taxes for the well-off, while taxing essentials, thereby increasing inflation by adding about 7 per cent to whatever it is at the time he gets the unlikely opportunity to introduce these policies. The Leader of the Opposition would have an unrestricted fire sale of public assets and push the unemployment button in the place of a wages policy. Welfare Avenue indeed! Soup kitchen lane here we come! What a disgrace. I can only hope that the Leader of the Opposition has a phone in his Ferrari so that my numerous electors who will be concerned about this issue will have the opportunity to phone him. Environment",132
166,Dr BOB WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to thank Simone Hunt of Santa Sabina College in my electorate for writing the details of this speech on the importance of the environment. Firstly, I will give an idea of how bleak life would be without our environment. A small boy sneakily emerged from his underground city. He was forbidden to go up there, but the temptation was just too great. In his hands he held his grandfather's diary, in which was an entry denoting the place where he was standing. It said, 'I look around me and I am absolutely spellbound by the beauty of this place. I am surrounded by lush green trees and there are living things everywhere I look'. The little boy looked around and all he saw was a lifeless stretch of cracked, parched desert land. He had never seen what the diary had described and guessed he never would. Maybe that example is a little extreme, but at the rate we are going in destroying our environment, this may be the situation we will be facing in the future. With soil degradation, deforestation and desertification all attacking our earth, how can it be expected to survive? The cause is our selfishness and our want for energy and increasing technology. Thus man's main flaw-our un satisfiable want for more and more and our ignorance in attaining it. The most frustrating ignorance in society today for some is the mismanagement of our lives. One Forestry Commission pamphlet states: Theythe forestsare renewable under proper management. Forests can keep producing wood in perpetuity. Statements such as these may sound ridiculous to some, next to facts which state that the world consumes enough wood to cover Manhattan to the height of a 10storey building. Our reaction to this may be to point the finger at the loggers, the major paper companies, and the agriculturalists, but the fact is that we are all offenders as we supply the demand. Trees are just so important not only as an integral part of nature and because they look beautiful, but because they are indeed the lungs of society. On a small scale, they remove polluting gases such as ozone and carbon dioxide. We are increasing pollution, yet we are eliminating our natural purifiers. When great areas of trees are cleared, many species of animals lose their homes, causing extinction of some of these species. During the next decade, one million species of plants and animals may become extinct, which is the same extinction rate as that for the last 20 million years. Not only are the animals which live in the trees affected, but so is the land itself. When earth is stripped of its natural covering and is overcultivated and overgrazed, the land becomes a desert. The forests produce rich, moist soils by sheltering the soil and providing organic wastes for the humus. Once the forests are gone, the earth is exposed to sun and to irrigation, extracting the richness through overuse. Once desertification has taken place, the earth is useless. That brings us to the problem of soil degradation, which is the major issue in Australian environment problems today. Fifty-five per cent of Australia's arid land. and 45 per cent of the non-arid land requires treatment due to overcultivation and erosion. Once the top layer has been depleted through erosion, the soil is irreparable. We also have the problem of salinity, which now affects some 4.2 million hectares of land. This forms a salt crust on the surface of the earth and deems it to be useless. Both of these problems are caused partly by the depletion of trees and, in turn, this is due to the fact that, without the trees' anchoring roots, both soil and salt are dislodged, causing these terrible problems. Once the soil degradation has taken place by either erosion or salinity, neither arable nor pastoral activities can continue. Thus, through wanting more by overgrazing, man discovers that he is now in fact getting less. In certain areas of Australia, he is getting none. The usual agricultural land in Australia is already limited due to the aridity of the content, so all the good land is indeed scarce and it should therefore be treasured and not abused. At last everyone is beginning to discover the importance of our environment as it supports us and many animal species. People are beginning to make changes for the better. Trees are being planted; there is less pollution being exposed to the atmosphere; and people are now recycling paper and are more aware. This good work must continue if it is to make a marked improvement in our environment. The environment is natural and beautiful. Should not our children and grandchildren be able to appreciate it t.oo? Rugby League",133
167,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (10.43)There is a battleground in Parliament House at the moment. Everybody is taking sides. Friends are pitted against each other. This Sunday, the great Queensland team, the Broncos, and the Canberra Raiders will clash. The winners will play Penrith in the grand final. Good friends are divided. Commonwealth car drivers and parliamentary attendants are well and truly committed. One can feel the tension rising. We Queenslanders are well and truly used to having the odds stacked against us. The Sheffield Shield and, of course, this year's State of Origin are two prime examples of overwhelming odds. Wayne Bennett and the Broncos have done us proud. Everyone in the Sunshine State, from Premier Wayne Goss to every sixyear-old, is barracking for the Broncos from Queensland. I would like to read out the names of the squad, because they will do us proud on Sunday: Paul Hauff, Dale Shearer, Willie Carne, Peter Jackson, Chris Johns, Kevin Walters, Allan Langer, Gene Miles, Terry Matterson, Bob Conway, Andrew Gee, Mark Hohn, Gavin Allen, Greg Dowling, James Donnelly, Kerrod Walters. They are the names that we are very proud of in Queensland. I would like to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr - evis), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), and the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) are all committed to seeing the great Broncos team win. Just for 80 minutes, my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) and I are at odds. The gloves are off on Sunday and my good friend Mr Bob Kemp and I will be against each other. For 80 minutes, it is total Queensland parochialism. Of course, the great Kevin and Kerrod WaIters, Gene Miles, Greg Dowling, Allan Langer, Terry Matterson and Peter Jackson will spearhead the attack. While we will be taking it up to them for the full 80 minutes, I also congratulate the players in the great Canberra Raiders team-their coach, Tim Sheens, in particular Gary Belcher, the great Mal Meninga, of course, and the Canberra Raiders patron, the Hon. Ros Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It is extremely difficult for us Queenslanders to pick a side when we have people like Mal and Gary playing on the other side in addition to Gary and Steve. I well remember as a youngster watching Mal's dad, Norm Meninga, play for Wide Bay. Indeed, I was speaking tonight to a former great Bundaberg and Queensland representative, Rex MCGlynn, who played football with Norm and said that he was not only a great player but also a great gentleman. Rex said that Norm played with both Wharfies and Natives in Bundaberg. I am proud to say that I too played for eight years with Natives, the greatest club of all. While many issues divide States, none can compare with Rugby League this weekend. The Broncos will create history for our great State, and we all look forward to the great clash, the premiership and the Winfield Cup, the weekend after next when we beat Penrith. Telecom Australia: Rural and Remote Area Program",134
168,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I raise an issue brought to my attention by a constituent in my electorate who lives in the small township of Muckadilla in the south-west of Queensland. This township, like many others in remote Queensland, was recently converted from a manual telephone exchange to an automatic telephone service provided from a digital radio concentrator system-the DRCS. Because this township falls under Telecom Australia's rural and remote area program (RRAP), anyone wanting a new service connection, or even one moved from one house to a new location in the town, is required to pay a rural connection fee. In this case the fee amounted to $1,450. There is no choice in this matter. Telecom policy discriminates against people living in small communities, and with constant advances in technology this discrimination will continue. It should also be noted that rural connection fees are not restricted to remote locations but apply where a service is required to be connected more than 16 kilometres from the nearest exchange. I made representation on behalf of my constituent to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), whose representative promptly told me that, as a government business enterprise, Telecom made its own commercial and management decisions within the context of legislative requirements and government policies. The Government appears to have the best of both worlds in the Telecom arrangement. It regulates the industry but takes no responsibility for policy setting. It is rationalised that Telecom remains a public corporation to ensure fair play. However, when instances of unfair play are raised, the Government cries, 'No responsibility'. Perhaps if the Government got out of Telecom, someone somewhere would be comfortable taking responsibility for policy. If there is one worthwhile cause that the Government could take up, it would be to attract people resources to provincial Australia via reasonable telecommunications. The stigma should be removed from living out bush. After all, it is incial Australia that contributes most to our export income. I am strongly of the opinion that the costs of a new telephone connection in established townships should be kept in line with the charge in large towns, and the distance charge which applies because of remoteness to the automatic exchange should not apply. The constituent concerned and thousands of others in the same predicament have no alternative. If they want to install a telephone they face an unreasonable fee. For most people, and I imagine the majority of honourable members present in the House tonight, this is totally foreign. The telephone remains an unconscious convenience for urban dwellers. However, on the admission today by the Minister for Transport and Communications, 50 per cent of rural telephone calls are long distance. Therefore, provincial Australians not only pay more for individual calls, they also face unrealistic connection fees. Rural communities do not have the privilege of untimed local calls; it is possible to pick up the phone and talk all day. In some suburbs of Brisbane, a phone call to an adjoining city-for example, Ipswich-can be made at the cost of a local call, whereas constituents in the closest township to my electorate office in Dalby have to make a long distance phone call to reach either me or my staff. I urge the Minister to look at this problem and take it up with Telecom. A change in Telecom RRAP policy must come about to bring the connection fees in remote towns in line with those in larger communities. Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations",135
169,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT," I refer to a rather serious matter which concerns the irresponsible behaviour of the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in relation to the report I tabled yesterday from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The honourable member for Dundas in his comments in the House provand to journalists chose to give the impression that the majority recommendations in the report were not passed by the majority of the Committee. Parliamentary committees proceed under fairly strict rules. There is no doubt that all of the recommendations made in the report which I tabled were passed by the majority of the Committee at the time they were put in that Committee. In a desperate attempt to get support for his dissenting report, the honourable member for Dundas organised a number of very unusual arrangements, one of which was for a telephone call from Senator Olsen, who was not at the meeting on the Monday when the report was finalised. That telephone call was made after the report was on its way to be printed. In that telephone call, Senator Olsen advised that he was intending to support the dissenting report of the honourable member for Dundas. Throughout all of the discussions, Senator Olsen had in fact supported the majority approach in the report. The recommendations embodied in the report included comments and suggestions of Senator Olsen. Mrs Sullivan-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to put you in an invidious position, but is the honourable member not out of order, to say the least, in telling this chamber about the private discussions of a committee and the individual contributions made by members of that committee? Surely that is a breach of privilege.",136
170,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,It is not a breach of privilege. Mrs Sullivan-It is a breach of something.,137
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The Committee's reports would be in the minutes. Mrs Sullivan-The honourable member is referring to statements that people contributed in the debate and in discussions with the Committee.,137
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I will allow the honourable member for Calwell to continue.,137
173,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,"After the Committee's report was on its way to be printed, I received a report from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was in London. He did not have the opportunity to see the full report. This was again a dissenting report which agreed with a considerable number of the recommendations made by the honourable member for Dundas. It was significant that, in pointing out that there were a number of dissenting reports, he failed to indicate that the proposal of the right honourable member for New England would have established an even wider and more generous scheme than that suggested by the majority of the Committee. In the course of the Committee's proceedings, an attempt is made to get agreement on the major recommendations, and those recommendations are included in the report. Dissenting reports on different aspects can be made by members of the Committee. It does not necessarily follow from the fact that there are a number of dissenting reports that the majority of the Committee members did not support the Committee's report. The impression given by the honourable member for Dundas in the statement he made to the House yesterday and in the statements he made to the media was that the Government should not take the report seriously. That was grossly irresponsible action on his part and behaviour not befitting a person who is the Deputy Chairman of that Committee, especially considering that many days and hours of deliberation went into the preparation of the report. As the honourable member said in his own comments, this is a matter of delicate judgment as to how one achieves a fair balance between compassion and control in the immigration program. Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations",137
174,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Dundas) (10.56)There are manners and conventions of this Parliament in relation to the way in which questions are raised which go to the credibility of other members of parliament. Tonight the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has seen fit to breach one of those conventions and has certainly displayed very poor manners indeed. He and I have spoken today on a number of occasions, but at no time did he mention to me a concern about this matter. At no time did he mention to me that he was intending to raise the matter. I regard it as unfortunate, in the same way that I regard it as unfortunate that he, as the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, did not wait yesterday to hear the remarks that I uttered in relation to this matter. I do not resile in any way whatsoever from what I said about the Committee's report. I believe that it lacks credibility. I believe that it lacks credibility because it was a report which was determined in a way which did not enable a consensus to be developed amongst the members of the Committee. I made it very clear when I spoke yesterday that the way in which the discussions unfolded and the pressures under which the Committee was constrained to conclude its deliberations militated against this. I quoted from the remarks of each of the Committee members who submitted dissenting reports. I made it very clear that the dissents were on different aspects of the report, but that they all undermined the credibility of the regime that was put forward by the majority-a majority which the minutes of the Committee disclose to be four. The honourable member fof' Calwell saw fit to express concern at the time at which certain members of the Committee were able to add their voice to the dissenting reports that they agreed with or, in the case of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), submitted himself. The fact is-and I disclosed this at all times during the Committee's deliberations-that, as I drafted my own dissent, I submitted it to those members of the Committee who were not there in order that they could consider their position. That is a courteous and proper thing to do. I did not try to influence the right honourable member for New England at all and, as can be seen, he wrote his own dissent and submitted it from overseas. He had paid studious attention to the deliberations of the Committee and had strong views on the matter, and he put them. The honourable senator about whom reflections were made, as the honourable member knows, suffered the tragic death of his brother which did not enable him to participate in the concluding stages of the Committee's deliberations. But the honourable member said that he desired to exclude him and his option to join a dissent.",137
175,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,I did not.,138
176,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member did. He impugned his integrity by suggesting that I arranged with him at the last minute for his dissent to be added to this report.,138
177,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member is misrepresenting me. I did put in both of those things even though they arrived late and the honourable member knows that.",138
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, I do not uphold the point .of order. The honourable member will please resume his seat.,138
179,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"The fact of the matter is that the honourable member had a view and I certainly facilitated his being able to add his dissent to the report. I have never seen an addendum of the sort that was added by the honourable member in relation to this matter because he ensured that it was noted that Senator Olsen's dissent was telephoned through at 6.30 p.m. on Monday, 10 September. So what? He agreed with the dissenting report that I had submitted. That was his view. He was entitled to have it heard. What is this postscript meant to mean? It was meant to impugn the views that he had formed.",138
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The time being 11 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Beddall to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Brisbane Air Traffic Services Centre.
