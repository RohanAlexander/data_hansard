2,Mr SPEAKER,INTERESTS,"In accordance with resolution 3 of the House of Representaportunity tives relating to the registration of memand bers' interests, I have appointed Mr L. Barlin, Deputy Clerk of the House of Representatives, as Registrar of Members' Interests in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. have also appointed Mr Bernard Wright, Clerk Assistant, to act as Registrar during any period of absence of Mr Barlin. MEMBERS: MAIDEN SPEECHES",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,INTERESTS,"I have had drawn to my attention the question of what is, what is not, a maiden speech in the conhave text of the unique situation where we have a number of new members who are on the front benches in this Parliament. These members may be placed in a positionur'er indeed, I think one of them was yesterday, and some will be today-where they have to make a statement not of their own choosing, such as a second reading speech on the introduction of a Bill, reply by the Opposition to a second readon ing speech or a speech in reply on a ter of public importance. In my opinion, these speeches will not be considered to be maiden speeches. A maiden speech will be a speech of a memin taxation ber's choice that is made at the time of his or her choosing. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",10
4,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I move: to That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Treasurer making forthwith to this House the statement on taxation policy which he intends to make outside the Parliament later this day. I so move because yesterday there was a lot of talk from members of the Government about the Government mending its ways in terms of the respect it holds for this Parliament. Yet today we find that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is to make a ministerial statement-a statement to be made not in this House, but at the NaWe all know that the Treasurer has had his minions working away for long hours preparing his speech, and the Opposition today provides the Treasurer with an opto walk into this chamber now read his speech here, treating the ParN. liament with the respect that the Government yesterday claimed to have for this great institution, instead of reading his I speech at 12 o'clock at the Press Club. We think that this Parliament ought to be debating one of the great issues which is the subject of consideration by the community at large. We think that the Treasurer and, thus, the Parliament ought to have the opportunity to consider a and proposition which the coalition parties been very strongly advocating, and that is that there ought to be a review of the consumption tax debate. Instead, today we will have a bucket from the Treason this very issue. The Treasurer is infamous for some of his one-liners over the years. Let me today have the pleasure of se'eing some of a those one-liners come back to haunt him the subject of the consumption tax. matThis is the man who said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald in August 1985: If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal then you won't see significant reform in this country for the balance of this century. This is the same Treasurer who said, also in 1985, on the consumption tax of which he was then a strong advocate: I think fairness is what Australians have wanted. They have wanted a government with the courage take hard decisions, to clean out this swill of a tax system. What we're trying to do is to get everyone back to some basis of fairness. One of his best was early in the consumption tax debate when he was approached by a journalist who said: ' Mr Keating, there are a few who are a bit worried about this consumption tax proposal. Is there any chance you might back off before the debate has really gained a foothold?'. He gave us these immortal lines: We're not shrinking violets. We're not about to disappear when the first whiff of grapeshot the trenches. Of course this is the man who is first the trenches over at the National Press Club today. The need for sensible debate is, effectively, our challenge to the Treasest urer today-a simple challenge. He should come down here and tell the people what it is that motivates him to swap his !ion, to do a complete somersault on Issue. It is a very simple proposition that our Parliament ought to discuss an issue which the public is debating. We have the Nawear tional Farmers Federation debating it. Senator Button was asked: 'Do you think it is a good idea for the public to have debate about the consumption tax?'. His answer, after it had gone through to the Prime Minister's office was: 'It is a great idea for the public to have a debate about it. In fact, the only people who should discuss it are members of the Governbe ment'. Even his own Department is reperson viewing the consumption tax debate. Back in 1985 the Treasurer said: If we fail to approach tax reform constructively we have failed not just ourselves but the nation gallery. generally. I say to the. Treasurer: He fails himself, he fails his Government and he fails this Parliament if he is not prepared down here and debate a matter of great national concern. He went on-and are not these words appropriate? - to say: The spoilers in any such process will have to answer for in condemning this and the generations of Australians to the blight, tant unfairness and gross suffering of our tax regime. We say to the Treasurer today that he is the spoiler. He is going to the National Press Club not on the basis of some sena sible, constructive debate but on the basis of running a populist campaign, the very campaign that he was accusing his oppofor nents of running back in 1985. The hypocrisy of these people is absolutely breathtaking. Yesterday they claimed that they want to do something about the standards of parliamentary duct. They claimed that they want to do something about the respect in which this Parliament is held by the community at passes large after, I might add, having significantly lowered standards themselves. Let into no one have any doubt about who has lowered standards in this Parliament. It is the people on the other side. The greatevidence of that is the way they conduct themselves at Question Time. I have spoken to people who have been here, posisay, 10 or 15 years ago and who then this have come back to this Parliament and they have been shocked at the way in which this Parliament has fallen into disrepute. Honourable members opposite will that. That is their responsibility. To add insult to injury, the person who parades the contempt with which these a people treat the Parliament is none other than the Treasurer himself. If honourable members look at his record on the way in which he conducts himself in this Parliament, they will see that it leaves much to not be desired. No-one in the gallery would surprised if I said to them that the whose language goes to the depths the most often is the Treasurer. I think the whole Australian public knows that.",10
5,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,They are nodding in the,11
6,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I appreciate that support from those there. They know it, as the to come whole public knows it. Let us not focus just on the language of the Treasurer but his whole attitude to Question Time. Many honourable memmuch bers here will remember the Treasurer's next statement a couple of years ago when, in the blathe heat of debate during Question Time, current he said that Question Time is just an indulgence the Government gives to the Opposition when it feels like it. I say to the Treasurer that Question Time is not matter of indulgence. It is not a favour that the Government gives to the Opposition. Question Time is an opportunity the people of Australia to call the Government to account. It is a central part of this institution and it reveals in the most significant way the manner in which this Government and this Treasconurer hold the Parliament in contempt. Who has been the greatest exponent of another practice which holds this Parliament in contempt? This is, of course, legislation by media release. It is none other than the Treasurer. Some examples of that, again say much for the Government. A curre-t example is the luxury sales tax which was announced not by the Government but by a political party during the election campaign. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, might be i,nterested to h-ar that we have a Cabinet handbook which the Government has revised dealing with the whole' subject of legislation by press release. That luxury tax proposal from the Government breaches its own guidelines, the guidelines it revised a couple of years ago. We say that when there is a proposition in respect of legislation there are times, and everybody recognises it, when a statement from the Government is appropriate in advance of legislation going through the Parliament. That ought to be a shared matter between us. However, there is no handbook, no set of conventions,. no set of rules and no set of views as to the running of this Parliament which the Treasurer is prepared to accept. He treats the Parliament with contempt. Mr Speaker, I think this is an unarguable case-",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,12
8,Mr REITH,TREASURER,We say that the Treasurer ought to come in here and make his statement.,12
9,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Is the motion seconded?,12
10,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,1 second the motion.,12
11,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,It is good to see you again.,12
12,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"It is great to be back. I commence my contribution to this debate by congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your re-election to the position of Speaker to the Australian House of Representatives. In doing that may I remind you and the House that when you were elected yesterday there were some very fine words from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and. the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) about the Importance of the institution of parliament. The public, I think, would have found a fairly resonant note in those words offered by the three party leaders. Even the more cynical of us may have thought that perhaps things will be different; perhaps there is a new dawn; perhaps the parties and their leaders have listened to the long-suffering public and do believe that the parliamentary institution in this country can have a new beginning and a new respect. There is a plague on both our Houses. Anybody in either of the major political constellations in Australia who pretends otherwise is deluding himself. I remind honourable members opposite and my colleagues on this side of the House that in the last election the combined vote, at a primary level, of the major constellations of politics in Australia was the lowest since World War II. We all ought to take a lesson from that. There are a number of reasons for it. One reason is that we engage in the humbug of saying that parliament is important and then we behave as though it is not. On the first opportunity the Treasurer is put to the test of that new and lofty principle he flunks it completely. At present two specific political issues are on the agenda against a background of continuing concern about the state of our economy. Those issues are immigration and taxation. Today we will get a statement from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) but we will not be paid the courtesy of a statement from the Treasurer about an issue in relation to our taxation system that will simply not go away. I have news for the Treasurer: no matter what he says at the National Press Club today the issue of a broad-based consumption tax is well and truly back on the national agenda; and it will not go away until it is introduced. If ever an issue has been mishandled on both sides of Australian politics it is the issue of a broad-based consumption tax. On this and many other issues the public is groaning for a proper public debate. It wants a willingness on the part of both sides of politics to debate the issue. sci what does the Treasurer do on the first opportunity to demonstrate the new beginning, the new respect and the new r-verence for the parliamentary institutIon? He scampers off to the National Press Club.",12
13,Mr NA BROWN,TREASURER,For a free lunch.,13
14,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"For a free lunch-and he says, 'To hell with the Parliament. I don't care about that. They are only the Australian people. It is far more important that I have a venue of my convenience. I will treat the Parliament with utter contempt'. This motion is all about one central issue: whether we care about the institution of parliament sufficiently to require the senior members of the Government to treat this Parliament with respect. If we are to get off to a good start and say to the Australian people, 'We have heard your disillusionment about the major political parties; we do get the message', then we can begin right here with our own forms and practices. We can all begin to behave as though we care a bit about this institution and about the people who send us here-and the way we do that is to treat it with respect. On any canon of parliamentary tradition and practice the statement that the Treasurer will make to the National Press Club today ought to be made to this Parliament. It would be a lasting insult and a lasting reminder of the arrogance of the honourable member for Blaxland were he to choose, at the beginning of this Parliament, to treat institution with contempt.",13
15,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"New members of parliament will be pleased to know that one thing has not changed in this Parliament: when Opposition members debate these issues, they are high on unction and low on content. If the implied undertaking of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that parliamentary standards will be improved is correct, that will be a pleasure, as he was one of the Opposition's chief yahoos in the last Parliament. If the fact that he has now been promoted to Deputy Leader of the Opposition means that he has changed in that regard, it is to be welcomed. We would not want to set that aside. This is just an exercise in unction. The last thing that the Opposition wants is a debate on the consumption tax for the simple reason that, whilst before the last election it had a position, now it does not have one. Wilson Tuckey tried to provide those opposite with a position yesterday, and they squibbed the opportunity.",13
16,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Minister will refer to the honourable member by his seat.,13
17,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"The first point that every honourable member in this House knows is that matters of great national public importance are rightly debated in this chamber. Many of those issues are on today's Notice Paper. The second point that everybody knows it that the National Press Club has, over the years, under those opposite when they were in government and under us when we have been in government, provided opportunities for shadow Ministers and Ministers to make major policy statements and discuss major political issues in relation to their portfolios. Leaders of the Opposition and Opposition spokesmen after Opposition spokesmen have stood up at that National Press Club. They have not said, 'No, I will reserve my remarks for matters of public importance. I will reserve my remarks for opportunities of general business matters in Parliament. No, I will go this out there. I choose this forum to get a view through to the nation'. It is just poppycock to come into this place and to say that somehow or other the Parliament is being demeaned by the fact that a long standing practice of making statements to the National Press Club is a practice that will continue. Opposition members should not be so darned hypocritical so early in this Parliament. Opposition members talk about the Parliament being brought into contempt by the behaviour of its members. Nothing brings Parliament into contempt more than promises that are sent out the back door by governments when they get elected. That is what brings politicians into contempt. Odd-y enou-h, the - ay-to­ day business of thIS - arhament IS not followed in great detaIl by members of the public. Mr Sharp-Why?",13
18,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Because they are actually working. We are working during the time that members of the public a-e at work themselves. Members of the public do not turn on the radios in their offices and listen to the deliberations of this Parliament for the simple fact of the matter is that,' if they did, they would be dismissed by their employers. And one could expect that to be the case. This Parliament is brought into contempt when people place a position before the electorate in an election campaign and then walk away from it immediately afterwards. That brings politicians into contempt. When people go home and have an opportunity to think about politics, having finished their day's work, they see not what has happened in Parliament but what has been presented in policy terms. I ask: What on this issue has been presen ted in policy terms by the Opposition as recently as six weeks ago? Let me provide a few quotes. Opposition members like to take the position of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in their advocacy of their position in 1985. Much has changed in the taxation system since then. Let me take the position, of the then Leader of the Opposition of 12 March 1990. He said: We decided not to have a broad based consumption tax in our first term ... When would the first term have been had the Opposition won the last election? Right now; right here and now. To con""' tinue: . . . for two main reasons. One, we want to cut Government expenditure and we want the focus to be on cutting Government expenditure. And you don't you know, to be crude, want to give a new Government a new tax, as was the case in New Zealand where a significant percentage of the revenue from the tax was actually spent by the Government or in the case of the - K - ven, Thatcher doubled the VAT in the early eighties and spent a substantial amount of the gain .in boosting social security and health penditure. We want to focus our attention on expenditure restraint. Secondly, there is already a very wide range of consumption taxes. The Opposition stated very sensibly in its remarks on 12 March why this ought not to be a matter of urgent consideration for this Parliament. The Opposition stated its position very clearly: in this Parliament consumption taxes ought to be off the agenda; in this Parliament we ought to be talking about expenditure restraint; in this Parliament we are not in a position to review these consumption tax issues. How long ago was that? One or two months ago. Now what the Opposition invites the Government to do-and we gave similar undertakings during the last election campaign on the consumption tax that we would not be talking about it in the context of this Parliament-is to bring this place into contempt. If the Opposition wants to bring the political process into contempt, then it should tell the Government to breach its electoral promises and tell its members to breach their own electoral promises. Mr Reith interjecting",14
19,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,14
20,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"The Opposition made its position on what ought to happen to a consumption tax absolutely clear during the last election campaign. There were no ifs, no buts. The Opposition was not going to confront the electorate with a suggestion that a good consumption tax ought to be put in place in order to relieve pressures on business taxation and in order to relieve the consequences of its position on capital gains taxes. The Opposition was not prepared to argue that to the electorate during the last election campaign. I really wonder why not. But the Opposition chose not to be silent on the issue. It did not shut up on it, run dead, or create opportunities for itself. If the Opposition had been elected and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) had been standing here now as Prime Minister, he would be standing here on the basis of a flat rejection of a consumption tax for the next three years. ex- That would be the position those opposite had presented to the Parliament. Only one group in the political processes has wavered from its election promises as far as this issue is concerned and that is honourable members opposite. As far as we are concerned, we retain the position that we had during the election campaign. So honourable members opposite should not come into this place wrapping themselves in some holy shroud as the people here who support the parliamentary process, who do not want to bring the parliamentary process and the political process into contempt. What the Opposition proposes and what it invites us to do brings its own election campaign into contempt. If the Government were to adopt the same attitude as the Opposition, that would bring the Government into contempt as well. We are not going to provide the Opposition with that opportunity to so demean us in the eyes of the public. Things have changed since 1985changed no thanks to the Opposition. A very different taxation regime exists in this country than existed in 1985 when the Opposition was fighting us in the ditches to preserve the business free lunch, when it was fighting us in the ditches to keep in place a capital gains tax that massively benefited the non-productive sectors of the wealthy in this community, that laid waste to manufacturing industry and let all of the real estate speculators and funny money market men on the financial exchanges cut loose. That was - he Opposition's capital gains tax promIse. The reason we do not have to sit in this place and accept the Opposition's invitation to breach our election promises in the way in which the Opposition wishes to breach its election promises is that we changed the taxation system fundamentally back in 1985, no thanks to the Opposition. What happened as a result of that was that the taxation regime being imposed on pay as you earn taxpayers was able to be very substantially altered, no thanks to the Opposition. As a result of that, the opportunities for getting the same sorts of tax cuts that might have accrued from a consumption tax disappeared out the window. The other reason that opportunity or necessity disappeared was that, unlike the Opposition, we have been able in our period in office to exercise a degree of fiscal discipline. The fiscal discipline that was called for only two or three months ago by the new Leader of the Opposition was in fact the fiscal discipline that this Government has been able to exercise. There is no room to play about with consumption taxes unless one wants to introduce them for one very important reason, and that is to lower things like business tax rates or to put one in a situation where one does not breach one's promises on one's capital gains tax proposals. This is a dishonourable proposition that the Opposition has put forward and we will not be party to it.",14

23,Mr TIM FISCHER,INDONESIA ZONE OF,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.41)This important legislation seeks to clarify 9 May 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 89 NA the arrangements pertaining to the Timor Humphreys, B. C. Gap between Australia and Indonesia. The Opposition is not opposed to this legislaJohns, G. T. tion. Indeed, the honourable member for Kerin, J. C.  Foreign Affairs, played a very important Lavarch, M. H. role in facilitating the original discussions which carried on over a lengthy period, MCHugh, J. indeed, many years, before finally a treaty was reached under the Federal Labor Morris, Allan Government of Australia and the Indonesian Government. I have a copy of the O'KeeFe, N. P. O'Neil, L. R. T. same treaty in my hands at this time. Price, L. R. S. Punch, G. F. This legislation seeks to enact the parts relating to the treaty into Australian law, Scholes, G. G. D. Sciacca, C. to present to this Parliament the treaty as a schedule in the main Bill, the Petroleum Scott, I.es Simmons, D. W. (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill. The treaty is entitled, 'A Treaty Snowdon, W. E. Staples, P. R. Between Australia .and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in Tickner, R. E. an Area Between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia'. Willis,R. The Opposition has a number of concerns with regard to the legislation. I will come to those in a moment, In principle, our PAIRS position is one of support in the national interest of exciting legislation which will allow the resumption of oil exploration in an area with great potential. Clearly, Australia's need to find more oil is paramount. This will help facilitate this in conjunction with Indonesia. I am quite sure that the Government and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), are quietly relieved that this legislation is coming on at this time and not prior to the last election. Had the then honourable memSecond Reading ber for La Trobe been in full stride I am sure he would have wanted to speak on these Bills. I am quite sure even the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) would have had something to say, given his long standing support of Fretilin and the aspects associated with the complex East Timor question. That is a separate matter. I will not dwell on it other than to say that there is a need for the Australian Government to do what it can to reach an understanding in relation to helping to provide for the removal. of any legal challenge which might be forthcoming in respect of the whole package associated with this legislation. I should point out that Australia and Indonesia are near neighbours with an important relationship, one which has fluctuated over the years and which flows from their proximity and a range of other contacts associated with the bilateral relationship. Australia has a population of some 16.5 million. Indonesia has a population of 175.6 million people. In 1986, the most recent comparable year available to me, Australia had a gross domestic product of some $239.4 billion; Indonesia had a gross domestic product of some $112.2 billion. That has increased somewhat since 1986. Clearly we are two very large countries in this region of the world and our economic futures are related. Over the years there has been a lack of wholehearted cooperation on many fronts for various reasons, but I hope that this legislation will usher in a new beginning-a fresh approach. It certainly confers an added dimension to the relationship between Australia and Indonesia in a very practical sense. The legislation sets out to create a zone of cooperation. That zone, in turn, is divided into area A, area B and area C. Area A is, of course, the larger of the three areas. It is the area to which the joint Australian-Indonesian authority-which will be created under the legislation and which will, in summary form, provide for a 50 : 50 take of the revenue flowing from the arrangements associated with area Awill pertain. Area B is to the south, closer to Australia, and will be administered by Australia. The revenue split ratio of area. B will be 90 per cent to Australia and 10 per cent to Indonesia. Area C, to the north, will be under Indonesian control, and the ratio will go the other way. In broad terms it will be 10 per cent to Australia and 90 per cent to Indonesia. There is a raft of other ratios, formulas and percentages in the legislation which differ from those figures which I have just given, and I refer members to the detail of the legislation in that regard. Essentially, the intention is to create three areas within the zone of cooperation on a sensible basis, with the centrepiece of that measure to be the joint authority to be established between Australia and Indonesia for the administration of area A, which has the two most exciting kelp structures identified and which, hopefully, will provide a boost to the oil production of both Australia and Indonesia. The area known as the Timor Gap comprises 60,000 square kilometres. It has remained a disputed area for a lengthy period of time. In 1961 the Flamingo One well was sunk and remains the only well recorded in the area. It showed good results in terms of oil and gas at 3,700 metres. Subsequent seismic work has proved successful. Australian and Indonesian geologists have been very impressed by the potential of the area covered by the zone of cooperation, particularly area A. Under the legislation a joint ministerial council will be established to oversee the joint authority created in respect of area A. The head office of the joint authority will be located in Jakarta, and its technical office in Darwin. The coalition is concerned that it may not be the most practical arrangement for the efficiency of the joint authority for the headquarters to be split between two different locations. We invite the Minister to comment in respect of that splitting of the headquarters as to what additional steps will be taken to ensure the efficiency of the joint authority and its operations and activities. There are other areas of concern apart from the split headquarters. However, I acknowledge that perhaps the only practical way to bring about the agreement was to split the headquarters between Jakarta and Darwin. Nevertheless, every step has now to be taken to ensure that that arrangement works. I have mentioned in passing the Portuguese claim, which is still spoken of, and the suggestion that it might be taken to an international jurisdiction. That is a matter of more than passing concern. Of course, the coalition stands as one with the Australian Government with regard to the underlying recognition which has been extended to East Timor. The second area of concern relates to the small service companies associated with exploration, and their requirement to set up a separate entity so that they can operate in area A. I would submit that, as the legislation is drafted, it would seem that companies which provide per- . haps plumbing services or catering facilities to a drilling platform in the Timor Gap-they are not large multinationals; they are not even large Australian companies; they are small service companies which exist in Darwin and elsewhere, such as at Sale in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran)-because of the different taxation regimes which will apply in areas A, Band C, will certainly need separate sets of books and separate entities set up for them to operate; likewise, in regard to complexities which would flow from some other aspects of their operations within area A. I invite the Minister to advise the House just what will be the obligations of those small businesses and service companies which operate in facilitating oil exploration, the operation of drilling rigs and the establishment of production platforms. Are they going to be burdened by additional cost structures merely to participate in area A? The coalition will carefully consider the response the Minister gives with regard to that particular matter. There are additional concerns about the structure of the joint authority and the practicality of having joint executive directors-one Australian and one Indonesian. I mentioned the split headquarters, and, again, certain senior echelons of the joint authority will have a 50: 50 split between Australia and Indonesia. I hope it works. I believe there is a great deal of goodwill on both sides to help make it work. But I sound the warning that it will r-quire a great deal of goodwill to work, - Ive- the structure embraced by this legIslatIon, and it will require particularly a very firm commitment from the two executive directors to a very practical liaison between them if the joint AustralianIndonesian authority is to work. There is something else, pertaining to the joint authority which, I think, is pertinent and Parliament should know about it. Key aspects of the contracts and permits which will be developed, released and entered into between companies and the new joint authority are going to be published. That is provided for in the legislation. That is as it should be. I think there are a lot of dangers in existing provisions which try to keep the public's right to know down to a minimum. I commend that aspect of the measure. Equally, the legi-lation provides that the joint authority will issue an annual report. That annual report will go to the ministerial council and that ministerial council will adopt it. I have to say that there is no provision in the legislation requiring the annual report then to be tabled in the Indonesian or Australian parliaments. I happen to know the Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament, Mr Kharis Suhud. Indeed, the honourable member for Gippsland and I had some very animated conversations with the said Speaker when he was Deputy Speaker. He made some very forthright comments on Radio Australia, as I recall, and on a number of other matters, which left us on the back foot at a celebrated meeting at the Indonesian Parliament. But we ended up very good friends after a lengthy discussion and, indeed, Speaker Kharis Suhud has visited Albury, in my electorate, as part of a parliamentary delegation and has been extended a civic reception. I know that he would have similar concerns that an annual report would not just rest at that ministerial council level but, quite properly, would go back to the Indonesian and Australian parliaments in accordance with long standing convention. Indeed, under other threshold legislation every Australian department is required to produce an annual report and that report is tabled in the Parliament. With this in mind, I had an amendment drafted, but ran into the problem that this is a treaty between Australia and Indonesia. This treaty is the main schedule of the legislation. In a sense that creates practical and real difficulties which I do not want to discuss as I do not want to endanger the national interest, given all the legislation's ramifications. We then looked at inserting the following new clause in the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990, on page 2 after clause 4: Annual report to be tabled in Parliament. '4A (1) The Minister shall, not later than ting days after 31 December in each year commencing with the year 1991, cause a report on the operations of the Act during the period of 12 months that ended on the preceding 30 June to be laid before each House of the Parliament. '(2) A report pursuant to subsection,(l) may tain comments on issues arising from the, operations of the Act, the Ministerial Councilor the Joint Authority.'. I put to the Minister that because of the construction of the Act that in another sense is not the tidiest way of proceeding. I ask· that the Minister assure the House that the annual report of the joint authority-ministerial council will, in the normal course of events and at the appropriate time after each year, be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. I ask that he do that in his response in the House of Representatives because it will be relevant to the proceedings in the Senate. I look forward to his response with regard to that very important matter because, whilst this is an agreement between Australia and Indonesia, we are a sovereign parliament and with regard to the government, government instrumentalities, government business enterprises and joint government authorities we have a responsibility to monitor their activity and progress in accordance with Australian legislation. It is for that reason that I raise these annual report requirements in the strongest terms. Certain other matters will be covered by my colleagues during the committee stage of the debate, including the adequacy of penalties which has been further, considered. There is an established practice for the conversion of penalties. Certainly the era of fining a major corporation $15,000 for an oil spill, causing environmental havoc and disaster in Alaska, for example, or anywhere else has passed. There have to be adequate penalties. These are addressed in some detail in the legislation. We need to examine that aspect very closely indeed. Overall the legislation is complex. It has to be complex legislation, given the treaty and all the ramifications involved. I acknowledge the achievement the treaty represents and I pay tribute to the government officials on both sides, who helped facilitate the treaty and to both Australian 15 sitgovernments that were involved and the Indonesian Government. We have to get on with the task of finding more oil in Australia as quickly as , possible. It has been estimated that in this con- decade, the 1990s, Australia is at the peak of domestic crude oil production. It is expected that this year we will produce some 32,000 megalitres of petroleum. That will decline quite rapidly. By 1999 production will be down to some 15,000 megalitres. At the same time, demand will climb from around 35,000 megalitres this year to around 45,000 at the end of this decade. So the gap between our crude oil production and our crude oil consumption will grow rapidly throughout the 1990s. Flowing from that are two very important ramifications for the Federal Government: firstly, for the balance of payments and, secondly, for Federal Government revenue associated with excise and other taxation regimes. So we have reached a very critical stage in Australia with regard to the energy equation. Our current oilfields are close to their maximum levels of production when considered collectively and crude oil production is projected to decline quite rapidly throughout the 1990s. This 'legislation represents, in a sense, our best chance to look for a further major breakthrough. For 10 years or more exploration activity in the area of the Timor Gap has been virtually frozen, which is regrettable. These negotiations had to proceed. The matter had to be sorted out to provide a legal basis on which exploration might continue, permit areas might be issued and ultimately, and hopefully, production proceed. In relatiqn to that one particular company has legitimate concerns with regard to all aspects of this measure. No doubt that company, in the correct forum, will seek to pursue those concerns, depending on the passage of legislation and all other arrangements entered into and flowing from the creation of the joint authority. Equally, the - u-tralian P-tr-leum E:xploration Assoclatlon has mdlcated Its broad support of the measure because it is very keen to see oil exploration and producti-n proceed in this - xciting area which eXIsts between Austraha and Indonesia. The Opposition is concerned. that this legislation has been brought on for debate just 15 ho-rs after its fo-mal introduction. The BIlls became avatlable to members in general terms late yesterday. The two Bills are very complex. This situation has set up a very cruel timetable with regard to the legislative process. The fact that such important legislation has been rushed into the Parliament is a matter of concern to the coalition, as is the fact that we have this legislation by exhaustion, this deadline approach. As I have said, the legislation was not readily available until the last moment. It was introduced yesterday. It is being debated in the House of Representatives today and will be debated in the Senate in a short time. It is being rushed through the Parliament when it has very important ramifications for the sovereignty of Australia and for the energy equation facing Australia during this decade. I thank the Government for making a copy of the legislation available to me ahead of its introduction into the House of Representatives yesterday and for the briefing provided, but that does not overcome the fact that this legislation was dumped on the Parliament yesterday, is being debated today and will, in the normal course of events, be through the House of Representatives a little later to-ay .when it goes to such important subJects as the relations between Australia and Indonesia. . T-e coalition is not opposed to the leglslahon. It recognises the importance of the treaty involved. We hope that it will pa.ve the way for a more mature relationShIP between Australia and Indonesia, a practical, cooperative working relationship. For that reason the coalition is not opposed to the legislation but it condemns the Government for the fact that the legislation was brought in yesterday to be debated today. That is not good enough for the legislative processes of the Australian Parliament as, this day, it enters its ninetieth year of operations.",16
24,Mr SNOW,NOES,"1 agree with most of what the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has said about the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone· of Cooperation) Bill and the Petroleum (AustraliaIndonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill., I would say to him that the Government, by placing the legislation at the top of the list, has given it a high degree of importance. We have been talking about the legislation for a long time. It represents a very important recognition of a new maturity in relationships between Australia and Indonesia. In the late 1940s, the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement supported the independence of Indonesia which was followed by some big problems between the two countries. There was the Cold War, which mixed the issues of anticolonialism and communism, and Indonesia became a moving force in the nonaligned movement. Full credit must be given to Indonesia in that, along with Yugoslavia, at a very early stage at the Bandung conference it moved for nonalignment. Australia was uncomfortable with that and, at the time, there was very little basis for good rapport between the two countries. The government of the day more or less tried to preserve colonialism in many countries. At that time. I was about to go into national service and Indonesia was considered to' be a potential problem area for Australia. However, it is true that even the government of the day tried to set up some relationship with Indonesia. Prime Minister Menzies invited General Nasution to Australia. Indonesia was at the forefront, the frontier, of the Third World-a third world which was on the move. We were not comfortable with that either. There were faults and problems on both sides. I do 'not want to pass judgment on the problems but, for instance, President Sukarno saw British action in Malaysia as a neo-colonialist plot. There was also the Vietnam issue. In the view of countries such as Indonesia, Australian involvement in Vietnam meant that Australia was getting on the wrong side in a dispute by an anti-colonialist force. So again we saw the anti-colonial struggle being confused with communism in the eyes of Indonesia. There have been many critics of the agreement that we have come to and are talking about today. Just yesterday I received correspondence from the Indonesia· Human Rights Campaign. An advertisement quoted an open letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stating that the United Nations General Assembly had unanimously declared that 'no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression shall be recognised as lawful'. It is attacking the Timor Gap Treaty on the basis of action that was taken by Indonesia in East Timor. I remind honourable members that 'Timor' means 'east'. I believe that there is a lot of validity in people's arguments, but Indonesia also has some arguments-the fact that Timor is in the archipelago and the fact that at the time. it was confronted with the choice of having a civil war in the local area or being taken over. These matters probably need to be settled in international forums, but I think we can safely say that for some timenot just for the time being-Indonesia will have jurisdiction there. This is a fact that countries have had to recognise through millenia, not just centuries. We have two neighbours with very different cultures and they owe it to one another to come to terms with that. Both are rich in resources, including that which the Japanese described as the greatest resource a country can have-that is, people. Portugal has had a long involvement in Timor-for 300 years, I understand. It claims that it is the legitimate authority. It has had to sort out its own domestic political problems and now it claims that it is the authority. But the fact is that there are domestic political issues even within Portugal which provide the reasons for its present stance. We need to recognise that international law today is not domestic law and we have to face the reality of territorial occupancy over many centuries. Even today Australia is criticised because there are islands which some groups say should have independence from Australia. It is not necessarily the people of those islands who say that, but still that argument is put forward. Another point to inake is that this is an outstanding area to resolve in the bilateral arrangements between Indonesia and Australia. It is very important that we move towards that. It is important that we recognise the economic advantages to both countries of the moves being taken. It is very important that we limit, as much as possible, the differences between the two countries. As the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Leader of the National Party have mentioned, there will be three zones of cooperation. Area A will be the area of joint development where the control of petroleum operations will be exercised by a ministerial council and a joint authority on behalf of Australia and New Zealand. Area B is the area of sole Australian jurisdiction and Indonesia will receive 10 per cent of resource rent tax revenues from the area. Area C is the area of sole Indonesian jurisdiction and Australia will receive 10 per cent of company income tax revenues from the area. The joint authority and the ministerial council, which have been outlined by the Minister, are working to draft joint authority regulations and directions dealing with a whole range of extremely important and complex issues which have to be dealt with-the technical, safety and environmental aspects of petroleum operations. In addition, procedures and arrangements are being developed concerning the practical aspects of the fiscal, customs, migration, quarantine, search and rescue, environmental protection and pollution control, employment terms and conditions, marine scientific and research, and occupational health and safety arrangements agreed under the treaty. Much of the wo-k. of the jo-nt authority will involve divIdmg area A mto contract areas with the aim of releasing exploration acreage in that area towards the end of 1990 or early in 1991. There is not very much knowledge about the geology of area A, so it is not possible to be precise about its petroleum potential. That is why Australia and Indonesia both want to encourage companies to explore the are- fully. We do .know about some interestmg structures m the area. We do know about the kelp structure which companies will be keen to target. Area A is within the Timor Sea region, which is a proven petroleum producing province and, very importantly, a proven oil producing region. Mr Willcox, the Chief Executive of BHP Petroleum, rates the region in the billion-barrel class. The discovery of the Jabiru oilfield in 1984 to the south-west has significantly upgraded the chances of finding oil in area A. Continued discoveries in the region, such as that at Talbot-I, announced recently by Santos, confirm the potential. The commerciality of Talbot will not be known until further appraisal is done on the field. But the test of around 5,000 barrels a day is encouraging- To further illustrate the importance of this region, production from the Jabiru-Challis-Cassini fields could reach 100,000 barrels a day next year. We have seen the long development of what are now very worthwhile and, I should say, overdue relationships between Australia and Indonesia. They could have come much earlier if they had not been obscured by the trauma of the Cold War, the confusion between anti-colonialism and communism and the trauma of East Timor. We now have opportunities for two great countries in the region with good resources--'--Aust'ralia and Indonesia. --t us take advantage of those opportunItIes.",20
25,Mr CONNOLLY,NOES,"Bradfield) (11.15)The Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill and the Petroleum (-ustralia-Indonesia Zone of CooperahOI?) (Consequential Provisions) Bill, WhICh we are debating today, are, as my colleagues have already stated, of profound importance to the relationship between Australia and our nearest neighbour in Asia-Indonesia. For me personally it is a particularly important piece of legislation because I was part of the Australian negotiating team which, back in the early 1970s, successfully negotiated with Indonesian authorities the Australian-Indonesian sea boundary between what was then the Bensbach River on the border of Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya through to the area in the Timor Sea which has, up till now, been subject to contention and then flowing on towards the Ashmore and Cartier Islands. I therefore welcome, as do other members of the Opposition, the final conclusion of what can only be said to be a period of extreme gestation. When we negotiated the original agreement we came to the fundamental problem of what to do about the part of the seabed adjacent to what was then known as Portuguese Timor. Putting it quite simply, back in that period, due to the confusion and the political uncertainty in metropolitan Portugal, it was simply not possible to conclude successfully an agreement. If it had been possible and in Australia's interests, there is no doubt that we would have negotiated on the basis of a continuation of the seabed boundary agreement with Indonesia, simply joining the two points, both north and south, of what are now sections A, Band C. However, that was not to be. Therefore, over the years that have passed, discussions have continued on and off to see what could be done about this outstanding problem, which is not a problem just for Australia and Indonesia, but one which has wider implications because of the, till relatively recently, continuing political problem of Timor. It also has considerable ramifications at the international level. As the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) rightly pointed out in his second reading speech, in many respects· this is possibly a new step forward in the negotiating position which can be adopted between countries in relation to seabed boundaries and in conformity with iaw of the sea conventions. An examination of the actual seabed in this area of the Timor Sea reaches some very interesting conclusions. The Timor trough is one of the largest and deepest areas of water in this part of the Indonesian archipelago. Whether it has any resources is of course a matter of great conjecture. As I recall, at that stage the real problem was that technology-since then technology has advanced-was not available to effectively seek resources at that depth. However, towards the Australian mainland, in what are now defined as areas A and B of the agreement, there was no doubt, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has rightly pointed out, that there was significant potential. The then Bureau of Mineral Resources advised the Government that we should negotiate an agreement, which naturally was to be in Australia's interests and which would give us as much access to the continental shelf as possible. It is fair to say that those negotiations were conducted on that basis and that they were successful certainly from Australia's point of view. Any examination of the boundary agreement and the median line which is now on the map demonstrates quite clearly that we managed to safeguard Australia's continental shelf. However, the new agreement can be said to allow Indonesia access to part of the potential revenues from oil search which would be successful on that part of the continental shelf covered by the areas A, Band C. That is the ultimate outcome of a very complex negotiating position adopted by both sides, particularly the Indonesians. But I would be remiss if I did not make a number of observations in the context of this debate on the background to the circumstances which created the problems in this area. In April 1975 there was a historic meeting at Townsville between the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and President Suharto. According to Dr Nancy Viviani in an article in the Australian Outlook, Suharto gave Whitlam an undertaking that Indonesia would not intervene by military means in Timor and Whitlam said that self-determination should be the approach. As one who has read the record of conversation of those meetings, I have to say that that interpretation is not entirely accurate. It would be fairer to say that, while those points were made by the then Prime Minister, the strong impression one gets from reading the record of conversation is that ultimately a green light was given to Indonesia to take whatever action it considered necessary. While this is neither the time nor the place to raise those very difficult issues again, it is significant to point out that the history of this particular agreement is closely related to the events which took place at that time. As I have said, the agreements which we signed with Indonesia in May 1971 and October 1972 were significantly limited by our inability to reach agreement over this part of the Timor trough, which is now successfully completed and is the subject of this legislation. Nevertheless, I think the point needs to be made in regard to what I hope is the final chapter in Australia's relations with Indonesia in relation to Timor. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that if and when significant revenues are finally gained from these wells-presuming they are successful-in accordance with the agreement contained in this legislation, by which Australia gets a share of revenue gained from the sea and Indonesia gets a share of revenue from parts of the Australian section, would it be possible for both nations, in the interests of the people of Timor-and I speak of Timor as a whole in this context because Timor is one of the poorer provinces of Indonesia-to come to an arrangement essentially as a goodwill gesture as much as anything else to ensure that part of that revenue is allocated to Timor for the economic and social development of the people of that province? As we well know, it has been subject to substantial political and military activity for many years. That has had a major impact on the social and economic well-being of the community. It is absolutely essential for Australia's relations with Indonesia that we put the past behind us. As we all know, the past tends to colour both the present and the future. Both governments h-ve a - espon­ sibility to the people of TImor 10 that context to ensure that all - he - eople of Indonesia, whether the- be 10 Inan Jaya, Sumatra, Java, - u.lawes- or anywhere else are able to part1Clp-te 10 the future economic growth of theu country. My colleague the Leader of the National Party of Aust!alia (Mr Ti- Fi-che-) made some interest10g observatIOns 10 hIS address which are worth noting. While our gross domestic product is $239 billion Indonesia's is still $112 billion, yet it h-s a population in excess of 175 million compared with Australia's 16 million. I recall that some years ago at a conference at the Australian National University an Indonesian academic made an observation that Australia was really only the appendix of Asia. Maybe that is so. But as far as our specific relations with Indonesia are concerned, it is our closest Asian neighbour. It is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, an organisation with which we must continue to have the closest relations. While we have different social and political systems it is important that every effort be made to ensure that in the future we maintain a better, and I hope a deeper, relationship than we have managed to establish in the past. In that context it is quite correct for the Minister to make the observation which he did in his second reading speech that this agreement, which was signed on 11 December 1989, is the most important ever entered into between Indonesia and Australia. It is therefore a treaty of immense importance to us, not least because of the evidence through the success of the Jabiru, Challis and Cassini fields and other fields which no doubt will be opened in this area. We see this as possibly the most prospective area for oil search off the Australian coast. It is worth noting for the record those v.ery important figures. Australia's domeshc crude oil production at present is some 32,0.00 megalitres, yet it is expected to dechne by approximately half to some 15,000 megalitres by the end of this decade. At the same time, if we graph those figures, honourable members will see that where the lines cross our domestic demand is expected to increase from 35,000m megalitres to 45,000m megalitres by the end of the decade. The revenue implications of that are extremely serious as are the balance of payments ramifications. Consequently, the need for Australia to find more domestic sources of oil both on our continental shelf and on the mainland is essential. The evidence of oil search in this country over the last 20 or so years demonstrates quite conclusively that we have a higher likelihood of success on the continental shelf than we have on the mainland. It also goes to show that if we examine the depth and the width of Australia's continental shelf, with the exception of the area in the Bass Strait where we know we have found substantial oil reserves, the second most likely place for oil search is in the Timor Sea. The Timor trough is effectively the demarcation line both in the technological and in the political sense on the developments in that area. We must expect to see in the coming years a considerable growth of interest in that area. That leads me to the other point which I think needs to be made: the question of compensation and so forth in relation to companies which over the years may have held access to leases for oil search in the area. As I recall a map of that particular area, it was fully covered by various companies. Whether or not they will be able to return to the area is to be subject to the agreement. It is significant that the Indonesians require that there be a total clean slate approach. In other words, whatever previous agreements have been entered into by the Australian authorities with the companies involved-and they are quite numerous: Elf Aquitaine Ltd, Woodside Petroleum Ltd in consortium with Shell Australia Ltd, BP Australia Ltd and BHP Petroleum Pty Ltd, and Western Mining Corporation in consortium with Petroz NL and Charter Oil-will be disregarded. Presumably, all of the companies which have, or thought they had, interests in the area will be required to negotiate the basis on which they continue oil search in this area. In that context the question of compensation will no doubt arise. Another issue which I think is worth noting is the relationship between Australian and Indonesian law in so far as it affects persons working in the oil industry in sections A, B or C. It is interesting to note that, for example, in area A the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has been successful in negotiating arrangements by which .Indonesian citizens, while they may be subject to Indonesian law in areas such as normal activities and taxation, will, for all intents and purposes, be under Australian trade union arrangements and award payments. That is an interesting example of the obvious power that the ACTU seems to believe it can apply in areas such as this. It will be a substantial advantage to many Indonesian citizens who presumably will be receiving higher wages through that structure than they would under their own arrangements. Nevertheless, the degree of oil search in the Indonesian archipelago in recent years has been substantial. A large international community is now involved in oil search on various rigs throughout the region. The whole concept of having a three area structure is unique. We have area A which will be subject to a joint Australian-Indonesian authority with a fifty-fifty revenue division; area B somewhat to the south administered by Australia with Indonesia receiving 10 per cent of any revenues gained from oil found in that area; and area C in the north on the edge of the Timor trough will be under Indonesian control with Australia receiving 10 per cent of the take. As I said initially, this is a unique agreement. However, I am rather intrigued to see the suggestion in the Minister's second reading speech that it is only on a provisional basis. I would be grateful if the Minister in his reply could explain to the House why, after so long and after such a complex period of negotiations, we are told that this is a provisional agreement. Does that mean that the substance of the agreement is provisional or does it mean that the actual contractual arrangements attached to the agreement are o of a provisional nature? One c,ould und stand the latter but it would be m difficult to comprehend the logic of t former. I would have' thought that at 't stage, because of the long gestation peri in oil search, the substantial capitalisati involved and the time taken to develop field, any suggestion that this is onl provisional agreement would, if anythi frighten away international investors a Australian companies which otherw would be more interested in a long te agreement. Nevertheless, we have a signific agreement in place. It is one which have a major impact on Australian-Ind nesian relations in the future. It is v important to ensure, if we possibly c satisfactory relations with Indonesia, a whether something can be done to ens that part of the revenues find their w to the people of Timor. I emphasise t I refer both to citizens of ex-Portugue Timor as well as those of Indonesia Tim in an effort to raise the standard of livi of both segments of the island as fast possible. ' I would like to make another interesti observation about oil search. Australi , oil generally is of a heavier quality co pared with that found in Indonesia. understanding is that the oil which is lik to come from the fields in the Timor S area will also be of a similar viscos more to the Indonesian type. That is qu significant because that oil has a lo carbon content and is highly sought af and, therefore, commands a higher pri That opens up another interesting qu tion which I would appreciate the Min ter's comments on: that is, the act status of the payments made on oil an in particular, the provisions in the agr ment which allow the joint authority market any or all of the petroleum p duced with the approval of the minister council. The Minister's second readi speech goes on to say: . . . when the Joint Authority can, receive a b ter price than the contractors. ' This opens up two intere,sting questio Does this mean that contractors could precluded from entering into the wo spot price market or does it. mean that the agreements they entered mto would have to be of a long term contractual nature? Could the Minister please explain, therefore, in that particular context what impact the agreement could have on the freedom of a producer .to - nter the international spot market wh1ch 1S always, as the Minister is no doubt well aware, subject to considerable fluctuations literally on a day ?y day basis and wh-t that means in relatIOn to the power wh1ch the joint authority apparently has to market any or all of the petroleum produced with the approval of the ministerial council? Considering the fact, as I understand it, that the development of the oil industry in Indonesia is a state run monopoly and considering the total private sector involvement that we have in the Australian industry, both in the oil search level and in the delivery and sale of oil products, is there not a potential conflict, philosophically at least at the ministerial level, between the interests of Indonesia and the potential interests of the Australian and international producers working through Australian contracts in this area. They are legitimate questions which need to be raised in what, as the Minister rightly pointed out, is a particularly complex piece of legislation covering a most significant international agreement between Australia and Indonesia. The treaty also extends well beyond questions of production sharing and covers taxation and arrangements for the ministerial council and the joint authority. It also covers issues likely to be encountered in exploration for and exploitation of petroleum. The previous speaker for the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party, referred to the question of pollution of the marine environment and whether or not the provisions in the legislation are adequate to protect the environment against polluters. The potential risks to Australia's coastline adjacent to the Timor Sea could have some parallels to what took place in Alaska. . This is a subject which deserves to be carefully considered.",22
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,26
27,Mr WRIGHT,NOES,"Capricornia) (11.35)The legislation that is before the House at the moment-the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990-is the culmination of 14 years of discussion, debate and, in manY' instances, disagreement over a very important geographical area between Indonesia and Australia. Honourable members who have read the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and who are also interested in the history of Timor will know that the debate over the seabed boundaries goes back to 1971 and 1972. At that time general agreement was reached but there were three unsettled areas. One of the important areas was the Timor Gap area. In December last year the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and Mr Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, came together and signed a very important treaty. This Bill will give effect to that treaty and I applaud it. I am pleased also to see that the spokespersons for the Opposition are in support of what our new Minister for Resources has introduced. I hope the treaty will ultimately end the conflict over the competing seabed boundary claims and, importantly, it will be the beginning of a new era of cooperation between two important countries, the most important countries in my opinion, in South East Asia-Australia and Indonesia. Cooperation is very much the thrust of the legislation which seeks to establish a zone of cooperation and allow joint development projects specifically in the area of oil exploration. It will mean that the two governments and the peoples of the countries will work together for the benefit of both nations. The agreement is a major breakthrough. It is regrettable, therefore, that we have some dissent in Britain where some members of parliament are trying to regenerate the concerns that relate to Indonesia and East Timor. Mr MACKellar-Labour members, I think.",26
28,Mr WRIGHT,NOES,"They are Labour members and that is regrettable. I, for one, dissociate myself with the position being taken by those members. I make no apology for publicly being known as a friend of Indonesia. I am proud to be such. I have been a supporter of Indonesia for a long period. I supported the position taken by the former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, on East Timor. I think it is regrettable that the East Timor issue is still around on the international political agenda. I think it is grettable that Portugal continues to hype up the issue, continues to try to have this matter taken to the International Court of Justice and continues to try to bring 'other countries into the debate. If one goes back 20 to 25 years one would say ! that Portugal has little to be proud of in II its relationship with, its administration and involvement in East Timor. I I visited Indonesia early in 1989. I had the privilege of speaking over a long period with the Governor of East Timor. I spoke with Foreign Minister Alatas, President Suharto and many other influential people. I also spoke to people who had financial and business interests in East Timor. I repeat: the time has come to take East Timor off the international political agenda. I think we need to put an end to the distortion that has taken place as to what was supposed to have been the rule of Indonesia in East Timor. It is time it was placed on the record that it was the East Timorese who invited Indonesia into East Timor. That invitation was accepted by Indonesia, and one would understand why. Ultimately our country recognised Indonesia's sovereignty. That recognition has existed for 20 years-for two decades. It goes back to 1979. If one looks over those two decades, one sees the great change that the Indonesians have wrought in the island of East Tinior. It has been a major change. There has been a change in the quality of life. During this period hundreds of schools, hospitals and administrative centres have been established. One can contrast what takes place today in terms of the number of young East Timorese who are receiving an education with what happened 25 years ago when a handful of young people ever attended high school, let alone ever gniduated from high school. Today those numbers are measured in the tens of thousands. It is true that it is the Indonesi-m involvement in a partnership with the East Timorese' that has brought about a new era for East Timor. I repeat that it is time that this issue was taken off the international political agenda. Let us see that there is renewed cooperation. I believe that the legislation brought forward re- by our Minister for Resources will achieve so much in this respect. The treaty is so important.· It will not impede in any way Australia's efforts to help the East Timorese people as we want to. I believe that the treaty will ultimately lead to a resolution of this debate about who owns what in seabed boundary terms. of This is the first step. We have two countries that. have argued for 14 years, and more so in the last 10 years since 1979. The two countries have come together and said, 'Let us work together, let us explore and then let us exploit these resources for the betterment of both countries'. I am confident that- as this cooperation is put in place, as we are able to demonstrate that we can work together for the economic advantage of our two nations, we are going to have a closer political relationship, and we need to. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made the point about Indonesia being our closest South East Asian 'neighbour. It is a vitally important neighbour. There are 176 million Indonesians and 17 million Australians. Indonesia, which is spread over 13,000 islands, is keen to be friends with us. I spoke recently with the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia about what is taking place in education terms in Indonesia. At the moment, some 11 million Indonesians are learning English. They are doing so because they want to gain entrance to higher learning. I believe that we can supply those services. There are enormous opportunities. I am not talking about military cooperation; am 'talking about economic cooperation. uha's been constantly said that South East Asia is the new economic zone of the twenty-first century, and I believe that. I believe the' Association of South East ASian Nations is going to be the key. It is going to be the vital, catalyst for econof!1ic growth for the Paclfic, the South Paclfic and the Indian' continent. Indonesia is central; it is so important. I 'am pleased that we have taken the first step as a government and, I believe, as it parliament. There is bipartisan support here and that is certainly to be applauded. We are not setting aside the arguments in regard to the rights that certain East Timorese people have. One would always understand the nationalist spirit of people. But 20 years have passed and in those 20 years good things have occurred. I hope that the cooperation that is being underpinned by way of this legislation will become a practicality. While the legislation will establish a very specialised framework of cooperation in the petroleum industry, it certainly could be analogous to so many other areas of cooperation. Honourable members who take the opportunity to read the legislation will see that it is going to mean a new involvement internationally in terms of protecting the marine environment. This is something that I think will have to be picked up, copied and duplicated by other nations. This is going to happen. We are not only going to have exploration and exploitation but also we are going to have a coming together of two countries to protect the marine environment of an area that adjoins our countries. I am most pleased that the environmental aspect of this has been taken on board. I want to finalise my comments by stressing the importance of the oil exploration industry. Other honourable members have referred to this. In Australia at the moment we use something like 17 megalitres of petroleum and about nine megalitres of distillate. Put in everyday terms, this is 17 billion litres of petrol and nine billion litres of distillate. The costs will continue to rise. We will be able I to keep those costs down-and one understands the importance of this to industry, not just to ordinary motorists-by ensuring that we produce more, that we have a higher domestic production. The way to achieve that is by exploring in the continental shelf area of the Timor Gap. We desperately need to make ourselves self-sufficient in fuel terms, in energy terms. Those who have reservations about this agreement ought to come back to the broader economic needs of this country. As they do so, I believe they will see the importance of working with Indonesia, hopefully to overcome the need to import fuel for this nation. I will be making some comments later in the day, in debate on the appropriation Bills, about the petroleum industry when I will refer in some critical terms to the 'oil companies. In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister on introducing this very important legislation as his maiden legislation. This is important for Australia; it will have vital international consequences and I believe it will be the foundation for a new friendship and a new partnership between two. great countries, Australia and IndoneSla.",27
29,Mr MACKELLAR,NOES,"Warringah) (11.46)...:-The Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill before the House have been dealt with on a number of levels by honourable members speaking in the debate. Before I commence my remarks, I just reiterate and reinforce the comments made by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), in addressing the House when he drew attention to the fact that this legislation has, been rushed into the chamber so quickly. It is complex legislation. I fail to see at this stage why it has to be dealt with in such a hurry. Honourable members would have been better served if the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the Government had brought in the legislation and then given some real time for people to examine it closely and draw some more detailed conclusions. Having said that, most honourable members who have spoken so far have drawn attention in the main to the foreign relationship aspects of this legislation, which are, of course, of very profound concern. One of the things that bedevil relationships between countries is when there is some dispute as to territorial boundaries between· two nations or a number of nations. In the past this area of the Timor Sea has been the subject of some disagreeabout ment between Indonesia and Australia as to demarcation. I am very pleased to see that agreement has been reached as many things flow from that agreement. Relationships between the two countries can continue to develop and expand parattention ticularly now that one area of dispute has been settled. As honourable members have said, it is important that we have a opment of understanding .and cooperation exponential rate. and coordination of effort between Indonesia and Australia. . The discrepancy between the populanot tions of the two countries has been menabsolutely tioned by previous speakers. Australia has roughly 17 million people. It looks very likely that the population of Indonesia will exceed 200 million people in the very near future, and it is expanding very rapsaying idly. So the human resources of Indonesia are enormous. It also has a very great profundity of natural resources. It is most important and significant nation one with which we have had some mispetrochemicals understandings in the past. The best interests of this country require that continuing cooperating and understandmously ing should be in all ways expanded and developed. This agreement will give us an opporsaying tunity in a very real and practical sense speeches. to develop that coordination and cooperation because it requires that joint operaand tions take place in the development of this area. That will put to a very practical test the capacity of representatives of this Australia and Indonesia to work together and get things right. It is important that occur. Some very real and practical lessons will be learned in the day-today operation and development on an ongoticularly ing basis of exploration effort and exploitation effort over the years. Another aspect of the legislation which needs to be expanded, and which has been touched upon already, is the growing requirement for Australia to have in-reased supplies of energy, particularly petroleum energy. The figures have already been mentioned by various contributors to this debate: our own capacity at present·. of 32,000 megalitres per year, going down to 15,000 megalitres produced in Australia by the end of the decade if nothing else is found, while at the same time Our so requirements going from 35,000 megalitres to a projected 45,000 megalitres by the end of the decade. I want to draw to that because the response has always been that we must find more within Australia-,-I agree with that-because the develdemand will continue to expand at an . This extraordinary dependence on petroleum energy, the petrochemical industry, is one of the great dilemmas facing only Australia but the world. There is no doubt that here is a finite amount of energy available on the planet. We and other nations around the world appear to be going ahead blithely dealing with the problem of a limited supply by that we will just keep exploring all over the place to make up for that ever increasing demand, without giving suffia cient thought to ways in which we could and diminish the demand for energy based on or other ways in which we could supply the increasing demand fOI our energy around the world. It is an enorcomplex problem which has not been given the attention it deserves eitheI here in Australia or overseas. I will be more .about that in subsequent Another thing that I wish to mention which has also been brought. forward by previous speakers in this debate is the environmental aspects of exploration in area. Again, this ties in with the .ever· increasing demand for oil and petroleum that products. There is no doubt that, when an environmental disaster occurs, the effects of that disaster are profound, par· in an area such as the seabed OJ the sea lanes off the Australian c?ast. The effects run right thro.ugh, affect-ng other industries and damagmg. the envIron1?ent most significantly. I belH-ve the enVlfonmental effects of explorahon and production need to be addressed more completely than apparently h.as been the case fr<?m the explanation- gIven so far by the MI-­ ister and from those aspects covered I? the legislation. The rush to debate thIS legislation has meant that members have not had sufficient time to explore fully that aspect of it. There i.s no doubt that with increasing population pressures, increasing complexity of trade and the increasing complexity of the environmental issues generally this area of all legislation needs the very closest attention. The planet really is shrinking in a most dramatic way in the sense of the interrelated effects which occur when environmental disasters of one sort or another take place. There is the potential for very real difficulties associated with the exploration and development of any oil fields off the north-west coast of Australia. As I say, I think it is an area where the Minister should provide further information. Unfortunately, as I have said, there has not been the time available for members really to analyse what is covered by the legislation in making certain, or as certain as it is possible to make, that the environmental effects are properly addressed. This is an important piece of legislation. Firstly, it has profound international and foreign relation effects which I think will be in the best interests of Australia and its continuing developing relationships with Indonesia. I hope that that aspect of the legislation will be fully taken advantage of and that people who are operating in the joint teams from both countries will realise the importance of not only their performance in bringing these arrangements to fruition, but also the ongoing effects of that cooperation. Secondly, it is of profound importance in terms of Australia's potential self-suffici-ncy in petroleum resources. Thirdly, I thmk there are environmental matters which require very close attention to ensure that fragile environments, particularly sea and coastal environments around Australia, are not put unnecessarily at risk.",28
30,Mr CAMPBELL,NOES,"Kalgoorlie) (-1. 56)I think the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) today demonstrates why the stirring and heartfelt remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) will go unheeded, and I refer to the remarks the honourable member made this morning. The honourable member for Warringah was carping; he was trying to disguise his carping as reasonable comment. The truth is that there has been ample time for comment on the legislation, which is certainly not being rushed through. It is an important piece of legislation and I think that he should recognise that. The honourable member for Bennelong said this morning that he hoped to see improved behavi'out in this House. Sadly, I doubt that this will occur. We in this House do not set social mores or standards; we are a microcosm of the whole of Australia. While we in this House exist in a conflict situation this will always occur, but we should bear in mind that it occurs virtually only at Question Time or during matters of public importance. The rest of the time, like this morning, is deadly dull and boring. This is an historic document and it is very important. I think that the original treaty setting out the boundaries, which the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Corinolly) took great pride in, was, if not unconscionable, certainly very much in Australia's favour. I can understand Indonesia's reluctance to continue that trend. I think that this document will lead to improyed relationships between Australia and Indonesia, and this is very useful to both countries. I do not think that we should dwell on the past. Timor is now a fait accompli and it is true to say that at the time this was occurring we did not do much to prevent it. It is now too late. A general improvement in the economy will improve the lot of the people of Timor. They can only benefit from improved relations between Australia and Indonesia. With these improved relations I am sure that we will have the opportunity to put some technology into Timor. I believe that one enormous potential advance that could be made for the people of Timor is some subsistence goldmining, and in this area Australia probably has the world's greatest pool of expertise. It is hard to people in there at the moment. Several years ago I tried to interest the Indonesians in this and they were frankly suspicious. With an improvement in relations I think that this could occur and we could see rapid developments in the improvement of standards of the Timorese. I think that one always has to look at the future and future dangers to Australia. It is no good hiding the fact that Indonesia is a potential threat. I do not think that Indonesia is a threat in its present form, but it is conceivable that this could change. I think that failure of the Indonesian economic system could precipitate a situation of instability, and that would always be threatening to Australia. I also see a danger in the largest Muslim country in the world being taken over by fundamentalists. Fundamentalist Islam is a very dangerous phenomenon. I think that at the moment the Indonesian Government is doing a great job in containing it. I am hoping that, with enlightenment in education, the power of the fundamentalists will wane. We see this in Australia already. We have impacted this on ourselves. I am very concerned about the growth of fundamentalist Islam in Australia. We have allowed ourselves to import this, principally, I suspect, from Lebanon, and we have a situation where hate is being preached in the mosques of Australia against Australia by some of these people. It is a trend which I regard with great concern. ' It should be remembered that Muslims, Jews and Christians all worship the same god. It is a god in which I personally have no faith, but it is disconcerting when we see the distortions that can be put into society by these fanatical elements. Believe me, I have spoken in this place against the danger of Christian fanatics. I simply think that the Islamic fanatics are more dangerous. We have seen instances of this. A very thoughtful paper on the Dead Sea Scrolls was recently released in Australia by an eminent theologian who, I thought, made a very good case. It really undermined some of the strongly held tenets of Christianity, but we have not seen mass riots on the streets; whereas get with the book of Salman Rushdie we saw an enormous reaction from Muslims. I must say that I think it is to the shame of governments in Australia and Britain that we did not take a strong enough stand against an attack on an integral part of our culture-the idea of free speech. I think that this joint management is a new idea; it is a new initiative in foreign affairs. I do not think that the history of this is particularly old. As is so often the case, I also believe that credit will not be given where it is due, and I will try to address that matter this morning. I refer to the efforts of a Mr Brian Conway, a businessman from Perth, who came to see me, from recollection, in about 1985. At that time he had extensive business interests in Indonesia in association with the Parry organisation. He had floated this idea of a joint venture with Indonesians to overcome the impasse that then existed. I think it was in early 1986 that I brought Mr Conway to see the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. He set out this idea, which he had discussed at a very high level in Indonesia, and found that there was clear support for it. It is from this meeting with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs that I think this idea has developed and come to fruition. It is often the case that contributions made to Australia by businessmen go unrecognised. It must be recognised that Australia owes a great debt to the great bulk of businessmen who are working very hard to try to create something for Australia, and what they do is often overshadowed by the antics of the high fliers, the corporate scoundrels, who get too much press publicity. I also want to address a remark to the British MPs and some of the others in Europe who are taking up the plight of Timor. I think that this is very much a case of distance lending enchantment. It is very easy for people in their situation to wax eloquent and be eloquent about Petroleum Bill these situations. We. sc;e the sa.me thinAustralia wit- Abongmal a-alfs. AbongInal affairs pohcy has been dnven for years by affluent, urban middle-class guilt, by that rather silly idea of the noble savage, when the real issues and - eeds o- the Aboriginal people of AustralIa are neIther listened to nor properly addressed. There have been some platitudes and claptrap heard in this place this morning about fuel shortages. We have heard honourable members talk in reverent tones about megalitres of fuel and declining production. There is no threat to Australia's energy in my view. There is a lack of vision and a lack of guts. There is more than abundant natural gas in Australia and it can be found at an almost exponential rate to replace the great bulk of our liquid fuel needs. Natural gas can do that. The technology is presently available and it would only require government legislation to ensure that this trend was accelerated. I also believe that we will see very large reserves of both gas and liquid fuel in the North West Shelf of Australia. It is beginning to look like a very good area for exploration and it is meeting with some success. I believe that it has the potential of the Timor Basin. I believe that we can look forward to the future with some confidence. It will not happen without some changes in policy but the potential is there for it to happen. In the longer term these things are finite but by the time that occurs we will be well into other technologies-either the hydrogen technology or a much greater use of electricity. I have mentioned in this place before the importance of the mineral neodymium, from which super magnets are made which allow us to make electric motors which are much more efficient. If we are ever able to overcome the ignorance of so many of our self-styled environmentalists we can get on with processing mineral sands and rare earths from which this element is extracted. The north-west coast of Australia offers enor!llOus potential for hydrocarbon productIon. This illustrates the importance to Australia of a two-ocean defence policy. 9 May 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 105 i?- We must defend ourselves in both oceans from every possible contingency. For this reason it is important that we have naval elements stationed in Western Australia and it is very important that these are supported. It saddens me that as a government we are now being faced with a lot of pressure-I do not think dishonest pressure would be too strong a wordfrom the Navy to keep submarine refits in New South Wales, at Cockatoo Island. It is an absurd notion. The base should be removed to Western Australian where it will certainly be needed in the future. This brings me to the requirement for governments to have guts. There will be a cost when we have a change of policy and when we set out to implement a policy-a studied and correct policybrought in over six or seven years. There is going to be a cost of implementation. It is not going to be anything like as high as the Navy says but it is a bullet that must be bitten and a cost that must be paid. This legislation highlights the need for that added naval presence on the west side of Australia. I certainly hope that the Government does not bow to pressure from the Navy and those many people in the Navy who would like to maintain their pleasant lifestyles on the east coast.",30
31,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,in reply-I might just take these issues in the rather eclectic way they were put by the various contributors during the course of this debate. The first issue that in the context of earlier debates in this chamber I ought to go to is the issue of parliamentary accountability. I simply put on record that in response to the request from the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) I am quite happy to ensure that the annual report of the joint authority is tabled each year for the information of honourable senators and honourable members. I think that would ensure that his request in the context of parliamentary accountability is satisfied. Mr Chaney-Are you giving an undertaking that that will be done?,32
32,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,"I rephrase that in a stronger sense. Rather than adopt the amendment that was floated earlier, it is my pleasure to accede and confirm that that will take place. I will dispose of a couple of the smaller issues now. The Leader of the National Party also indicated some concerns about the need for small companies to change their legal structures to operate in area A of the treaty area. I simply say that that is a matter for them and their advisers. I suppose it goes without saying that were we not discussing an initiative as important as this in this chamber today there would be no reason to contemplate any sort of corporate set-up. The old adage that 50 per cent of something is better than 100 per cent of nothing is probably relevant in this context. The issue of damages flowing from environmental damage was also raised. I will come back to the environment in a moment. I should place on record that the penalty provisions in sections 8 and 9 of the Act do not apply to damage to the marine environment. They relate to inspections and exploration within the relevant areas without authority. Environmen tal damage is dealt with in articles 19 and 28 of the treaty. In practice, civil damages claims suffered by Australians will be raised under the Northern Territory legal jurisdiction. Subject to what I will canv-ss in a moment in terms of environmental protections, the Government has the ultimate sanction in that it may ensure that those who cause the environmental pollution will not be allowed to continue to operate in certain circumstances. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made suggestions in relation to the provision for the joint authority to market petroleum. I should point out that the provision which allows the joint authority, with ministerial council approval, to market petroleum, is essentially a safeguard which ensures the full value of petroleum produced is realised. The joint authority would only market petroleum if it is assured that a better price than that which can be achieved by companies is achieved by the joint authority. These provisions do not prevent companies from operating in the normal commercial manner, selling petroleum via a long term contractor or on the spot market as circumstances arise. In my viev. that is quite apparent from the legislation and supporting documentation. In the context of the overall interna· tional framework I think it is worth reo sponding in some detail, given that that was a theme traversed by many honour· able members in their contributions this morning. The Portuguese and British Labor Party responses were adverted to, albeit briefly. Portugal claims to remain the administering power for East TimOI and accordingly has protested against Australia's signing of the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty which Portugal claims to be in breach of international law. Australia rejects that claim that the treaty is illegal. Australia recognises Indonesia's sover· eignty over East Timor, a policy adopted by the then Government in 1979 and af· firmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 22 August 1985. Recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor does not-I stress those words-imply approval in any way, shape or form of the circumstances of Indonesian acquisition of the territory. The Prime Minister's confirmation in 1985 acknowledged that this permits pursuit of both human rights and aid issues in East Timor. Senator Gareth Evans has made a number of statements in another place on Portuguese criticism of the treaty. Australia supports the United Nation's efforts to have the East Timor issue resolved between Indonesia and Portugal. The TimOI Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty is a separate issue from the Portuguese-Indonesian dispute. The treaty could only have been negotiated and entered into with Indonesia. The honourable member for Bradfield also raised the issue of this matter being a provisional or temporary agreement and explicit in his submission was that that may have some adverse commercial implications. The treaty is for a 40-yeaI period with the potential for 20-year extensions. That will provide, by definition, aIllple time to expl?re and exploit the designated area, that IS, area A. The treat.y is provisional only to the extent that It takes the place of a single seabed boundary: The honourable mem-er. for Bradfield will be aware that negotIatIons over an extended period to establish that boundary have not been successful. This is, in fact, a creative and timely response to ensure that the. benefits that can flow from exploitation of area A can· be shared by both countries. Should a single seabed boundary be agreed to during the term of the treaty, provision is in fact made in article 34 of the treaty to protect individual company interests. Taking all of those things into account, there ought not to be, and there is in fact no evidence of, any concerns being expressed in the commercial context put by the honourable member for Bradfield. Compensation for existing area A permit holders was raised. I will briefly go to that issue. The permits extending into area A are to be terminated only because this is an essential step in the implementation of this important international treaty. No special benefit is, in fact, gained by the Commonwealth. The Government does not propose to compensate the permit holders unless the termination of permits within area A is found to be an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution, as I adverted to in my second reading speech. An exploration permit is a right to explore granted by government to search for petroleum owned by the Crown, that is, owned by the Australian people. Legal advice to the Government is that the termination of an exploration permit in these circumstances is not, indeed, 'an acquisition of property'. In the context of the environmental issues that were raised earlier, I think it is w-rth making a couple of very important pomts. The first one is that under the regime agreed to there is a comprehensive range of sub agreements or shared agreements that go to ensl,lring that the environme-t is protected. Before going to those ISsues, I should point out that the comments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) in terms of other approaches to ensuring that Australia has a sufficient energy supply in the immediate and long term future are I believe, as he does, very important. They go to, for example, issues of energy efficiency and, of course, the continued search for alternative means of energy. Both of those, I might flag, are matters of great interest to me personally and to the Government. I intend to ensure that in my time as Minister for Resources they are dealt with as a priority. In terms of the overall issues of the environment in so far as they impact upon this particular project, I should go to article 37 of the Petroleum Mining Code, which provides for the joint authority to make regulations relating to, for example, the prevention of the escape of petroleum; , cleaning up the effects of the escape of petroleum, or oil spills in more ordinary parlance; and the removal of structures and equipment from the contract area, which is probably one of the most significant adverse environmental issues consequent upon exploration of this nature. Indeed, in recent weeks the Prime Minister has made certain announcements. Relating to other domestic platforms and the taxation treatment of the removal of those platforms. The carrying out of operations in a safe and environmentally sound manner will be the responsibility of the joint authority, as will the preparation of environmental impact assessments of petroleum operations- The regulations are based on those operating under the Australian Petroleum Submerged Lands Act. They are currently being drafted for adoption by the joint authority and, of course, they have wider domestic application and experience relating to them. In addition, in the event of pollution occurring the joint authority, in conjunction with authorities in Australia and Indonesia, will put into place arrangements to clean up oil spills. These arrangements will include coordination with the national oil spills plan operated by the petroleum industry in Australia. Companies operating in area A will be required to take out strict liability insurance to cover possible environmental damage. Companies will also be required to remove all property from their production sharing contract areas at the direction of the joint authority and on termination of the contract, as I had previously adverted to. I think that adequately canvasses the issues, as I recall them, raised by honourable members. Should I not have adequately responded to any issues raised in the time. I was out of the chamber I will review the speeches made and respond as soon as possible to individual matters raised by honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",33
33,Mr CHANEY,NOES,"I wish vides, to follow up and seek a little information from the Minister for Resources (Mr the Griffiths) during the committee stage on the matters which he, in part, addressed in response to issues which were raised the second reading debate, namely, some of the environmental issues which were raised. I would remind the Minister of the comments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) about the potentially very large environmental efcontract area. fects of any disaster in this area. Indeed, the Minister drew the attention of the House to some of the provisions in the treaty and the annexures which go to vironmental concerns. To explain the matter on which I seek further clarificator tion, I would like to refer to some of those provisions. We have, of course, in the treaty itself specific provisions relating to the protecparagraph tion of the marine environment. In article 18 it is provided that the contracting states shall cooperate to prevent and minimise the pollution of the marine environment and regulations may be issued. Indeed, the regulations were referred to by the Minister in his closing remarks. In article 19 it is provided that contractors shall liable for damage for expenses incurred as a result of pollution of the marine environment in accordance with contraccontractor's tual arrangements with the joint authorgraph ity. Later in the schedule-in Annex B, which is the Petroleum Mining Code for area A-one finds provisions in article,24 relating to the responsibility of the contract operator, with the requirement beil11g stated that the contract operator shall take the necessary action to protect the,environment in and about the contract ,an:a. In article 25 it is provided for insurance on a strict liability basis to cover the expenses associated with the prevention and clean up of the escape of petroleum. All of those, I think, are exactly 'What one would expect and hope to find in' this document, and I have no concern about that. However, I would ask the Minister to address two points. The first relates to article 28 of the Petroleum Mining Code, which provides for exemption from or variation of conditions and which protherefore, an escape clause for contractors in certain circumstances. I draw Minister's attention to the first paragraph of Article 28, which, provides that the joint authority may agree to exempt in the contractor from complying with the conditions of the contract. I remind the Minister that article 24 is the provision which says that the contract operator shall take the necessary action to protect the environment and so on in and about the My concern, and I simply seek clarification from the Minister, is about the extent to which the joint authority simply enhas the capacity to provide without any limitation for an exemption to a contracfrom complying with those conditions of the contract which relate to environmental protection. Again I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in 2 of article 28 there is a specific series of limitations placed on the joint authority with respect to the power of the authority or the right of the authority to exempt the contractor from the conditions of contract without the prior approval of the ministerial council; so that, in fact, the joint authority has a limited be power of exemption with respect to certain matters-for example, in, subparagraph (a), the joint authority's or the production shares and, para(b), the operating cost recovery provisions. I interpolate that I have not had this legislation for very long. It was introduced yesterday, although I had some prior notice of it from the Government. Jtdoes not appear to me on a quick reading: that 'the operating cost recovery provisions' necessarily covers all the environmental conditions. There does appear to be virtually an unlimited capacity on the part of the joint authority, without reference to the ministerial council, to exempt contractors· from those portions of the contract which relate to environmental protection. That is the first point on which I would seek clarification from the Minister. The second point flows from the area that the Minister addressed in concluding the second ·reading debate when he referred to article 37 of the Petroleum Mining Code and the regulations and directions which can be issued, which cover matters such as the carrying on of petroleum operations in a safe and environmentally sound manner and the cleaning up and remedying of the effects of the escape of petroleum. Again because I have had limited time to consider this matter, I would seek clarification from the Minister on how those regulations are actually enforced apart from within the contractl1al framework under which people will be operating. We are referring here, as I understand it, to exploration activity in area A, which is the area jointly administered by Indonesia and Australia under these arrangements. It is not clear to me whether this is a system of regulation which enables an injured party or, indeed, the Commonwealth or any other body to take action and what the enforcement proceedings are with respect to those regulations. I would appreciate some further guidance from the Minister on that point also. I do not, in putting these matters forward, suggest to the Minister that I would be seeking to move amendments to the Bi!l with respect to the matters that I have raised even if the answers that he gives ar- n-t totally satisfactory. I make that pomt m a quite non-contentious way because I .think there would be common ground around the chamber and between the Government and the Opposition that all of us would want to see effective measures for the protection of the environment. Most of us would agree with the point made by the honourable member for Warringah that there is a potential for enormous damage if there are accidents or if there is negligence in this area. Of course, the matters. we are talking about are not matters which admit to statutory amendment; they are matters which have been hammered out in an agreement between the Indonesian and Australian governments and they are therefore matters which could only be addressed by further discussions and negotiations between those governments. I do ask the Minister, in the interests of our being quite sure that a government which claims to be seeking to establish what I think is the strongest environmental regulation in the world or the most rigorous, to say whether there are in these very detailed arrangements between Australia and Indonesia that are addressed in this legislation satisfactory answers on those two points which I have raised.",35
34,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,"First and foremost, let me say that we are dealing here with an extraordinarily complex piece of legislation that encompasses intern ationallaw, domestic and Indonesian contractual law and so on. I will, in fact, respond to both issues but in a very real sense take them on notice to ensure that the detail of these answers is correct. The first point that I would make is that the joint authority is ultimately responsible to the ministerial council. The provision in article 28, I think it was, that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) referred to is not an uncommon arrangement in terms of contractual arrangements. My understanding of that provision is that it would allow changed behaviour in terms of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources; but in terms of offering, if you like, an escape clause for environmental damage, I could not imagine that it would be used in that context, although clearly any particular circumstance relating to either the exploration for or the exploitation of petroleum in that area is very much subject to the ministerial council decision making process. I could not imagine the circumstances that would arise whereby that problem would present itself. I will, however, ensure that I take detailed advice on that possible interpretation; but my very strong feeling is that that will not prove to be a problem. As I understood the honourable member's questions relating to article 37 and the standing of Australian citizens or companiesMr Chaney-What are the procedures for seeking retribution?",36
35,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,"My understanding-again, the legal procedures that relate to this particular and, I might stress, unique arrangement are complex-is that for certain aspects, as I indicated earlier, there would be provision under Northern Territory legislation and for other aspects-for example, for Indonesian people taking action-it would come under the relevant jurisdiction. To the extent that a treaty relationship would impact upon the legal procedures that should be adopted, I would have to take advice on that. I might suggest in passing that I suspect that there would be very few people qualified to answer that question off the top of the head. In essence, the Northern Territory has jurisdiction in terms of Australian citizens. Otherwise, as is normal in Australian courts interpreting contract and other law, presumably the High Court, the Federal Court or whatever court would review the circumstances in which, for example, contracts were entered into, where companies were registered and so on. I think the honourable member would get potentially a range of different answers to his question, depending on the precise circumstances; but I will read in detail his question and ensure that we have a definitive response made available.",37
36,Mr CHANEY,NOES,"1 thank the Minister for his response and, indeed, for the care he has taken to respond to the various issues which have been raised in the debate. I rise for the purpose of making quite clear what I would like some later advice on. I make the request that the advice be provided before this Bill is dealt with in the Senate so that, to the extent there are continuing concerns, those matters could be given some further parliamentary consideration. I would be grateful for that. I note the Minister indicates his assent by nodding; so I will read that into the record and thank him for that also. The point I wanted to make, just to clarify it, is that the Minister in his response to my first point-I think riot unnaturally-said that he could not imagine it would be used to escape the responsibility for environmental controls. I suppose that most environmentalists would say that lots of government Ministers and lots of businessmen in the past could not have imagined it but in fact it happened. I am sure he would agree that there is a counsel of prudence in this. The thing I would ask him to do in his later response, not necessarily today but in the response that he has indicated that he will give us, is simply to confirm whether pr not article 28 could be used-not whether it is likely to be used, but whether it could be usedto provide for. an easy exemption from contr-ctual obligations. That is very relevant to the second point, which he has already responded to in a preliminary way in this committee debate. I draw the Minister's attention to article 48, which is the only provision that I have been able to find in the code which gives any clue as to how the regulations will be enforced. Article 48 is under the heading 'Penal Provisions'. Normally that suggests one can go off to a court and prosecute someone; but that is not, apparently, what the words mean in this code because all that article 48 really refers to is to the termination of contracts and to possible contractual remedies. That tends to underline my concerns about the potential loophole which is provided in article 28, because it is possible that article 48-1 do not make this as an assertion; I make it as a query on which I would like later advice from the Minister-is simply confirming that really the authority is reduced to essentially contractual remedies or perhaps the possibility of some ci.vil suit in Australia or ,Indonesia if there IS damage. These might seem minor matters, but I think most honourable members would be aware' of the - 1 billion plu.s d-ma-es claims involved III the substantial 011 spIlls by the Exxon' Valdez off the Alaskan coast. We are talking about matters which are potentially very large in terms of cost to the community and, of pourse, cost to the enviroriment. I do acknowledge the ready way in which the Minister hers responded and said that he would provide further informatIon. I tqtally agree with him that this IS a very complex, set of documents. That is why I have raised these matters as queries rather than as assertions, because I think it would be possible for any member of this place to have a quick reading of these. documents and miss something very important. I may have missed something significant, as the Minister may have in his reply to me so far. It does appear to me that the scheme of things is that fundamentally we are relying upon contractual arrangements and upon the penalties which we can impose on people by refusing them subsequent access to this resource. That is fine. That is a very substantial commercial penalty and a major oil exploration company might well feel, therefore, that it has no choice but to meet every requirement which is put down in accordance with this treaty and the accompanying documents or put at risk future operations. But not all work is done by major companies. It rnay well be a situation in which very substantial costs could be incurred by Australia and very substantial damage done to the environment. I am certainly not satisfied at this stage that the treaty is watertight in that respect. The final comment I would make is that if on a careful consideration of these matters the Government believes that th-re are some potential inadequacies in thiS area, I think the suitable response would be for those matters to be add-essed in the ongoing dealings that there Will, be between Australia and Indonesia because I very much doubt that the present Government of Australia or the present Government of Indonesia would in any sense wish to leave any loopholes. It may be that it is very difficult in this international area to achieve the sorts of definite outcomes that one can when one is dealing with a matter within domestic law. I do not make these comments in any way critically of the overall achievement of this treaty. I think that when the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) led on behalf of the Opposition he made it clear that we regard this as a very significant achievement. I would not want my concerns or the concerns that I have expressed on behalf of the Opposition about the specific environmental aspects to suggest that we are in any way unhappy about what I think was a very important development in Australian and Indonesian relations.",37
37,Mr CONNOLLY,NOES,"Bradfield) (12.39)If I may take the time of the committee for a few minutes to refer to a matter which I did raise in the second, reading debate, that is, the question of the model production sharing contract and the authority vested in the joint authority not only to determine the value of petroleum but also to be able to market petroleum where the joint authority can receive a better price than the contractors. I raised a query which I had hoped the Minister would refer to in his closing remarks, but perhaps he omitted to do so, regarding the question of how that affects spot sales as distinct from contractual obligations. I think it is a very important question. The oil industry is a multifaceted one, but if one half of the parties to the agreementthat is, the Indonesian half-has a government monopoly over fuel supply, how would that affect the domestic or foreign market?",38
38,Mr GRIFFITHS,NOES,"1 thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). The honourable member for Bradfield raised the philosophical problems that may arise given that Pertamina is a government owned monopoly and we have a range of very large, I might say, private companies in Australia. I suppose that has exercised the minds of many. I suspect we will just have to wait and see. Clearly, both govapply. ernments have moved this far down the track and implicit in where we are at is that that ought not to be any substantive ongoing problem. I did in fact advert to the spot price issue, but the honourable member may curred have been out of the chamber. Let me simply repeat for his benefit that the properhaps vision which allows the joint authority with ministerial council approval to martinue ket petroleum is essentially a safeguard ensure that the full value of the petroleum produced is in fact realised. The Joint Authority would market petroleum only other if it were assured of a better price than that which can be achieved by companies. These provisions do not prevent compahonourable nies from operating in the normal commercial manner, selling petroleum by a long term contract or on the spot market as circumstances arise. I might say that were I negotiating on behalf of an explosoon ration company this would be a threshold consideration. Clearly, there is a lot interest. I do not believe that the issues that the honourable member for Bradfield adverted to are in any way, shape or form going to provide a disincentive. The old principle of caveat emptor applies. I pose that in the final analysis it is going to be a matter for the judgment of the participants. I would be very surprised indeed if that were to result in any disincentive. Going to the matters that the honourable member for Pearce raised, he properly repeated the essence of my comments earlier that the applicable law stated in the production sharing contracts; that is, it is essentially contract law that we are relating to here. In addition, however, there are a number of other that I should perhaps raise. As to criminal law, citizens and permanent residents of Australia and Indonesia are subject to their respective laws for acts done in area A. Northern Territory criminal law will apply to unlawful acts done by Australians in area A. Nationals of a third status are subject to the criminal law of both Australia and Indonesia, with provision for consultation to be determined on a case by case basis as to which law is to Of course, we have ensured. that there are no double jeopardy problems there. As I indicated earlier, as. provided in article 28 the Northern Territory law will apply to actions brought by· Australians who have suffered damage or inexpense as a result of activities in area A. In other cases Australian courtsI did not put it as articulately as I have now found it written-will conto exe""rcise jurisdiction and apply to relevant laws consistent with private international law rules which take into· account where contracts were executed and criteria. In fact, I think I suggested in essence just that. I conclude on this note: I will have a very close look at the member's questions because in particular in one earlier instance I was engaged in conversation for a part of the time. I undertake to give a response as as I can and before the matters are in the Senate. It may be that because of of the complexity the response cannot be definitive, but I might just make the observation in passing that there is a lot of law that goes through this place that one cannot be definitive about until it gets to supour courts.

42,Mr LANGMORE,WOOL EXPORTS,My question is dithe rected to the Minister for Trade Negotiaseriously tions. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that Australian compathe nies exporting commodities to the Soviet Union are not being paid? What is the Government doing to overcome any such difficulties?,40
43,Dr BLEWETT,WOOL EXPORTS,"I thank the honourexporters able member for his question. Yes, the Government is aware of delays in payof ments to Australian wool exporters, and the Soviet authorities have approached Australian suppliers for extended terms trade. The total exposure at this stage appears to be $198.7m. One hundred and thirty-four million dollars of that is wool already shipped to the Soviet Union but not yet paid for, $45.7m relates to wool which has been ordered but not shipped and $19m is for other tracts which have been entered into. I have to say that not all the money is due yet-probably half of that sum is due at this time. We have no information on deferred payments on any other Australian goods at this time, although a number of European countries have had problems in this area. Let me stress that we are talking about delays in payments, not defaults in Soviet payments to Australian wool supAll who have been involved in this trade have told me that the Soviet Union has always, to date, been a major and very reliable participant in this trade. It appears that the delays may have been result of problems associated with the one reorganisation of the Soviet Union's foreign trade system. Many of those changes are ones which we all applaud, and recognise that there might be some difficulties this transition stage. The wool industry disrepresentatives have expressed to the all Government confidence that the outstanding payments for Australian wool will made shortly, and have advised us that they do not consider the Soviet wool trading organisation-Novo Export-to be a credit risk. They have also stressed the need for the current situation to be dealt O'Conwith in an atmosphere of calm. Contrary to some statements by the shadow Minister for trade negotiations, Government does take this matter and is working closely with the wool industry to resolve it. I also make point that he raised in his statement to the media that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has provided payment insurance to Australian wool suppliers, and I have to point out that most of wool to the Soviet Union have not made use of that facility because the very reliable trading partner the Soviet Union has been. Yesterday there was a constructive meeting between govof ernment officers and wool industry representatives and the current situation of the Soviet payment arrears was discussed in for depth and a range of options explored. The Government has been making regular representations at very senior levels and at working levels to the Soviet Governwool conrnent and Novo Export. Our embassy in Moscow is continuing to pursue the matter at the highest level, emphasising to relevant Soviet authorities the concern of the Australian Government and the wool industry about the effects of these delays on Australian exporters. The Soviet Union has long been a major and very reliable trading partner for Australia, with bilateral trade at approxieign mately $1 billion. It has traditionally joyed an excellent reputation for promptly meeting its contractual obligations. Both the Government and the wool industry are working together to resolve what we hope will be short term difficulties. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: NA",40
44,Dr HEWSON,BOUGAINVILLE,Will the Prime Minisby· ter inform the House whether the AustraPapua lian Government was consulted or advised by the Papua New Guinea Government prior to PNG's recent imposition of ecohave nomic sanctions against the island of Bougainville? Will Australian military equipment be used in enforcing the blockhave ade? Does the Australian Government lieve that the blockade is an appropriate move at this time and that it will assist negotiated end to the Bougainville disthe pute?,41
45,Mr HAWKE,BOUGAINVILLE,"I thank the honourable that gentleman for his question. There have been ongoing discussions over a considit. erable period of time between represenbeen tatives of my Government and the sovereign independent Government of Papua New Guinea as to the problems created for Papua New Guinea by the Bougainville crisis. I have no doubt that at certain stages during those discussions the possibility of some form of blockade obviously would have been talked about. As far as I know there was no specific prior statement by the representatives of the Papua New Guinea Government to our representatives before this actual cision. That is my understanding, but will check that and confirm it for the honourable gentleman. As to the use of Australian equipment, what happened in the Bougainville crisis was that there was the use of Australian helicopters but they had been disposed of by Australia to Papua New Guinea and became its property. The only condition that we, properly, imposed in those circumstances was that no Australian' def- . ence personnel would be used in 'the operation of those helicopters. But on-e you have made a decision as a government to dispose of equipment to a soverindependent nation, then what that ennation does with that equipment that it has acquired from you is its business. Let me make the point, which I think, would have been clear to the honourable gentleman from what I have said to this point, that when we are talking about Papua New Guinea we must be careful not to slip into the assumption which all too often, I believe, underlies comments some people in this country about New Guinea. They do not accept that Papua New Guinea is a sovereign independent nation. It is as though we some particular sovereign rights over that nation. There is a condescending attitude in some quarters, as though we still some semi-colonial relationship with bePapua New Guinea. That is not the case. We have attempted at all times to cona duct our relations with that country on basis of recognising, firstly, that it is sovereign and independent and, secondly, as a result of our historical relationship we have certain obligations towards I believe that is an attitude which has bipartisan in its nature. We will continue at all times to consult with our friends in Papua New Guinea to do anything that we properly can within the context of that relationship to which I referred to assist them in trying to bring to a peaceful end a problem which presents for the Government of Papua New Guinea very significant economic and social problems. Whether they make the decision to impose sanctions, that is their decision. They are not a second-class denation. If they make the decision to imI pose sanctions, that is their decision.",41
46,Dr HEWSON,BOUGAINVILLE,And sanctions.,41
47,Mr HAWKE,BOUGAINVILLE,"Yes. If they make the decision to impose sanctions, that is a right they have to impose. We have no right to say, 'Papua New Guin-a, you are a second class country. We will tell you what you do ?r do not do'. We - ill have discussions wIth Papua New Gumea and, indeed when I go up to Papua New Guinei at the end of this month, all these issues including the decisions Papua New GUlri-a has taken, will be a matter appropriately for discussion between us.

NA",41
48,Mr LEE,NATURAL DISASTERS,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In view of the unusual number of natural disasters and accidents which have taken place along the east coast of Australia, can the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government's responses to this series of tragic even-s?",42
49,Mr HAWKE,NATURAL DISASTERS,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. As all honourable members would be aware, there have been a number of major tragedies affecting the people of Australia and all levels of Australian government since this House last met. I know that I am· speaking for all honourable members-both sides of the House-when I take this opportunity to express to the people directly involved in these shocking events the greatest sympathy for the tragedies which have befallen them and also the greatest respect that we have for the courage which has been shown by all of them in their respective very considerable difficulties. They have shown great courage in the face of adversity. Since this House last met, Newcastle suffered major earthquake damage on 28 December; south-west Queensland and many areas of the central west of New South Wales suffered serious flooding in the. last weeks of April; the Gippsland reglOn of Victoria also suffered flooding an-, as we all .know, there has been a senes of boating, road and rail accid.ent--most recently the tragic rail colliSion In New South Wales which cost lives and many injuries. Those accidents have left many Australian families grieving. I know that I am speaking for all members of the House when I express these sentiments, but these sentiments, as heartfelt as they all are on behalf of every member of this House, are only short term comfort to those who have suffered and still suffer from these calamities. The Commonwealth Government has made special efforts to deal with the costs in a financial sense. In the case of both Newcastle and the floods, we have provided $250,000 to the public appeals and substantially very much more than that in terms of tax deductability for these appeals. For example, the Commonwealth will effectively fund about $21f2m to $3m in contributions to the Newcastle appeal. For Newcastle, special provisions under the natural disaster relief arrangements include guaranteed dollar for dollar reimbursement to New South Wales of expenditure on short term emergency relief; repair of public assets; carry-on finance for business at concessional interest rates; and repair of homes for the underinsured. Some $5m has already been spent but the total bill will probably be some 10 times that level. Premier Greiner and I expect to receive very shortly a report on the full extent of the likely bill for damage in Newcastle and the process for reconstruction. The timetable was agreed between us last January and is being met. I have heard of problems associated with expenditure from the Lord Mayor.'s appeal and will be writing to the Lord Mayor shortly about the need to see this money put to good use as soon as possible. The flood victims of Nyngan, Charleville and other centres will also receive substantial Commonwealth assistance. In Queensland, the State Government's efforts will be reimbursed by the Commonwealth at the rate of $3 for every dollar of State money because Queensland has passed through a number of threshold levels of expenditure under the disaster relief arrangements. The Army and the Air Force have also made magnificent and, may I say, too often unrecognised contributions. In Newcastle, flood victims will be eligible for hardship relief funds, repair of public assets and carry-on finance for business at rates jointly determined and jointly funded by Premier Greiner's Government and the Commonwealth. Special legislation, which I hope will receive swift passage through this House and the Senate, is being introduced this afternoon to authorise the special double initial payment of unemployment benefits to victims of disasters. I do not detail these actions of financial assistance that the Commonwealth has taken to seek any special plaudits. These are things which properly should be done under the arrangements which have been in place since 1978. They are reviewed regularly. "" I certainly believe that were the Opposition in government it would do the same thing. I am just indicating that these were the things properly to have been done. Again, I am sure that I speak for all members of the House when I repeat the very, very sincere sympathy that we feel for those who have lost loved ones and our respect for the courage they have shown in the face of adversity.",42
50,Dr HEWSON,NATURAL DISASTERS,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like on behalf of this side of the House to join the Prime Minister in expressing sympathy to all those who have been so adversely affected by these disasters, be they floods, earthI ! I quakes in Newcastle, or the recent horrific road and rail accidents. I also endorse his I comments about the tremendous courage that people have shown in these circumstances. The way the people of Nyngan attempted to withstand the push of the waters was a good example of that sort of courage. I would also like to thank all those who have helped, those who have gone in there at considerable personal risk and have sought to help people in difficult circumstances, whether in the earthquakes or in the floods. What concerns me is that the worse is still to come in some of the flood areas. Flood waters take time to reach their peak. It will be a continuing problem which we will have to monitor. A number of people on this side of the House have followed, the situation <;:losely. They are very concerned that whatassi-t­ ance the Government can given ,is given. We will continue to monitor that situation as best we can. The point of thPrime Minister's statement is to express sympathy, to acknowledge courage and to offer thanks. We endorse that 100 per cent. NA NA",43
51,Mr TIM FISCHER,VICTIMS,"I support' the comments of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I direct my question without notice to the Treasurer. In view of the Treasurer's commitment to providing tax relief for flood victimsand acknowledging the general information just provided by the Prime Mini-­ ter-will he confirm that this includes late lodgement of downward variations for provisional tax in light of the changed outlook for farmers and businesses, large and small, in the regions affected? Will he extend the promised relief to allow rebates on tax already paid by those affected? Can he outline the basis of valuing livestock and fodder donations for the calculation of tax deductions?",43
52,Mr KEATING,VICTIMS,"I can only add to what the Prime Minister said, which is that the Commonwealth is bearing a substantial part of the burden for relief and reconstruction in some of the areas most devastated, particularly by floods. That is outside the area of the accidents referred to in the question. This varies from State to State under the natural disast,er relief arrangements. As the Prime Minister said, the Commonwealth will be carrying about $ 3 for every $1 spent in Queensland. If New South Wales crosses a certain threshold, which is apparently quite close, Commonwealth funding will increase on the basis of $2 for every $1. The Commonwealth also made commitments in terms of extending tax deductability for relief appeals as well as providing an initial contribution to those appeals when they began. ' In relation to the more specific parts of the question dealing with the righ,ts of taxpayers to vary the uplift in relation to provisional tax, I can only say that in the past the Commissioner of Taxation has exercised great common sense, judgment al1d compassion in the administration of the tax system whenever these things have occurred. I am sure that he will do so again to the extent that his administrative discretion is permitted under the law. I will certainly raise the import of the question with him. As honourable members know, in terms of primary industry there are substantial averaging provisions and the losses which may be incurred in anyone particular year can be carried forward and income is averaged over a time. How particular farmers respond in terms of their income and their tax liabilities under those provisions, I am not certain. But I will alert the Commissioner to the import of the question. Mr LIoyd-1 refer the Treasurer to the position of those people who have paid provisional tax ahead of what has occurred and the consideration that should be given to their circumstances-",43
53,Mr SPEAKER,VICTIMS,Order!,44
54,Mr KEATING,VICTIMS,I have picked that up in the question. I will refer the question and my answer to the Commissioner and ask him to look sympathetically at the tax treatment of these people. SOUTH-EAST TRAWL FISHERY,44
55,Mr SNOW,VICTIMS,I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What recent decisions have been made about the long term management of the south-east trawl fishery?,44
56,Mr KERIN,VICTIMS,"I thank the honourable member for this question and the close interest he shows in this major fishery which is Australia's major finfish trawl fishery and the one of greatest interest to all Australians because it is in the highly populated south-east area of the country. The Government has been engaged at official level in consultation with the industry and four State governments for a number of years. Basically the problem is overcapitalisation and too many boats chasing too few fish. Following discussions with the four State Ministers involved and further discussions with· the South East Trawl Management Advisory Committee, I announced on 23 April that over the next two of three years a quota management regime will be introduced into this fishery, replacing the previous arrangements. It will take a fair time to hold the necessary discussions with all interested parties about the details of how individual transferable quotas will be applied. But the important thing is that we have foreshadowed a new approach and we hope that the fishery thereby will operate on a long term sustainable basis. . The changes, the honourable member will be pleased to know, have received broad support from the industry, whose members understand the need for certainty. The move to individual transferable quotas· for seven major species is also consistent with the fisheries policy paper that I released in December last year. There will be individual fishers who are concerned about how the total catch of the species will be set and the basis on which individual quotas will be allocated. I can assure them that none of these detailed decisions has yet been made. I have asked the Australian Fisheries Service to take on board the views of all interested parties. As I said, it is a very complex mixed fishery. Decisions about its long term management have never been easy. The· industry itself has found it very difficult to reach agreement. But the four Ministers and I believe that we had to take a step and I am very confident that with the cooperation of industry and the State governments involved we can return it to a sound basis, both economically and biologically. NA NA  General to reports that he has asked the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs to explain public comments about a Thai drug bust, which comments forced a Sydney District Court judge to abort the trial. What is the Minister's explanation for such irresponsible comments and what further action is being taken?",44
57,Mr DUFFY,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"As honourable members may be aware-obviously the honourable member for Kooyong is-the judge in this case has again remanded the accused in custody to face trial. While I shall try be as informative as possible in my answer, I have been advised by my Depart- . ment and also by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that for this reason there are limits to the detail whi?h it is proper for me to provide. I wish to acknowledge straight away that the matter to which the honourable member has referred has been of serious concern to me and to the Prime Minister. I accept that the remarks made by the Minister for Justice to the media were most unfortunate in respect of both the presumption of guilt on the part of the person arrested in Thailand and their causing the judge in Sydney to abort the trial. I made this very clear to the Minister as has the Prime Minister. The Minister accepts the error he has made and the significance of that error. I have looked closely into the circumstances surrounding Senator Tate's remarks, including through detailed discussion with the Prime Minister and with Senator Tate himself. Following those discussions, I have written to the Prime Minister setting out my conclusions and, in order as fully as possible to inform the honourable member about the matter, I take this opportunity to table my letter to the Prime Minister and his reply to me; Having tabled these letters, I shall not take the time of the House to go into detail. But there are some key points which I should mention. The first one is that in making the remarks which he did, Senator Tate was unaware that the trial was under way in Australia. The Director of Public Prosecutions accepts that Senator Tate had no knowledge of any trial prior to his remarks to the media. Indeed, it was the Director of Public Prosecutions who was the first to inform Senator Tate that a trial was under way several hours after the press conference when theythat is, the Director of Public Prbsecutions and Senator Tate-met on a flight to Melbourne. Obviously, Senator Tate had no intention of expressing opinions which would lead to the aborting of the trial. What gave rise to this state of affairs was serito ous shortcomings in communications to Senator Tate. There were various conversations in vol ving the office of the Director· of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police and Senator Tate's office and conversation between the latter and Senator Tate. But at no stage was Senator Tate himself informed before he spoke to the media of the crucial fact to which I have referred, namely, that a trial was under way. I consider it essential that we rectify these shortcomings so that no such situation arises in the future. I have directed that a system be set in place foIthwith to ensure that the Minister and others are informed on a monthly basis of significant trials which are continuing or about to ' commence. As I said earlier, the judge in the trial has indicated that he has remanded all three of the accused in custody to face trial again when the publicity has died down. Our aim is now to restore the circumstances in which the trial may proceed. This matter has been thoroughly investigated and my view has been made clear to the Minister and to the Prime Minister. NA",45
58,Mr KERR,TOURISM,"My question is to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. Is tourism still the significant industry for Australia that it has been in recent years? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The honourable member is asking for an opinion from. the Minister. I would ask you to consider that aspect before allowing the Minister to proceed.",45
59,Mr SPEAKER,TOURISM,"No, he could be asking him for a statement of fact.",45
60,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for Denison for his continuing interest in tourism in Australia. Tourism is significant in its contribution to the overall economy. In 1988-89 the industry contributed around 5.6 per cent to gross domesticproduct. I do not need to tell those honourable members who are involved in the tourist industry in their own electorates about the significance of jobs within the industry-over 442,000 jobs, or. nearly 6 per cent of the work force, with some 18,000 jobs being generated in 1988-89. The other interesting point is that tourism is a significant contributor in respect of the current account with $6.1 billion of foreign exchange earnings being added to the economy as a result of this industry. Domestic tourism has also been sustained. In 1988-89 Australians took some 46 million domestic trips of at least one night's duration, spent 214 million nights away from home and, importantly, spent over $16 billion on domestic travel.",45

As at 31 December last $19.4 billion was firmly committed to tourism infrastructure. We will all be aware that 1989 was a fairly difficult year for the industry and in that respect we should be encouraged by some of the figures that we have seen already come out from the Bureau of Tourism Research. Those figures indicate that for January 1990 the level of international tourism was up by 4 per cent with some very significant growth from some of the Asian nations. Overall, the contribution from Asia represented a 72 per cent increase in figures for January 1990 over those for January 1989. In summary, tourism is still a very significant contributor to our economy. The tourism recovery package, both at the domestic level as well as the international package, will ensure that the 2.2 million tourists whom we expect to come into - ustralia this current year will come. More Importantly, the tremendous growth that we will see over the course of this decade will ensure that by the turn of this decade the figure for international tourists to Australia will approach some 6 millionplus.

63,Mr REITH,CONSUMPTION TAX,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I ask the Minister to what extent the present wholesale sales tax system represents a tax on exports. Furthermore, what is the current status of the review of a broad-based consumption tax (BBCT) within the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce?",46

71,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"As a matter of fact I addressed some of these issues in my National Press Club address, which I commend for the honourable member's reading. Mr Smith interjecting Mr .SPEAKER-I warn the honourable member for Bass.",46
72,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"-'-He is reading it now? I am sure that, as he does, he will be squirming a bit. The fact is that a very large part of the collections of the wholesale sales tax system represents a tax on business inputs. A large part of that-a great preponderance of that-is in the service sector of the economy. There is some tax on business inputs which one could argue is a tax on exports. That has been a cost which in the past has been borne by the exporters, but a relatively modest one in relation to the business inputs which are carried in the wholesale sales tax system. I remind the House that back in 1985, when the Government was looking at a broad-based consumption tax it was being argued then by everybody that all business inputs should be taxed-that everything should be taxed, without exemptions, at a flat rate. But now the debate has shifted as the debate on the consumption tax has shifted. Now people are urging support for it on the basis of its capacity to reduce tax on savings and to reduce a so-called tax on exports. The ground continues to shift. I can only say in relation to that that the Opposition will have to do some thinking about it itself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked about a review of the broad-based consumption tax. We are not reviewing the matter. We are reaffirming our publiciy stated position in the election campaign. That is why today the statement was made outside Parliament. It was simI! I ply a confirmation by the Government of an existing public policy position. honourable member opposite who has changed his policy position by putting a BBCT under review. But he did not wait to announce that in Parliament; he did it at a doorstop. In terms of that first very weighty question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a little less duplicity would not go astray in terms of what the prerogatives are in terms of who should, address Parliament and on which subjects. REPUBLIC OF KOREA: NA NA",46
73,Mr HULLS,ON BEEF,"My question is directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations. Can the Minister inform honourable members whether an ad hoc referendum understanding on beef has been negotiated with the Republic of Korea and whether or not the dispute that Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America have had with Korea for some time has ended?",47
74,Dr BLEWETT,ON BEEF,"I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the importance of the issue to his own electorate. I am very pleased to report that an understanding has been negotiated, thus effectively settling the dispute. The Australian and Korean officials reached in Seoul on 25 April an ad referendum record of understanding on beef access arrangements into Korea. The arrangement represents a satisfactory outcome for Australian bilateral consultaHons initiated with Korea in 1988. The major points of the agreement are that it reaffirms Korea's General Agreement on Tariffs,and Trade undertaking to liberalise beef by 1997, sets down a minimum global access level for Korea over the next three years of 58,000 tonnes for 1990, 62,000 tonnes in 1991, and 66,000 tonnes in 1992, establishes a new simultaneous buying and selling system which represents the first step towards a more market oriented beef import system for Korea, sets out the agreement on a number of important technical matters and calls for bilateral consultations on the post1992 import arrangements to be issued It is the no later than 1 July 1992. I confess that the access levels are perhaps less than we would have liked, but they are minimum guaranteed levels. The actual imports in any year may exceed these levels and I am quite confident that imports this year will be above that minimum level. The Australian beef industry representatives have expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the negotiations and the arrangements are expected to lead substantially to increased exports of Australian beef to Korea. Australia's exports of beef to Korea in 1989 were valued at around $A150m and on present indication exports in 1990 are likely to increase significantly. NA",47
75,Dr HEWSON,ALLEGED RECESSION,"I refer the Prime Minister to the conflicting statements from his Government on recession. These ranged from Senator Walsh who said that the Government engineered one, to the Minister for Finance who said that we are technically in one, to the Treasurer whc said that one did not exist. Will the Prime Minister settle the dispute among hiMinisters and tell us whether we are or are not currently in a recession?",47
76,Mr HAWKE,ALLEGED RECESSION,"If I could charitably offer some advice to the honourable gentlem-n, I would have thought that he would have his time more than fully taken up with settling the disputes that he has on his own side on fundamental matters of economic policy, including the question of a consumption tax. He should just get his own act into order and leave us to run the country. Let me address the substance of the honourable gentleman's question about whether there is a recession or not. The simple fact is that demand growth in Australia, as I think any rational observer would understand, has been unsustainably high during the last financial year. The . figures are quite simple and incontrovertible. The gross national expenditure in that period grew by about 8 per cent, which was more than twice the rate of gross domestic product. That ratio is simply unsustainable. It led to two unacceptable results: unacceptable pressure on the external accounts and unacceptable inflationary pressures. Let me say that recent indicators suggest that demand is slowing, but I believe that those same indicators show that the slowdown in economic activity is modest and it is precisely in line with what the policy had been calculated to achieve. A very important part of this situation, and one which very significantly distinguishes the present time from 1982-83, is the success of the accord in preventing a wages blow-out which, in turn, has helped to prevent a collapse in employment in this country. That situation starkly contrasts with the position in 1982-83 when there was a massive wages blow-out and then the economy went into the worse recession that it had experienced in 50 years. The simple fact is that the accord achieved unprecedented real wage moderation in the face of a booming economy, something that had never before been achieved in the economic management of this country.",48
77,Dr HEWSON,ALLEGED RECESSION,What is the answer?,48
78,Mr HAWKE,ALLEGED RECESSION,"The honourable member should just wait and he will get his answer. He is getting it now, if he would only understand it. The strength of the labour market is consistent with indicators of production in the March quarter. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition, patiently, will understand what this means. Those production indicators show that overall production remained relatively strong, with some industries still running at near full capacity. Private dwelling approvals in the March quarter indicate continuing confidence in the housing sector. In that area the Housing Industry Association notes that the March Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for approvals imply private housing starts of just under 100,000, which is an historically strong level of activity . The level of investment, although falling, remains very high by historical standards. We have seen a 3.1 pcr cent growth in employment in the last three months. If we see these production figures, the private dwelling approval figures and the level of investment, my answer is no, we are not in a recession, much as those opposite would like to see one. NA",48
79,Mr HARRY WOODS,ORGANIC FARMING,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the Minister inform the House about the Government's attitude to organic agricultural produce and what action the Government has taken to encourage its production and export?,48
80,Mr KERIN,ORGANIC FARMING,"I thank the honourable member for his maiden question. As the honourable member is well aware, there is a growing demand, both within Australia and overseas, for organic agricultural produce and there is, therefore, a significant commercial opportunity for producers willing and able to service this niche market. At present there are three organic farming organisations established on a national basis-the Biological Farmers of Australia, the Biodynamic Agricultural Association and the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia. The Government recognises all three of these groups, but obviously it would be a good idea if they got together, particularly with respect to definitions organic produce. In February of this year I invited resentatives of all three to participate in a meeting in Canberra to discuss the future direction of the organic farming industry. Happily, this resulted in the formation of the Organic Produce Advisory Committee, which has agreed to develop national standards and certification procedures for organic produce. The Organic Produce Committee will also advise me and the Government on other matters related to this growing area of Australia's agriculture, some of which is represented in the honourable member's electorate of Page. Long may he stay there. NA NA  rected to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the letter of today's date from the Attorney-General to himself and his response of today's date to the Attorney-General. Bearing in mind that I have had Very little time to go through these, as the Attorney-General answered a question only a short time ago, I do note in passing that the Australian Federal Police did claim that they notified the Minister's office that a trial was under way and that the Government appears to be accepting the advice of Senator Tate's staffer rather than the advice of the police. Irrespective of that, given that the Prime Minister in his letter to the Attorney-General has expressed regret that the Minister for Justice 'presumed the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand and also caused the judge to conclude that he must abort the trial', does he accept that this behaviour falls below the standards required of a Minister, ticularly a Minister charged with the administration of justice in our country?",48
81,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I welcome the further question from the honourable member for Kooyong. It is really in two parts. I will go to them sequentially. The honourable member is wrong in the first assumption that he makes. Let me make it quite clear that at no point is there an assertion by anyone, including the Australian Federal of Police, that they informed the Minister about the existence of a trial. It is true rep- that they say they told the staff.",49
82,Mr NA BROWN,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"His office! Mr MCGauran-It is not his fault, is it? Where does the buck stop?",49
83,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"It has not taken long for those opposite to resort to the hollow laugh. It did them no good in the last seven years. It will do them no good in the next three years. They need to do better than their silly hollow laughter. The simple fact is that there is nothing on the record, and there is no assertion from the police, that they informed the Minister. It is the case, as the Attorney General has made quite clear to the House and in his correspondence to me, that they spoke to the Minister's staff and they believe that they told the Minister's staffer that there was a trial. It is not the recollection of the Minister's staff that the police referred to the trial. In this circumstance I accept without question as, may I say, perhaps more importantly in this case, does the Director of Public Prosecutions, that the Minister for Justice did not know and that, indeed, the Director of Public Prosecutions was the person to inform the Minister. If those opposite are wanting to question the Attorney-General or me they are also questioning the Director of Public Prosecutions because he is saying that, in his judgment, the Minister first knew of this when he, the Director of Public Prosecutions, saw him on the plane. That is a fact. The second part of the honourable gentleman's question relates to the judgment of the Minister in saying what he said. I identify completely with my friend par- and colleague the Attorney-General. Frankly, we are appalled at the lapse of judgment.",49
84,Mr NA BROWN,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Well, sack him.",49
85,Mr HAWKE,CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Mr Speaker, w- hear the statement, 'Well, sack. him'. If it was a question of sacking people because of appalling lapses of judgment, you would be bereft of shadow Ministers because there is hardly one on the other side of the House who has not fallen into that category. I have made it quite clear previously in this case that simply because there is an error of judgment by a Minister is not necessarily a cause for sacking. I have spent a considerable amount of time in the last couple of days on a very careful examination of this matter with the Attorney-General and, indeed, with Senator Tate himself. If I had been faced with the situation in which the Minister for Justice did not accept that he had made an error of judgment that would be another matter. But he quite straightforwardly accepts that there was a significant error of judgment and, indeed, that conclusion is unavoidable. Having said that, and having taken into account as I have, as has the Attorney General, the excellent record of the Minister for Justice in taking a leading role in securing cooperation between our relevant police forces and those overseas in combating the monstrous drug trade-and he has, indeed, played an excellent role in that respect-on balance I have come to the conclusion that it would not be appropriate to seek the Minister's resignation. I have thought seriously about the issue because I attach such weight to this. I think he did make a very bad error of judgment. I have taken into account the record of the Minister-which, I think, is an excellent record-and the fact that there is no doubt at all that he did not know, when he made the statement, that a trial was on. Taking all those things into account, as far as I am concerned, that is where the matter will rest. I hope that is where it will rest generally because I would have thought the major concern of everyone now should be that the circumstances be allowed to emerge which will facilitate, as soon as possible, the bringing to trial in Australia of those concerned.

87,Mr JULL,RIGHTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications.

I ask the Minister to inform the House of any talks which have been held, and any commitments which may have been made, between the Government and the Ansett TNT Ltd group regarding the commencement of this operation.",50
88,Mr BEAZLEY,RIGHTS,"The Government will have consideration, in its multifaceted and extensive micro-economic reform program, of the issue of extending international freight rights to more than one carrier. Qantas has those rights exclusively now, except for some charter operations. We consider it an important matter of reform and we will be looking at it seriously. I am not aware of any particular discussions that have been had between the Department and any of the operators or potential operations as far as international freight is concerned. It is quite possible that it has had discussions with numbers of them. If it has had discussions with numbers of them, I am quite sure that it has had discussions with Ansett or TNT in that regard, given its prominence in aviation freight both domestically and internationally. But I am not aware of any undertakings that have been given anyone in this regard. The matter will be properly looked at by the Government and an announcement made when the time is appropriate.

SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ANZAC DAY. Ministerial Statement",50
90,Mr HAWKE,ABORIGINAL DEATHS IN CUSTODY,"by leave-I move: That this House, mindful that the people of Australia are the inheritors and custodians of the ANZAC tradition: (1) recalls that(a) from the deeds and sacrifices of the ANZACs at Gallipoli there emerged a powerful sense of an Australian national identity; (b) the spirit of ANZAC was sustained and Report strengthened by more than 300,000 Australians who served overseas during World War I; (c) despite the military failure of the Gallipoli campaign the ANZACs forged an unsurpassed reputation for bravery, endurance, resourcefulness, irrepressible humour under pressure :md, above all, loyalty to one another; and (d) the experiences shared at Gallipoli helped forge the basis of a continuing close relationship with New Zealand; (2) recognises that(a) the commemoration of ANZAC provides a continuing source of inspiration for all Australians; (b) the example. of the ANZACs has been emulated many times, in war and in peace, by individuals and communities coping with natural disasters, tragedies of all kinds and, indeed, the challenges of everyday life; (c) the overwhelming response in the community to the commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli expresses a spirit of national commitment central to the continuing relevance of ANZAC; and (d) the sacrifices-first at Gallipoli and then in all other theatres of war in which Australians have served in two world wars, Korea, Malaya and Vietnam-emphasise the tragedy and futility of war and the need to rededicate ourselves to the cause of world peace; (3) noting the unprecedented nature of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary of ANZAC Day by veterans; war widows and junior Legatees, expresses its deep gratitude to all those involved in the success of that pilgrimage, including the departmental officials and all others responsible for the planning and organisation, the personnel of the Australian Defence Force, the Returned Servicemen's League of Australia, Qantas and, in particular, the carers who played such a large part in ensuring the health and well-being of the veterans during the pilgrimage and their safe return home to Australia; and (4) also expresses its deep gratitude to the Government and people of Turkey for their recognition of the importance of ANZAC to Australians and for their generous assistance to the 75th anniversary commemoration and pilgrimage. I know that the House will welcome the opportunity afforded by this motion to place on record our thanks to all those who were involved in initiating, planning, organising and carrying through so successfully the memorable pilgrimage to Gallipoli on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1990, the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Australian landing at ANZAC Cove. Mr Speaker, I shall always count it as one of the very great privileges of my public life that I was able to take part in this commemoration. I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other members of Parliament present at Gallipoli last month share that feeling with me. In an enterprise so complex, so difficult, so unprecedented as the pilgrimage, it would be impossible adequately to single out individuals for praise. Indeed so much of the work done and the service rendered by officials, members of the armed forces, volunteers and the carers is literally beyond praise. I know that the House, and I believe the nation, would wish me to pay special tribute to that magnificent group of original ANZACs who returned to honour their mates on Gallipoli. In 1915 these men and the thousands of their fellow Australians they represented made a profound impact on the imagination of the Australian people and upon their sense of nationhood. Seventy-five years on they have made, I believe, no less an impact on a new generation of Australians. The most remarkable thing of all is that they have achieved that by showing exactly the same qualities which created the ANZAC tradition so long ago-the way they bore themselves; they way they seemed to shrug off the weight of years; their sense of independence. I might say that the carers travelling with them very quickly found that these were men who would not be mollycoddled. Their determination to see it through, the old, sharp irreverent wit, their sense of mateship-in a word, their sheer Australianness-was as evident in the pilgrimage as it had been 75 years ago. It was their presence, their conduct, their demeanour and their qualities which expressed more eloquently than anything else the true meaning of the ANZAC tradition and the true purpose of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli. It was from their ranks which came the spontaneous response to my words at Lone Pine. When I said that we had not come to Gallipoli to glorify war, from them came a heartfelt, 'Hear, hear!'. I am confident that the pilgrimage to Gallipoli has demonstrated to a whole new generation of Australians that the ANZAC tradition and its commemoration, far from being a glorification of the· waste of war or celebration of militarism, represents a statement of values and ideals of service of enduring re-evance to .the p-ople. of Australia. That IS why I belIeve It IS 'that we should place - hi- resolution recognition and appreCiatIOn on the ords of this Parliament. I commend motion to the House.",52
91,Dr HEWSON,ABORIGINAL DEATHS IN CUSTODY,"The Opposition supports this joint motion of the Parliahundreds ment honouring the Australians who fought at G-llipoli, in the sa.me biparti.san spirit in WhICh I accompamed the Pnme Minister (Mr Hawke) two weeks ago on that pilgrimage to those battlefields. zac Day' is an occasion on which all tralians, politics aside, are drawn closer together as we remember the courage the sacrifices of Australian service men that time. and women at Gallipoli and of course in all the wars in which Australians have fought since then. It is a testament to the strength of ANZAC spirit that its capacity to stir hearts of Australians seems undiminished 75 years on. Personally, I was deeply oured to represent the Opposition at commemoration services at Gallipoli. was for me and for my wife one of the acter. most intensely moving and significant experiences of our lives and is one that will cherish in our memories forever. body could have gone there and walked on those battlefields and stood in those cemeteries without being extremely deeply moved. I am sure that the emotion pride in being Australian that we felt that day was shared by my colleagues the parliamentary delegation to Galliat poli-the Leader of the National Party Australia, Mr Tim Fischer; the honourreared able member for Bradfield, Mr David Connolly; and Senator David Hamer. ANZAC Day 1990 was rich in powerful impressions. Still vivid in my mind, as the dawn broke over ANZAC Cove, is sight of those forbidding cliffs and gullies which original ANZACs stormed with such bravery. It seemed to me impossible for - en armed with ritles, many of them just kIds, coming ashore in rowboats in the half light of dawn, to advance up those deadly hills. Yet, as we know, they did and, in doing fittmg so and in holding on for those eight of terrible months, they created a modern reclegen:d on the shores of the Aegean from the which so many ancient legends have grown. Later that day at Lone Pine, at Shrapnel Gully and at Quinn's Post, my lasting memory is of the rows of simple white headstones bearing the name of of Australians in their twenties and even in the teens whose lives were cut short by bullet, bomb and bayonet. What a tragic loss for such a young nation. Indeed, I have a 16-year-old son. I Anfind it incomprehensible to imagine givAusing him a rifle and sending him into those sorts of circumstances. One can imagine and the pressure on children of that age at In giving up their lives in what was in the end a costly and pointless military failure, the young Australians in those the graves and the lucky ones who came back the proved to themselves, to their countrymen and to the world those special qualhonities of courage, endurance, good humour, the mateship and respect for their foe that It are now idealised in the Australian charOnly those who fought at Gallipoli can we know what it was really like. The rest of Nous can only see their faces, hear their stories and imagine. It was also a great privilege for me to meet' and to talk to all of the veterans who made the long jourand ney back. Among them was Jack Hazlitt, on , aged 92, from my electorate. Mr Hazlitt on is typical of the ANZACs. He came from a farm, put his age up to enlist, and fought Gallipoli and later in France. After the of war he came home, settled down and a family. Like the old mates he travelled back to Gallipoli with, Jack Hazlitt is a living symbol of all that is good in the Australian character. Another powerful impression from that the day was the large number of young Australians who had made the pilgrimage to Gallipoli to honour their forefathers and, it seemed, to search for what it means to be Australian. I am told that this pilgrimage of Australian youth to the now quiet and peaceful hills of Gallipoli happens' in ' greater numbers every year. One of the most moving ceremonies I can recall was at Lone Pine. To see the faces of thousands of young Australians standing there watching veterans laying wreaths at the memorial-in particular the veterans who had carried wreaths from Australia-and to hear them sing the national anthem or a song to the tune of Waltzing Matilda was a very moving experience. It is particularly a tragedy that the rest of Australia did not share in that. ever. I gather that it was not picked up by television coverage. A lot of the mood of that day seems to have been missed back here. If the sacrifices of the ANZACs can be justified, it surely must be in the knowledge that 75 years later their deeds and their unique qualities are still an inspirafrightening tion to today's generation of Australians. I was impressed by the skill and devotion shown by the carers assigned to look after the veterans. Getting by on only three or four hours sleep a night, the ers scarcely left the sides of the old soldiers in their charge. It is a mark of the professional ability and the personal commitment of the carers that a group of men in their 90s could be drawn from all over Australia, travel halfway round the world to visit old battlefields and return home suffering no worse than a sprained ankle. I noticed that a close personal bond developed between the veterans and their carers. Hopefully this bond will be maintained now that the veterans are safely back home. I also record our praise for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and the officers of his Department, some of whom are in the chamber, for a superb feat of organisation. Months of detailed planning resulted in a complex exercise in logistics being carried off without a major mishap. Much credit is due to the Minister and his Department as well as to all the other organisations involved in making the Gallipoli pilgrimage a success, most notably the defence forces. I also mention the cooperation, hospitality and goodwill extended by our Turkish hosts-once enemies, now friends, and bearing no resentment or rancour about the past. The sacrifices of the ANZACs would have been in vain were we not to draw lessons from their experience. Seventy-five years ago Australia was a young and innocent nation living happily in the days of empire and content with the uncomplicated sense of loyalties. Gallipoli and World War I generally changed such a world and such an Australia forAustralia in the 1990s is a very different nation in a very different world: our population is more culturally diverse; our ambitions are more complex; our national interests are· not as narrowly defined as the world in which we live is more competitive, more interdependent and more in its capacity for conflict. Despite such dramatic changes over the past 75 years, however, the lessons of our past remain more relevant than ever. I know that the seventy-fifth annivercar- sary of the Gallipoli landings prompted some Australian commentators to call for a more appropriate and relevant source of national inspiration in the 1990s and failure in battle early this century. These were not mindless or ill-considered reflections but they were, I believe, fundamentally mistaken. Our potential as a nation and as a people will be realised only if we know our strengths and weaknesses and if we establish clear national purposes for ourselves and pursue them coherently. The story of Gallipoli is not the only source of inspiration in that task, but it should always be an indispensable part of it. Gallipoli will always be testimony to the power of courage and mateship in the face of overwhelming odds. Gallipoli will always teach us the importance of retaining control over our own destiny and of pursuing our international interests in both war and peace on the basis of our own clear view of what is in Australia's national interest. Gallipoli will always remind us that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and that our national capabilities should always reflect that fact. Above all, Gallipoli will always epitomise the horror and futility of war and the responsibility we all have to build a world in which people are both free and at peace. These are the lessons from our past that we ignore at our peril. and tha-, if proper-y understood, can contmue to mspIre us m the brave new world that is now emerging. We are proud to join the Government in supporting the motion before the House.",54
92,Mr HUMPHREYS,ABORIGINAL DEATHS IN CUSTODY,"It gives me much pleasure to speak in support of the motion. I endorse all that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said about the significance and impact of ANZAC Day on the Gallipoli Peninsula this year. It is not my in-ent-on to a-tempt - n analysis of the Galhpoh campaIgn or Its relevance to our national character. Nor do I wish to add to what the previous speakers and other commentators have said about the emotions generated by the events of that extraordinary day. I frankly acknowledge that I do not have the skills to put into words all that that day meant to me, both as Minister for Veterans' Affairs and as a fiercely and unashamedly proud Australian. I do know that I will never experience another day like it. Indeed, having travelled the full distance with those Gallipoli and World War I veterans, I will never know another 10 such days. I can say that by observing and getting close to those men I have broadened my understanding of my own character and what it means to be an Australian. Rather than go over that ground, I should like to focus on that part of the motion which reads that the Parliament 'expresses its deep gratitude to all those involved in the success of the pilgrimage'. It give me much pleasure to acknowledge the presence in the Speaker's gallery today of some of the people to Whom we owe a deep debt of gratitude. There are a great many to be thanked and congratulated. Certainly there are too many to give the personal recognition deserved. While I will single out a few groups and a few individuals, I want everyone connected with this project, however remotely, to know that every contribution is greatly acknowledged. Bill Hall, Patron of the First World War Veterans Association of New South Wales, set the ball rolling when, in 1988, he asked my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) whether a Hercules could be made available to take a party of Gallipoli veterans back to ANZAC Cove for the seventyfifth anniversary of the landing in 1990. Although uncertain of what the response would be, Bill thought it worth a go. In his own words, 'No hide, no Christmas box'. From that point things took off, and Bill Hall was there every step of the way. He was still at the veterans' sides when the plane-not a Hercules, thank goodness, but a Qantas 747-finally landed safely in Sydney on 30 April last after its historic lO-day flight. It was largely because of Bill's experience in travelling with First War veterans, and his confidence in their ability to make such a long trip, that we took on this challenge. No amount of thanks is adequate, Bill. The Hercules became a 707, and the 707 a 747 because from the time of that first optimistic approach to the time of departure on 20 April this year the project had grown enormously, swept along by an overwhelming response from the remaining First World War veterans and the wider Australian community, and developing interest from other countries. As the scope of the visit increased, so too did the recognition of the administrative complexity. A steering committee under the chairmanship of Mr Ed Attridge and a task force headed by Mr John Quinn, both officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, were established. These groups worked tirelessly up to and, in the case of some individuals, for the duration of, the visit. The steering committee and task force attempted to anticipate and respond to every conceivable issue and problemfrom hotel layouts to luggage tags; from transport requirements to the necessity of comfort stops. That anticipation was made even more difficult because of the uncertainties applying to what would be available and what the competition for it would be like, in what is a fairly remote and rural part of Turkey. Of course, not everything went according to script and more than once we were forced to adopt 'Plan B'. But with good humour and good will we managed well. To all of those involved in that administrative planning process, I say thank you for a job extremely well done. The Turkish Government and authorities also played a maJor part in plarining for and ensuring the success of our visit. I took the opportunity to call on the Governor of Canakkale on 26 April to thank him for his help with arrangements on the peninsula. He was full of enthusiasm and already looking ahead to 1991! From an early point it was obvious that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) would need to be heavily involved and I pay the highest tribute to the way its members went about the tasks assigned to them. Honourable members may have seen television footage of the naval vessels lying off ANZAC Cove, the honour guards, or the catafalque party at Lone Pine. They may also have heard the stirring playing of the composite army band. But they may not be aware of the work co-ordinated by Wing Commander Mayhew in planning the flights; of the constant care afforded our veterans by the aeromedical team looking after them on the flights; of the work done in Turkey in the months before ANZAC Day firstly by Lieutenant-Colonel Brown and then a larger defence advance party; of the generous assistance provided by the Navy in accommodating strays, transporting supplies, ferrying people and materials, and the like. And they will not have seen the bond formed between the defence escorts and the individual veterans and war widows to whom they had been assigned. In the process of helping our elderly VIP's on and off buses and taking them into unfamiliar territory, of physically lifting off an Instanbul cruise ship, of sharing reminiscences on the 26 April tour of the battlefields, and of stretchering our oldest veteran to Shrapnel Gully, those young servicemen and women did a great job and earned the love and sincere gratitude of the veterans. They also, in the process, had their own lives greatly endched. To Colonel Bishop, Commander of the ADF commitment on Gallipoli on 25 April Defence Central Command, and' to all thservicemen and women involved, congratulations on a task very well performed. The Returned Services League (RSL) deserves a special vote of thanks for its promotion and support of the endeavour. For many years, without the fanfare which accompanied this historic visit, the RSL has conducted ceremonies at the Peninsula, and we benefited greatly from the League's experience. It contributed greatly to making the dawn service such a memorable occasion. The other ex-service organisations were also enthusiastic supporters of the pilgrimage and I should like to thank especially the War ,Widows Guild of Australia and Legacy for the part they played in select,ing the war widows and junior legatees who made the trip. Those selected were fine representatives. ' There surely has never been a flight like Qantas QF 1915/1916 which took us to and from Istanbul. We all could check the Guinness Book of Records, but I will take odds that we will not find another flight of this distance carrying four passengers in their seventies, eight in their eighties, 54 in their nineties, and one over 100 years of age! The management of Qantas could not have been more co-operative. As just one example, they provided tickets for an American based Australian Gallipoli veteran and his daughter to enable him to fly to Australia to join the travelling party. My understanding is that crew spots were highly prized, and I was delighted to learn that many finally rostered onto the flight had Vietnam service. The plane was named Spirit of ANZAC and the crew, I think, demonstrated elements of that spirit-stamina, ingenuity, tolerance, flexibility and, above all, humour. It cannot them be easy to work in an aeroplane in which people are milling in the aisles, holdipg impromptu conferences, swapping seats, taking photographs, filing stories and so on. They coped superbly. To Captain Les Haywood, Flight Service Director Siggy Jablonski and all the .crew, thanks for a safe and comfortable t-IP, made even more special by your attentIveness. Thanks, too, to the med-a for your se-­ sitive and positive reportlllg of the pIlgrimage. We were aware that .there was.a high degree of interest back I!l Austraha about our progress and - q,tllck sca-. of the mountains of press chPI?lllgs awaItlllg me on return demons-rates Just.how comprehensively you servIced that lllterest. I give a special pat on the back to the staff of Lady Davidson Hospit';ll-:-the doctors, nurses, caterers and admllllstratots. As honourable members may be aware, the travelling party assembled at the hospital several days before departure and for a couple of days on return. As well, the hospital played host to a large pre-departure breakfast attended by several here today. For being such gracious hosts, and accommodating such a severe disruption, you are to be commended. Finally, I come to the group covered by the term 'carers'. This is the 27-person group chosen to provide medical and other care on the trip, and to whom must go much of the credit for getting our veterans and war widows to Turkey and back. Dr Phil Henschke, geriatrician of Daw Park Repatriation Hospital in Adelaide, headed this team. He was supported by two other repatriation doctors, two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) doctors and 22 nurse carers. Dr Henschke had principal responsibility for determining who was and was not fit to take this trip. He developed the protocols used for selection and stood by them. On this basis he, and perhaps he alone, was supremely confident that we could travel without losses. The work of the nurses 18 of them from repatriation hospitals and four from the RAAF, was co-ordinated by Mrs Diana Trickett of the Lady Davidson Hospital, who quite literally worked herself into the ground. It is simplistic to say that the carers doctored and nursed our party successfUlly over the today visit. Well before we left Australia these men and women visited the veterans and widows in their homes and hostels to get to know them and to form an appreciation of their capabilities-how mobile was each one, how good with stairs, how independent and what special needs they had. At Lady Davidson prior to departure this relationship and the understanding of individual lifestyles was developed. On QF 1915, in Singapore and in Istanbul, on the Gallipoli Peninsula and throughout the return trip this was built upon, and I think the comment made by Mr Attridge on return sums it up: We went away as individuals and came back as a family. The carers slept little, making sure their charges felt sharp and looked sharp for the inquisitive camera- of the world. Chills, colds, aches and pains were jumped upon. Meals were fetched, laundry attended to, money changed and souvenir shopping done. I will say no more. They were simply fantastic. I seek leave of the House to incorporate their names in Hansard. Leave granted.

93,Mr HUMPHREYS,PILGRIMAGE,"I thank the House. Some greater power also smiled on this visit, enabling our party to remain intact. It was a peaceful pilgrimage, undertaken by men and women for whom war and its memories hold no joy or fascination. It rained on the peninsula prior to ANZAC Day, yet on 25 and 26 April it was fine and warm. On 26 April, as the last veteran was put onto a bus after laying the last wreath on the headstone of a former comrade, the rain, symbolically again started to fall. '",59
94,Mr TIM FISCHER,PILGRIMAGE,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.21)_ It is with a great deal of pleasure that I Charge rise to support this motion on behalf of the Parliamentary National Party in conjunction with all the other speakers.· I think that it is a magnificent motion. I support it also as a Vietnam veteran of a more recent conflict. Of the many positive events, let me choose a couple of additional events flowing from the seventy-fifth anniversary pilgrimage. Those travelling with the party of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and participating in various activities learned with great joy the day after ANZAC Day that there had been record turnouts in many towns, cities and suburbs right across Australia for ANZAC Day commemqrations. In places such as Tumbarumba, Tamworth and Townsville-right across Australia-'-notwithstanding variable weather conditions, there were all time . record crowds. For example, the Tumbarumba Times reports that it was the largest ANZAC Day service which had ever seen in that particular town. That is just one of 1,000 examples I could give Manager, Car- on this occasion. I congratulate all those involved: the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Ed Attridge and many others from that Department, and members of the team. I see Ed Attridge and Bill Hall in the Gallery. It is a delight to see them there. I thank the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Returned Services League, Qantas Airways Ltd, the carers, the Turkish Government-indeed everyone who participated in making it a success. I congratulate the ANZACs who participated and the ANZACs alive today who were not able to participate because it was an effort which extended beyond those who were directly participating. The spirit of the occasion embraced everybody in Turkey at Gallipoli and in Australia. Bill Hall c-n rightly report that he safely delivered his team back. I - m su-e that people such as Jack Ryan will contmue to give the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party plenty of . cheek whenever they get the opportunity. That is when he is not kissing the good wife of the Prime Minister on every other occasion. I also congratulate the war widows and the legatees who participated. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it involved all generations. It was a special delight to see the younger ones there, both officially and informally. I will record the names of the legatees who officially participated: Graham and Phillip Bradford, Naomi Byles, Declan Deasey, Samantha Falconer, Michelle Hall, Stephen Haynes and David Taylor. They really embodied the spirit of all the younger people who were at ANZAC in 1990 in Turkey. There is one area of disappointment, and the Leader of the Opposition did touch on it: when I returned to Australia. I was inundated with many comments on problems with the television coverage. Firstly, there were problems with the dawn service. Obviously the light was always going to be difficult, but there were sound transmission problems. Secondly, I understand that the cross was not made for the international service. Finally there were difficulties at the Lone Pine service which meant so much for Australia. It was meant to run for a full 30 minutes associated with the 7.30 Report. I will pursue this in a more proper place by way of a question upon notice to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). I am a great supporter of the role of the Australian - roadcasting Corporation (ABC), especially towards remote Australia. I commend such programs as Ian MCNamara's Australia All Over which managed the Sunday before to make two successful crosses to the area. If it was the fault-I do not say that it was-of elements of the ABC I think there should be an investigation. If there are factors that can be corrected they should be investigated and 9 May 1990 REPRESENTATIVES corrected and those involved properly 133 dealt with. For example, if the network carrying the State of Origin match tonight lost a cross to the State of Origin I bet that if a technician was found responsible for that he would no lon'ger work for that network tomorrow morning. Mr Braithwaite-It would only be out of sympathy for New South Wales as New South Wales is going to lose.",59
95,Mr TIM FISCHER,PILGRIMAGE,"This occasion was far more important than tonight's State of Origin will be. It was a one-off occasion. The Prime Minister correctly said that never again will we see those ANZACs at ANZAC Cove. It was an honour and a privilege to be present. It is in that context that I very happily support the motion before the House. It is not only· on ANZAC Day but also on other days that we are obliged and have a commitment to look after those who served and ex-service men and women, war widows and veterans generally. Therefore, I close in commending this motion to the house with a quotation from former Prime Minister Ben Chifley. In this House in 1946 he said: On this Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done for those who served this country in war.",60
96,Mr BEAZLEY,PILGRIMAGE,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (3.26)I would like very briefly to join in the remarks of the honourable members who have spoken here today and to support the motion. I do not know quite which hat to wear. Having heard the remarks of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) just now I thirik I will wear my Defence representative hat for the remainder of this discussion. The person I have to thank very much for being there is Senator Robert Ray, the current Defence Minister, who very kindly stood aside from the trip in order that I would be able to attend. Something that inspired me throughout the election campaign to even greater efforts was the thought that I might be able to get there, having wanted to do so ever since being accosted by the gentleman in the Public Gallery, I might say ambushed in the best of ANZAC traditions, to make available an aircraft to take the veterans over there and in other ways participate in the celebrations. It was an excellent accident with very considerable consequences. I claim absolutely no credit for the organisation from that point on. The people who deserve that credit have already been mentioned here. As I was representing the Minister for Defence on that occasion I would like to say one thing in particular about the defence forces that participated. Substantial numbers did so. They were made very welcome by their Turkish hosts, who gained an awful lot from it. It was one of the many delightful and interesting features for those hosts to be able to talk to ering. the individual young and not so young Australian soldiers and naval personnel who were associated with the visit. They draw great strength from the traditions of their organisations in what for many is a lifelong commitment to the defence of this country. For those who participated it will refresh and reinforce that sense of commitment, a sense of commitment they do not always draw from watching the nature of public debate on defence issues as it passes from day to day in the life of this country. That thoroughgoing assertion that was directed to them, that the jobs they perform are essential to this nation, was exemplified by the fact that they could see the consequences for their nation of the sacrifices of their predecessors who were actively with them on the day. They were extraordinarily tough people. One of the comments I saw in one of the articles back here says of our understanding of past events that the past is a foreign try. I am not sure I really agree with that particular quotation. It was evident that there were characteristics common to contemporary generations of Australians among those diggers who took the trip. There were also, obviously, characteristics that not. Those diggers are, I think, of a generation tougher, more gnarled and battered by the experiences of life which have enabled them, through some of the most extraordinary stories, to survive to this day. I do not think there can be anyo apart from an individual of that age, w this sort of experience: wounded on one; off to hospital; back into acti wounded again; off to hospital; back the Somme; wounded again; back to h pital; back into action; re-enlisting in 19 retreating down the peninsula of Mala when the Japanese assaulted down t peninsula; prisoner again, working Burma-Thailand railway-and still aliv I do not think many of us of this g eration will be able, if we live to 90, boast such a curriculum vitae in doing The fact of the matter is that there such a person there, and he was unique among those veterans at that ga The services that day were a wonder reassertion of national spirit. All I can to the honourable member for Farrer (Tim Fischer) with regard to the co ments that he made about the ABC that I really do think the problems w largely in international connections. spoke on the day to the ABC technicia who were enormously moved by the j they were doing and were very dedicat to conveying their emotion and their derstanding of the significance of the ev to the Australian people. I am sure, t that in the tape which the ABC is prod ing of all this there will be proper cov age of those events and their incorporati into the historical record. But I will lo at the honourable member's question notice and, hopefully, give him a satisf tory answer. Again I thank Senator Ray for perm ting me to be there. It was a privilege, counthe Leader of the Opposition (Dr He son) said, which will live with all of who participated for all of our lives one of the most worthwhile, decent a interesting things we are ever likely to in public life.",60
97,Mr CONNOLLY,PILGRIMAGE,"Bradfield)· (3.33 As a member of the parliamentary de gation to the seventy-fifth anniversary the landing at ANZAC Cove in Gallipoli am delighted and honoured to have t opportunity to associate myself with t motion moved by the Prime Minister (Hawke) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I think it is fair to say that none of us have felt so proud to be Australians as we did on the 25th of last month, when we participated in the dawn service on tl).e beach at ANZAC waiting for the first grey light of dawn and actually seeing in front of us men who had come ashore at exactly that time 75 years ago. In a sense we went through some form of Orwellian time machine. If one wanted to reorganise it, one could say that if the whole audience of thousands had held little candles in their hands it would have been a more impressive spectacle for the audiences back home. But for those of us who were there, the poignancy of that event will remain with us to the day we die. In a sense I think it is unfortunate that there are still people who question the spirit of ANZAC. They question the right of a relatively young nation such as Australia to have ANZAC Day as a day on which the whole nation comes together. They question whether war should be the basis for. a national event. All I can say to them IS:' 'Go there, look, and you will find. You will find on those hillsides to this day the very essence of what the Australian spirit-not just the ANZAC spirit-ought to be all about'. When we came back and saw, on television, the events at Nyngan, and we saw men and women fighting to keep back the flood - aters, immediately I saw that emotional ltnk and precisely the same spirit that those thousands of young men demonstrated so long ago. '. As .the Prime Minister and others have mentIoned, we found gravestones of young men-as young as 16-who had barely left their mothers. They were probably large. country lads who went before the recrUItment sergeant, put their ages up and hoped for the best. They went on what, . to .them, was the great experience - f a lIfetIme. They wanted to participate In the war to end wars. They did not fail --t the. generations of Versailles, regrettIy, dId. The-efore, for anyone to say !hat remembermg the sacrifices of ANZAC IS a glorification of war in my opinion is to completely misinterpret all the historical event- and circum-tances surrounding that partIcular generatIOn of Australians. Perhaps the. most interesting thing at the dawn serVIce, from my point of view, was to see at my· feet the name of a trooper. As l was writing down his name and details-he lived all of eight days after the first landing-I heard a woman's voice behind me say, 'That man is. writing down the name of my great uncle'. I turned to her, and we met. She is a Queensl-nder and, naturally, I will correspond WIth her in the future. The thing that was so interesting about the people there in their thousands was that .t-ey are still part of the same family tradItIon that had sent their great-uncles and great-grandfathers to Gallipoli 75 years ago. They came from all over the world. They covered every' generation. There were backpackers, legatees and simple tourists who had changed their arrangements to make sure that on that day they would be at ANZAC. It was incredible' as we drove through the road blocks tsee Australian troops in their slouch hats sh-ring point duty with Turkish troops. I mIght add that it was almost equally bizarre to look up at the hillside in the light of dawn, and see, as our ancestors did the next gener<l:tion of Turkish troops, full; armed, watchmg us. As one journalist right.ly pointed out- perhaps they were makmg sure that thIS time, although our s-cond assault was significantly more effiCIent than the first, we were also goipg to return at least as expeditiously as our ancestors. Nevertheless, it left in the minds of all of - s a sense of belonging, and an appreCIatIon. that we had come back to the very fountamhead of Australian nationalism. As I said, that is something we will carry with us for the rest of our days. However, I would ask of the Government one thing which is a matter of some - oncern to me. It is simply this: the TurkI-h nation; to its credit, has made a natIonal park of the entire part of the Gallipoli Peninsula which covers the battlefiel<;ls o- the Great War. Regrettably, there IS eVIdence of the incursions of tourism in the area, especially between ANZAC Cove and Cape Helles. I ask the Prime Minister to consider using the good offices of the Government to approach the Turkish authorities to see whether it is possible for them to lease to Australia in perpetuity the piece of land from ANZAC Cove to the top of the ridge. It may not be possible, but it is a way of assuring future generations that, whatever else may happen, that piece of our tradition-that most valuable piece of our history-will remain intact. 1 do not wish to labour this point, but 1 want to thank the Prime Minister for, at the eleventh hour, incorporating the parliamentary visitors in his party. 1 use the term 'visitors' because by that stage we were no longer an official delegation. These circumstances were unfortunate. It is a matter which I shall raise in this Parliament again at the appropriate time. I simply wish to thank the Prime Minister for supporting us and giving us the opportunity to join him and the Leader of the Opposition in what was undoubtedly one of the great moments in Australian history.",61
98,Mr LES SCOTI,PILGRIMAGE,"1 would like to associate myself with this motion because 1 also had the privilege to be a member of the parliamentary delegation to Gallipoli. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) highlighted a number of points 1 would like to endorse. In particular, I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for ensuring that the visit went smoothly. It was certainly a moving experience for me. Most Australians have had some association through their families with Gallipoli. I had a namesake there. Fortunately he returned but he is not with us now. The day, and the whole trip, were certainly a moving experience for me. Lone Pine, in particular, 1 felt was a real inspiration for all Australians. That was certainly felt on the day. 1 would also like to offer my thanks to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and to all associated with him, whom he covered today. Without his help I am sure that the trip would not have been the success it was. From my point of view it was interesting to see the cooperation we had from the Turkish people and the friendliness they showed to us. It was quite magnificent. It showed that they want to live in peace and harmony with us. The Turkish people were magnificent right throughout the tour. So I associate myself with this motion and thank all those associated with the success of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli. Question resolved in the affirmative.",63

101,Mr HAND,LEGISLATION,"Honourable members will be aware of the far-reaching changes which were introduced in 1989 into the regime governing our migration administration. After the Parliament enacted the Migration Legislation Amendment Act in June 1989, regulations were made on 19 December 1989, as required under that Act. Large sections of the new Act and regulations are now being administered smoothly. The Government, however, has heard a good deal of criticism of the operation of parts of the new system, not ,least from the last Parliament's own committee--'-the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations set up by resolution moved by my predecessor on 31 May 1989. Accordingly, the Government has decided to act on a number of the criticisms and concerns voiced. 1 intend to make some changes to the regulations immediat-ly, and set up a structured process of parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation to examine further necessary changes. 1 should first, however, provide a short overview of the character and direction of the changes to the Migration Act 195-.

Prior to these changes, decision-making under the Act had .Iarge-y been a - atter of administrative dIscretIOn. Accordmgly, there was a la-k. of uni-ormity - n,d consistency in decisIOn-makmg. PolIcIes - nd guidance were scattered across a vanety of departmental handbooks. Instructions were frequently expressed only in broad terms and in some instances, had essentially evol-ed ov-r time without - eing articulated in detaIl anywhere. ThIS meant that individuals, and their representatives, as well as departmental decisionmakers had no coherent body of rules to consult' to implement the Government's policy requirements. The Minister, because decision-making powers were vested in him, and policy was a matter of discretion, was placed in the unenviable position of being a general avenue of appeal on the merits in respect of any decision made by any officer of the Department. There was also increasing evidence that illegal entrants and others were using the avenues provided by policy loopholes and procedural complexities to challenge decisions quite properly using the emerging body of administrative law. The introduction of so large a body of regulations under the amended legislation in a much compressed time ,frame compared to what was originally intended was required by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act. This resulted in a lack of clarity, and, in a number of cases, unintended consequences. Accordingly, my predecessor made it clear on a number of occasions that it would be necessary continually to monitor the regulations and amend them as problems emerged. My predecessor made a number of changes prior to his leaving !he portfolio and the changes I am makmg are part of that ongoing process. Underlying the Government's approach to any review of the legislative framework are our basic objectives of maintaining government authority over our non-discriminatory migration program and other entry of people into Australia; continuing to ensure that its migration administration has effective means for minimising the potential for abuse of the system by illegal entrants; and retaining the power, through its control systems-including the discretions available to the Minister-to respond sensitively and with compassion when individual cases arise that require special consideration. Control over the migration program and entry generally is exercised through the codification of policies into regulation so that the X are fixed in law. Codification means that policies are clearly specified in criteria and people are clear on their entitlements and obligations. This narrows the range of discretions needed to make decisions. The correlative of this meant that policies had to be spelt out in fine detail. Further, the Department has to have in place proper administrative procedures consistent with the principles of administrative law and these procedures in turn must also be reflected in the regulations. Because of the scope and complexity of migration policies and procedures, this in turn meant a very extensive body of regulations. To some extent the sheer volume of the regulations has given rise to some of the criticisms of complexity. The second objective of minimising abuse of the system by illegal entrants has also been largely attained by the codification process. By this means it has proved possible to define clearly the entitlements we are prepared to allow for particular groups of illegal entrants, rather than have broad discretionary criteria for illegal entrants as a group. It is quite clear that we must distinguish between those people who become illegal quite innocently and unintentionally through ignorance of proper procedures, and those who exploit every loophole in immigration policies to stay on in Australia even though they have no right to do so. This is by no means easy, as considerable ingenuity is directed towards finding loopholes which must then be plugged. And, of course, the regulations become increasingly complex as these loopholes are plugged. Another related objective is to ensure that those who jump the queue are not advantaged to the detriment of those whose family sponsor their coming to Australia in accord with proper procedures. . The other main objective was that of removing from the Minister the almost intolerable burden of being a court of appeal for all the adverse decisions made by Departmental officers. I see my role as principally being responsible for setting and correcting the direction of policy. I have powers to deal with the individual case at the primary decision level but I am bound by the regulations. Without going into detail, I also have powers under sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act to set aside decisions after each review stage. Under these sections I am not bound by the criteria established by the regulations and have a power to make any decision more favourable to the applicant that I judge to be in the public interest. This is a discretionary power and I am under no obligation to use it. However, I am restricted in the exercise of the power in that the person seeking my intervention must have a review right. I must also report to Parliament if I make such a decision. I might also emphasise that I have no intention of intervening under my review powers unless there is serious reason. That is, I shall not be setting aside decisions reached in accord with the criteria established by the regulations unless I am convinced that there isa gap in policy, that the refusal is.an unintended consequence of the regulations or that an individual case requires special consideration. In these circumstances I shall move to amend the regulations as necessary. There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the regulations on the grounds that they are inflexible, harsh and overly complex. Some of the criticisms raise valid concerns and I shall indicate later how I intend to deal with these. But it is worth noting at the outset that the regulations work reasonably well in by far the great majority of cases and have caused few problems. The great bulk of the problems have emerged in two general areas. First, people whose circumstances fall outside policy and who were previously handled on an ad hoc discretionary basis. Second, people who are illegally in Australia and who either simply do not wish to leave when they should, or who argue that there is good reason for staying on after they should have left. When numbers of people entering Australia were significantly smaller than they are now, we as a community could accept dealing with these problems by waiving policy on an ad hoc basis. Now, however, the numbers are becoming so large that more forthere mal measures need to be in place to maintain the integrity of the problem. I will be approaching the question of changing the legislation in a three-phase approach. The first phase incorporates those changes where a response is needed immediately, or where further consultation is not needed. These changes are of some significance. The phase will also include a number of technical changes which have only minor policy or procedural implications but which will improve the working of the regulations and clarify some of the criteria. I will also ensure, in making changes in the first phase, that provision is made such that people, who may have applied after 18 December, but before these changes come into place, are not disadvantaged by any changes relating to their application. The first phase will, in particular, provide greater access to review rights under the transitional arrangements. That is, I accept that it is quite inequitable to leave people without a review right. I am therefore going to reinstate the Immigration Review Panel to provide a review channel for people who were here before 19 December 1989, had lodged an application before that date and had no review avenue in the event of an adverse decision. I also intend in· the first place to give effect to some recommendations of the Administrative Review .Council in relation to the Minister's powers to substitute a decision more favourable to the applicant at the review stage. As the legislation is presently formed? some app-i-ants could be disadvantaged If 1, as .l\:1-m-ter, were to intervene on my own ImtiatIve at the internal review stage. and remov.e from the applicant any reVIew of .the mternal review decision by the ImmIgration Review Tribunal. Accordingly, .I foreshadow a Bill to amend the Migration Act to ensure that my discretion to make a decision after the first tier can be exercised only at the request of the applicant and where I am prepared to make a - ecis-on ag-eea,ble to the applicant. The BIll will mamtam t,he situation that I have no duty to exerCIse that discretion when requested. I will also move to amend the legislation to allow the applicant to appeal to the Immigration Review Tribunal on the internal review decision where I do not intervene. I will also address a matter relating to review fees. Where an applicant has appealed to the Immigration Review Tribunal and I have exercised my discretion in favour of the applicant, the applicant will be refunded any fee paid to the Tribunal. I will also be moving quickly to establish a Joint Committee on Migration Regulations and will seek to ensure that the terms of reference of that Committee facilitate wide consultation. I also now intend that the Minister should report to Parliament every six months on any intervention at any decision-making stage in respect of applications for visas and entry permits. My reporting will cover an analysis and cataloguing of cases determined by me and will contain 1lly conclusions about - ossible needs to amend existing regula!lOns or make new regulations. By reportm- regularly in this way the proposed JOInt Committee will be provided with an opportunity to scrutinise any decisions I hav- taken and to report to me and the Pa-han:tent on the appropriateness of any legislatIve or regulatory amendments, , My reporting will also include Immigration Review Tribunal comments about the impact of the regulations in the light of the cases that come before them. In addition, I will reduce the complexity of the application procedures by collapsing the current 97 entry permit classes down to a possible seven; provide changes to relax certain deadlines; provide for the waiver of appeal fees in hardship cases; eliminate the requirement for preferential family applicants for permanent residence in compassionate circumstances recognised in the regulations to leave Australia simply to lodge applications in situations where this requirement is unnecessarily harsh and arbitrary; and provide discretion for relaxing the provisions barring the return to Australia of illegal entrants, other than deportees on criminal or security grounds, so as to recognise compelling compassionate circumstances. These changes will meet a number of the more pressing problems which have emerged. The second and third phases will deal with changes which require more time to decide. I intend in the process of finalising these to pursue a structured process of parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation. The proposed Joint Committee will playa central role in this process. By this consultation process I hope to avoid the problems which emerged because of the tight deadlines within which the regulations had to be introduced. In particular, I wish to ensure that department manuals setting out the regulations and procedures are in place when the regulations are changed, and that officers of the Department are given adequate time to digest the changes and be trained in any new procedures which may result. One area I am not addressing in the first phase is the general area of asylum and the special case of the long term future of People's Republic of China nationals in Australia. This area is to be the subject of further consideration by Government. I shall, however, be giving early consideration to humanitarian entry criteria and, in particular, the barriers to the entry of persons who have a right of settlement in third countries. In the second phase I shall be examining such issues as the health criteria; restrictions on the grant of permanent residence to visitors who marry Australian citizens; the question of tightening criteria for testing the genuineness of marriage; clarifying the entitlements of illegal entrants to remaining in Australia; and restrictions on temporary resident permit holders having access to permanent residence. But I will be looking at these issues in a measured fashion, and will not be rushing into quick ad hoc solutions to meet the exigencies of particular cases. I am also certain that other issues will emerge as public consultation is carried out. I hope to have these changes in place beginning in August and to have completed this phase by December this year. The final phase relates to a general redrafting of the regulations. I accept that the regulations could be made less difficult to understand. There are two aspects to this. Some of the problems stem from departmental procedures and I am taking steps to change these in the first two stages of my review. The other aspect stems from language and. structure. I will shortly be talking to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) about undertaking this exercise as matter of priority. It will, however, probably take about 12 months to achieve this. In the time available to me it was not possible to establish with complete confidence as to which changes in the regulations that I am foreshadowing today will require changes in the Migration Act itself. This matter is being examined as a matter of priority. The timetable that I have outlined may need to be varied to allow for the processes of any necessary amendment of the Act to take place. I am confident that by adopting this structured approach to amending the migration legislation we will have a legal regime in place which, on the one hand, will meet the reasonable needs of people seeking to come to or remain in Australia, along with the rights of Australian sponsors. On the other hand, we will continue to meet the legitimate concerns of the Australian community that the numbers of people coming either to stay permanently or temporarily are consistent with the interests of the Australian community. I present the following paper: Review of Migration Legislation-Ministerial Statement, 9 May 1990 Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",63
102,Mr RUDDOCK,LEGISLATION,"1 thank the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and . Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for his comments today when making a statement on the review of migration legislation. This is a welcome exercise in accountability and I thank him for that. However, it comes as a result of the Government's abject failure in relation to the process of law reform, the administration of the important migration program for this country, and the national interest, and the Government's failure in the administration of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Firstly I want to address the Government's failure in the administration of the Department. In seven years there have been six Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-West, Hurford, Young, Holding, Ray and now Minister Hand. Secondly, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has seen fit to intervene in the administration of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs personally and in a most unusual way. Before the Minister was appointed, the head of his Department was dispatched largely without notice and in a way which brings, I think, grave disrepute upon this Government and its decision making processes. We have seen these comments about the man: . . . Ron Brown has resigned amid claims that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet wanted him out because he upset ethnic organisations. It is understood that senior members of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet have argued that ethnic organisations were not happy with new hardline, economically based immigration rules and attempts by the immigration department to halt the abuse of immigration controls. Later there were further reports in the Australian about the departure of the Deputy Secretary, Mr Harris. It was observed in an article written by Mr Sheridan that: Mr Harris's departure means that the immigration department will within a few weeks have uired a new head and a new deputy head, -:h from outside the departI?ent, and a new minister. This is regarded as highly unusual and mes at a time'when debate over the Governco ment's immigratIOn 1 po'ICY IS There was a detailed commentary in the Canberra Times by Jack Waterford in which he commented on these matters and the role of th- Office, o- M-lticultural Affairs in the Pnme MmIster s Department. He commented particularly about Middle East lobbies and ,the de-is,ion taken in this matter by the Pnme MInIster. The article states: Mr Brown, it seems, had offended some people, apparently by some remarks he had made about comparative assimilation records-matters unemployment rates, criminality etc-of different, countries. I do not know the truth of those matters; ness nobody does. But the fact is that the Govconsequences ernment changed the very basis on Public Service heads are appointed; changes have been made but no satisfactory explanation has been given for them. There is a good deal of comment around which suggests that there may have been other reasons for this move. Some relate to the involvement of the Office of Multicultural Affairs seeking information through officers of the Immigration Department. There is concern that when a brief relating to the Lebanese concession was prepared-a matter in which I know the Prime Minister has taken a personal interest over time-the .head of the Department sought a re-writing of part of the document-not, I believe, to change the ultimate information that was conveyed, but to put it in a more bureau:"" cratic form. The Prime Minister saw both docu!llents. and was concerned about the way In whlCh he was being briefed. As a result of that he took it upon himself ,to make these sorts of changes. I regard it as a very serious matter. It reflects upon the Department of Immigration and its administration. These reports that pres-ure has been put on the Prime Minister In rela-ion to these appointments and that the Pnm- M-nist-r did a deal not only over the ImmIgratIOn regulations but also over appointments of senior officers in order to take this matter off the agenda during an election campaign are considerably alarming. It is pertinent that the Prime Minister 'heatmg ' up, himself commented during the recent election campaign on the migration regulations which we have discussed today. One can see in his comments his personal involvement in this matter. He said: It is a complex business, and the new regulations are at times confusing. He went on to say: I do not claim that our new regulations are yet perfect. Robert has made clear that some criticism has been fair. like He further said: And I say also, loudly and clearly, that the hallmark of the Hawke Government is a willingto listen to ethnic communities and-where necessary-to act. If there remain unintended to some of the new regulations you which have my word we will change them, It was the Prime Minister's intention to take these matters off the agenda. He was severely embarrassed and a man was made the scapegoat. That man was the head of the Department. If anybody was to be made a scapegoat in this matter it should have been the former Minister, Senator Robert Ray. In all my dealings relating to the migration regulations I spoke to the former Minister. I had no complaint about those dealings. I found him a reasonable man to work with and an honourable person to deal with, but the decisions were clearly his; he took them himself. At no time did I speak to Mr Brown about those regulations. I spoke to him at other times. In all' my dealings with him I found him to be a very professional and competent career officer. The way in which he has been dealt with is a most shabby exercise. I know that this occurred before the current Minister was appointed. It reflects most seriously upon the Government. The next matter that reflects upon this Government is the very process upon which decisions have been taken in the immigration area. Honourable members do not have to ask me about this. I have been commenting on immigration policy over a long period; I have also commented on administration of immigration. We now have confirmation from somebody on the inside about the way in which decisions are taken by this Government. I know that people have tried to put Senator Walsh down. I know he has been nicknamed Cassandra. From the byline that he writes for the Australian Financial Review I see that he has taken that name on board with a degree of approval. But he has now blown the whistle. I quote from his article yesterday. It was important. He wrote: Following the 1982 recession, the immigration intake was about 80,000 . . . But in three years February-March submissions notified Cabinet that the target would be exceeded. ommended to a 20,000 extension. The recommendations were accepted not because Cabinet believed a larger intake was a good thing, but because some feared political backlash from ""ethnic leaders"". I am not saying this; it is a member the Australian Labor Party-a man who sat in Cabinet and sat through those decisions as they were taken. He went to say: If our present 140,000 programme is ""about right"", it is a remarkably fortuitous outcome, given that it is the unplanned product of a sequence of blow-outs and cave-ins. The most significant events to occur since then are the number of comments-some by the current Minister, some by former Minister West, some by former Ray and some by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who has taken an interest in these matters. The interesting point is that they are all saying something different. This is a government that claims it has a program. The administration of regulations reform were a catalogue of disaster. I have brought not only the articles that I wrote but also press statements I prepared and put out. They reveal, once and for all, Government's failure. There was a total absence of fairness and equity in the way these matters were dealt with. People lost rights retrospectively. The Minister may now be intending remedy these matters. I will that in a moment. But the fact is thal these were mistakes; they were not mat· ters that could be glossed over by sayin€ that these regulations were reasonable and that most of the reforms had not been the subject of complaint. They were the sub· ject of serious malady. I commented nol only on their retrospective nature but alsc the way in which people lost appeal rights. the way in which people who married Australians were being asked to go over· seas and to lodge applications which would probably lead to them being able to return to Australia fairly easily. It was a nonsense. The Minister would say, 'We'll send you overseas and we'll even pay for fare back'. I was absolutely and recastounded as I looked at the shambles that was made of immigration law reo form. I issued a press release after the Minis· ter told us that we would need to adopt a trial and error approach in which lobof served that there was more error than trial-and that sums it up. I commend the Minister for his statement today as he on has indicated that some of the matters ] have raised will be addressed. I think he has tried to camouflage the enormity of the mistakes made, the enormity of the failure of the Hawke Government in these matters. He had made it appear-although it is very clear when we read the time-frame that the Minister has settled-that this will be a relatively Minister easy matter to remedy. I want to make it clear that the Opposition was well aware, and made it clear at all times, that there were enormous problems in the way in which this law reform occurred. We were not complaining about the direction in which the Govand ernment was going. We facilitated the reform. We assisted in the passage of the legislation. Without our cooperation it would not have been passed. At all times the we offered the Government an olive branch. We said, 'Look, we will even postpone the implementation of these regulations so that you can put them in place in a timely fashion'. But the Minister to spurned those advances. He was not incomment on terested in the least. I want to say to the Minister that he will have our cooperation for the reforms he proposes: the ref-nd of fees where people are successful - n appeals; the - e­ establishment of a parlIamentary commIttee' the requirement that he will reportI - elcome that particular statement-and the new role that he intends for the parliamentary committee. They are all welcomed by the Opposition. But this Minister is merely closing the stable door after the proverbial horse has bolted. Mr Hand-Did he win the race?  start.",67
103,Mr RUDDOCK,LEGISLATION,"I agree that it was very much nobbled at the barrier. We actually got there but there was something wrong with the photo finish equipment, if honourable members really want to know something about it. I am not interested in these horseracing analogies. The Minister h.as promised consultation on this occaSIon. lY1r Hand-And you will be.",70
104,Mr RUDDOCK,LEGISLATION,"I welcome that. The reform that was undertaken by the pre,vious Minister and by the Hawke Labor Government was without consultation and without discussion. Had the Government been prepared to consult, the difficulties that it experienced would not have occurred. I suspect had the advice of Mr Brown been heeded instead of the Minister's, we would not have had this problem. I suspect that the Department did not want to go down this reform route from the way in which the Minister was fired up about the changes that he wanted in place. What he thought would be, a monument to his credibility will be a monument to his infamy in immigration and ethnic affairs. There are perplexing problems yet to be addressed. I refer to the problems of Chinese students in Australia and the problem of what to do about people who marry Australians? How should those questions be dealt with? If the Minister means to consult about these questions I promise him cooperation and sensible and sound contributions on the part of the Opposition. But we need a lot more honesty on the Government's part in explaining why the Secretary to the Department was moved in the way in which he was.",70
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,70
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to outline an adequate program to achieve urgently needed microeconomic reforms in the communications arid transport industries. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",70
107,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"Three years ago with the advent of the Third Hawke Government we heard that this was to be the government of great micro-economic reform. Three days ago we heard with the advent of the Fourth Hawke Government that this was to be the government of great micro-economic reform. In Question Time today the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who is sitting at the table, said that we would be introduced to a multi-faceted array of micro-economic reforms over the next few months. The Opposition says that it needs more than the platitudes that it has been fed since last weekend and that the most important and critical area of micro-economic reform required in Australia right now is in the area of his portfolio, the area of transport and communications. I and my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) will be bringing home to bear many of those areas that urgently need attention if Australia is to stay competitive in the 1990s, if we are to get a situation where Australian industry can compete with its overseas rivals and where the people of Australia can get good value for money. The whole area of communications and aviation is faced with a number of potenhappen tial disasters. We can look at what is pening with the television networks at moment, the radio networks around Ausservices tralia, the threat that is being made rural radio stations, the problems that Aussat Pty Ltd has been facing in recent days with the Government having to in pump up that organisation with $1 OOm to into Australia. keep it afloat. What has been happening in terms of any competition that might be provided in the telecommunications area by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission? We are no wiser as to which way the cellular phone debate will What will the Government do in the area of cable and pay television? When we get into my area of responsibility, that of aviation, we have a real disaster on our hands. We are less than six months away from the deregulation of the Australian domestic airline industry. This week the headlines in the newspatourism. pers have given an indication that we not see the entry of new competitors in the aviation industry. We see Capitol lines, one of the major players, has ators. decided to defer its entry for at least six months flnd may not come into the game that? at all. We had six aspiring new airlines: itol, Compass, Southern Cross, Transwere Continental, Air Hibiscus and Seaboard Airlines. Have we had any indication the Government as yet as to whether any of those airlines will get off the ground? In actual fact there appears to be just airline that is making noises at the mowe ment: that is the Compass group, headed by Mr Brian Grey, for whom I have a great deal of respect. But even Mr Grey has been facing headlines this week saying that the aircraft that he had on order lease have now gone elsewhere. He has lost those and he is looking at the prospect of having to wet lease other aircraft overseas to try to get some competition into the air. There is a sense of urgency in the Australian community to know exactly what is happening in the domestic aviation area. There is a sense of expectation in' the Australian community that something will to air fares; that they will come hapdown; that the very high prices that Austhe tralians have been paying for aviation over the years may at last be to given some relief; that more Australians may be able to utilise those services and that we might become more competitive our capacity to bring overseas tourists It is a sad reflection on the Government when the head of one of its own instrumentalities, the Chairman of the Industry Commission, Mr Tony Cole, addressed a major tourism seminar in Canberra last go. week and we saw his speech headlined 'Aviation is the Basil Fawlty of Tourism'. Unfortunately, one could agree that that is right. Let me remind the House that it is more than 12 months since we had the interim report of the then Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) into travel and At that stage we learned of the may horrendous cost that Australia was up against for the services that were being Airprovided by domestic and overseas oper",70
108,Mr NA BROWN,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,How long ago was,71
109,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"That was' 12 months ago Capwhen that interim report came out. We told then that uncompetitive, high international air fares cut Australia's from spending power by $225m each year and that the present situation with the two domestic carriers was costing the Austraone lian economy about $170m a year. Yet, still do not know what will happen. At that self-same conference representatives of the present domestic airlines-Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd-got up and said, 'Yes, we welfor come domestic deregulation, come 31 October. It will be a tremendous thing but let us remind you that most of the from business is on the major trunk routes: Sydney-Brisbane; Sydney-Melbourne. Do not expect too much to happen on those thin routes'. I ask people on the opposite side who represent seats around far n<;>rth Queensland or the Northern Terntory or the Minister who lives in Perth what will happen to the cost of air fares in those areas. We went through the operations of this lAC report. We heard of the tremendous costs. We even had a statement almost 12 months ago from the present Minister's predecessor who got up and told us of the tremendous reforms that were about to be undertaken in terms of international aviation and international regulations. One can look back at that speech and ask oneself what in fact actually happened. Well, two things have happened. After a dragged out 14 year brawl, Korean Air has been granted one service a week into Australia with the prospect of a few more later this year. Swissa-r Pty Ltd was granted. rights into AustralIa but, unfortunately, It cannot start operating until 1991. We heard that there was going to be a whole new range of charter programs that were really going to liven up the tourist industry. Throughout the disastrous pilots dispute we were told that that was going to happen and that it was going to be part of the restoration program for tourism. How many new charter operators have come into Australia? We have had only one on a semi-regular basis. A couple of specials have come through. We now hear around the iRdustry that in fact a separate charter program really might be a figment of our imagination. In respect of the next round of talks on the United Kingdom Australia air agreement we hear that Qantas Airways Ltd has every intention of putting the rights of Britannia, the charter operator that has been coming into Australia, into the pile as part of the negotiation process. But we understood that the skies were opening up for charter operators. We have not seen any evidence of that yet. While it might be painful to remind honourable members of the effects of the pilots dispute, I think we should be perfectly aware of the tremendous cost of that dispute to Australia. It was the most costly industrial dispute in our history. In money terms it cost more than the Vietnam war. It cost 22,000 jobs. It cost billions of dollars to the tourist industry. Anybody who says that the dispute is over and everything is back to normal only has to get a copy of Ansett's and Australian's present schedules and compare them with the pre-dispute schedules of last year. Where is the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler)? He will come in here and tell us that Cairns now gets eight services a day. Prior to the dispute it got 23. Why does not the Minister have a look at what is happening with the Perth schedules? Why does he not have a look at what has been happening in the Western Australian tourist industry? Mr Tim Fischer-And Mount Isa.",71
110,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"What has happened to Mount Isa? What has happened to Rockhampton? They have not had any flights in at ,all. What has happened to Mackay? Look at the disaster that happened in Tasmania. Look at the disaster that happened in Alice Springs. Yet, we were told that one of the great benefits of the pilots dispute was the capacity of the airlines to be able to reorganise themselves, to get themselves set up in a more efficient manner and to go out there and really provide some reasonable air fares. What happened? The first thing that happened was that Ansett and Australian went to the Independent Air Fares Committee and, in the worse display of airline public relations in the history of this country, after the tourist industry had bled to death, applied for and got a 5 per cent increase in fares. So much for the efficiency processes that the Government was telling us were so good about this dispute. We hear now through the industry that prior to deregulation there is going to be another bite at the cherry-that, stand by, the two present operators are likely to go along to the Independent Air Fares Committee in the middle of June or early July and apply for another increase. Is the Government going to sit by and idly let them do that, especially when there is very little prospect of new carriers coming into the marketplace towards the end of this year? It goes well beyond just the domestic aviation situation. Do honourable members remember 18 months ago when we had the situation of air traffic controllers in Sydney going on strike and causing absolute havoc? We were told .that the negotiations were going on, that everything was going to be all right and that we were going to have new systems in operation that would alleviate the problems at Sydney international airport. What is happening? Virtually nothing, except we are told that in the next few days we might hear something about some new procedures. What was the arrangement that was made with the air traffic controllers in Sydney at the time of that strike? We know that they got more money. Has anybody got any idea of what the Government did in terms of those procedures, because nothing has happened yet? We can go beyond Sydney. Mr Hawker-And what about going into Melbourne?",72
111,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Wannon saw me the other day and said, 'Why do I have to hang around for 40 minutes in the air going into Melbourne?'. I will tell him why he has to hang around for 40 minutes going into Melbourne. There are problems with air traffic control there, too. We have a situation in which we have been told time and again that the aviation facilities, the radar and the navigation systems are going to be upgraded. What has happened? Very little has happened. What has happened in Perth? Very little has happened. There are still tremendous problems in terms of the reform of that system across the south of Australia and in terms of Sydney airport. We went through the situation of the third runway at Sydney airport. Remember the impassioned .speeches that we had here over the last 12 to 18 months about the Sydney airport. We had a Minister who actually resigned and got out in protest against this proposal. We were told that there was going to be an environmental impact study in terms of whether there was going to be an extension to the Sydney airport. What has happened? We are still waiting for it. It has been delayed. It was delayed until after the election. Most of us have a fair idea of what is going to be in that report. Now we get the Government saying, 'Well, if everything is all right, maybe we will go ahead with that third runway in Sydney'. But let us make sure that we are perfectly clear that if the decision were made tomorrow to build that third runway in Sydney it would be 1995 before it was fully operational. The Government has not been telling us that. It has not been telling us what the new air traffic procedures are going to be and just how much difference that is going to make in terms of being able to bring in new carriers and in terms of being able to increase the efficiency of the domestic operators. The domestic operators are still saying that holding over Sydney is costing them $27m a year in excess fuel burn. That has to be paid for by somebody. It is paid for by the long-suffering fliers of Australia who have to use those services. Let us go into deregulation a little more deeply and find out exactly what is happening and why the new carriers are not getting off the ground. We know thflt there are problems in the financial markets at the moment. There is not much confidence in those financial markets following the pilots dispute. We know that the economy of Australia is in such a mess that a couple of those carriers, including Capitol, have said that it is not the right financial climate for them to go and look for money. The big factor that is coming through and which has been alluded to by the Trade Practices Commission is the fact that the Government,. prior to the announcement of deregulation, did a deal . in the middle of the night. It signed up air terminal agreements for 30 years with Ansett and Australian. The Minister will say,· 'Oh yes, but there is a facility there for two gates to be made available to any new carriers'. We have found out in reCommunications and· Transport cent days that the two gates in fact are parked out in the yard somewhere, and that any new carrier will not be able to use the terminal directly in Sydney and that passengers will be transhipped by buses. . From the statements of the Minister last Sunday night, it seems that he is not too perturbed about that at all. I do not find any great disagreement with him. But he did make the point that the people of Australia would probably have to get used to operating out of tents and if they wanted lower air fares that was probably the way to go. In soine respects, probably it is the way to go. But why are the present airlines spending so much money on upgrading terminals? Why, for example, is one of them spending $6m in Canberra for .two air bridges? Is that going to bring down the cost of air fares? The answer is , no. Effectiv-ly, I thi.nk we can honestly say that there IS very lIttle chance at this stage of any major competition coming into the Australian aviation industry on 31 October this year. There may well be a few - ive-away fares that the airlines will try. I Just hope that we may see another carrier - om- into competition, but every option IS being closed off. According to the Minister's statements, the option of privatising Australian and Qantas has gone. Where are we really going to go? The option of interlining was closed off as a means of - educing the cost of tour packages. for mternational airline travellers commg to Australia. The Minister says that that has not happened. We are going to be subjected to a multifaceted micro-economic reform package I- the next few months. I think it is about ttme t-at this House and the people of Austraha had some indication of just what - h- Government is going to do and what It IS not going to do.",73

The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) delivered a mass of contradictions at a thousand miles an hour. There is a total incapacity to see the contradictions in what he says. On the one hand the honourable member argues that the Government ought to deregulate. On the other hand he asks what is the Government going to do to make sure tha- .the two airlin-s .concerned get competItIOn and what IS It going to do to get another player in the field. What does he want? Does he want one or two of the new airlines to be subsidised? Does he· want them to be given exclusive access to particular routes? Does he want to see the sorts of things that the Opposition did for years and years in government in this country? The honourable member likes to t<l;lk about a .bit of history, or at least hIstory accordmg to him, in respect of the situation in which we now find ourselves. I point to another piece of history of which the honourable member ought not to be terribly proud. In about July this year this Government will become the second longest serving government in Australian history. In about October this rear th.is Government will preside over Its earlIest opportunity to deregulate the a.viation indu.stry. The answer to the questIons that anse from that set of facts is that so effectively did the previous Government, when in office, lock up the domestic aviation domestic system that it has taken us to achieve the status of the second longest serving government in Australian history to be able to unlock the set-up that the previous Government put in place. Those opposite should not come into this chamber waving their arms about and g--ticu-ating about what their current poSItIon IS on deregulation. Their position was t- r-gulat- this country to the eyeballs; It IS takmg us years and years to undo that. There are one or two honourable exceptions on the other side in this regard. The honourable member for Tan&ney (Mr Shack) is shaking his head. He IS an honourable exception in this regard, but the rest of those opposite collectively are not. The rest of them collectively were up to their eyeballs in regulation of the domestic aviation indusairlines try. That is the first point. Another piece of history in which the honourable member for Fadden was more directly involved was the pilots. dispute. He led the charge by that bunch of misled ca,-:,aliers on the other side of the House during the pilots dispute, with one objecadditional tive, and on€(objective alone-to prolong it and to ensure that, whatever came out of it, no major step in increasing the ciency of those two airlines was achieved by the Government. The honourable member should not kid himself about his role in that. I know what his role was. had. the experience, none too damaging, of pilot candidates operating against during the last election campaign, feeding off the honourable member as he went around from box to box. Their hope was be in the market. for the election of the Opposition. Why?  promised us that, if the Opposition is elected, they will direct Australian lines to re-employ us llnder our old conto ditions'. The Opposition told them that would dismantle the process that we engaged in of signing them up on the basis of individual contracts. The pilots mayor may not have been mistaken about the honourable member's attitude, but they certainly saw comments from him in the course of the election campaign along Ica. the lines that something like that would be done. They certainly were not disabused of that. What we have learned from the honournot able member and the rest of the characbeing ters on the other side of the House is that, when it comes to having a stomach for a fight in any area of the transport and communications industry for a bit of restructuring, not only will they not be the trenches with the Government but they will be back there feeding ammunicountry. tion to the other side to maximise its capacity to resist the things we are trying to do. The honourable member for Fadden If then talked about what we ought to be doing to ensure domestic competition. said that the Government ought to have a plan and that somehow this plan ought to produce a situation of six or seven competing with the two current domestic carriers. He said that this was the Government's responsibility and that we had to ensure that this happens. The simple fact is that no government engaged in deregulating the aviation industry by definition will know. There may well be carriers at the time that deregulation occurs. They may not come until a few months after that. The reason effiwhy there mayor may not be domestic carriers is that after October-unlike the situation that those opposite supported and imposed on this Government-it will I be up to individual investors and individual operators in this country to decide me whether there will be competition. That is the point of domestic deregulation: the Government no longer directs who is to Mr Carlton-But they set the rules.",74
113,Mr BEAZLEY,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"The rules as far as that Airis concerned are that anybody who wants set up an airline and conform with the it correct safety requirements imposed in· got this country may do so. Anybody who wants to set up an airline and operate within this country under those terms and conditions may do so. That is deregulation. It is no different from the situation that exists in the United States of AmerThe Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Fadden, criticised me for saying that one thing that we will contemplate is Qantas Airways Ltd put into full competition with the domestic airlines. That is common sense. If we did that, that would absolutely guarantee that there would be no other operators c.oming into the field and in the long in term would probably guarantee that there would be one monopoly carrier in this That would immediately raise the issue of whether we ought to have two, three or four other designated international operators operating from Australia. we did that, we would go in exactly the opposite direction of every other country, He We would be in an absurd situation courtesy of our opponents on the other side of the House. We will not go down that road of throwing Qantas into full-blooded competition with the other two operators. The issue of whether there ought to be cabotage on the normal operations-that is a non-scheduled service-of Qantas as a- international carrier in this area is a matter that the Government will consider over the next few weeks. For the honourable member for Fadden to have touted that sort of proposition and endorsed remarks that he erroneously said had been made by the Chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission is perhaps an indication that that is the road that he wants to end up going down. The fact is that the infrastructure of aviation in this country has been constructed around two domestic airline operators. People will want to operate cutprice airlines. Through the contracts that we have negotiated we have left some f00m for them to manoeuvre. We have also left it to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) to develop new facilities if it wants to do so. We will encourage new operators, if they want to, to set up alternative facilities. In the experience of the United States, cut-price airlines are quite prepared to operate out of different sorts of facilities in order to pursue the objective of competition. That is all there is to it; there is no alternative.  way at the moment a program worth some $700m for the construction of new facilities at airports around Australia. So the FAC is doing its best in addressing the requirements for infrastructure, given more effective competition and more effective operations. Why does the FAC exist? Why is it now outside of the Government's normal budgetary arrangements under which infrastructure almost invariably gets constrained, whether it be under the budgetary arrangements of this Government or that of our predecessors? The reason is that the Government established the FAC to be able to be in a position precisely to better serve the needs ?f the Australian aviation industry than - t could when it was a department. Who mtroduced that process? It was this Government. We have a program for micro-economic reform in this country. I can see that it is a program that will be the subject of constant sniping from the Opposition. Mr Jull-Whatabout the third runway?",75
114,Mr BEAZLEY,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"The third runway has come up. If the honourable member knows anything about the legal regime that operates in this country, and if he thinks for one minute that we can get away with an environmental impact statement that is not perfectly legally valid, he is talking through his hat. That is what he seems to be inviting the Government to do-to charge ahead, bull-headed at the gate, and to find ourselves in the position at the end of the day of legal challenges in court which could tie us up for years and years. It is in this area and so many others that opportunities are now available to the people who wish to disrupt the processes of government. The honourable member for Fadden raised one or two other issues. I will try to cover those, and others that I anticipate from a subsequent speaker, in the rest of my remarks. It is very important that in the micro-economic reform debate that will take place people understand what is micro-economic reform and what is something else. Unquestionably, there are areas of the communications portfolio constituting serious matters of micro-economic reform which, when adjusted to the policy development requirements of this Government, will provide opportunities for Australian business generally to be far more competitive. There are other things that ought to be changed for other reasons. Pay television is not a major element of micro-economic reform. Pay television is an issue about the delivery to people of entertainment services and the like. But that is a different matter from the areas of micro-economic reform which create efficiencies to make our business more effective. Likewise, other amendments that need to be made to the Broadcasting Act will arise from a thoroughgoing review of the Broadcasting Act that we have in place at this moment. When those particular matters come in, issues may arise about the deli very of services to people that will need to be considered and will be fundamental to it. There may well be other commercial considerations that apply. We may decide to get ourselves to the position where we will sufficiently deregulate competition, and permit a situation to occur where people will fail and succeed according to their own commercial judgments. It will be a very stupid exercise-I can see that it is one that the honourable member will engage in when he gets into this place-to assume that, when somebody has made a commercial mistake and is somehow at fault, the Government must step into correct the consequences of commercial mistake and prop him up. That is the implication of the sorts of things that the honourable member was stating in the remarks that he made. Other areas of the communications industry, when reformed, will make a great deal of difference to the way in which our businesses operate. That, of course, relates to the issues of the three main carriers for our communications system. We have heard precious little from members of the Opposition on what they intend to do about that. What we did hear in the course of the election campaign was one product of this capacity of the Opposition to run off babbling at the mouth. That was on the question of cellular mobile telephones. The Opposition went into this campaign with the position that there would be one competitor in the cellular mobile telephone area for Telecom Australia. Austel subsequently came out with a fairly reasoned argument for two.",76
115,Mr NA BROWN,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,In their draft report.,77
116,Mr BEAZLEY,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"In its draft report, and it may come out with another statement a month down the line. I am not certain that I agree with that proposition, but it indicates that there were serious matters to be considered which did not lend themselves to babbling at the mouth about one competitor automatically and forgetting about anything else-particularly babbling at the mouth accompanied by the absolutely absurd proposition that the new competitor should have a $500m entry fee before he would be allowed into the system. That is to guarantee absolutely at the outset that there would be no competition. This was the principal communications platform reform on which members of the Opposition fought that election campaign three or four weeks ago, and they ask us to take them seriously in this place when it comes to issues of micro-economic reform! Members of the Opposition are great on the slogans. They can charge around the country spouting slogans but, when it comes to hard policy, no matter whether it is in this area or in any other, we can guarantee that they will get it wrong .. They that have been in opposition for so long now that they do not comprehend the problems for government in making serious, sensible and detailed decisions. Unfortunately, we cannot here go through the processes of change that we are now introducing on the waterfront. There have been years and years of Opposition inactivity. As that very excellent Sunday program indicated the other day, the only attempt was made by Menzies in 1954-nothing on the waterfront since from members of the Opposition. But it does not stop them moralising and lecturing us on these matters. This is a very poor start here today to the Opposition's contribution to the micro-economic reform debate. All I can do is assure honourable members that the Government's program and achievements will be a great deal better.",77
117,Mr NA BROWN,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"Menzies) (4.44)By way of introduction, may I say that as soon as the matter of public importance is over we will give the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) the opportunity to demonstrate whether it is the Government that is concerned about mere slogans about reform in telecommunications or whether, on the other hand, the Government is prepared to take action, because we will put up a motion to give the Government an opportunity to cast a vote; and we will see then which side is engaging in the empty rhetoric and who is prepared actually to go along and make the hard decisions. The Opposition has three points to make in this matter - f public import-m-e about micro-economIc. re-orm, as It IS called, in telecommymcatIOn-. - he first point to be made IS that thIS IS not a competition to see who can get there first. We of course have an agenda, and I will be saying a little about that .later. o-. But the point about the matter IS thIS: If the Government does proceed with substantial reform, and if it does go about it smartly and promptly, then we on this side of the House will be the first to applaud. The Government should get that straight at the outset. The second point to be made-and one where in fact, we are critical of the Governmdnt, and have no hesitation in criticising it-is that the Government is clearly not apprised of the urgency of the situation and does not have all of the items that it' is necessary to have on its agenda if it is seriously going to tackle the prob- He continued: lems of reform in telecommunications. When put in a nutshell, the situation is this: in telecommunications the rest of the world has enthusiastically embraced deregulation, competition and privatisation, but in telecommunications Australia is still locked into this absurd monopoly mould. We say that it is time that Australia broke out of that mould; it is time that we set free these forces of investment; it is time that we set free this potential for people to offer a different and a better service and it is time to get the Government out of fields that, frankly, in many cases it should not be in at all. The unfortunate thing is that today, on all of the evidence that we have got, the Government, frankly, does not seem to understand the urgency of the reform problem. Nor is there any evidence at all that it knows where it is going. It is true that there have been some micro-reforms, as they are called, but, frankly, they seem to be so small in telecommunications that one would need a microscope to see them. By and large, apart from those minor reforms, we have seen a .very depressing record from this Government. We just have to take its last monument, which was the 1987 review of telecommunications. Frankly, the whole series of recommendations in that, and those that were adopted by the Government, were supportive of this one proposition-defend and support the monopolies. That has been the situation under the present Government, and that is the paralysis that presently still grips the Government. The whole approach that it has adopted, and apparently the whole approach that it will continue to adopt, is to subject this whole area to one review after another and avoid making the decisions: We just have to go back over the interviews the Minister gave over the last couple of weeks to see this theme recurring time and time again. I took out some of the words that he has used to express what the Government is doing about this reform area. For example, he says: . . . those are going to be options for my colleagues to consider. All those sorts of things are going to have to be considered. On competition with Telecom, he says: I think that is certainly something that we have to seriously consider, yes. . . . all of those things are going to be under consideration by the Government at some point of time in the future . . . Again, he says: Now that's a subject that is going to be up there for review. . . . this is going to be a matter, I think, of open discussion over the next few months. That is what it is-review after review in telecommunications and the whole communications area. This area seems to have had more reviews than the Folies Bergere so far as I can tell, but the Government s-ems incapable of reaching any deciSIOns. The third point that we want to make is this: we on the Opposition side have an agenda. There is a clearly stated list of reforms which we believe are essential in communications, particularly in telecommunications. We would say to the Minister, 'if he were here and were prepared to listen and think carefully about these mat· ters, that this agenda is balanced and reasonable. It will allow competition, it will stimulate investment, and it will get rid of the stranglehold which many of the monopoly areas are subject to and which are holding back development and progress in these areas. Let us come to the issue of the agendas of the two sides. The other day we had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) writing a letter to the Minister who was at the table, listing the reforms that he should turn his mind to. I had a look at this letter and, frankly, the conclusion I came to was that the Minister needed another letter. So I sent him a letter setting out the full agenda and some of the other items that he should be directing his attention to. I attached this list of 10 items that the Prime Minister seems to have overlooked, all of which are important. I want to tell the House briefly what this agenda is because, frankly, we just will not sit here without some protest when we are accused of the wild generalisations that the Minister gave when there is an agenda for improving communications in Australia and we have it. The first point that I made in my letter to the Minister is that this great report that his Department is undertaking of the three telecommunications carriers should be made public so that we know what issues have been examined. Secondly, the development of private telecommunications networks clearly be encouraged and facilitated. There is one thing about this that can be done immediately and it can be done today. The independent authority, Austel, has published a report on private networks and how to expand and encourage their development. It has a series of very sensible recommendations. We certainly support them. We call on the Government to implement them. It does not require legislation. It does require-this prings this debate very sharply to a point-the Minister, if he really wants to encourage competition, to give a simple direction to Austel to issue a different form of licence to allow the expansion of private telecommunications networks. When this debate on the matter of public importance is over I propose to ask the House for leave to bring on a motion, which is already on the Notice Paper, urging the acceptance of Austel's report and calling on the Minister to give that direction to Austel so that we can go ahead from tomorrow. There can be no putting these issues off. It can be done tomorrow if this direction is given by the Minister. We have heard babbling out of the mouth of the Minister in this debate so far. We will see who is doing the babbling and who is prepared to take action. It is a simple decision that can be taken today. The third thing we have said in our list is that the resale of excess capacity on private networks should be allowed. Fourthly, Telecom should be open to competition in providing public pay phones. Fifthly, private technicians should be allowed to install and maintain all telephones. Sixthly, Telecom should be open to competition in the provision of the first phone, public switched data text and video transmission and information services. These are all areas where if we simply allowed competition-it can be done very easily indeed-we would unleash a powerhouse of competition and investment and stimulate great industrial activity and employment in this country in those areas. The seventh point is related to Aussat. The other day we saw an absurd performance by the Government when it put an extra $100m into Aussat without setting it free from the restrictions that it is subjected to and maintaining it as a government body. We have other recommendations including the privatisation of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, allowing other companies to establish satellite communications and enabling pay television to be introduced. The lines are very clear in this dispute between us and the Government. We have the agenda and we are prepared to act on it. We want to give the Government an early opportunity to see whether it is just babbling or whether it is prepared to take the positive and hard decisions that are needed. We say that it should get on with the job.",77
118,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,"We have had a farcical proposition today. We have a matter of public importance which suggests that the Government has failed to outline an adequate program to achieve urgently needed micro-economic reforms. There are about 10 major areas of microreform in the economy which could have been touched on in the Opposition's presentation today. In leading the debate the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the first cab off the rank, the prime expert in the field, spent his whole contribution talking about the airlines. In that contribution-I very carefully noted the content of it-he presented not one single policy proposal or policy option. All he did was complain about a number of things that can be traced back to inaction over a long time. More importantly, he mostly complained about the effects on the Australian economy of the airline pilots dispute last year and the closing down of the airline system by the pilots. That is really what he talked about-the flow-on effects in the Australian economy of that action which took place. It should never be forgotten in this Parliament that the prime advocate of the pilots, the person who day after day came forward during Question Time and put pressure on the Government on behalf of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, was the honourable member for Fadden. He ran their case day after day. As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said, he went around Australia giving the pilots comfort to continue their program which brought about a number of the things he no\v complains about. One would have expected that in the first matter of public importance debate the Opposition might have gone to the Governor General's Speech of yesterday and tried to move through the scope of the Government's reform agenda and talk about it. But we cannot even start with the first paragraph without running into a dramatic problem for the Opposition. I will read the very first sentence of the Government's agenda relating to transport and communications, as outlined yesterday by the Governor General. It said: The Government believes that a national approach to our transport problems is required. The minute we start to talk about a national approach in this House we immediately have to focus on the question of State rights. Why do we have an absurd road-rail infrastructure? Why do we have all these absurd problems on the waterfronts that are owned and operated by State authorities? The reason we have all these problems is because the Opposition has continually promoted States rights and has never been prepared to accept the role qf a Federal Government as a central Federal Government running a country on a sound national basis. It has never been prepared to accept this. Even during the very recent election it continued to run exactly the same position on States rights. As the micro-reform agenda is being put into place by the Government during the next three years we are going to see these very same people come into this Parliament and complain about intrusions of States rights, complain about attempts to rationalise the trade union movement on a national basis and complain about attempts to try to bring industry together on a national basis. We are going to see the words, 'We will not oppose; we will applaud initiatives' fall in a hole within weeks. If we move through the Governor General's Speech of yesterday-it is not very hard to go over the two columns of Hansard-to this particular topic we see reference to a national approach and major areas of reform such as shipping, which includes the introduction of performance indicators for turnaround in the waterfront and the performance of the shipping industry. We saw a national freight initiative. When have members of the Opposition ever come into this Parliament and talked about some way of getting a national rail-road strategy? They have not because they have consistently pursued and supported a broken-down State by State approach. We made reference to the drive for uniformity of regulation of road use and uniformity of standards for roads. At least today the deregulation of the domestic aviation industry has been focused upon. I do not think we can focus on it without remembering-I am going to reiterate the point made by the Minister-that the two-airline policy which has operated in this country now for 30 years was a product of the coalition. The last government in Australia with a chance .to break that two-airline policy and to dISsolve it was the Fraser Government in 1981. It signed it up for another decade. In the first opportunity that tqe .Haw-e Government had to tackle that Issue It put on notice the fact t-at the tw--airli-e policy is finished. It will be fimshed m October and we will start a new era. There are members on the front bench of the Opposition who have been here during that whole process. At least the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) - utlined. a number of policy proposals-hIs 10-pomt plan-for changes in telecommunications. There is nothing new in them and there is very clearly a big gulf between the approach of the Government and the approach of the Opposition. Anyone who wants to go to Hansard and look through those 10 points as the honourable member for Menzies outlined them will see that nearly every point includes the terms, 'to sell' 'resell', or 'open up for private competition'. That means that the - arious functions which Telecom AustralIa performs at the moment will be hived off and made available to the private sector to provide competition. There is nothing new about that. In fact this Government, in its 1988 reform, set in place for the first time the process whereby competition in business systems, the PABX field and other major communication fields could be provided and delivered via the private sector. It was done by negotiation with Telecom, the unions and user groups, and successfully put in place. Price capping has been put in place very successfully by the Government, as has a role for consumers having a say as to how Telecom performs its operation. While it has not yet gone all the way, Telecom is a far more customer responsive organisation now than it was 18 months ago. The process is moving along, but it is happening because the Government has tackled it in a sensitive way and will continue to do so. We heard all the talk about the third runway at Sydney Airport. If the Opp-si­ tion is signalling that it wants the thud runway at Sydney, irrespective of what the environmental impact statement says, it is out of touch not only with people in this Parliament who are representing the community in Australia, but also with the whole world. Anywhere in the world where airports operate there is now a large degree of sensitivity towards a lot of these issues. A range of things incorporateq in the Governor General's speech have not been touched on today. Instead, all we got was a whinge about the pilots strike and a bit about selling off Telecom. I am going to finish on one point regarding the pri,:atis-tion age-da. I a?1 going to take debght m observmg the dIfficulty that the Opposition will have in its ranks during the next three years on the question of the privatisation of Telecom and other areas. I know there are a number of new members of the Opposition who represent country areas in Victor-a who will be made to account to theIr constituencies about their position on privatising Telecom. They will have to talk about the increase in country charges because they want the Melbourne-CanberraSydney route to be super cheap for the business sector. They will be called to account, and they will not be able to stand the pressure.",79
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The time for the debate has expired. NA,81
120,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES,"I move: That for the purposes of the procedures of the House: any reference to Minister- shal.1 be taken to include Parliamentary Secretanes, wIth the following exceptions: (a) presentation and motion for second reading of government bills; and (b) question- seeking information (chapter XI of the standing orders). As honourable members will be aware the Government has reinstituted, on a sys.tematic basis, the institution of Parliamentary Secretaries-this was .actually set in place first, to my recollectIon, by the Fraser Government-carrying with them here some of. the responsibilities that a previous Li-e-al government assigned to Assistant MInIsters. Parliamentary Secretaries will not able to answer questions in the portfolio area or introduce Government Bills, but the Government considered it desirable that they have a distinctive responsibility in this chamber. Part of that responsibilan ity is the ability to carry through legi-la­ tion in the House from the second readmg stage. They also have other House arus rangement duties such as representing Ministers or being the Minister, effecSecretaries. tively, in charge of the business of the House from time to time. The institution of Parliamentary Secretaries, I think, be enhanced by that aspect of their role. We are proceeding by a process of trial and error as far as the activities of Parliathe mentary Secretaries are concerned. They are an institution not unknown in most equivalent democratic systems; they are only sporadically known in this one. Perwill haps their lack of longevity in the past has, in part, been due to the fact that the end of the day governments have been absolutely certain whether they performed a worthwhile role. I give the assurance to my Parliamentary Secretary behind me that it is not our intention that Parliamentary Sectetaries should feel this of themselves at the conclusion of this Parliament. While most of their functions and activities are associated with assisting the Minister in the portfolio to which they are assigned with activities external to the House, they will, as a result of this, assist the Ministry generally in the consponsibility duct of the House.",81
121,Mr FIFE,PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES,"The Opposition supports the motion moved by the Leader of the House(Mr Beazley). We believe that there is a place in our Parliament Parliamentary Secretaries. As the MinisDeputy ter has just indicated, a Government our political persuasion has been down posal. this path before. I hope that as a result of the trial and error exercise it will th.at the role of Parliamentary Secretaries will become very important and useful and will enhance the' work of the Minisrostered ters, the shadow Ministers and the Parliamentary ment. While the Leader of the House did not make it clear in his comments, I am asbe suming that the same courtesy that will be extended to the Parliamentary Secretaries for the Government will also be extended to the Parliamentary Secretaries for the Opposition. The Opposition has executive which shadows the Government's Executive, and our Parliamentary Secretaries have been appointed to assist in the same way that the Government hopes to be assisted by its Parliamentary I was disturbed to hear the Leader of the House say that, as well as the other will duties that Government Parliamentary Secretaries will have, it is intended that on occasions Parliamentary Secretaries on Government side of the House will be in charge of the House. Of course, that means that there will be occasions when this House will be sitting and no Minister be present. I believe that this is not desirable. Whilst we strongly and warmly at support the move towards the establishnot ment of Parliamentary Secretaries and have giving them a meaningful role in the chamber, I think that the Executive should pay a courtesy to the chamber by always having a representative present. In future I intend to draw attention to the fact that the House is meeting with not one Minister present. Over the years the size of Federal ministries has increased-no doubt because of the increased workload. The Executive has a very important reto the community, as it has through this Parliament. I believe that this House should not be in session with-ut a representative of Her Majesty's Government being present in the chamber. So with that one reservation I indifor cate to the House and, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the of Government that we support the pro",82
122,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES,"in reply-The understanding by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) that from time to time duties will be done by ParliaSecretaries is correct. That is our intent. He was also concerned that Parliamentary Secretaries assigned by the Opposition should be treated in the same way as Parliamentary Secretaries assigned by the Government. The answer to that is that they will be. As far as we are concerned that treatment obviously will be reciprocated. We do not actually have a gigantic executive in this place compared to most equivalent systems. It was, thought by us that, having sworn in these Parliamentary Secretaries as members of the Executive Council, which was not done to Parliamentary Secretaries during the period of the Fraser Government but which was effectively done to Assistant Ministers during the period of the MCMahon Government, we had clothed them with a certain legitimacy in defending the Executive. Nevertheless, 1 anticipate the Manager of Opposition Business being a man of his word. He no doubt will protest the first time it happens and maybe subsequently. Question resolved in the affirmative.

SUPERANNUATION BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",83
125,Mr WILLIS,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Bill 1990 introduces a package of reforms in superannuation for Commonwealth employees. It is an upgraded version of the Superannuation Bill 1989 introduced on 29 November 1989, with the trust deed and rules attached as a schedule to the Bill now covering all categories of membership of the new scheme. It entails the most far-reaching reforms in 68 years. It will bring Commonwealth superannuation within the mainstream of Australian superannuation schemes. It will provide benefits that will be far more attractive to members at less cost to taxpayers. The new scheme will provide: the opportunity of membership to all employees; a choice of lump sum or pension benefits; flexible contribution rates for members; substantially improved resignation benefits; and significantly tightened invalidity provisions. ' The new scheme will be the main superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees. The scheme will cover all Commonwealth sector employees, except those of government business enterprises, and other Commonwealth agencies, that have separate superannuation schemes for their employees. Membership will be compulsory for new permanent employees, and optional for all other staff, subject only to a threemonth qualifying period. Superannuation will in future be available to around 35 000 temporary employees of the Comm-nwealth who ""are unable to join the current scheme. The form for the employer benefit in the current scheme is a non-commutable pension. Consistent with the Government's policy that lump sums are a legitimate form of superannuation benefit, the new scheme will provide a choice of lump sum or pension benefits. The standard benefit on age retirement will be a lump sum. However, members will be able to convert 50 per cent or more of their retirement lump sum to an indexed pension, at very attractive interest rates. In effect, the new scheme provides a subsidy in order to encourage people to take a pension. This encouragement is in addition to the general tax incentives favouring pensions over lump sums, particularly the higher reasonable benefit limits available when pension benefits are paid. The scheme will give Commonwealth employees access to the lump sums available to private sector employees, and be consistent with the Government's retirement income policy. These reforms are based firmly on the principle that Commonwealth employees sho-Ild have the same superannuation Op!lons and be subject to the same regulatIons and restrictions as the rest of the work force. The new scheme will comply with the occupational superannuation standards, including the reasonable benefits limits. In the current scheme, the member contribution rate is a minimum of 5 per cent of salary. In the new scheme, members will be able to contribute between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of salary. This will enable members to tailor their contributions to suit their changing financial circumstances throughout their working life. Benefits will be linked to member contributions, and will include the 3 per cent productivity benefit. The maximum retirement benefit for members on average salaries of between $25,000 and $37,560 a year will be a lump sum of eight times average salary, or a fully indexed pension of 80 per cent of average salary. Members on higher salaries will have maximum benefits below eight times average salary in accordance with the reasonable benefit limits. Members on lower salaries will be able to receive a lump sum of up to $200,000. This may be converted to a fully indexed pension of up to $20,000 per year. One of the most significant initiatives in the new scheme is a major improvement in resignation benefits. This will correct a major inequity. More than two-thirds of members of the current scheme receive no employer benefits because they resign before retirement. On resignation, members of the new scheme will be entitled to a refund of ,their own contributions with interest. They will be able to either take this in cash on resignation or leave it in the scheme until retirement. Members who resign will also receive their 3 per cent productivity benefit accumulated with interest when they ultimately retire from the work force. In addition, a member's entitlement to the remainder of the employer-funded benefit will start to phase in after one year's membership. After four years membership, employees will be entitled to the full employer benefit at retirement. Thus, all members will receive a Commonwealth superannuation benefit on retirement, even if they had resigned from Commonwealth employment many years beforehand. These significant improvements in superannuation benefits for Commonwealth employees will be funded primarily by tightening invalidity arrangements. While many of the persons receiving invalidity benefits in the current scheme are genuine invalids, there is evidence that invalidity retirement has been abused. A significant proportion of members have been retired on invalidity grounds by their employer against the advice of Commonwealth medical officers. Invalidity rates the current scheme have been five to 10 times private sector rates. Invalidity retirements must be brought into line with general community standards. The current scheme provides a significant financial incentive towards invalidity retirement rather than early age retirement. In the new scheme, invalidity benefits will be more closely aligned to age retirement benefits. The assumed retirement age for calculating invalidity benefits will be reduced from 65 to 60, better reflecting existing retirement patterns. Administration of invalidity retirement will be tightened to receive an invalidity pension, a member will have to meet the definition of invalidity in the occupational superannuation standards. That is, a pension will be paid if the member is unlikely ever to work again in any occupation for which he or she is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience. Retraining potential will also be taken into account. The trustees of the scheme will have the final say on whether invalidity benefits are to be paid. These measures will eliminate the rorts, while still protecting genuine invalids. Moreover, invalidity benefits will no longer be subject to a complex administrative process which involves determining if the cause of invalidity medical conditions existing at entry up to 20 years earlier. For those presently caught by this process, invalidity benefits will improved, in some cases very substantially. For others, except for career employees, invalidity benefits will generally be less attractive than in the current Commonwealth superannuaHon scheme. In all cases, genuine invalids will be provided with an adequate pension having regard to their service to the Commonwealth. Increasingly, thanks to this Government's initiatives, less than full career Commonwealth employees will have superannuation benefits from their previous employment to supplement Commonwealth superannuation benefits. Current Commonwealth employees will in be able to benefit from these reforms. Contributors to the current scheme, except employees of government business enterprises, and other agencies, that have their own superannuation scheme, will be given an option to transfer to the new scheme over the 12 months from 1 July 1990. Others, for example people on extended leave without payor who have a deferred benefit, will have an option to transfer to the new scheme when they rejoin a relevant area of Commonwealth employment. There will be a major information campaign to ensure all members have access to adequate information to make an informed transfer decision. Transferring members will receive a credit in the new scheme based on the standard transfer value in the current scheme of 3.5 times their accumulated basic contributions, plus their 3 per cent productivity benefit. I will now discuss the financial aspects of the new scheme. The ending of invalidity rorts means that the improvements in the new scheme can be provided at no additional cost to taxpayers. The consulting actuaries, TPF&C, and the Australian Government Actuary have certified that, for existing employees, the cost of the new scheme will be virtually identical to the cost of the current Commonwealth scheme, in net present value terms, after allowance is made for tax and social is related to security 'clawbacks'. The Government has decided that the be 3 per cent productivity benefit will be funded from 1 July 1990 putting this benefit for Commonwealth employees on the same footing as in the private sector. The payment of lu-p su-s on retirement instead of penSIOns bnngs for-ard expenditure. If all transferees were gIven immediate access to employer-financed lump sums from age 55 with a full credit for past service, the impact on the 199091 Budget outlays would be unacceptably high. Budget outlays could increase .by up to $300m in 1989-90 prices. For thIS re-­ son it has been necessary to phase III acc-ss to lump sums in the new scheme. Lump sum benefits will be available only to members aged 64 and over in 1.990-91. This age will be reduced progressIvely on each 1 July until lump sums are available to member- aged 55 and over in 1994-95. The proposed phasing-in arrangements will limit the impact of lump sums on the 1990-91 Budget to an increase of no more than $21m. For the new scheme as a whole, Budget outlays in 1989-90 pr-ces are estimated to increase by $131.8m III 1990-91, $147.6m in 1991-92 and $179.2m in 1992-93. However, while net c<?sts for existing members are the same III both schemes, there will be significant savings in respect of future employees. The cost to employers of superannuation for new entrants will fall from 13.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent of salaries, after allowing for tax and social security clawbacks and for increased coverage of casual and temporary employees. This is a saving of 18 per cent, or 2.4 per cent of salaries. Ultimately, this saving will be reflected in the Budget outlays, which will fall significantly. The new scheme entails some significant changes to the administration of Commonwealth superannuation. The legislation for the new scheme is comparatively simple. Details of the scheme are spelled out in the trust deed and rules included as the schedule to the Bill. A part time board of trustees, with equal numbers of employer and employee representatives and an independent chairperson, will be established to oversee the new scheme. This is consistent with the thrust of the occupational superannuation standards legislation that responsibility for fund administration and control be placed in the hands of scheme trustees. The joint employer-employee trustees will have an obligation to protect me1!lbers' intere-ts. This will be reinforced with an extensIve internal review mechanism. These arrangements will bring Commonwealth employees into the mainstream of Australian superannuation practice, and places their superannuation arrangements on the same footing as arrangements in the private sector. However accountability to the Parliament will be - aintained. Any appropriate changes to the trust deed or rules will be by way of disallowable instruments. The new scheme is fully in accord with the Government's social justice strategy. The new scheme will substantially improve equity in' Commonwealth superannuation. Membership of the scheme will be' open to almost all employees, regardless of their employment status. Benefits will be related much more directly to the aggregate period of membership, wh-ther served in one period or in broken penods. Broken periods of service will no longer adversely affect benefits. Accordingly, the significant indirect discriminati-n against women in the current scheme WIll be substantially eliminated. In summary, the .reform of Commonwealth superannuatIon has major financial implications for a very large number of Commonwealth employees. The detail of the new scheme is in the rules forming part of the schedule to the Bill. The rules now include the provisions relating to part time and casual employment and the other areas that time did not permit to be included in the 1989 Bill. However, a period of examination and experience over the next few months may well suggest technical improvem-nts in the detail of the scheme. Appropnate changes to the deed and rules will be made wherever necessary to ensure that the scheme operates as intended. The Government's policy statementReform of Commonwealth Superannuation has been well received. The new scheme has been accepted by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and affiliates, and there has been broad support for the crackdown on invalidity abuse. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. . Second Reading Mt WILLIS (Gellibrand-Minister for Finance) (5.30)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988, the Super7 annuation Act 1922 and the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973. The Superannuation Act 1976 provides the current superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees. Many of the changes proposed in the Bill are associated with the introduction of a new scheme by the Superannuation Bill 1990. As noted in the second reading speech on the Superannuation Bill 1990, contributors to the current scheme except employees of government business enterprises (GBEs) and other agencies that have their own superannuation scheme, will be given an option to transfer to the new scheme over the 12 months from 1 July 1990. Provision is being included in the 1976 Act for the arrangements for those transfers. Provision is also being included for the arrangements for transfers to the schemes of government business enterprises and other agencies. The second reading speech on the Superannuation Bill 1990 also referred to the abuse of the invalidity retirement arrangements under the current scheme. The Bill tightens the administration of invalidity retirement under the current scheme to eliminate the rorts. It will do this by adopting the same administrative arrangements as for the new scheme. This will end the rortswhile still protecting genuine invalids. A critical step in this process is the creation of the Commonwealth Superannuation Board. This Board will have the final say on invalidity retirement. Part of the savings expected from the elimination of the invalidity rorts will be used to provide a number of enhancements to the current scheme. Among these are recognition as salary for superannuation purposes of the updated former salary where a contributor experiences a salary reduction; provision for reversionary benefits to be payable to or in respect of certain children of a contributor or pensioner for whom maintenance payments were being made by the contributor or pensioner at the time of his or her death; payment of pension to a surviving spouse of a deceased pensioner at the rate payable to the pensioner for six full fortnights after the pensioner's death before commencement of payment at the lower rate normally applicable to spouses; allowing contributions to be paid during a period of unpaid maternity or parental leave at the option of the contributor; changing the reduction in pension on retirement before age 60 from 4 per cent to 31f3 per cent of the age 60 rate of pension for each year by which age at retirement is less than 60 y-as; and basing the retirement pension on completed years and days, not just completed years of service. All of these changes improve equity in the current scheme. They are desirable changes, but could only be responsibly introduced in current circumstances in the light of the savings from ending the invalidity rorts. Presently, the 3 per cent productivity superannuation benefit for contributors to the current scheme is provided under the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 on an unfunded basis. From 1 July 1990, this benefit will be provided under the 1976 Act and employers will be required to pay contributions to meet the cost of the benefit. This will bring the productivity benefit for members of the current scheme on to the same basis as for the rest of the work force. The Superannuation Fund Investment Trust will continue in its role of managing and investing the superannuation fund for the current scheme. It will also act as investment manager for the new scheme board of trustees for the five years from 1 July 1990. The Trust will, however, lose its monopoly role in relation to the funds of contributors who transfer to the schemes of GBEs and other agencies. Given that it is losing its statutory monopoly to protect the integrity of the current s-heme superannuation fund, the Trust is being provided with the opportunity to maintain the quantum of funds under its control by competing in the market. The Trust will be able to provide investment services on a fee for service basis, either discreetly or through unit trust or other pooled arrangements, for as wide a range of domestic and overseas clients within the public .and private sectors as is constitutionally possible. In line with this commercialisation functions the composition of the being changed and its membership is being increased. The Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 also provides an unfunded 3 per cent productivity superin annuation benefit for Commonwealth emnificantly ployees with no other employer sponsored superannuation cover. This Bill amends the Interim Arrangement Act to provide a funded 3 per cent benefit to these monwealth employees. Employers of persons with no other perannuation cover will be required make 3 per cent contributions of their employees to a superannuation fund. The fund is to be either a fund nominated by the Minister for Finance or the Bill. an industry or other fund approved by the Minister. As a safety net, in the rare instance where a Commonwealth employer fails to make the required payments to a fund, the employees will continue to receive the existing unfunded benefit. The opportunity is being taken to first time. amend the Superannuation Act 1922 to bring its provisions in relation to pensioners Who are imprisoned· into line with those of the Superannuation Act to amend the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 to recognise that the contract officers' benefits scheme established by that Act is now defunct. Finally, I address the financial impacts of the amendments. With the enhancements to the current scheme being met by the savings from the tightened administration of invalidity retirement, the only significant financial impact results from the decision to fund the 3 per cent productivity benefit froml July 1990. For the current scheme, the net increase in Budget outlays expressed in 1989-90 prices is estimated to be $46.3m in 199091 $38.6m in 1991-92 and $31.9m in 19-)2-93. The amounts fall in later years because the net increase takes into account moneys that otherWIse would have been payable under the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 of and because the number of persons in the Trust is scheme would be reducing. For those Commonwealth employees with no superannuation benefit other than the productivity benefit, the net increase in Budget outlays in 1989-90 prices is estimated to be $19.6m in 1990-91, $5.2m 1991-92 and $5m in 1992-93. The sighigher figure in 1990-91 results from the need for employers to pay to the nominated or other fund the amount of the benefit accrued up to 30 June 1990 Comunder the interim arrangement. In aggregate, therefore, the net increase suin Budget outlays is estimated to be to $65.9m in 1990-91, $43.8m in 1991-92 in respect and $36.9m in 1992-93.

126,Mr WILLIS,SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Bill 1990 is to make provision for the supervisory mechanisms to apply to the provision of superannuation to Commonwealth sector employees. In essence, the Bill re-enacts the existing part XA of the Superannuation Act 1976, with certain minor drafting changes. It is no longer appropriate that these provisions be embedded in legislation governing a particular Commonwealth sector superannuation scheme. They are primarily used to monitor arrangements offered as an alternative to legislatively based schemes. In presenting this Bill, it is not the Government's intention to make any significant alteration to the supervisory mechanisms originally established by part XA. The opportunity has been taken, however, to make certain minor changes to the drafting of the provisions. In the main, these changes are designed simply to ensure that the provisions operate as intended when part XA was originally introduced. For example, the supervisory mechanisms contained in this Bill will be capable of being applied even-handedly to all subsidiaries controlled by Commonwealth authorities or bodies. At the present time, part XA can be applied to certain subsidiaries only. The Bill is also drafted in terms which will ensure that it does not apply ,in any way to employees of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, or authorities, companies and other bodies funded by them. As the provisions of the Bill are in most important respects identical to those of the existing legislation, it has no new financial impact.

127,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: . That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill arises in the context of negotiations between Commonwealth and State Ministers on the future direction of corporate regulation in Australia. Since the passage by this Parliament of the Corporations Act 1989 and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, the need for reforms of our current system of corporate regulation has become more apparent. It is now commonly acknowledged that the current cooperative scheme is not able to provide the most effective method of regulation of our markets. There is an urgent need to restore investor confidence at home and to rehabilitate the international reputation of Australian markets and corporations. The Government sees the reform of corporate law as a significant element in its program of microeconomic reform. To resolve the present difficulties I recently sought and have had constructive meetings with State and the Northern Territory Ministers responsible for companies and securities regulation. At those meetings substantial progress was made by Ministers in resolving differences as to the substance and timing of the new arrangements for corporate regulation. Negotiations are continuing in particular on the funding and staffing aspects of the proposed new arrangements. This Bill forms an integral part of the ongoing consultation with State Ministers. The majority of the Ministerial Council have agreed to the introduction of this Bill. My State and Northern Territory colleagues and I have placed the utmost importance on ensuring that there should be an orderly transition from the cooperative scheme to the national scheme. We are also keen to ensure that corporate regulation, especially in relation to investigations and prosecutions of offences, should not lapse due to any changes tration or law. The approach set out in this Bill will facilitate an orderly change1983 over to the national scheme. The Bill will facilitate interim arrangeagreement. ments for corporate regulation by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) until the final form of a new structure is agreed by the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory and the necessary new legislation and administraIn tive arrangements are put in place. In effect, the Bill will enable the full-time members of the ASC to be appointed full-time members of the National Commarket panies and Securities Commission. The current cooperative scheme laws will continue until new agreed national arrangeis ments come into operation. Finally I am hopeful that given the structive spirit in which the recent negoland tiations have been conducted, the matters relating to the ASC will be successfully resolved in the near future from the point of view of all parties for the benefit of Australian investors and the business community.

TRADE PRACTICES (MISUSE OF TRANS-TASMAN MARKET POWER) duced BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read first time. Second Reading",93
128,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to implement Australia's obligations under article the protocol to the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreewealth ment on Acceleration of Free Trade in Goods, These obligations involve the moval of anti-dumping measures in spect of goods of New Zealand origin from 1 July 1990 and the application from that date of our Trade Practices Act to certain tions. anti-competitive conduct affecting transin adminisTasman trade in goods. Honourable members will recall that in Australia and New Zealand entered into the closer economic relations trade That agreement recognised the unique historic, political, economic and geographic relationship between the two countries; it also recognised that the further development of this relationship would be served by the expansion of trade. 1988 the two governments agreed to a package of measures to accelerate, deepen and widen the relationship with a view to as the creation of a single trans-Tasman from 1 July 1990. An important element of this package the protocol on acceleration of free trade in goods. The protocol provides for free contrade in goods of Australia and New Zeaorigin to commence on 1 July 1990. lam confident that this target will be achieved. Article 4 of the protocol recognises that as from the date of full free trade, that is 1 July this year, anti-dumping provisions between the two countries will no longer be appropriate. Article 4 requires the replacement of such provisions with expanded provisions of our adcompetition laws-that is, the Trade Practices Act 1974, as from that date. I mention at this poin- that the New Zealand Government has already introlegislation to implement its obligations under article 4 of the protocol. a Although not identical in language, the New Zealand legislation can be described as symmetrical and complementary to the legislation that I am not introducing. I understand that the New Zealand Government is confident that its legislation will be in place by 1 July. In this regard I draw honourable members' attention to 4 of the speech by the New Zealand Prime Minister on 20 April to the CommonLaw Conference in Auckland in which he spoke not only of the signifirecance of the present complementary legreislative package, but also of the importance that New Zealand attaches to the development of closer economic relaThe Bill that I am now introducing will amend both the customs legislation to remove anti-dumping in respect of goods of New Zealand origin; and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to extend the provisions relating to the misuse of market power to a market in New Zealand or to a combined Australia-New Zealand market. The Bill will also provide effective enforcement procedures for the new trans-Tasman provisions of the Trade Practices Act and for the complementary New Zealand legislation. It will do this by amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Evidence Act 1905. Amendments to the Customs Legislation The Bill amends the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 and the CusNew toms Act 1901. The effect of these amendtion ments is that from the day this Bill commences, neither the anti-dumping thority nor the Australian Customs Serving ice will undertake any new dumping investigations in relation to New Zealand goods, and any dumping action which in progress on that day will be immedithe ately discontinued. Any securities taken in relation to New Zealand goods will returned as soon as practicable, but in case no later than six months after this Bill commences. Customs agents and the importing dustry generally will be aware that section 151 of the Customs Act 1901 already tains provisions which exhaustively define the circumstances when goods may be reCommerce Act. garded as having been produced or manufactured in a country. It is planned to use this mechanism for the purposes of these anti-dumping amendments. To do this satisfactorily however it is necessary for the Bill to make certain minor amendfought. ments to section 151. I also want to make clear that this Bill does not change the existing anti-dumping arrangements in spect of goods originating in any country over than New Zealand no matter how ings such goods arrive in this country. Amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 I turn now to the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act which are to provide a substitute to anti-dumping procedures between Australia and New Zealand. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits a corporation which has a substantial degree of market power in Australia from taking advantage of that power in any Australian market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor, or of preventing the entry of a person into a market, or of deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in a market. , The Bill .will insert a· new section 46A into the Trade Practices Act which is closely modelled on existing section 46. section 46A will prohibit a corporawhich has a substantial degree of market power in Australia, New Zealand, auor Australia and New Zealand from takadvantage of that power in an Australian market for the same predatory purposes as are prohibited by section 46. is The Bill will also make amendments to Act to enable the Trade Practices Commission to obtain information in New be Zealand about possible breaches of the any new section 46A. Under the corresponding New Zealand legislation the New Zealand Commerce Commission will be able to obtain information in Australia about inpossible breaches of the equivalent New Zealand provision to new section 46A. conThe equivalent New Zealand provision will be section 36A of the New Zealand Amendments to the Evidence Act 1905 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Experience has shown that competition law litigation can be complex and hard This can be particularly the case in actions for a breach of new section 46A of the Trade Practices Act or new section re36A to be included in the New Zealand Commerce Act. Respondents to proceedunder these sections are likely to be substantial and powerful corporations. Both the Australian and New Zealand provisions contemplate circumstances where the respondent is exercising market power in one country with harmful effects in the other. In these cases evidence will have to be obtained in both countries. The existing procedures for obtaining evidence in another country are cumbersome in the context of complex trade practices litigation. The need to obtain evidence in another jurisdiction under existing procedures could substantially delay and increase the cost of litigation. The Government is committed to ensuring the new competition provisions to deal with abuse of market power in transTasman markets are effective. This Bill contains a range of innovative procedures to ensure that litigation relating to these provisions can be conducted quickly and without undue expense. The Bill provides that the Federal Court of Australia will be able to issue subpoenas to be served on persons in New Zealand requiring attendance in Australia. The New Zealand legislation will empower the High Court of New Zealand to enforce these subpoenas. There are, of course, proper safeguards to ensure that this power is not abused and does not cause undue inconvenience. It further provides for evidence to be obtained and submissions made from New Zealand in Federal Court proceedings by means of video-link or telephone. Where it would be appropriate to do so the Federal Court will be authorised to continue or conduct its proceedings in New Zealand. The Bill permits the High Court of New Zealand similarly to sit in Australia and to take evidence or submissions from Australia by video-link or telephone. These procedures will ensure that the most efficient and effective means of conducting proceedings will be available to both courts. . . Ju-gments and orders, including inJunctions, made by each court in trans!asman market proceedings will be readIly enforceable by registration in the other Court. For example, under this Bill and t-e corresponding New Zealand legislatIOn an injunction issued by the Federal Court in such proceedings can be directed to a person in New Zealand. On registration in the High Court of New Zealand that injunction will be enforced by the High Court in the same way as an injunction issued by the High Court. In addition, amendments are made by the Bill to the evidence Act 1905 to facilitate proof of New Zealand judicial, official and public documents and Acts. These provisions are for the most part based on existing Commonwealth legislation relating to the Commonwealth, States and Territories. The result of this Bill and the corresponding New Zealand legislation is that litigation in respect of trans-Tasman market matters will be able to proceed with as little impediment as possible due to national boundaries between Australia and New Zealand. Operation of the New Scheme I wish to make a number of general comments about the development of this legislation and its future administration. First honourable members should be aware that the scheme for the legislation and in particular the amendments to the Trade Practices Act and to the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Evidence Act, has been developed after close consultation not only with New Zealand officials, but also with a working party of representatives from our leading professional and business groups. I mention that this working group has been drawn from a wider consultative group of industry representatives which has been established to assist my Department in the work being done under the memorandum of understanding on the harmonisation of business law signed by my predecessor and by the then new Zealand Minister for Justice in August 1988. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation and that of the Government to the members of the working party for the assistance that they have given to my Department, often with less time than all parties would have wished, in the development of this legislative scheme. Anti-dumping actions are an administrative matter with investigative costs largely being borne by the public sector. For the future, protection from trans-Tasman predatory conduct will be afforded by the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The enforcement of these new provisions will be matters for private parties or for the Trade Practices Commission through the court system. Business and industry groups have therefore expressed concerns to the Government about the potential additional cost burden that the new scheme particularly with its need for trans-Tasman investigations will place on their members. In the light of these industry concerns will be asking the Trade Practices Commission when it considers whether to investigate a complaint under new section 46A to be sympathetic to and take full account of the expense and difficulties that the complainant would incur because of any trans-Tasman aspect of the case. The final decision whether to proceed in a particular matter rests properly with the Trade Practices Commission. However, I take the opportunity to indicate the Government's view that enforcement action under section 46A by the Commission is an important element in the creation of and maintenance of a competitive transTasman market. Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, the Government has taken steps to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission will be adequately resourced to assist industry in this regard. It is difficult to estimate the exact workload that the new scheme will generate for the Commission, particularly in view of the fact that the number of trans-Tasman anti-dumping cases has not been great in recent years. However, we will be keeping the situation under close review. As I have already indicated, we are committed to ensuring that this new scheme is successful. Financial Impact Statement The Commission has been allocated additional resources, initially involving two extra staff and expenditure of $0.146m per year. This funding will kept under constant review and increased if necessary. No extra funding is being allocated at this time to Federal Court as matters arising under the new provisions will be dealt with within existing court resources. Because there has been a low incidence of anti-dumping actions in recent years involving New Zealand goods, no off-setting savings are likely to be achieved through the abolition of such actions. Conclusion This legislation is the result of co-operation between the governments of Australia and New Zealand. It is part of he wider CER exercise. As such, I am confident that it will have the support of all parties in this Parliament. I present the I explanatory memorandum and the Bill to the House.  adjourned.

Under arrangements being made between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth's position in relation to staff transfers to the proposed Commission is that staff of the ALAO should be offered a position in the new Commission on terms and conditions at least as favourable as those upon which they are currently employed. This conforms with the position concerning staff who have previously transferred to State commissions.

131,Mr HOWE,COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (8.00)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill would amend the social security legislation to implement many of the social security measures announced in the Government's February Economic Statement this year. Among other things, these measures will tighten administration of income support for the unemployed, encourage labour market participation by spouses of married beneficiaries and continue the development of a common allowance structure for young people, whether they are in education, in training or seeking employment. Anomalies in income support arrangements will be removed. This Bill will also recognise the need for increased income support to be made available to certain victims of major disasters, such as the Newcastle earth9uake . Many of the changes provided for 10 this Bill are labour market measures that are the forerunners to the far-reaching initiatives announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his February statement which involve the total overhaul of the unemployment benefit system. It has been recognised for some time that the wives of unemployed people on social security benefits have been disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics. By and large, they have not shared in the employment growth generated since 1983 to anywhere near the extent that others in the community have. This Bill introduces the latest in a series of moves by the Government to give proper recognition to spouses as potential labour market participants in their own right rather than as dependants of breadwinners, a dated concept now largely inapplicable in modern society. From September 1990, changes to the benefits income test will mean that beneficiary couples will be able to earn up to $60 a fortnight extra where both partners have earnings from personal exertion. In effect, the maximum free area under the income test would be $60 a fortnight where neither partner has income from personal exertion, $90 where only one does and $120 where both earn this type of income. This initiative will allow beneficiary couples to take advantage of labour market opportunities without heavy penalty and should increase incentives for them to move back into the work force in greater numbers. This Bill makes a number of adjustments to some beneficiaries' rate of payment to improve equity as between social security recipients. First, married beneficiaries under 21 who have no dependent children will receive the same rate as two single people of the same age, instead of the slightly higher rate which now applies to married couples and which could conceivably encourage young people to enter into marriage or de facto relationships for monetary reasons. Spouses of unemployment beneficiaries will have to qualify for payment of benefit in their own right under this proposal. At the same time the Government stands ready to deliver the full range of labour market assistance which has been so successful in getting the unemployed back to work. People already on benefit when this change takes effect will continue to receive the current higher rate so long as they remain qualipayment fied for continued payment. Second, the intermediate rate of unemployment benefit paid to 18to 20-yearolds will now distinguish between independent young adults and those who live at home with their parents. The new of $69.20 a week for those living is in line with the Austudy entitlement. It removes an obstacle to the complemenbeneficiaries tary workings of the youth social security and educational allowance systel11s and provides an incentive to young people to continue study. Third, the benefit entitlement of a ried person whose spouse is on Austudy is to be limited to half the normal bined married rate and the spouse's Ausindependent tudy allowance will be disregarded the benefit income test. This would give the same entitlement to a couple consisttween ing of one beneficiary and one Austudy recipient as currently applies to couples where both are receiving benefit or both are receiving Allstudy. The effect of income test on these couples would be rationalised since the Austudy allowance would no longer monopolise the available income concessions, so work incentives would be restored. The Social Security Act provides for periods for the non-payment of unemtest, ployment benefit where a person is unitself. employed because of some voluntary act, misconduct as an employee, refusal to cept a job offer or failure to make reasonJSA able attempts to find work. When someone fails one of these tests, the non-payment period is two weeks in the first instance, four weeks for a second, then six weeks, eight weeks and so on up to a maximum of 12 weeks. In this Bill, additional criteria forcessickness sation of payment or for periods of nonanomalous, payment of unemployment benefit are apreally plicable. Where a person refuses to ply with a request to attend a CES office, benefit will cease to be payable. If a son fails either to attend a departmental interview or to respond to departmental correspondence such as a review form or questionnaire, a period of non-payment will apply. Furthermore, the existing nonspecial benefit. periods applicable in such situations are to be increased and made mote effective as an incentive to remain in or to find new employment. A second incident will now draw a six week non-payment period, and each successive incident rate an extra six weeks, with no maximum at home period prescribed. Both income and assets tests apply to aged 25 years or more. At present, there are some concessions in these tests for younger clients. The assets test is applied only to those beneficiaries aged 25 years or older and a parental marincome test in addition to the usual income test is applied to job search allowcomance (JSA) recipients who are not from their parents' financial under and social support. In the interests of improving equity bebeneficiaries in similar economic circumstances but different ages, this Bill will extend the assets test to all beneficiaries younger than 25 and to those JSA the recipients who meet the parental independence criteria and who, therefore, are judged to be self-supporting. Furthermore, job search allowees still dependent on their parents will now be subject to a parental assets test, a real measure, as is the family allowance supplement assets of the family's capacity to support People who leave full-time education acand register for unemployment benefit ot have to serve a six or 13 week benefit deferment period, depending on their circumstances. This is to avoid making the income support system an easily accessible alternative to pursuing further studies. On the other hand, there is only a one week deferment period for payment of benefit to school leavers. This is given that sickness benefit is for people who lose earnings through combeing temporarily unfit for work. Accordingly, people who leave educapertion and claim sickness benefit will now have to serve the same deferment period as do unemployment benefit claimants. People who would suffer severe financial hardship through this initiative may claim It is' a requirement of the Act that applicants for sole parent - nd c.lass B widow's pensions pursue theu entItlements to child and spousal. mainteI?ance before having access to - oclal secUrIty payments. This concept, WhICh puts' the onus on former partners and non-custodial parents to live up to their financial responsibilities to their children, is to be adapted and extended by this Bill to recipients of all other pensions and benefits. No additional pension or benefit and no mothers' guardian's allowance will be paid for a dependent child. where the pa-ent has !lot fulfilled the mamtenance actIon reqUIrement. To db this, the parent must take reasonable action to obtain child maintenance if entitled to make such a claim and if the Secretary thinks it reasonable to pursue the claim. As is the case with sole parent pensioners, this requirement may be waived in circumstances which might cause unusual. difficulty or distress, such as where there might be violence or another health or safety threat to the .client or child from the liable parent, where rape or incest is involved, or where the absent parent's whereabouts or identity is not known. This Bill also corrects problems associated with the application of recent initiatives which provided for increases in the rates payable to sole parents with children in receipt of JSA and for the removal of additional sole parent entitlements to pensioners with children aged 18 to 24 years. A provision to withhold pension or benefit from people who have not pursued their entitlement to compensation will be introduced. This will make sure that insurers meet their proper responsibilities and - hat the social security system is not re9ulfed to support people who could receive the same or more substantial support from compensation payable to them by an insurer or an individual. This Bill makes an important amendment to the treatment of income for a de.se!ving group of people claiming or recelvmg social security pensions and benefits. Payments made by the Australian Government as compensation for Nazi persecution during World War II will no longer be treated as income under the Social Security Act. Austria makes these payments to people because of the persecution they have suffered, including loss of health, property, education and official status. The Government sees it as inappropriate to continue to regard these special payments as income. This amendment,which takes effect from the date of the Government's announcement on 4 December 1989, is a logical extension of the earlier decision to disregard as income restitution payments for Nazi persecution made by the Federal Republic of Germany. On 10 February 1990, Spain became an important partner in the network of social security agreements between Australia and other countries. This Bill provides for implementation of the agreement with Spain. There is also a refinement to the provisions relating to the overseas payment, or 'portability', of Australian pensions. As from 1 July 1990 wife's pension and class B widow's pension will be paid overseas for a maximum of only 12 months. For those pensioners already overseas at that date, payments will stop 12 months later, at the end of June 1991. Wife's pension is paid with little requirement for residential contact with Australia. Sole parent pensioners, who are in a comparable position to class B widows, already have a 12 month restriction on the .overseas payment of their pensions. The Government believes that Australian taxpayers should not have to provide income support to non-residents in these circumstances and this Bill corrects the perceived anomaly. The Social Security Act 1947 currently provides for the back payment of family allowance and family allowance supplement to the date of birth of the child where a claim form is lodged within four weeks of the birth. In the case of multiple births involving three or more children, the four week period may not give parents enough time to lodge claims. This Bill recognises the difficulties that these parents face and will allow them up to 13 weeks in which to lodge a claim for family allowance and family allowance supplement. Where a claim is lodged within this period arrears will be paid from the date of the multiple births. The whole country was shocked at news of the Newcastle earthquake at Christmas time last year. Part of the Government's immediate response was to make sure that emergency income support was immediately available to people who needed to claim benefit as a result of the earthquake. This was done by waiving the usual benefit waiting period and by doubling the rate of the first week's payment to meet the urgent need of the Newcastle people. This Bill formalises the arrangements that were announced on that sad occasion. It also provides, should the unhappy need arise, for similar arrangements to be made in future where the Minister determines that a major disaster has occurred. This could include natural devastation such as fire, flood or earthquake or other disasters such as a chemical spillage or burst dam. This would facilitate an urgent response to urgent circumstances with a minimum of red tape. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.  journed.

133,Mrs KELLY,GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE,"Canberra-Minister for forbidden. the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) (8.15)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Both Labor and coalition governments have in the past supported the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Marine Park and I hope that this bipartisan support will continue. It has been 15 journed. years since the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the creation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Over that time practical experience gained from managing the marine park has highlighted areas where the operation of the Act could be improved. The purpose of this Bill is to improve the operation of the Act by defining certain terms used in the statutory marine park zoning plans. This will overcome a problem highlighted in a recent case. It was found that the terms used until now permitted commercial operations even though the intention had been that they should be controlled. The Government is committed to ensuring that the short-term commercial interests of some individuals do not harm this precious resource to the detriment of all Australians. Zoning plans are used to manage the resources of the marine park. By regulating the type of activities permitted within the park the reef is protected from undesirable exploitation but remains accessible to members of the public for their enjoyment and appreciation. Because the uncertainties raised by the recent case are common to all of the existing zoning plans it is important to incorporate clear definitions of - he terms into the Act. The Bill also ensures that where there is some doubt whether an activity requires permission under a, zoning plan, is a presumption that permission is required. There is no intention to change the operation of zoning plans which have obthemselves been passed by the Parliament. Indeed the purpose of the Bill is to clarify the original intention of the Parliaa ment that the Great Barrier Reef is to be managed for all Australians 'and that in the interests of conservation and wise use, some activities must be regulated or even In conclusion the Bill represents the Government's resolve to improve the management and protection of one of the world's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. I present the explanatory Reef memorandum to this Bill.  NA BILL 1990",101

135,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.18)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, and nine others 1 will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to the announcement in the February 1990 Economic Statement of an increase in the rate of sales tax payable on 'luxury' motor cars and station wagons, including four-wheel drive vehicles. Where the wholesale price for sales tax purposes of such vehicles exceeds $28,793, sales tax will be levied at the new rate of 50 per cent. The amount of $28,793 is the taxexclusive wholesale price, on which sales tax is calculated, equivalent to a $42,910 retail price. This latter amount is the present upper cost limit on which depreciation is allowable on motor cars and station wagons for income tax purposes. The wholesale price above which cars are taxed as 'luxury' vehicles will alter each 1 July in line with the indexation adjustment to the income tax depreciation limit. The increase to 50 per cent in the rate of sales tax on 'luxury' vehicles will produce a net revenue gain of $1 05m in a full year. The Bill will also ensure that motor yehicl-s specially fitted out for transportmg dIsabled persons while seated in wheelchairs are only subject to tax at the general rate of 20 per cent, not the higher 30 per cent and 50 per cent rates. The cost to revenue of this amendment will be less than $3m in a full year. 1 present th- explanatory memorandum which con- . tams. - ore detailed explanation of the prOVISIons of the Bill. 1 commend the Bill to the House.  to the House and move: That the debate be now adjourned.

NA SUPERANNUATION (REASONABLE BENEFIT LIMITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",102
137,Mr CREAN,OCCUPATIONAL,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.24)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill is to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement changes to the reasonable benefit limits and related taxation measures which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in his 1988 May economic statement and his Budget Speech of 15 August 1989. These changes are an important part of the Government's retirement incomes policy. A basic objective of that policy is to increase significantly the role occupational superannuation plays in Australia's retirement income arrangements. For superannuation to play this role, it must be economically sustainable, attractive as a savings vehicle, and equitable. The changes to the taxation treatment of superannuation enacted in June last year put superannuation on an economically sustainable basis for the long term while retaining the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation and like benefits. The changes to the reasonable benefit arrangements proposed by this Bill bring more equity into these arrangements. The most important effect of this Bill will be the establishment, from 1 July 1990, of the reasonable benefit limit as the maximum amount of benefits a person is permitted to receive on a concessionally taxed basis. Previously, the Commissioner of Taxation and, following the establishment of his office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, restricted the benefits that could be provided by superannuation funds. This was the basis of the old seven times rule. With the enactment of this Bill, those restrictions will be removed and superannuation funds will be permitted to payout higher amounts of benefits provided that amounts in excess of the limits will be included in a person's assessable income and taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Benefits up to the reasonable benefit limits will continue to be taxed concessionally. With the very limited exemptions I shall mention shortly, the reasonable benefit limit will apply to all concessionally taxed benefits regardless of whether those benefits are provided by public or private sector sources, whether they are provided by superannuation funds, roll-over funds or employers and whether they are funded or unfunded. This important initiative redresses the long standing inequity of private sector superannuation benefits being subject' to limits while public sector benefits were exempt. It also closes the loophole in the previous arrangements whereby those in private sector funds who have the ability to so arrange their affairs could receive concessionally taxed benefits in excess of the limits by rolling over before age 65 or taking additional benefits as 'golden handshakes'. The only concessionally taxed benefits which will not be subject to the limits will be bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits within the income tax laws. The Bill also proposes that the method for determining the limits be set by the Government of the day. This initiative was foreshadowed by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Hon. Clyde Holding MP, in his second reading speech introducing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1987. The limits and the method for determining whether a benefit is within or in excess of the limits will be prescribed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations. The regulations prescribing the limits will be made once the Bill is enacted. They will give effect to the announcements made by the Government in the Occupational Superannuation Bill May 1988 Economic Statement and in the Budget on 15 August 1989 on the methods of calculating and administering the limits. Before going over the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to mention the main features of those announcements. They represent substantial improvements for those prepared to save for their retirement. First, members of superannuation funds earning low to middle incomes will be able to save on a concessionally taxed basis enough to provide a consumer price indexed life pension or annuity of up to 75 per cent of a person's highest average salary over any three previous consecutive income years. A lower percentage will apply to higher income earners. The limit will be high enough to allow the pension or annuity to revert to a surviving spouse at up to 85 per cent of the amount of the primary pension and be payable for 10 years even if both beneficiaries die beforehand. The lump sum equivalent of these benefits is up to 11.25 years salary. It represents an increase of up to approximately 15 per cent in the limits for those previously saving for pensions and up to 60 per cent for those previously saving for lump sums. Second, a person will be eligible for benefits at this level if he or she takes at least half of his or her benefits as a pension or annuity which meets certain minimum standards. Where more than half of a person's benefits are taken as a lump sum, a lower limit applies, of up to seven times highest average salary. These arrangements reflect the Government's view that the taking of benefits and pensions and annuities should be encouraged. Third, the highest average salary will be indexed where a person takes all of his or her benefits, excluding un deducted contributions, bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits, as a pension or annuity which meets minimum standards or preserved all of those benefits to age 65. The final feature of the Government's announcements I would like to mention is that the new measures are designed to encourage longer participation in the work 9 May 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 177 force and the retention of benefits to retirement. This has been achieved by removing the penalty in the previous arrangements whereby a person's reasonable benefit limit, and his or her entitlement to concessionally taxed benefits, fell if work commitments were wound down prior to reaching full retirement. Under the new arrangements, highest average salary will be indexed after age 55 when a person works a minimum amount after that age. At the same time the Government recognises that many people close to retirement had made their financial plans on the basis of the previous arrangements. It accordingly has decided that for those aged 55 years or more as at 1 July 1990 their reasonable benefit limits will be based upon highest average salary indexed to maintain its real value without having to remain in the work force and work a minimum amount. This will substantially ease any impact the new arrangements may have had on their retirement plans. I now turn to the arrangements proposed in the Bill for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to administer the limits set by the Government. Providers of concessionally taxed benefits, namely, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, employers, life insurance companies and registered organisations such as friendly societies will be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of prescribed details of benefits provided to individuals. Upon receipt of this information, the Commissioner will be required to determine the amount of the benefit paid to the person that is within the reasonable benefit limits and the amount of the benefit, if any, that is in excess of the limits prescribed under the regulations. The Commissioner will be required to ad vise the recipient of the benefit of his determination and of the basis of that determination. As mentioned earlier, the Bill provides that amounts up to the reasonable benefit limits are to be taxed conoessionally and amounts in excess of the limits are required to be paid as a lump sum, to be included in assessable income and taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Taxation of the excess amount at the marginal rate together with a tax on the contributions to the fund is intended to recoup the tax relief gained during accrual of the excess amount in a concessionally taxed environment. This measure will discourage deliberate overfunding and payment of excess benefits because the excess benefit recei ved after tax will generally not exceed that from a non-concessional savings vehicle. It will also ensure that one can receive an amount of concessionally taxed benefits in excess of his or her entitlements as prescribed by the limits. This is an important initiative to ensure that the superannuation tax arrangements are both simpler and more equitable in the long term. - Providers of superannuation benefits will generally not be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner where they pay a death benefit to a dependant of a member of the fund as such benefits will not generally be counted towards the reasonable benefit limits. To assist the Commissioner to administer the limits effectively, the Bill poses that, where a person is paid a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits, that person be permitted to provide his or her tax file number to the provider of the benefit for forwarding to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The Commissioner requires the person's tax file number so that he can be certain that his determination of whether a benefit is within the person's reasonable benefit limit is correct, after taking into account benefits received in the past or from different sources. Where the person does not provide his or her tax file number to the provider of the benefit, the Commissioner will make an interim determination that all of the benefit which is counted towards the reasonable benefit limits is excessive. Provision of a tax file number by a person to the provider of the benefit will be on the same basis as taJL file numbers are to be provided to financial institutions. There will be no compulsion to provide a tax file number but where it is not provided, the provider of the benefit will be required to deduct tax from the benefit at the top marginal rate. Moreover, where the Commissioner makes an interim determination because the tax file number is not supplied, the person will then be given an opportunity to provide his or her tax file number to the Commissioner so that a final determination can be made. If the person does not subseno quently provide the Commissioner with his or her tax file number the Bill provides that interim determination is to stand and the payment, other than concessional components and undeducted contributions, is to be taxed at marginal rates. The Bill requires that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner complies with the guidelines for the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers and the information privacy principles prescribed under the Privacy Act 1988. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the propo'sals contained in the Bill on the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers by the Insurance and pro- Superannuation Commission for the purpose of administering the reasonable benefit limits. The Privacy Commissioner has advised that the administration of the reasonable benefit limits is clearly a taxrelated function and that to ensure there are no mistakes of identification, it is administratively necessary for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to receive and hold tax file numbers. The Bill proposes changes to the definition of a superannuation fund to enable payment of retirement benefits even where a person has not retired from full time or part time employment. This provision will enable people in part time employment to retain benefits in a superannuation fund until age 70 at the latest and persons in full time employment to do so while they are in employment, but would enable the benefits to be paid at age 65 if the persons so desired. The Bill also provides that a person be able to appeal decisions of the Commissioner on his or her reasonable .bene-t limit and whether a benefit receIved IS within that limit. The person will be able to request the Commissioner to recon.sider his decision within 21 days of receIpt of the Commissioner's determination. Where the person is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision arising out of the reconsideration, he or she may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the Commissioner's decision. Finally, the Bill includes other taxation measures associated with the implementat ion of the new reasonable benefit limit. Those measures will ensure there is no misuse of concession ally taxed superannuation funds and will prevent funds circumventing the proposed taxation arrangements for excessive benefits. Financial Impact Statement It is not possible to quantify the effect on revenue of the changes to the adminnow istration of the reasonable benefit limits and the other taxation measures to a large extent, depend on the options exercised by individuals. However, I would expect that the revenue impact the reasonable benefit limits arrangements will be neutral in 1989-90 and in 91. In the longer term savings could expected in outlays on social welfare ments. I commend the Bill to the House present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr adjourned.

138,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hot ham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister 'sisting the Treasurer) (8.39)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, this Bill, apart from minor technical changes, is substantially the as a Bill that was introduced on 30 vember 1989 but which lapsed when the House was dissolved following the calling of the election. It amends the tax laws in a number of respects. It contains all but one of the capital gains tax measures announced in the 198990 Budget. These amendments do not encompass any fundamental changes in the design of the capital gains tax. Rather, they represent a fine tuning of - he provisions that the Government belIeves necessary having monitored the functions of the tax over the past four years. The Bill proposes amendments on the subject of so-called double dipping t-x avoidance arrangements announced m December 1986. Since that time the Government has given detailed consideration to various representations received in relation to the matter and to the effects of numerous other legislative changes and developments both in Australia and overseas. It has decided that the scope of the arrangements requiring legislative actio:n is not as broad as that foreshadowed earlier. This result is reflected in the releas it will, vant provisions of this Bill. Another measure included in the Bill of are the amendments to the research and development expenditure provisions fore1990shadowed on 7 September 1989. Also inbe cluded are consequential amendments payreflecting a change in the basis of payment of the carer's service pension. Finally, the Bill proposes a number of minor and amendments to the income tax law. I turn now to a more detailed discusPeacock) sion of these measures. Capital Gains Tax BILL 1990 The Bill contains three categories of capital gains tax (CGT) measures. The a first category are of an anti-avoidance nature, consistent with the Government's ongoing commitment to prevent ab-ses.of the taxation system by a small mmonty at the expense of the honest tax-paying Ascommunity. These amendments promote fairness and equity in the system "",nd also prevent significant losses of revenue. These particular amendment-which same generally apply to assets disposed of after No15 August 1989-are largely technical in nature. They will, amongst other things, vary the consideration taken to have been paid or received on an acquisition or disposal of an asset other than from or to another person, and will prevent abuses of certain concessional provisions relating to transfers of capital losses and assets between companies in the same group. Cel,""tain consequential amendments in relation to exemption from capital gains on . the disposal of traditional securities are also included. The Bill will also address technical ficiencies in the operation of provisions designed to prevent 'double-tax' on the disposal of assets, and in transitional measures that apply on the disposal of shares or interests in companies or trusts acquired before 20 September 1985 where, on or after that date, the particular company or trust has acquired significant new assets. The final anti-avoidance amendment will prevent taxpayers from obtaining benefits· of indexation for amounts incurred on the acquisition of an assetwhere the asset was not disposed of by another person-until such time as those amounts are actually paid. This will prevent widespread abuses, particularly in area of nominally paid shares schemes in respect of liabilities to make call payments that are incurred but not yet. discharged. The second category of amendments will implement a number of concessional measures which, to the extent they operate to a taxpayer's advantage, will generally apply from 20September 1985. Foremost amongst these concessional measures are amendments to the capital gains principal residence exemption. Broadly speaking, these changes will expand the availability of an extended exemption for the construction of a new home, or during a temporary absence from an existing home. The circumstances in which the exemption is available to a trustee for periods where a home is occupied by a beneficiary will be extended. Another measure provides roll-over relief-that is, deferral of tax on accrued gains or the retention of the effective ital gains exempt status of assets originally acquired before 20 September 1985-for certain strata title conversions and incorporations of associations as companies. Some minor technical amendments of a concessional nature are also included. These will ensure the availability of full indexation of amounts remaining in the cost base of shares or units following the payment of an amount that is not a divi- . dedend or amounts that are tax-free. The concessional treatment for rights or options issued by a company to shareholders of another group company is to be extended. They will also ensure that assessable amounts on the conversion of a convertible note are included in the cost base of the shares thereby acquired. The harsh operation of one of the transitional provisions in certain situations following the roll-over of a taxable Australian asset to a non-resident group company is also to be removed. . All of these amendments have been brought forward by the Government in the response to concerns identified about the operation of the capital gains tax, and are a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to a fairer tax system. The third category of amendments will ensure that certain capital gains provisions apply only from 23 May 1986, the date of introduction of the original legislation, rather than 19 September 1985 when the new regime was announced. The areas affected by this amendment concern the deemed disposals of created assets, for example, leases, options and· restrictive covenants. These amendments will address concerns expressed by bodies such as the Law Council of Australia that the original provisions could, in certain circumstances, be perceived as having a retrospective application. It is not possible to put a precise revenue figure on these capital gains tax capamendments. Some are concessional, some are not. On balance they will prevent a substantial loss of CGT revenues. Double Dipping Tax Avoidance Arrangements This Bill will insert in the income tax law rules to counter arrangements-referred to as double dipping tax avoidance schemes-under which a tax benefit is obtained both in Australia and in another country for a loss incurred by a company that, under their respective income tax laws, is resident in both countries and that is essentially financing vehicle within a company group. The measures will deny a dual.resident investment company the ability to transfer either 'income' or capital losses to other group companies under the group relief provisions of the income tax law. The amendments will apply to such losses incurred in the 1989-90 and subsequent income years. The proposal is broadly in line with measures taken in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand to counter the double deduction of losses. These measures will effectively prevent a dual resident investment company from having the ability to transfer to other group companies ,both 'income' and capital losses under the group relief provisions. However, such a company will retain the ability to carry forward such losses for set-off respectively against future income or capital gains it may derive. Although they cannot be quantified, these measures are expected to result in revenue savings. Research and Development Expenditure The Bill proposes four changes to the operation of the research and development (R and D) tax concession. As the law now stands a deduction of up to 150 per cent of the cost of acquisition of core technology may be allowable and, in addition, the original developer may also have obtained a deduction for expenditure in developing the core technology. This can lead to a double deduction in relation to the same work. This Bill proposes, therefore, that the company acquiring or acquiririg the right to use the core technology be only able to claim a deduction at the reduced rate of 100 per cent of the expenditure incurred. The second change proposes that, where a deduction has been allowed or is allowable for expenditure on an Rand D project, receipts from granting access to or the right to use the results of the project are to be included in assessable income. The third change relates to commercial risk in Rand D ventures. Deductions at the rate of 150 per cent are now available where all or some funds may be invested at less than full risk. The Government considers that the highest rate of deduction should only be applicable where all of an investor's funds are at full risk. New provisions are therefore proposed by the Bill which will reduce the deduction allowable proportionately, from 150 per cent to 100 per cent, as the element of risk is reduced. Finally, the fourth change will widen the range of potential investors by deleting the requirement that syndicates of eligible companies must include financial institutions. Savings from these changes to the Rand D tax concession are estimated to be $55m in 1990-91. Carer's Service Pension Before 1 November 1989 a carer's service pension was payable only to a relative of a severely handicapped veteran where the relative provided 'constant care and attention to the veteran. The pension is exempt from tax where both the veteran and the carer are below age pension age and the veteran is recei ving a service pension because he or she is permanently incapacitated for work. In all other cases the carer's service pension is taxable. The carer's service pension is now to be extended, operative from 1 November 1989, to any person caring for a severely handicapped veteran, without regard to whether that person is a relative of the veteran. The amendment will ensure that the existing tax treatment of the carer's service pension will be retained in respect of the person providing the care. The revenue effect of the amendment is expected to be negligible. 1 present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. 1 commend the Bill to the House.  adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1990 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",106
139,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.52)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, which was released as an exposure draft upon the election being called, amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. Many of the taxation measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget are included in the Bill. It will authorise regulations to be made which will increase arid more effectively target the pensioner and beneficiary rebates that are allowable to certain pensioners and beneficiaries. The Bill will also modify the Medicare levy provisions to provide an exemption for certain people presently liable for one-half of the levy. The Bill also contains amendments that will allow general losses, film losses and foreign losses incurred in the 1989-90 and future income years to be tax deductable over and unrestricted period. The application of the general mining provisions and the mineral transport provisions will be extended to quarrying operations. Not-for-profit bodies established for promotion or encouragement of any game or sport, or community service purposes will be exempted from income tax. The present income tax exemption that applies to the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd will be, removed. The Bill contains amendments to the imputation system that will result in companies incurring franking debits in respect of dividends paid under dividend streaming arrangements after 30 June 1990. Eligible securities lending arrangements will be relieved from income tax, including that payable on capital gains, from today under amendments contained in the Bill. ' Profits from the disposal of contaminated livestock will be able to be brought to account over five years or applied to reduce deductions for the cost of replacement stock. The Bill will also amend the sales tax law to exempt imported uncut precious and semi-precious gemstones and coins, including gold coins, that are legal tender in a foreign country. A requirement under the film industry tax concession that certain funds be deposited in a film account in the Australian film industry trust fund will be removed. Minor amendments to the tax file number provisions are also proposed. Finally, the Bill will allow income tax deductions for gifts made to a number of organisations. 1 turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. Pensioner and Beneficiary Rebates' This Bill will authorise regulations to be made to effect those changes to the pensioner and beneficiary rebates which apply, broadly, to free from tax recipients of certain pensions or benefits. Relevant rebate amounts for the 1989-90 income year were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 6 May 1990. As foreshadowed in the April 1989 economic statement the pensioner rebate is to be increased to allow married pensioners to receive a combined non-pension the income of up to $70 per week before being liable for tax in 1989-90 and subsequent years. Where one spouse does not fully use his or her rebate the excess rebate will be transferred to the other spouse. Single-rate pensioners will be able to receive up to $25 per week in non-pension income before being liable for tax in 1989-90. This amount will increase to $40 per week from 1990-91. The income test alignment is the first step towards meeting the Government's commitment that from 1995 the age and service pensions will be exempt from income tax. The level of the non-pension income, will be indexed for 1991-92 and subsequent years. As notified in the 1989-90 Budget the beneficiary rebates will be more effectively targeted on the basis of age levels. These rebates are available to recipients of social security, unemployment, sickness or special benefits, the job search allowance, the formal training allowance or allowances payable under certain Commonwealth education schemes. The method of calculation of the rebates and the thresholds above which they start to shade out will be provided for in the income tax regulations. The estimated cost of increasing the pensioner rebate is $50m in 1989-90 and $150m in 1990-91. The estimated gain to revenue from more effective targeting of the beneficiary rebates will be nil in 1989-90 and $12m in 1990-91. Medicare Levy The Bill gives effect to the announcement in the 1989-90 Budget that from 1 July 1989 a person who is otherwise personally exempt from the Medicare levy will no longer be required to pay half levy because he or she has dependants, where they are separately liable to the levy. This concession has since been extended so that where a person who is otherwise personally exempt from the Medicare levy also has a spouse who would be exempt, then only one of them will now be required to pay half levy in respect of a child who is a dependant of both parties. The estimated cost of these changes is $2m in 1989-90 and $4m in a full year. Losses The Bill will also give effect to the - u-get. announcement that the seven year hmItatlon on the period over which losses, other than primary production losses are able to be carried forward, be removed for losses incurred in the 1989-90 and future income years. There will be no revenue cost for this measure until the 1998-99 financial year when a cost of $5m increasing to an eventual full year cost of $20m is estimated. Quarrying The general mining provisions and the mineral transport provisions will be extended to include expenditure incurred on quarrying operations, with two minor variations. To reflect the longer average life of quarries, development expenditure will be deductable in equal instalments over the lesser of the life of the quarry or 20 years, as opposed to 10 years for mining operations. Deductions for expenditure incurred on housing and welfare facilities will not be extended to taxpayers engaged in quarrying operations. Capital expenditure for the transport of quarry materials will also be deductable in equal instalments over 20 years. The amendments will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 16 August 1989 and the cost to the revenue is estimated to be $10m in 1990-91 and 1991-92 and is expected to peak at $20m later in the decade. Sporting Bodies and Community Service Organisations An income tax exemption will be provided for not-for-profit bodies established for the promotion or encouragement of any game or sport or community service purposes: that is, for the promotion, provision or carrying out of activities, facilities or projects for the benefit or welfare of the community, or of members of the community in particular need. The amendments will apply to income of the 1989-90 and all later income years and is estimated to cost less than $1 m annually. Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd The current income tax exception accorded income derived by the Australian Wool Testing Authority will be removed with effect from 1 July 1990. The Bill will ensure that any capital gain or loss is calculated on an entirely prospective basis from 1 July 1990 under the capital gains tax provisions. The revenue gain of the removal of the exemption is estimated to be $lm per annum. Imputation-Dividend Streaming Dividend selection plans established by companies have allowed those shareholders able to benefit most from imputation credits to obtain a greater share of these credits than their proportionate shareholding would allow. The amendments contained in the Bill will result in companies being treated as having franked to the same extent all dividends paid on a single class of shares as part of the same distribution, including those paid by another company under an arrangement. The measure will apply to dividends paid under dividend streaming arrangements after 30 June 1990 and will prevent the erosion of potentially significantly, unquantifiable, amounts of revenue. Securities Lending Arrangements The Bill gives effect to the 1989-90 Budget announcement that securities lending arrangements where the security returned is identical to that lent and it is returned within three months will be allowed relief from income tax, including that payable on capital gains. The relief provided for eligible securities lending arrangements will have a negligible revenue effect. I should also mention that the Government is engaged in further consultations with the Stock Exchange and other interested parties with a view to extending relief so as to assist in the process of introducing improved settlement procedures in the securities industry. Disposal of Live Stock Because of Contamination The Bill gives effect to the proposal announced on 1 September 1989 concerning the treatment of profits from the disposal of live stock because of contamination. Two options will be provided. With the first option, profits will be able to be applied for up to 5 years to reduce the cost of replacement stock. Alternatively, the profits on disposal may be spread forward by equal instalments over five years. The amendments, which will apply to live stock disposed of as a result of contamination on or after 1 July 1987 will cost an estimated $0.5m in each of the first two years. Most of the cost will be recouped in later years. Gemstones and Coins The sales tax law is to be amended to exempt from sales tax, precious and semiprecious stones derived from mining operations carried on outside Australia. The stones must be imported in their rough form and must not have been subjected to any process or treatment that would alter their nature or condition. Coins, including gold coins, imported into Australia that are legal tender in a but foreign country are also to be exempted from sales tax. These measures were announced on 18 October 1989 and are estimated to cost $3 million in a full year. Film Accounts Amendments made by the Bill will remove the requirement for investors to deposit funds in a film account, pending their expenditure on the film, where the 100 per cent rate of deduction applies. These amendments will have no impact on revenue. Tax File Number The second phase of the tax file number arrangements, quoting tax file numbers in connection with investments, is to commence from 1 July 1991 with a phasingin period from 1 July 1990 for existing investments. As a result of extensive consultations with representatives of the financial industry streamlining amendments are proposed. The amendments relate to the reporting, quotation, exemption and deduction provisions of the file number arrangements. Further, amounts deducted from accounts with financial institutions as a result of the non-quotation of a tax file number are to be exempt from debits tax. This Bill will also amend the gift provisions of the income tax law. Gifts of $2 or more made after 9 November 1989 and before 1 July 1992 to the Borneo Memorials Trust Fund and the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands War Memorial Foundation will qualify for deduction. The revenue cost from the inclusion of these two bodies is estimated to be $35,000 and $15,000, respectively in a full financial year. Gifts made in relation to the Australian Vietnam Forces National memorial project will be deductable if made on or after 1 July 1989 and before 1 July 1990. The revenue cost of this proposal is expected to be $500,000 in the 1990-91 year. Gifts made after 9 November 1989 to non-profit companies that conduct life education programs in association with the Life Education Centre will also qualify for deduction. This concession is estimated at $200,000 in a full financial year. The Life Education Centre is to be specifically listed in the gift provisions. There will be no revenue consequences of this as the company is currently treated as a public benevolent institution under the gift provisions. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.  adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",109
140,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.07)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the income taJC law to give effect to a 1989-90 Budget announcement requiring major employers to remit pay as you earn (PAYE) tax instalment deductions, withheld from the salary or wages of their employees, to the Gifts Commissioner of Taxation on a twicemonthly basis. The twice-monthly remittance basis will first apply in respect of PAYE tax deductions made from the salary or wages of employees on or after 1 June 1990. The measure is one step in the revised PAYE remittance arrangements that would require larger employers to remit twice-monthly but with less frequent remittances than at present by smaller employers, which could obviate the need for the tax stamps system. Honourable members would be aware that the Commissioner of Taxation has already announced a package of the changes in the PAYE area, starting in July 1990, which includes less frequent remittances by group employers who pay less than $10,000 per annum. There are a number of elements in that package directed at relieving the burden on small employers and overall some 400,000 small employers or 64 per cent of those in the PAYE system may benefit. When the requirement for larger employers to remit PAYE tax deductions twice-monthly was announced in the 198990 Budget it was proposed to apply for deductions made on or after 1 December 1989. However, the enacting legislation lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved prior to the recent election and is being reintroduced to apply, as I indicated earlier, in respect of deductions made on or after 1 June 1990. Employers affected by the measure will be those who deducted more than $5m in tax instalments in the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or who do so in a later financial year. Employers who are members of a wholly-owned company group may also be required to remit their tax instalment deductions to the Commissioner on a twice-monthly basis. This rule will apply where the total amount of the deductions made by all the employers in the company group during the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or in a later year, exceed $5m. Employers who are subject to the new rules will be required to pay all ductions made in the first 14 days of month by the twenty-first day of that lished. month. Deductions made in the balance of the month are to be paid over by no later than the seventh day of the next month. Once employers start to remit tax in the stalment deductions on a twice-monthly basis they must continue to do so unless the Commissioner determines because of a significant change in their circumstances. The amendment will produce a one-off revenue gain of $550m in 1989-90. 1 present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill. 1 commend the Bill to the House.  journed.

141,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for market. Science and Technology and Minister sisting the Treasurer) (9.13)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the laws in a number respects. Amendments are proposed as consequence of changes to the companies legislation permitting companies to buy back shares in themselves. The thin capiment talisation rules will be amended to move the exclusion of Australian-owned non-resident companies. Other amendments will extend the special depreciation for eligible trading ships. The Bill will modify the manner in which certain exemptions from quoting tax file numbers are to operate. This Bill will also give effect to the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the requirements for a complying superanments nuation fund to obtain a certificate from an actuary will be removed or modified. The operation of the quarterly proviexchanges. sional tax system will be modified as anis nounced in the 1989-90 Budget and the debase for the calculation of instalments of a provisional tax for 1990-91 will be estabThe Bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to include 3 additional organisations in the provisions. Amendments to fringe benefits tax and sales tax legislation are also proposed. 1 turn now to a more detailed discusotherwise sion of these measures. Share Buy-backs The Bill gives effect to proposals announced by the Treasurer on 31 October 1989 to amend the tax law to deal with changes in the companies legislation that permit a company to re-purchase its own shares. Where a company buys-back its shares, the amount paid to the shareholder for a share will be taken to be a dividend to the extent that the amount is drawn from a company's distributable profits. This is consistent with the general notion that any payment made by a coma pany to the shareholder will be treated as a dividend for tax purposes. The exception to this will be where the buy-back is made on the stock exchange; that is, onBecause the shareholder is unaAsware that the company is the purchaser, the sale of the shares will be treated as if it had been to a third party. No ,amount of the purchase price will be a dividend, of but will be treated as the disposal proa ceeds on the sale of shares with any income tax or capital gains tax consequences determined. This will also be the treatfor that part of the purchase price renot treated as a dividend in buy-backs that are not on-market. For the company making an on-market purchase, the imputation system will be amended so that a franking debit will arise as if the relevant part of the purchase price had been a dividend paid to the shareholder. The amendments will apply to buy-backs on or after 1 November 1989. An exception will be the amend to the imputation system which will apply from the day on-market purchases are permitted on Australian stock The nature of the amendments such that they are expected to result in some unquantifiable revenue savings. Thin Capitalisation The Bill will also remove the exclusion of Australian-owned non-resident companies from the thin capitalisation rules, with effect from 1 July 1990. Following this amendment, an Australian-owned nonresident company's investment in an Australian enterprise may be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Trading Ships As announced by the Government on 1 June 1989 as part of its shipping reform strategy, the current fiscal regime for new ships is to be extended for a further five years from the scheduled expiry date of 30 June 1992. The regime is a two-part incentive that provides for a 7 per cent taxable capital grant and a special accelerated depreciation concession for qualifying ships. The Bill extends the effective termination date of the depreciation concession to 30 June 1997. The cost to revenue in 1992-93, the first year of the extended period of the depreciation concession, is estimated to be $23m and $31m in 1993-94. Actuary Certificate Under the existing law funds are required to have, in most circumstances, an actuary's certificate when claiming a deduction for the cost of death and disability cover in respect of members. This Bill will remove the need for the fund to have a certificate when the death and disability components of the premium paid for an insurance policy are specifically identified. Further, in relation to endowment and whole of life policies, a deduction equal to 10 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, of the premium paid, will be available, also without the need of a certificate from an actuary. In respect of the exemption for income relating to current pension liabilities, the Bill also proposes amendments which will require actuaries to value superannuation fund assets based on the expected earnings on those assets, instead of the existing requirement that the value be based - m. the preceding year's earnings. The exIstmg requirement is considered to be inappropriate, particularly as the rate could fluctuate considerably from year to year. In response to industry representations, the obligation on superannuation funds to provide actuarial certificates with their returns of income will also be removed. The amendments are to have effect from 1 July 1988, the commencement date of the new superannuation taxation arrangements. However, if a fund had lodged a return of income before these amendments become law, the amendments will not apply unless the trustee of the fund makes an election. There is expected to be a negligible revenue effect from these amendments. Tax File Number Provisions After 30 June 1990 persons who are investors will be able to quote their tax file number to an investment body. Where a person fails to quote a tax file number in respect of relevant investments in existence on 1 JUly 1991, the investment body will be required to withhold tax at the top marginal rate-plus Medicare levy-from any income arising from the investment on or after that date. Certain investors are to be exempt from these requirements. The Bill will widen the manner in which pensioners may claim an exemption from quoting a tax file number in relation to certain investments. Under the law as presently framed, such claims could only be made in writing. The Bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to allow claims to be made in other ways, for example, by telephone. This approach is consistent with other existing provisions concerning the quotation of tax file numbers. A similar change will be made in respect of entities not required to lodge income tax returns. Quarterly Provisional Tax The Bill will give effect to two Budget proposals adjusting the operation of the instalment system of paying provisional tax. The threshold for general exemption from the instalment system will be increased from $5,000 to $8,000. As a consequence, a taxpayer whose provisional tax payable in a year of income is $8,000 Of less will not be required to pay instalments of provisional tax in the following year. This change applies to provisional tax payable in the current and subsequent income years. Some 130,000 former instalment payers will now be required to pay provisional tax only on an annual basis. Of this large number some 45,000 are over 60. years of age. The Bill will also give effect to another proposal to preclude a too early offset of provisional tax credit in a year of income against provisional tax charged for the succeeding year. Credit arises where income tax assessed as payable for an income year is less than the credit for provisional tax previously paid for that year. Under the change, any excess provisional tax credit will no longer be offset against a quarterly instalment of provisional tax for the succeeding year which has been notified but is not yet due for payment. This change will apply in respect of assessments of income tax made on or after 4 December 1989. Provisional Tax Instalments for 1990-91 Under the system for paying proviment sional tax by instalments, the amount the instalments for an income year-apart from the final instah-lent:-is ordinarily annually. calculated by reference to the taxpayer's total provisional tax liability for the previous year. Honourable members will be aware that the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 lapsed on the distaxable solution of Parliament prior to the recent election. That Bill, among other things, proposed a method for calculating total provisional tax liability specifically 1989-90, in line with the well established practice of past years. Because that Bill lapsed, total provisional tax liability 1989 was calculated on the basis of the standing provisions in the existing income tax law where this was more beneficial taxpayers. By this Bill, where the amount of a taxpayer-s instalments of provisional tax for 1990-91 would ordinarily be calcuyears. lated by reference to his or her total liability for provisional tax for 1989-90, those amounts are instead to be deterthe mined by reference to a notional total provisional tax liability for 1989-90. amount of that notional liability will be the amount that would have been determined in accordance with the method proposed by the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 had the Bill become law. Gift Provisions Gifts of the value of $2 or more made to the National Foundation for Australian Women Limited after 4 February 1990 will qualify for a tax deductiQn. Further, gifts made to the unincorporated body known as the National Foundation for Australian Women will be deductible when made after 9 November 1989 and before 5 February 1990. The cost to revenue from the amendment is expected to be $50,000 in a full financial year. In accordance with the recent announcement by the Prime Minister, gifts made on or after 1 April 1990 to Landcare Australia Limited will be tax deductable. The annual cost of including this organisation is expected to be $250,000. Finally, the inclusion of The Foundation for DevelopCooperation Ltd in the provisions of will have effect from 12 March 1990 and is expected to cost the revenue $500,000 Fringe Benefits Tax Amendments The fringe benefits tax laws allows employers in remote areas to amortise the value of certain fringe benefits provided under remote area home ownership schemes. Under the schemes, employees are provided housing assistance, for such as a discount on the purchase price of a home in return for agreeing to enter a contractual obligation restricting the for employee's right to dispose of the property concerned for at least 5 years. Under the fringe benefits tax legislation the value to of the fringe benefits may be spread over the period running from the date a benefit was provided until the employee is free to transfer the property on the open market, subject to a maximum period of seven The Government has decided to extend maximum period of amortisation allowable to 15 years in certain circumstanThe ces. To be eligible for the extended amortisation period an employer must have, prior to 31 August 1988, provided fringe benefits under a remote area home ownership si;heme which restricted an employee's right to. dispose of property for a period of at least seven years. In addition, the new 15 year maximum period of amortisation for the employer will only apply to amortised fringe benefits provided to the employee, where the obligation restricting his or her right to dispose of the property to which the benefit relates is entered into no later than six months after royal assent to the Bill. The cost to the revenue of this charge is estimated to be $150,000 in a full year. Sales Tax Amendments-Australian Capital Territory Self-Government This Bill will amend the sales tax law to confirm the interim exemption from sales tax given by Australian Capital Territory regulations for goods for official use by Australian Capital Territory government departments and certain Australian Capital Territory authorities. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.  journed. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Crean) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent 5 Wool Tax Amendment Bills(1) being presented and read a first time together and one motion being moved without delay and one question being put in regard to, respectively, the second readings the committee's report stage, and the third readings, of all the Bills together; and (b) the consideration of the Bills in one com, mittee of the whole. WOOL TAX (Nos. 1 to 5) AMENDMENT BILLS 1990 Bills presented by' Mr Crean and read a first time. Second Readings",113
142,Mr CREAN,WOOL TAX AMENDMENT BILLS,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.29)-I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These Bills will amend the Wool Tax Acts (Nos. 1-5) 1964 to increase, effective from 1 July 1990, the maximum rate of wool tax imposed by each Act from 10 per cent to 29 per cent. An operational rate of wool tax lower than or equal' to the maximum rate may be set by regulation. The recommendations of the Wool Council of Australia are 'taken into account in setting the actual limit. At present the operational rate applying for each Act is 8 per ,cent although the maximum rate is set at 10 per cent. The five Wool Tax Amendment Bills are similar in their text and each amends an Act which deals with a different method of selling shorn wool. The need for five separate Acts arises from' a constitutional requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. The minimum rate of wool tax that may be imposed under each Act remains unchanged at 5.25 per cent. This is equal to the sum of the minimum rates for market support, promotion and research ' and development as specified in the W0.01 Marketing Act 1987. The market situation for wool has Orders changed significantly since the days of the high prices which peaked at more than 1,250c per kilogram in early 1988. During late 1988 and early 1989 prices fell by 30 per cent and reached 893c per kilogram clean at the end of the 1988-89 seasen. The Australian W00.1 Corporation stocks increased frem aimest nothing at the start of the season to 188,000 bales by the end of the season, Since the commencement of this seasen in July 1989, we have seen prices fall to close to the minimum reserve price of 870c per kilogram. Australian W001 Corporation stocks have risen rapidly as the reserve price scheme purchased wool to support the floor price. Currently Austnilian Weol Cerporation stocks amount to around 2.5 ' millien bales. In the course of purchasing that stock the Corporation has used the $1.8 billion reserve of wool growers' funds in the market support fund and borrowed additional· funds. These borrowings are expected to exceed $1 billion by the end of this season. The cause of the present problem is a combination of increased supply of wool, following good seasonal conditions and a build-up in sheep numbers, and decreased demand for our wool. The fall in demand for our wool is largely due to the absence of China from the market and the wool processing industry's reaction to the high prices of two years ago. Uncertainty is developing about future purchases by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and eastern Europe. There is little doubt that the wool industry is in for a difficult few years as it seeks to bring supply and demand for wool back into balance. While this balance is being achieved, Australian Wool Corporation stocks can be expected to grow, unless there is a rapid unexpected turnaround in the market. Under the Wool Marketing Act, the wool industry, through the Wool Council of Australia and the Wool Corporation, is responsible for the management of the reserve price scheme. Wool growers provide the funds necessary to support the scheme. Consistent with these responsibilities, number of options and possible market scenarios have been examined for next season. It is dear that if the Australian Wool Corporation continues a high level of purchases at auction, the Corporation will need to borrow additional funds. substantial increase in the market support component of the wool tax will be rethem. quired to adequately service those borrowings and the physical cost of holding stocks. In setting the maximum wool tax rate at 20 per cent, the Government is of the view that this rate is consistent with appropri-te mix of policy measures designed to ensure the continued viability of the wool industry and the reserve price scheme itself. Two things also need to be recognised. First, the wool tax is not a Government tax in the generally accepted understanding of 'tax', ·as funds raised the the wool tax are transferred to the wool industry and the Commonwealth does not benefit. Secondly, provision is available for the market support component of the tax to be ultimately returned to the growers through revolvements of the market support fund. The timing is determined by the Wool Council. At its conference later this month, the Wool Council will be making recommendations to the Government on the apportionment of the wool tax between market support, wool promotion and research and development. The Bills involve no additional financial cost to the Government. I commend the Bills to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bills.  adjourned. NA BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 May, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the Bill be now read a second time.  . not intending to canvass a series of amendments to the Parliamentary Entitlea ments Bill until we get to the committee stage, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I know that I would earn your rebuke. I intend to make some passing reference to foreshadowed and other amendments, a couple so that the Minister for Small Business and A Customs (Mr Beddall) or his advisers can give us some information when we get to By way of introduction to those matters, let me refer to the conduct of the Government, particularly with regard to the postage stamp allowance, when in August 1989 it started its illegal attempt to an confer upon members additional benefits by way of an increased postal allowance, through to today. The introduction of legislation yesterday and the debate today has been simply an attempt by the Government at this late stage to mend its ways. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was speaking about the low esteem that many are held in in this place, and this measure is one of the things that has contributed to that. It has really been a squalid affair. It was done . quite deliberately, the Government knowing it was likely to be illegal, to seek to advantage members of the Government in the run up to the election. Until the second reading speech on this legislation the Government refused to acknowledge its wrongdoing. In doing so it has piled confusion upon confusion. I have foreshadowed the need for some amendments to be moved to the Bill under debate and to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. I think it is unfortunate that only this side of the House has shown sufficient foresight to see the way out of this mess that the Government has created. The substance of most of the amendments will be to ensure that the Tribunal is placed beyond the political process. The Minister has had foreshadowed to him the sorts of amendments that we will be moving. From a cursory reading of this legislation it appears that there may be further drafting errors that we have not dealt with in the legislation to date or in the amendments that have been foreshadowed to date. I may be wrong; perhaps the Minister can advise us at some point. I note, for example, that in schedule 1, parts 1 and 2 are divided between entitlements to members and entitlements to what are call((d parliamentary officers and Ministers. There is no reference to the subsidies for home telephones, in terms of members; there is no reference to travel by their spouses within Australia. This is dealt with in part 2 in relation to parliamentary officers and Ministers. In the first part of schedule 1, I also note that in clause 10, concerning former Prime Ministers-honourable members should excuse my interjecting a conflict of interest here; I am shadow Attorney-General but am also referring to a description in clause 10-and Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Representatives while they are members, additional facilities are approved by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does indeed show a degree·of benevolence to former Leaders of the Opposition while they are members of the Parliament, but former Prime Ministers are looked after irrespective of whether they are in the Parliament or not. I do not know whether it is sloppy drafting or whether I am interpreting it wrongly but I would like some explanation of the statement that 'for former Prime Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Representatives while they are members, additional facilities are to be approved by the Prime Minister'. Let me get on to the substance of the matter itself. We will deal with the amendments in the committee stage. The history of this matter is that by determination No. 18 of 1988 the Tribunal determined, with effect from 1 January 1989, allowances for members and senators, which determination included an amount by way of postal allowances in the following terms: A Senator or Member shall, for parliamentary or electorate business but not for Party business, be provided with a postal credit card which may be used . . . [for specified purposes] up to a total expenditure of $9,000 per year. The determination was laid before Parliament and no motion disproving it was passed. In August of 1989 the Government, upon Executive whim alone-and I repeat it was by determination of the Cabinet, seeking to override the Tribunal itself-simply decided to increase the postal allowance to approximately $30,525 for members on an indexed basis for senators. In doing so, as I say, the Government, upon Executive whim alone, attempted to usurp both the integrity and the independence of the Tribunal and the supremacy of the Parliament which is recognised both in our Constitution and in the Remuneration Tribunal Act. Tonight I will give a more coldly clinical appraisal on this legislation in quiet terms because the man who foresaw all this, the litigant himself, is on the front bench. The anger that moved him to say to the Australian people, 'This is wrong' and to take his matter to. the High Court of Australia was found to be justified. I would wish him to give vent to that oral spleen in a way which would justify the successful action that he took. Such action led to the judgment by the High Court which proved that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), the former shadow Attorney-General, was correct in disproving the payment and regarding it as illegal. The honourable member for Menzies saw quite clearly that the Government's conduct was illegal, and it was simply one more example of the Government spending money like men with a dozen arms. The increased postal allowance was clearly designed to seek to benefit the Government in an attempt to be re-elected in the recent Federal election. Time and again yve raised complaints that it was using the lllcreased postal allowance for a direct mail-out of standard letters for political purposes. Accordingly, in September of 1989 my colleague, the former shadow Attorney General, instituted proceedings in the High Court to challenge the validity of the Government's action. But rather than adopting the prudent course of action and saying, 'The increased allowance is under challenge and it therefore might be wise for members and senators not to spend the additional allowance until the High Court action is resolved', the Government came out and said, 'There is nothing wrong to worry about; there is nothing illegal or immoral with our conduct. Go ahead and spend the extra money'. We on this side of the House advised our members to be more prudent. As expected, the Government was proved wrong and the honourable member for Menzies, not noted in any vexatious way as a litigant, was proved by his litigation to be sagacious, correct and possessed of sounder interpretative skills in legislation on the Constitution than anyone on the Government side. The High Court condemned the Government's action as being totally illegal where the Full Bench said: In this case, the Determination specified maximum level of the benefit to be enjoyed: 'up to a total expenditure of $9,000 per year'. The total expenditure was not flexible but fixed. increase in the total expenditure is inconsistent with the express terms of the Determination. The Tribunal's Determinations does not contemplate that, if the Executive Government so chooses the total expenditure specified be supplemented.' In the High Court proceedings the Government relied upon a spurious argument that somehow Parliament had sanctioned its actions by authorising the increased expenditure in the supply and appropriation legislation for 1989. This was not the case and it was rejected. Notwithstanding the fact that the High Court found this Government as it were, with its hands in the till, the Government continued to pursue a reckless and irresponsible course of action. Immediately after the Hight Court's decision the former Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), in the heat of the election campaign, came out and said, 'Spend your money. Do not worry about the High Court determination; do not worry about its decision. Spend. The increased postal allowance is not affected by this decision.' To put it mildly, this was.outrageous. It was wrong at law, it was wrong in fact and it was grossly dishonest. We would not have this legislation today had that not been the case. All through this the old knight in his shining white armour on the white charger proved to be right again. As I say, the action was clearly wrong on all pointsas a matter of law, principle and truth. At the time of these statements the former Minister for Administrative Services asserted that he had legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department to support the view that he was proffering in the campaign. Now, some two months later, the Government has come into the House. and not only sought to rectify, in a way, the postal allowance question but also claim that it has legal advice that calls into question so many other benefits that have been granted to members and senators, in some instances since the time of Federation. Who is fair dinkum? Who told the truth? Was it the Minister in the campaign who said that he had legal advice from the Attorney-General's department which motivated his call to members to keep spending their postal allowance, or was it the alleged legal advice which has the brought about this legislation? One does not need to be a Rhodes scholar-although there is one around the joint-to An know this legislation would not be here if the legal advice tendered to the Minister during the campaign was that the legislaafter tion was okay. As I say, in the light of the High decision the Government says that not me. only is the increased postal allowance unlawful but also a series of other miscellahas neous allowances made payable to members and senators may also be unlawculpa-and ful, It alleges that this possibility arises due to comments by the Court that secand tion 48 of the Constitution may mean that Parliament, and Parliament the power to confer benefits. The only thing illegal to date has been the payment of moneys for postage succinctly stamps. To allege that the other benefits are illegal is wrong in fact and in There has been no determination by any court that they are illegal. The only illelowances, gality is the very thing the honourable member for Menzies pointed out in the first place. Let me turn to the advice which has been tendered, which is the genesis of legislation. Although the honourable factual member for Menzies-hereinafter rewhich ferred to as the litigant-and I requested copies of the legal opinion, that has denied. We simply have not seen it. There is a bit of obfuscation here. The Governlimited ment has been caught with its hands in the till and has thrown up this smokesso successful. creen. The Court only decided the question of postage stamps, and anything else is ter dicta-not relating to this legislation. There has been no determination. There has only been, it appears, a piece of vice tendered to the Government which states that the action may be legal. I not know who gave the advice. He may have come in through the ventilator and gone out under the carpet for all I know. We have seen none of the advice. We do not know who tendered it. It may well have been counsel at the action instituted by the litigant.",116
143,Mr NA BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"You would think he would get someone else, wouldn't you?  would get someone else because he went down in flames against the honourable member for Menzies. It begs the question: Why am I the shadow Attorney-General such sagacious legal advice which the honourable member has tendered in Court the past-but he always tendered it to The Government's approach, however, not been to admit its wrongdoing as one would expect-some form of mea start again with a clean slate. Rather, it has chosen to colour the issue distract the public's attention away from its unlawful and what could be alone, has termed immoral wrongdoing. A number of points should be made with respect to the Bill presently under consideration. Firstly, when law. the Government speaks of the various items which need to be considered as alservices or facilities, in effect, it is trying to speculate as to what the factual distinction between an 'allowance' and a 'facility' may be in view of the High Court's alleged comments on section 48 of the Constitution. The Government is this really not in a position to make such a distinction. It is a factual question can be decided only by the judiciary in appropriate litigation. Secondly, the been Government's approach to the issue involves an element of overkill given the nature of the decision in Brown v. West; Brown being the litigant who was This is no doubt an endeavour by the obiGovernment to colour the issue and detract from the following points: Firstly, the former Minister for Administrative adServices was clearly wrong both before and after the High Court's decision. Secdo ondly, any chaos which has been created has been created by the Government's illegal conduct. Thirdly, the Government will not recognise that, in fact, the High Court's decision has been beneficial in pointing out or illustrating other possible illegal expenditures. Instead of the Government humbly abiding by the High Court's direction it now attempts to confuse the issue. Finally, this side of the House respects the integrity and the independence of the Tribunal. That is behind some of the amendments that we will be moving. It is a viewpoint strongly supported on our side of the House that, having established the Tribunal, it should be treated with the respect for its independence and the regard for its integrity that is required. There is no doubt that the Australian public will not forget the Government's conduct in this matter. It has been condemned by the Opposition from the start. It has been determined as illegal by the High Court. I am sure that it would be condemned by the Australian people if they were a-ked to cast a viewpoint on it. I reiterate that we said from the start, as a consequence of the advice of the honourable member for Menzies, that this was wrong at law and wrong in fact.· It has been held to be such. The High Court in its judgment passed some comments on other matters. It did not determine them. I am concerned additionally at the way in which the Bill has been drafted. It is only a Bill of some 14 clauses and two schedules and yet I am forced to move 18 amendments to it, in addition to foreshadowing some other concerns that I have. Because of the lateness of the hour I will curtail my remarks in order that our successful litigant may take the floor and also that we may deal with this matter in Committee of the Whole.",120
144,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,1 believe that the comments by the honour that the Government had its hand in the till on this issue are unwarranted and unfair. Opposition members-Rubbish!,121
145,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,I intend to say why.  money in instead of taking it out?,121
146,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"They are unfair comments first and foremost because Government members and Opposition members alike use the postage in question and have continued to use the postage in question. They need to use postage. The bible concerning the entitlements of members is the handbook setting down the rules of the Remuneration Tribunal as regards the salaries, the remuneration generally and the broad entitlements of members. What the Opposition argued in law was that the Government had no right to go outside those rules-tl-e scriptures-in giving entitlements or benefits to members of parliament. If that is the premise of the argument put forward by the Opposition, let us expand it to other aspects of entitlements. As the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) so rightly said, if that is the rule, if no member has the right to take upon himself or herself any entitlement that is not set down by the Remuneration Tribunal or by legislation, then one will quickly see that many of the benefits and resources that are enjoyed by the Opposition, particularly by the leadership of the Opposition, are illegal. That is the issue. A list in the Minister's second reading speech sets down the sorts of issues that are now in doubt. Therefore, it is only proper that we have this validating legislation. This Bill will address the legal impasse which has now arisen because of the High Court decision to which the honourable member for Kooyong refers, a decision or a ruling that says that the Government does not have the power-and this is the strength of it; this is its essence-to supplement a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal to provide postage entitlements to members or senators. But it is not just postage, as I said. The argument is that, if it not set down by the Remuneration Tribunal and if there is no measure in law, if there is nothing on the statute books, then it is deemed to be illegal. If that is the argument, so many other additional resources enjoyed by members of parliament in terms of travel and office facilities, even of having their book pamphlets or publications transporte from this Parliament to their electora offices, are illegal because there is no re erence anywhere in legislation or in th Remuneration Tribunal's determination that they are an entitlement of membe of parliament. I find it quite unfair of th honourable member for Kooyong to sa that we have a hand in the till, althoug I understand the politics involved. I stress that this is not just about transporting office material; it comes back to all sorts of things that members of the Opposition have enjoyed not just for the last few years-since 1983 under this Government-but since Federation. In the 51f2 years that I have been a member of this chamber I do not recall 'any member of the Opposition ever challenging the legality of the rights of members to have proper and adequate office accommodation. I have never heard an Opposition member get up and say that the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has no right to travel overseas on official business. However, those aspects are not covered by legislation; They are not referred to in any of the Tribunal's recommendations and findings regarding travel. Not once did Opposition members get up to speak but, as an election was pending, they saw cause and advantage in doing so. I accept that. However, this legislation puts things right. It puts the matter in a proper legal context. I hope that members of parliament will support the proposition because if the High Court rules,· as it has, that if the Tribunal does not set down our entitlements and there is no law, the entitlements are illegal. We must do something about that. We have to legalise those advantages. I also think it is unfair of the former Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Kooyong to go on about wrong motives. Mr Lee-They tell me he has sent a few letters in his time.",121
147,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"He probably has, but I think that is pretty necessary for members of parliament. The argument is not about the quality of life of members, as Opposition members seem to make out when they talk about how much money we get in our pockets for postage; it is about the quality of service that we provide to our constituencies. I argue strongly that if we are to provide an adequate or even standard quality of service to the people we represent, we need these entitlements. We need a postage allowance, office facilities and the human resources behind us. I hark back to my time in a State House. I had the privilege of being an Opposition leader for two years. I was the only person in the Opposition in Queensland that had the right to travel. No other member of the Opposition had travel rights. I had no interstate travel rights but I could travel around Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition had those rights but the Deputy and shadow Ministers did not. I had five staff and a limited postage entitlement. The then Bjelke-Petersen Government used that regime to hold us down. That was not the case under the previous Fraser Government. Due facilities and resources were given to the Labor Opposition and, in turn, similar resources have been given to the present Opposition because there is a recognition that the quality of service is paramount. The Opposition has a responsibility to provide information and alternatives to the broad constituency, and to do that it needs, in some cases, an unlimited postage allowance. Let us make sure that the Australian community knows that, when the Opposition talks about ordinary members having $30,000 worth of postage, the Leader of the Opposition has an unlimited postage allowance, and so he should. He should also have extra staff and travel rights. Shadow Ministers should also have access to extra staff. They should have travel rights, including overnight travel, because they have a special responsibility. Every time we criticise the conditions of members of parliament we criticise the democratic Westminster system. Too often we put ourselves down.  dled legally.",122
148,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"I think that is now being done. I take the point. I know there was some debate, I know there was some difference of opinion, as to what was legal. But the legal advice given to the previous Minister was that the allocation was in fact legal. May I use some examples of those of us who represent country electorates. My electorate of Capricornia is 53;000 square kilometres. It takes me seven hours to drive from one end of my electorate to the other. I represent something like 110,000 people in my electorate. I have over 70 populated regions. Yet my electorate. is minute in size compared with Kennedy, which is 712,000 square kilometres, and Maranoa with 625,000 square kilometres. Yet they just pale into insignificance when one looks at Kalgoorlie with 2,308,320 square kilometres. Add to this the role that senators must play in representing the States. As members we ought to be arguing for more postage allowances, more human re-ources, more. staff, more backup to ensure that we carry out our role properly. I make comparisons with what now takes place in Queensland at the State level. Capricornia totally takes up the State electorates of Rockhampton, Rockhampton North and Broadsound. It takes up most of the State electorate of Callide, a significant part of the State electorate of Bowen, and parts of the State electorates of Port Curtis, Mirani and Auburn. Let us make one comparison with one of those State seats, the electorate of Callide. It is a National Party electorate. It is about a fifth of the size of my own, Capricornia, it has about a sixth of the population, and yet the State member· for that electorate has a salary equal to mine-exactly the same salary as mine. But that State member gets some $3,000 a year more as an electoral allowance than I do, even though she represents one-sixth the population and a fifth of the area. That State member gets a special allowance for a car that we do not get and also gets significant other resources. The only difference is we get three staffers and State members get one. I do not begrudge the support that State members get because I believe they need it as well, but when members of the Opposition stand up and try to put us down as members of parliament saying we do not need the postage, I think that their whole standards and values are wrong. What we should be doing is standing up here on an apolitical basis saying, 'Let us do what is right, not by the member of Parliament, but by the people we represent to ensure that we, particularly in country and rural areas, can develop that proper relationship with our constituency and that we can fully represent the people'. We need a free phone so that those who live 300 kilometres away from Rockhampton can make a reverse charge call. Otherwise they ring up for som.e reason and they get caught up with the many other callers waiting on the phone and pay $5 or $6 of their own money simply because they need service and information.",122
149,Mr NA BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,It is not in the Bill.,123
150,Mr WRIGHT,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"It is also an .unfair thing. I think we ought to have 008 call systems. There is now a Telecom charge for a reverse charge call, at whatever time. I get something like 200 phone calls a day. I have around 400 letters per week, and I am sure there are other members with larger electorates that would receive more calls than that. What I am saying is that the people out there have a right to have their prqblems raised; they have a right to advice; they have a right to get answers; they have a right to have access to their members of parliament; they have a right to up to date information. We have a responsibility to ensure that we service our constituencies and that we service our electorates. Every time there is a change in law as it relates to a nursing home, I have some 20 nursing homes that need to be advised of that change in law. Every time there is a change in the rightS and pensions of veterans and pensioners, then I have a responsibility to ensure that I tell those people what the changes are. Across Australia it means telling some 2.2 million people of those changes. We all know the myriad of legislative changes that go through this place. We have seen it in recent times-it was mentioned again tonight in the changes in superannuation. We still have bogged down in the Senate changes over privacy as it relates the credit reference agencies. Every ye hundreds of thousands of people are bei affected by the changes in law. They ha a right to know what those changes a and we have a responsibility to infor them. But our ability to inform depen on the entitlements and the resources that we have; it depends on the staml?s,. the stationery, the telephones, the facsImIles, the word processors, acc-ss to departments' travel and, finally, the human resources. I suggest we start advocating - or extra human resources, for extra staff, lUstead of trying to chide the Government for giving honourable members extra postage allowances. As I said, we need access to the 008 local call facility. We need increased postage and facilities to ensure that we are able to advise and inform our people. The electors are becoming far more demanding for detail. They want sophisticated, ongoing advice about issues. They choose to go to their local member rather than to the departments. As I said before, governments are becoming more complicated. Changes are more difficult to understand. One has to look only at the superannuation changes and start talking about reasonable benefit limits· to get 1,000 telephone calls. Honourable members have had to run seminars on these changes. They have had to go out to their people and explain them and then, in turn, answer a myriad of letters from all sorts of communities. There is a real need to ensure that honourable members have these resources. If these resources are challengable in law, as has been shown by the High Court, we need to legalise. That is what this legislation has to do. That is what it is about. I find it difficult to understand, except for the political reasons, why any member of the Opposition would want to attack what was done where members' facilities were improved. I find it strange that anyone should stand up here and challenge the rights of members to have fair facilities and fair entitlements. They should make the comparisons that I did with our State colleagues. They should make comparisons with the statutory authority personnel to see the salary differences arid the differences in facilities and entitlements. They should look at any private enterprise sector and see the contrast. They would then realise that members of parliament need these facilities and resources. It is not my task to complain about salaries. That will be dealt with by the independent Remuneration Tribunal. But all honourable members need to stand up and be counted when it comes to arguing for better facilities and better entitlements. This Bill validates a previous practice-a practice which was warranted. It recognises the importance of ensuring that honourable members have adequate and reasonable entitlements and resources. It should be approached on a political basis rather than trying to political point score and talking about hands in the till.",123
151,Mr NA BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"Menzies) (10.08)Having heard the speech delivered some time ago by the honourable member for  conclusion that very little else could be said in this debate. However, we have since heard the contribution of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright). In view of what he said, a few matters should be put on the record so that those who read about this matter in the future-if anyone does-and the Australian public as a whole will know the facts. I could therefore start off by asking a question of the honourable member for Capricornia, namely: where has he - een for the last six months? If he had gIven the slightest attention to the issues in this matter he. could not possibly have made the contribution to the debate that he has just made. The point about this matter is simply this: some time ago this Pa-lia­ ment decided that the bulk of entItlements and facilities for members of parliament should be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. That tribunal was set up in a quite specific way so that it was not at the beck and call of Ministers, so that it was not confined to looking at only those matters that the Ministers and the Government decided it should look at. It was set up to look at salaries and related matters and at the same time it was given an opportunity to look at those related matters which it felt were appropriate. I am jumping a little ahead of the argument here, but I do not know whether the honourable member realises that all of that is being undone by this Bill and that is the basis for one of our amendments. Through this Bill the Government is to destroy the Remuneration Tribunal as we have known it because it is limiting to the Remuneration Tribunal those matters that the current Ministers think should be looked at by the Remuneration Tribunal and it is taking away from the Tribunal its own power to look at large on its own initiative at those very good and necessary and desirable things that the honourable member has just been telling us about. Why on earth is the honourable mem-er voluntarily handing it over to people lIke Bolkus and company to decide for him what he needs in the proper service of his constituents? I have no doubt the honourable member serves them in a very substantial and responsible way. I just do not know why he is doing it. Perhaps if any other people from the Government side contribute to this debate they may explain it to me. But that is one of the points about this case. I just wanted to explain to the honourable member the context in which it arises be-au-e the .Remuneration Tribunal, pursumg Its qUIte proper role and exercising what we all thought and believed its functions were, determined that the postage allowance .for members of parliament, senators and members both, should be $9,000. The Government, with an election coming - p over the horizon, came along and saId-to use the honourable member's own words-'How can we manipulate and twist this in some way to our advantage; how can we take away what the Remuneration Tribunal has done; how can we pervert and twist this our own ends?' The honourable member should just look at the documents the former Minister tabled in the Senate when he announced that the Government was v:rithdrawing this matter from the jurisdicment tIon of the Remuneration Tribunal. It seemed to us on a proper, reasonable and balanced look at the legislation and the law that that was illegal. We told the Government this. We warned it of it. We said it was illegal. The response of the former Minister was to ridicule me and other people who spoke on the same side of the argument as me and to tell members opposite to ignore what we were saying and to go ahead and spend the money. We then issued a High Court writ to pursue the point and again the former Minister said, 'No, there's nothing in it. Don't worry about it. Ignore it. We have advice from the Attorney-General's Department'. I must say that was the point in time when I was absolutely convinced we were right. He said, 'Go ahead and spend it' and of course members opposite did. They acted on what he told them. We would have thought that the sensible, prudent and responsible thing for him to do at that stage, exercising some stewardship over public moneys, was to say 'Look, perhaps we'd better calm down othis for a while, put it on hold until the court has a look at it and decides where the law is, what the right answer is'. But no, recklessly he said: 'Go ahead and ignore the High Court challenge'. The High Court sprung members opposite and said their Government was acting illegally. They were sprung. To use the analogy that the honourable member for Kooyong used, they were caught with their fingers in the till. They were caught with having come along and said, 'We don't care what the Tribunal said, the Government knows best and we will increase the stamp allowance and take a sideswipe at the Senate as we go by and won't give senators the increase'. That was a very foolish, silly thing to do. Anyone who knows anything about the history of this country knows just how silly it is to tryon that sort of exercise because it rather has a tendency to agitate senators and concentrate their attention. Members opposite were wrong. The High Court said they were wrong and we were right. The High Court said Governmembers were acting illegally. I pause there to say that it was obvious to the High Court and to us that this was no accidental illegality. This was no mere slip. This was no mere mistake. This was a deliberate course the Government had embarked upon to pervert and twist the proper uses of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Government was sprung and that is the end of this issue, full stop. The Government was exposed. Not only did the High Court say that the Government had acted illegally but it said so five-love; five-nil. The Government did not have one single supporter on its side. The High Court made an order for costs which I might remind honourable members has not been paid as yet. That is one of the many things that the Government should be concentrating its attention on. That is really what it comes down to. After the High Court decision the matter became a'complete shambles. We had the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) saying, 'I have got more advice from the Attorney-General's Department. Relax. The Attorney-General's Department which was wrong the first time is now right and it says not to worry about the judgment; spend to your heart's content'. Not surprisingly, he was wrong then also. He very foolishly advised people to go along and took a sideswipe at the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who was then Leader of the Op"" position saying, 'This just goes to show you, doesn't it, how wise people would have been to ignore the advice of the Leader of the Opposition not to spend this money'. The smile is on the other face because we now know how utterly and completely wrong the former Minister was. Now, miraculously, we have some other advice. A different opinion has come along to the Government which says, 'Sorry, that wasn't quite right. This whole thing has been put in doubt. The High Court found that what we did was illegal'. To cover that up the Government has now drawn this smokescreen across the whole matter saying that other entitlements are in doubt. That is what the rest of the Bill is about. It is a smokescreen. The Government has acted in the best traditions of the Tammany Hall politicians who liked to get their hand on public money and use that public money illegally for their own political ends and purposes. In contrast to some of the Tammany Hall politicians Government members have been exposed for the grasping lot that they are. The Government has been exposed by the highest court in this country, five-nil. While we are looking at this let me make a couple of points. I have already made the point that the Government foolishly-I wish that honourable members on the Government side would stop to think about this for a moment-is destroying from today the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. It is giving to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and his mob the ability to decide what the Tribunal will adjudicate upon. That is a very silly thing for the Government to do. To put it bluntly, as a member of our collective group, the Remuneration Tribunal traditionally has had a more realistic appraisal of the real needs of members of parliament than Government Ministers have had. Frankly I do not understand why on earth, like turkeys voting for an early christmas, the Government goes along with this sort of proposal. Perhaps Government members might explain it to me at some stage. But it is worse than that. The Government then says that what the Remuneration Tribunal does not do, we as a Government will do by the means of regulation. Then the Government says, 'If there is a conflict between what the Remuneration Tribunal does and what the regulations say, the regulations take precedence'. I think that that is quite an outrageous part of the Bill. That is a stupid thing to do. Have Government members not read this wretched Bill? Why on earth does the Government want to give to the Executive Government the power to overrule the Remuneration Tribunal? Why does the Government want to do that? Perhaps the Minister might explain it to us and to others. The Government then does another thing in this Bill which I think is not foolish but also contrary to the sort of principles that our country was based onthat is, retrospective legislation. There is a case for retrospective legislation when an accident has occurred down the track or when something that we all thought was lawful and proper turns out, on some construction of the law, to be out of order. But that is not this case. What the Government has done with this Bill is to go back to its actions which were illegal. It is not just me saying this this time. The High Court said it five-nil, with costs that have not been paid yet. The High Court said that it was illegal. But the Government is going back to that Act and saying that it was lawful and that it will just ignore what the High Court said and pass a law to say so. That is a very bad precedent to set. It was a deliberate act by the Government; it was not accidental. It was embarked upon as a deliberate matter of Government policy. The Government was sprung and it was shown to have acted illegally. The Government now says retrospectively that it was lawful and all right. There must be some explanation for the Government doing such an unprincipled thing as this. That is the reason why we will move an amendment to take all of that out, as we should. Any decent, self-respecting member of parliament should vote in support of the amendment that the honourable member for Kooyong will move to that effect. The Government is doing all these silly, unnecessary things, devoid of any common sense, devoid of principle and, worse of all, against its own interests because it will not do as well out of the Ministers as it would out of the Remuneration Tribunal; I can tell the Government that now. The Government is doing all these unprincipled and silly things for no reason and setting some very unfortunate precedents. We are vindicated in this matter. I must give due recognition to the role played by the honourable member for Kooyong, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, who seized on the issue and, with considerable courage, supported the proceedings only that we took in the High Court to have the law upheld in the first place and to have the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal upheld in the secon,d place. He did it in the Government's interests as well as ours, and in the country's interests. That is why he did it, and we were vindicated. The Government-not the backbenchers; I do not blame them for this; I blame Minister Bolkus and his lot, and West before him-has been exposed for engaging in a very silly exercise. I will take a minute or two to tell a story about a customer of mine who also did something silly-about the same standard as what the Government did. The client of mine was charged with bank robbery. He was very bright; he knew that banks these days have video cameras inside them, so he went into the bank with a can of paint, went up to the video camera, looked straight into it and sprayed the paint over it so that no one could identify him. Of course, the police had the best pictures that one could imagine! That is what this Government has done. It has said, 'Let us look at this and see how we can twist and contort it so that no member of parliament will ever challenge it. No-one will stand up and regard the law as more important than his stamps'. I can just imagine those opposite in a Cabinet meeting or a Caucus meeting saying of us, 'We are going to give the Opposition an extra $21,000 in stamps; no member of parliament will knock that back'. But the Opposition, led as it then was by the honourable member for Kooyong, stood the Government up and put principle before money and self-interest. It put principle first. Mr Broadbent-And integrity.",124
152,Mr NA BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"And integrity, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Corinella. We put principle first and we have been vindicated by that stand. This Bill on any test is one of the Government's gravestones so far as its reputation and integrity are concerned. Finally, I will show once again that the Government really does not know what it is doing with this. We do not often refer in debates to the financial impact statement. But this one states that funds to meet the cost of all benefits subject to the Bill have been appropriated in the 198990 appropriation Acts. I ask again: Where has the Government been in the last six months? A fair bit was said about this issue in the High Court. The Government has not appropriated money in the 198990 appropriation Acts. If there is an explanation for this, we would like to hear the Government's version of it. I will not, for my part, necessarily accept that it is right. On the Government's track record, I would think it was more likely to be wrong than right about this. But I would like to hear its explanation for it. And we would like to hear an explanation for some of the other things that the honourable member for Kooyong has raised. But the Government has been exposed in this and it deserves all the public criticism that I hope it gets. It will get some from the press, I hope, which is interested in this. I do not mind members on the Government side ridiculing me; it is done most of the time here. But it did Government members no good at all to ridicule David Solomon of the Australian for writing articles that were accurate. That was a very foolish and unprincipled thing to do. He has turned out to be right and the Government's Bill is its admission that he was right. So why do Government members go round ridiculing people when they might have an arguable case? Often Government members turn out to be wrong and this time they have very much indeed turned out to be wrong. Let me give the Government some free advice, and there is no need to pay costs for this-do not try it again.",127
153,Mr BURR,PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS,"The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in his contribution earlier to!1ightaccused the Government of having Its hand in the till and he was quite correct in making that claim. But when the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) responded he said he could not understand the claim that had been made by my friend from Kooyong. Just let me explain to the honourable member for Capricornia the basis for the claim that has been made that the Government and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) did have their hands in the till and what they were trying to do was to give themselves a free kick at the expense of the taxpayers for the purpose of the last election campaign. Surely members on the Government side can count-that is the basis of ALP politics. They should know that in the last Parliament there were 87 members of the ALP on the Government side of the House and 61 members on the coalition side. What the Government was doing was increasing the stamp allowance from $9,000 to $30,000, an increase of $21,000 per member. I invite the honourable member for Capricornia to do a simple calculation and multiply $21,000 by 26, because the Government had 26 more members than we did. If he does so the honourable member will come up with a figure of $546,000 to go to the ALP campaign effort, to be paid for by the taxpayers. That is why my friend from Kooyong accused the Government of having its hand in the till and he was quite right. It has a half million dollar free kick to the ALP election campaign. That is what it was all about. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) caught the Government out. He is an astute lawyer. He understands the law. But, more importantly, he understands the integrity of politics· and that unfortunately is not forthcoming from members on the Government side. It was not forthcoming before the last election and it is not forthcoming now. The Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 is not designed to make provision for members of Parliament; it is designed to get the Government off the hook. It is on the hook. It has negated all the provisions for members of Parliament and this Bill is designed to get it off the hook. I invite any of the new members who are here today to go down to the Post Office and try to fill their franking machine. I assure them that the Department of Administrative Services will not give them a cheque, because right now they are not entitled to any facility. Until this Bill is passed they are not entitled to any facility and they. can blame their own Government for getting them into that mire. The Government did it because it was trying to give itself a half million dollar free kick at the taxpayers' expense. The honourable member for Menzies alluded earlier in his contribution to the fact that the worse feature of this whole sordid episode has been the removal of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. That is the worse feature of the whole flaming exercise. One of the wisest moves of the Whitlam Government in 1973 was to establish the independent Remuneration Tribunal. The intention of the Whit lam Government in doing that was to have an independent body to establish the salaries and facilities for members of Parliament so that the odium of members of Parliament setting their own conditions could be taken away.

155,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrief!) (10.30)Earlier today the House acknowledged the debt Australia owes to the ANZACs for their valour at Gallipoli 75 years ago. Tonight I want to remind the House that yesterday was the forty-eighth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, and to acknowledge the great debt we owe to the Australians and British, but particularly the Americans who so gallantly and ably defended this country in that battle. On this battle's fortieth anniversary, the Bulletin magazine stated: The most neglected date on the Australian endar is May 8. While it is fitting that our war dead should be honoured on April 25, it is surprising that there is no celebration on scale to mark our national survival . Never in Australia's history has the nation stood in such peril. After their successful attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the Japanese had swept down through the Carolines and Marshalls in a few months and had seized Rabaul. A second offensive was then planned for May 1942. Tulagi in the Solomon Islands and Port Moresby were to be seized, and from these bases Japan would have air mastery of the Coral Sea. The plan included an attack on allied bases at Thursday Island, Cooktown and Townsville with the objective of forcing Australia out of the war. The Japanese attack force included three aircraft carriers, nine cruisers, six destroyers, 12 transports and 125 aircraft. The United States fleet marshalled to combat this force comprised two aircraft carriers, eight cruisers-including HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart-12 destroyers and 141 aircraft. The Japanese had not yet suffered a significant defeat, and on 6 May the battle for Corregidor was finally lost by the Americans. The first contacts between the Japanese and American fleets in the Coral Sea occurred on 7 May. When the aircraft carrier Shoho was sank by torpedo bombers from US Yorktown, the Japanese Imperial Navy incurred its first loss of a major warship in World War II. Bad weather prevented further contact that day and. it was not until 8 a.m. on 8 May that the main fleets made contact and attacks were launched by both sides. Shortly after, when the battle ended, the Japanese could claim a marginal material victory. They had lost the 12,000 ton Shoho, 77 aircraft and 1,074 men, together with some superficial damage to another carrier. The United States had lost the 42,000 ton Lexington, the tanker Neosho, the destroyer Sims, 66 aircraft and 543 men, together with damage to the carrier Yorktown. Strategically, however, the Allies had won an important victory. They had succeeded for the first time in stopping the calJapanese advance and had prevented the sea-borne inv-sion of Port Moresby. The a similar Australian mainland was never again threatened by a ,major invasion force. The Battle of the Coral Sea was also critical to the United States Navy's victory in the Battle of Midway fought less than one month later, where the Americans, with three carriers, inflicted a decisive defeat on a Japanese force which included four carriers. One of the United States carriers was the Yorktown, patched up in three days and rushed into the battle. If Yorktown had suffered just one more bad hit at the Coral Sea, it almost certainly would not have been at Midway and the odds in the air would have clearly favoured the Japanese. The Bulletin article I referred to earlier reported the view of historian Sir Arthur Bryant that the three critical battles of World War II were EI Alamein, Stalingrad and the Coral Sea. The fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea will be in 1992. I urge the Government to give this anniversary the recognition it should receive as a critical event in our national history.",129
156,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay tribute to a very significant event that has happened today. Many of us came to this place today expectantly, not simply because it was the day on which ex-members were to visit Parliament House, but because it was the day on which the first State of Origin rugby league game between New South Wales and Queensland was to be played this year. In the last three years, unfortunately, the New South Wales team has been unable to record a win over Queensland. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you will be very pleased to hear that that drought has now been broken and that New South Wales has at long last won a game. There are many Queenslanders hereparticularly those sitting behind me-who I am sure are a little upset. But I am sure that they would agree, nevertheless, that the fact that one try was disallowed because the referee claimed that it was a forward pass when it clearly was not, the fact that another try was disallowed because it was claimed to be a knock-on When it clearly was not, and the fact that the referee was a Queenslander, did not have any bearing on the game at the end of the day. What it did do was again show that in adversity New South Wales, with young players and young talented people, can come to the fore. Mr Snowdon-Not Canberra?",130
157,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am reminded by my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory that it seemed to many people watching the game that it was Canberra A versus Canberra B. That was somewhat distressing, but I was particularly pleased tonight to see the performance of a couple of very young players in that side from New South Wales and also of a couple of players from Queensland. One of the most outstanding successes in tonight's game other than the captain, Ben Elias, was the young winger from the Wollongong Steelers club in the ,Winfield Cup competition, Rod Wishart. Rod Wishart comes from Gerringong, which is in the electorate of my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who unfortunately is not here to support me in this debate tonight because he is still celebrating the fact that the Steelers won last weekend. Nevertheless, Rod Wishart has played for the Steelers for the last two seasons and well and truly earned his position as a winger in the team for tonight's encounter at the Sydney Football Stadium. In all seriousness, though, it is a tribute to his courage and dedication that he was able to overcome a very crippling injury recently and got fit to take his place in the team tonight. What tonight has done is to put the lie to the claim that Jack Gibson is no longer a supercoach and that Arthur Beetson really could take any team of Queenslanders and turn them into a team of supermen. Tonight was not the night for that, and it was witnessed by all that that clearly was the case. Many people throughout this Parliament in the last 12 months or so have had their interest in sport, and in particular rugby league, aroused because of the success of Canberra in the Winfield Cup and· the fact that it won the premiership last year. That success has been reflected in the selection of players in both the Queensland and the New South Wales teams. But tonight I think people would also have to recognise that the game itself was a magnificent spectacle. Whether one follows rugby league, rugby union or Australian rules football, it was a magnificent game of football and it clearly demonstrated the commitment of those sports men and women who follow the game and are prepared to get involved. Mrs Sullivan-Men and women?",130
158,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"My friend and colleague on the other side raised her eyebrows about women being involved in rugby league. In fact, they do play it these days in lower grades and as children, and there are women referees as well. I feel sure that not too far in the future we may even see one refereeing League games. I am pleased that my' friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby has now joined me. I indicated that he represents the areas of the Illawarra from which Rod Wishart, the young winger, comes. Mr Hollis-He is a constituent of mine.",131
159,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"He must be a constituent of the honourable member if he lives in his electorate. That is the quality of the players and the representation we get on this side of the House. At the conclusion of my contribution tonight, I pay tribute the New South Wales Rugby League for the promotion that it embarked upon. A ground record was again set at the Sydney Football Stadium, with 41,000 people there. Sure, it does not compare with the crowds in Melbourne but, who knows, in the second State of Origin which will be played in Melbourne we may see an enormous crowd of people who are interested in it. I am sure that my friend and colleague, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is a great sportsman himself and a follower of sport, would be more than pleased to come along and see the game at Olympic Park on 30 May. I conclude by saying: Congratulations to New South Wales and it is about time.",131
160,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I thought the honourable member might have asked for that sentiment to be carried by acclamation.,131
161,Mr MCGAURAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Gippsland) (10.39)I wish now to direct the House's attention to a matter of national tragedy, that is, the recent floods. So much media attention has centred on the widespread devastation in New South Wales and Queensland and not to such a great extent on the floods in Gippsland which occurred over the weekend of 21 and 22 April. Whilst it is true that the scale of the losses in both human and financial terms in Gippsland is not so significant as in Queensland and New South Wales, in terms of damage to those who actually suffered from the flood it is arguably even worse. Allow me to explain. During the night of Friday, 20 April and Saturday, 21 April some 16 inches of rain fell on the Great Dividing Range which enc.loses Gippsland. That rain, of course, poured down principally into two rivers-the Avon and the Mitchell-and, to a lesser extent, the Thomson River. The Avon River broke its banks late on the Saturday night-that being 21 April-to the extent that houses even two miles away from the river were flooded. It meant the small township of Boisdale was completely flooded without any warning whatsoever, so quickly did the floodwaters rise. There was also a number of losses to the more diverse housing structures of Valencia Creek. The Avon also carted away a large number of dairy stock and, of course, fencing and caused widespread damage to farms. The Mitchell River did great damage to the Lindenow Flats, basically used by vegetable farmers, and some stock as well. It flooded parts of the town of Bairnsdale. It is terrible to visit these places and know that for so many of these people life will never be the same again. There is no prospect of government ever restoring the townsfolk, the farmers or the small businesses back to their original position before the onset of the floods. Indeed, for many of the houses there is little hope of recovery. In fact, many of the foundations of the houses in my electorate are already sinking, and the smell of silt as it encroaches on all parts of the structure will never be got rid of. So it is a tremendously tragic time for a great many people, and I would not wish this Parliament nor, for that matter, the Australian population as tim.e recedes to forget our obligations to those people. In many ways flooding is the worse of all of Australia's natural disasters. A bushfire, to which Gippsland is extremely prone, is very quick, and if rain follows pasture can be restored. Indeed, much of the emergency aid available and drawn up in Victoria is centred really on. the aftermath of bushfires rather than flooding. I wish to pay tribute to a large number of people who were involved in the immediate rescues that had to take placethe State emergency services, the Victorian police force, the Army Reserve and a whole range of other groups, not least of all the Red Cross Society and the ambulance service. In the aftermath of the floods a number of Victorian State Government agencies have done excellent work, particularly the community services of Victoria and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Each of us in this place has an immense responsibility, whether or not our particular electorates have been affected by these devastating floods. People's lives have been destroyed. There has been a loss of a lifetime of work in establishing a home, a farm or a business. The trauma is quite immense and the aftermath and shock will be quite devastating for families. All sorts of psychologists and trauma counsellors have been warning us as the months pass that the human tragedies will multiply. So those of us whose specific electorates were affected by the floods have the particular responsibility of bringing these matters before the House, but I would expect and I am quite sure that all members of this House will support us in our efforts to provide as much assistance as possible to these people who have suffered a devastating loss.",131
162,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"1 share the concern of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr - cGauran) who spoke of his constituents III their time of loss. In· 1911 a redoubtable Federal parliamentarian by the name of King O'Malley bought three acres of land in the middle of Perth. At the time, the Federal Government believed that it was necessary to develop a Federal presence.in Western Australia following Federation, and it was proposed that the general post office (GPO) be placed on that site. Plans were developed in 1912 and the initial contract was let in 1914. In 1923 the building was completed. It is an outstanding example of early twentieth century architecture. The central building is in Forest Place. This is the central city square in Perth; it is a major civic square. It is a place where there has been a great deal of history in respect of all those people who have made their mark on history in Western Australia. It has welcomed many important dignitaries to the city and been the sCene of large numbers of political rallies. The most recent of these was that of the honourable member  On many occasions it has been an important civic meeting place. In 1932 Don Hradman, on his return from England, was welcomed back to Australia in this place. The building is classified by the National Trust and is on the register of the National Estate. It is a very important building for us in Western Australia. The problem is that Australia Post has a charter to rationalise its operations. There was great concern when we heard that the building was to be sold and the prospective buyer was to develop it into a shopping centre. . The belief of Australia Post that the old post office was too costly to maintain and that it was underutilised and there were serious postal and operational difficulties is fair. What we need to consider in issues such as this is that there are very few of these important buildings. There is a great need for them to be maintained and for our cultural heritage to be maintained. The whole flavour and style of the building would have been destroyed if it had been turned into a shopping centre with escalators and all of the other things that go along with retail activity. There was a great deal of concern in my electorate during the election campaign. It was one of the things that surfaced temporarily as an issue. Honourable members can imagine my great relief when I read a press release on 23 April from the State manager of Australia Post in Western Australia saying that the deal had fallen through. Indeed, Australia Post was renegotiating and reconsidering its options. It is considering three options. One is that again it will sell outright the GPO, taking into account all of those caveats which exist over the building. Another is that it will remain in the GPO, rationalise its occupancy and lease the surplus. The third option is that of getting an equity partner to redevelop it but play its part by maintaining a presence there while redeveloping some other parts of the building. I must admit that the first of those options is one that I would not support. I believe it is absolutely critical that the GPO be maintained as the central post office and that Australia Post maintain its presence there anq that it be maintained as a public building. The cultural and historical significance of this building should be maintained. It is absolutely critical that public access one of the guiding lights of the maintenance of this building. The fifth floor has a Very significant sky light which is presently hidden by a false ceiling. If the building is restored to its original splendour it will provide the people who use it, as it has a great deal of public access, an opportunity to have a glimpse of the past. The redevelopment of the Queen Victoria Building in Sydney has been a very successful example of restoration. I would hope that the primary position that this building has in the city square and the importance it has to Australia's historical significance will mean that Australia Post will maintain its office for public ownership.",132
163,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,133
164,Mr MILES,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to reflect on a few details in regard to past election which we have just had in Tasmania. One of the interesting aspects of that was to see that the Green vote compared with the vote in the State election actually dropped from 17 per cent to about 4.7 per cent. There is actually a marked change in the voting patterns of Tasmanian people. I just raise this because I think it indicates why people are now starting to go into a phase of information in regard to ecology and the Green movement. In Tasmania during that election the Tasmanian Wilderness Society was proposing a number of things for Tasmania which are obviously very progressive, very development orientated and helpful for the State and for families! One proposal was that we release the water in all of the hydro dams in Tasmania. This is at a stage when we have a severe drought in Tasmania and our water capacity for the hydro-electric schemes of Tasmania is down to 24 per cent. This really shows how the people in the Green movement in Tasmania have now really become the ecological Luddites of the 1990s. I think it is very important that in this Parliament we get a balance between progress and a genuine concern for the environment of this nation. To go down be the track of the ecological Luddites is absolutely ludicrous. Another of the proposals which the Society put to the Tasmanian people as being progress was that they do away with all the feral honey bees in the national parks so that we make sure that these feral bees that were introduced into the country are eliminated and are not allowed to cross the borders of the wilderness areas of Tasmania or the national parks. Of course, there are feral trout in Tasmania as well: the beautiful rainbow trout and and the brown trout. This indicates the extent that some of these so-called environmentalists will go to and calls into doubt their credibility and concern for this nation as a whole. Of course, they thought that by drumming up these things as an issue at this election they would have a good platform for the media to the rush after them, as they did during the State election over the Wesley Vale pulp mill, and give them a lot of pIedia coverage. Fortunately, the media, together with the people in Tasmania, are now more interested in factual, balanced progress. Hopefully, down the track, and with this Government's guidelines in place for pulp mills, we will be able to see in Tasmania the sort of progress that· should have gone ahead a year or so ago in regard to a world-class pulp mill which has the best quality standards which can be met in the world. If we in Australia need to up our game to be more efficient, we must have that type of development. While we have these ecological Luddites this country will not progress. We ought to ignore that section of the environmental movement and get on with the job of having balanced development.",133
165,Mr SNOW,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to talk about the Liberal Party's reversal of its pre-election policy to consider a consumption tax. Some decades ago a British politician said that the first thing an Opposition should do after an election is to burn all its policies. The Opposition here has taken the advice of that politician. Some people will benefit from the establishment of a consumption tax. If honourable members opposite considered their own attitudes towards consumption taxes and had a look at the various sections of their cominunity, they would find that very few of them would benefit. People like me would benefit. I live with my wife, our children have left home and we have purchased most of the worldly possessions that we want. We do not make hire purchases. We who pay relatively high income taxes would benefit from a consumption tax. Plenty of others would be disadvantaged-even retailers. Retailers would have extra work, possibly having to submit monthly returns, and would suffer buyer resistance because their prices would go up. Sales would drop in some businesses-wine and spirit businesses, for instance. Quite a long time ago when I was in business in Victoria the then Bolte Gove.mment introduced a form of consumptIon tax-a turnover tax. We had to go through the arduous process every month of furnishing returns of our turnover to the then Victorian Government. At the end of the year we would have to submit a tax return from our accountants to the State Government as well as to the Federal Government so that the State Government could verify and adjust the taxes we had been paying each month on our turnover. It was an arduous duty. Young families, single people and others who are making large purchases or paying them off would suffer. People paying off homes or furniture or faced with high medical bills would be hurt by a consumption tax. I refer also to another section of the community, particularly in country areas-low income farmers, particularly farmers who have been hit by events that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) was talking about, and that is floods. The same applies to businesses which have been hit by earthquakes, as happened in Newcastle. Those people are not paying high income tax now but they would pay more in the form of consumption tax. They will be hurt. There are many non-pensioners and retired people-people who may have an income from interest or some form of fixed superannuation-who would have to sustain price rises without increase in income. They would be hurt by a consumption tax. One cannot be so sure that pensioners and social security beneficiaries would not be hurt. They need to ask whether they can trust not only this Government but also an alternative government to hedge their incomes against the price rises and index their benefits. After all, governments have been known to withhold due increases from pensioners. They would very likely be hurt by a consumption tax. The consumption tax ought to be kept off the agenda. It is being kept off the agenda by the Government, as promised. The Opposition ought to keep it off the agenda as well. We want to have an expanded indirect tax base and the evidence is that consumption taxes and value' added taxes are not enough to reduce personal tax rates. One only has to look at other (countries to find that that is the case. A consumption tax would very likely increase both inflation and interest rates and should be rejected as a concept.",134
166,Mr MCGAURAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Gippsland) (10.58)I note the presence in the House tonight of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean)-the man who would be Prime Minister. All of us observed that it was hardly an auspicious start to what is supposed to be a promising parliamentary career with one of the most wimpish performance any of us have ever seen from a Minister. He sought to hide behind the coat-tails of his right-wing Big Brother, the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Has anyone ever seen anything like it? He was asked a legitimate question pertaining to his area of responsibility as the representative of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in this chamber. He refused or was unable to answer what was an easy enough question, relating as it did to the effects of a consumption tax on the export industry, and whether a review of the consumption tax was under way with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. What did we see? We saw the colour drain from his face, although he did blush a couple of seconds later at the uproar from the Opposition. We observed him blushing. He alternated between paleness and redness. If this is the best the centre unity can throw up to this Federal Parliament, no wonder it is a diminishing minority",135
