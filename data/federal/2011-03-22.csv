3,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Today I visited Paragon Printers Australasia, an environmentally sensitive, medium-sized Fyshwick whose electricity bill will rise by almost $50,000 a year under a $26-a-tonne carbon price. I ask the Prime Minister: how will she compensate this business so that printing jobs do not migrate to countries like China and India that do not have a carbon tax?

4,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: no matter how ferocious the scare campaign, we will stay the course and we will get this done because it is the right thing to do by the country. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has business in only one speed as a politician and that is ‘wreck'. Here he is in this parliament making figures up. What is remarkable to me is that some days the Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and criticises the government for not giving enough detail about carbon pricing and then on other days he comes into this parliament and makes figures up as though he can use those figures with any authority. You cannot have it both ways. ",21
5,The SPEAKER,AM MP,Order! The member for Sturt is warned.,22
6,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, this is a government committed to pricing carbon. That means we will make the biggest polluters pay and we will use the revenue that is paid by the big polluters to assist households, to assist businesses to make the transition and to tackle climate change programs. I understand that as the Leader of the Opposition goes around the country he is making people afraid. I am sure he went to that small business today for the sole purpose of making people afraid. But to the Leader of the Opposition I say this: we are a Labor government and we will deliver this change fairly. In the great tradition of reforming bor governments we will get this done and we will get it done with fairness. I say to Leader of the Opposition as well: I hope he took the opportunity during his travels to this small business today to say to every person that he met along the way that, if he is elected and we have provided tax cuts, he will take those tax cuts away; that, if he is elected and we have increased pensions, he will take those increases away; that, if we provide assistance through direct assistance to households and he is elected, he will take that assistance away. I think the Leader of the Opposition should be very clear with Australian families, after the announcement made by his shadow Treasurer yesterday: what he stands for is ripping money out of the purses and wallets of Australians which the government wants to provide. The government is committed to making the biggest polluters in this country pay and using that money to assist households, to assist businesses and to tackle climate change. The proposition is to tax polluters and help households. The Leader of the Opposition's proposition is to tax households and help polluters. That is what he stands for-taking money off decent hard working Australians and giving it by way of subsidies to the biggest polluting businesses in this country. We will get this job done because it is right for the country, no matter how ferocious the Leader of the Opposition's scare campaign. Economy",22
7,Mr CHEESEMAN,AM MP,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is it important to deliver economic reform through a bipartisan commitment to act in the national interest-in particular on climate change?,22
8,Unknown,AM MP,Opposition members interjecting,22
9,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and know he is Laguided in this place by serving the national interest. We had the opposition laugh at this the question because this is an opposition that think the word ‘reform' and the concept of reform are to be laughed at. That is their only contribution to the public debate. It was not always like this. The Liberal Party did not historically lie as low as it does today. Historically the big economic transformations in this country have had bipartisan support. That was true under the Hawke and Keating governments when major reforms like floating the dollar and reducing tariffs got strong bipartisan support. Of course, I was never a fan of former Prime Minister John Howard, but I do give him this: faced with the choice when he was in opposition of going and looking for fear or supporting economic reform in the nation's interest, he chose to support economic reform. Now, in the challenge that we face today, a challenge of pricing carbon, what do we see? Each and every day we see the Leader of the Opposition putting his political interest before the national interest. That is what he does every day that he comes into this place. He uses a scare campaign before even giving the matter any proper consideration or using his better judgment. Let us go through the examples. On national health reform, before I even announced the new national health reform agreement, the Leader of the Opposition was on people's TV screens, bagging it and saying it was wrong. He did not even bother to read it before saying no. On the National Broadband Network, the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly does not understand the power of this technology, before he bothered to inform himself about the economic benefits and the service benefits for Australians, just said no. On the flood levy-and it is a very important example today-when this government were working through how we would fund our commitment to rebuilding Queensland and rebuilding the nation, the Leader of the Opposition just said no. A levy was good enough for him to fund his election promises but it was not good enough for him to support the people of Queensland by supporting that levy. Now, in the tradition of those scare campaigns, we have the Leader of the Opposition trying to raise fear on pricing carbon. I say the Leader of the Opposition that we will keep staring his fear campaign down. What the Leader of the Opposition needs to do is come clean on his attitude to climate change. He should stand before the Australian people and admit that he is a climate change denier. He should come before the Australian people and say that he has supported a carbon tax in the past and that the only reason he says no now is that he is motivated by the politics of the issue. And he should say to the Australian people that he stands for taking assistance out of their hands. If we provide tax cuts to assist, he will take them away. If we provide pension increases to assist, he will take them away. If we provide direct payments to assist, he will take them away. The Leader of the Opposition stands for taking money from Australian households. He should come very clean about that. Carbon Pricing",22
10,Mrs MARKUS,AM MP,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that Labor's $30-a-tonne carbon tax could increase rail fares by up to $70 a year? Given that a carbon tax is meant to encourage people, not discourage people, from using public transport, how will the Prime Minister compensate state public transport authorities so that fares do not skyrocket as a result of her carbon tax?",23
11,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,The member who asked the question started her question with the word ‘given' and then went on to say something to this parliamentMr Hockey interjecting,23
12,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"You can always rely on the shadow Treasurer for a bit of help. I thank him for that; he is much more supportive of me than he is of the Leader of the Opposition and he is being very supportive now! I thank the shadow Treasurer for absolutely admitting to this House that the oppoto sition is predicating its questions on figures that it is just grabbing-that, of course, it is coming into this parliament to raise fear and, in order to do that, it is making things up. The question asked by the member is just about making things up. What I would say to the member opposite is: how is she going to feel in the 2013 election campaign? How is she going to feelMr Christensen interjecting Mr Simpkins interjecting",23

I say to the member who asked the question: how is she going to feel in the 2013 election campaign after this government has successfully priced carbonMrs Markus- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With all due respect, this question is about a $70 increase on rail. I would like the Prime Minister to come to the question and explain how she",24
16,The SPEAKER,AM MP,The member for Macquarie will resume her place. The member for Macquarie has made her point of order. Prime Minister.,24
17,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"Thank you very much. I say to the member, who continues to float figures that she has just made up: how will she feel at the next election campaign when we have successfully priced carbon through this parliament? How will she feel at the next election campaign, when she is honour bound to go to every constituent in her electorate and say, ‘The assistance the Gillard government gave you, Tony Abbott wants back'-that, if we have provided tax cuts, those tax cuts will be taken away and that, if we have provided pension increases, those pension increases will be taken away. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If she is accusing us carbon price, she should stop inventing tax cuts which do not exist.",24
18,The SPEAKER,AM MP,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Swan interjecting,24
19,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"The Deputy Prime Minister will withdraw. Mr Swan-I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",24
20,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"The Leader of the Opposition knows that that was not a point of order, and I say to him that even though it has been the tradition to give leeway to leaders on either side he is stretching the leeway by approaching it in that way. I think that he should leave it at that point. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to my point of order: I take your point and I accept your admonition but, in the same spirit, surely the Prime Minister is also stretching things? I would ask you to ensure that she genuinely answers the question.",24
21,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"Now that the Leader of the Opposition has raised as a point of order what could be characterised as asking me to ensure that the Prime Minister is directly relevant to the question, the Prime Minister has the call and she knows the requirement to be directly relevant to what is a question that, perhaps for my blood pressure, I might have considered ruling out elements of. The Prime Minister has the call.",24
22,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"I say to the member as well: how will she feel in her electorate of Macquarie, saying that her political party is led by a climate change denier and that she stands for no effective action on climate change?",24
23,The SPEAKER,AM MP,Order! The Prime Minister will relate her material to the question.,24

25,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"The member for Indi is warned.  of order. Under standing order 89, I think the words being used by the Prime Minister would be regarded as offensive words. We all know the connotation that the Prime Minister is trying bring about by using the word ‘denier'. We know that she is trying to allude to the Holocaust. It is offensive and it must stop.",24
26,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"With all the sensitivity that the chair can muster, I think that the construction that the Manager of Opposition Business has placed at this point in time is stretching it. The Prime Minister has the call, and the House will come to order.  the Parliament I do not think there is anybody in this place who would ever accuse me of making light of the Holocaust or any issue to do with the state of Israel. I was 11 years as chairman of the Parliamentary Friendship Group on Israel. I make the connection between climate change denier and Holocaust denier. I find it offensive and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition finds it offensive, and in that spirit I would ask you to ask her to withdraw it.",25
27,Unknown,AM MP,Government members interjecting,25
28,The SPEAKER,AM MP,"Order! If people want to personalise this, as a member of this House for 25 years, and in making my ruling earlier, I indicated that I was making that ruling with as much sensitivity as I could muster. No matter how my learned colleague the member for Sturt wants to put his case, I think that it is stretching the bounds of the way in which this House has conducted its business for a member to put his construction on a statement and forcing a withdrawal. I simply say to the House that, actually having come to this flashpoint, I would hope that members take a deep breath and behave in a manner that those who observe us from outside would expect. That would apply to both sides-actually turning down the heat and returning to the basics of what we are here for: that is, to debate the issues and get into the personality clashes that we have seen over many question times. I conclude, regrettably, that we are judged on this hour and a half of our proceedings, and not on the cooperation that is seen about issues that are myriad-including the sensitive issue that I am being lectured upon by a member. The Prime Minister has the call. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order and your comments, which I accept and understand, to assist the House I wish to indicate that I find the Prime Minister's statement both untruthful and offensive. If you do not wish to ask her to withdraw, I just wish to place on the record that it is untruthful and offensive.",25
29,Unknown,AM MP,Government members interjecting,25
30,The SPEAKER,AM MP,Order! I hope that the whole membership of the House would see that as a full stop. The Prime Minister has the call.,25
31,Ms GILLARD,AM MP,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I simply refer the House to the Leader of the Opposition's many past and completely contradictory statements on the question of accepting the climate change science. I also refer the House to the shadow Treasurer's words from yesterday-facts that the member for Macquarie may be interested in, facts on Sky Agenda, where he was asked by the host, ‘You'll repeal the compensation?' to which the shadow Treasurer said, ‘Of course.' That is why I am putting to the member for Macquarie that, if we give tax cuts, you are committed to taking them away; if we give pension increases, you are committed to taking them away; and if we give direct payments then the Leader of the Opposition has committed you to taking them away. Be honest about that with your electorate. NA",25
32,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before callnot ing the member for Robertson, I inform the House that we have a group of students from Matsusaka High School-I apologise for my mispronunciation-who are here in Canberra on exchange. Whilst the school is not directly affected by the quake and tsunami, I think that as young citizens of a nation that in our thoughts it is appropriate that I give them a warm greeting on behalf of the House. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",25
33,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why is bipartisan support for a carbon price necessary so Australia does not get left behind in the race to invest in clean energy?,26
34,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She is right. It would certainly be better if we saw bipartisan support for the major reform that lies in front of this nation. It would be better if the opposition had not given way to denial of the science of climate change. It would be better if the Liberal Party had not turned its back on its traditions and denied the power of markets. It would be better if the Liberal Party accepted what I believe it would have accepted at any other point in its history, which is that it is not right to take money from taxpayers and use that as a subsidy for big polluters, which is what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. It would be better if this major transformation of our economy so we can be a prosperous nation in the future and so we can make our contribution to combating climate change-this big reform-had bipartisan support. Of course, pricing carbon has had support from time to time before they gave way to being in perpetual scare campaign mode and standing for absolutely nothing except raising fear in the community. The government is committed to pricing carbon. We are committed to doing that because I do not want this nation left behind. I want us to invest in a clean energy future. We have to make a start because the rest of the world is moving. We have a high-pollution economy is and we cannot afford to be left behind. We need to start to have our economy transition. Yes, this is going to be a difficult process of reform; I absolutely accept that. But it is a reform the government is determined to lead notwithstanding the fear campaign and scare campaign coming from the opposition. I take the House to the following words-it would be better if the opposition remembered some of these words: Despite an initial protest from industries taxed not only have they survived but many have flourished because the cleaner industry has often proved to be more efficient.",26
35,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is my 1990 thesis.,26
36,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These words were from an opposition member: ‘Pollution taxes encourage companies to decrease discharges of pollutants to the extent that it is less costly to treat waste than to meet the tax bill.' He said these words: ‘Producers have responded to the tax in two ways. First, they have switched to less polluting production processes. Secondly, they have developed new technology to minimise waste created by existing production processes.' There we go. We have those wise words and the member for Flinders owning up to them. No, it was not the member for Wentworth who said that. It was not the member for North Sydney. It was the member for Flinders in his 1990 thesis. We know, of course, that then he was a believer in dealing with climate change. We know that he then endorsed carbon pricing. The truth is that many thinking members of the Liberal Party still do. I appeal to them to be their best. I appeal to them to walk in the reform tradition of the Liberal Party. I appeal to them not to give way to this fear and climate change scepticism and denial. I appeal to them to maintain the historic mission of the Liberal Party: understanding the power of markets. What that means is that they will not be able to follow this man any longer. NA",26
37,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the member for Goldstein, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Ms Helen Evans, who is the interim Chief Executive Officer of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. I am sure that we all would wish her the best in her role, and on behalf of members. I give her a warm greeting. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",27
38,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her comments this morning on radio that she could not provide forecasts of China's or India's future carbon emissions. How does she reconcile that statement with the fact that Professor Garnaut provided her with a report just last month that shows that China's emissions will triple and India's will more than triple in the next 20 years? Can the Prime Minister explain how hitting every Australian with a carbon tax is in the national est when the growth of emissions from China and India alone will completely undo any reductions in emissions in Australia? (Time expired),27
39,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Of course, we have been through these debates before. When we were reducing tariffs there were plenty of people who said, ‘Don't do that until the rest of the world has done it,' and fear was raised about the reduction of tariffs. What has been the outcome of that major economic reform? A more prosperous country that is more resilient to economic shocks, including the global financial crisis; more people in work; and a country that is making its way in the world. But on any day when we were involved in that major economic debate people said that we should not do those things; we should not reform our economy until the rest of the world had acted. To the great credit of the Liberal Party then it believed in economic reform. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party no longer believes in reform of anything. It no longer believes in putting the national interest in front of its political interest. The answer to the honourable member's question is that the rest of the world is moving. President Obama committed to 80 per cent of energy coming from clean energy sources by 2035. China is acting on climate change by closing small, inefficient, dirty power stations and replacing them with bigger, more economically efficient and environmentally friendly ones. China is making new commitments to climate change and to reducing greenhouse gases, including commitments to reducing its carbon emissions per unit of GDP. India is taxing coal from all sources in order to fund clean energy initiatives. India will in April move to an energy credits trading scheme. These are the things that are happening interaround our world. Here we are in Australia with per capita the highest carbon polluting economy in the developed world. That means that the journey of transition that we need to make is a bigger journey. It is in our national interest. Mr Robb- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask whether I should repeat the question. The Prime Minister is so all over the place and not answering the question, I ask you to bring her back to being relevant.",27
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will directly relate the material that she is using to the question.,27
41,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked by the member for Goldstein if it was in Australia's national interest to act. The answer I am ing leads to one conclusion: unambiguously yes. If you want a prosperous country in the future then you are for carbon pricing. If you want to make a difference to climate change and to the degree of carbon pollution emissions in our economy then you are for carbon pricing. If you do not care about jobs, if you do not care about the challenges of the future and if you do not care about the environment then you stick with your scare campaign. We know that the opposition do not care about any of them. The Leader of the Opposition does not care about the prosperity of this country and the future. The Leader of the Opposition does not care about doing the right thing by our environment. That is why, when faced with the choice to act in the national interest, we got this tawdry political display instead.",27

43,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Is the minister aware that the Gulf Country has 131 million megalitres of water whilst all the rest of Australia put together has only 255 million megalitres? Since half of Australia's food is produced in the Murray-Darling with only 22 million megalitres, would the minister not agree that, with Australia becoming a net importer of food within six years, it is imperative to make a start on the proposed microresource development program for the designated five gulf and mid-west towns? These projects, whilst small, nevertheless will each create extra 100 jobs and double the size of four of these towns. Finally, could the minister assure the House that the program's interdegivpartmental task force, promised to be set up in 2010",28

48,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Kennedy for his question. The member for Kennedy raises an issue that he has championed long in this House-the importance and possibility for agricultural growth in the north of Australia. It is true that there are extraordinary quantities of water available in the north and, unless mechanisms are found to be able to better harvest that water, the communities there will not be able to fully take advantage of that. When the Northern task force reported-I think it was a couple of years ago now-I was asked a Water question about the possibilities here, and on behalf of the government I reaffirmed that there is no government policy against the building of weirs or dams and that these were issues that we were very happy to look at. Some of the work that is relevant to what the member has asked goes to the Northern Australia Sustainable Futures Program. It is worth $6 million. It builds on existing government programs to advance the economic, social and cultural interests of people living in the north. Because there are so many different departments and agencies involved, there is now a new Northern Australia Ministerial Forum, which had its inaugural meetan ing on 13 December last year. I am advised it was highly successful in facilitating genuinely collaborative action in Northern Australia. The question also goes to what work is being done purely within government, here, in getting the various agencies in the Commonwealth government to better align to make sure that these programs and possibilities for Northern Australian can finally be brought together. As the member for Kennedy notes, we are not necessarily talking about massive projects but, in terms of the impact on those towns, a very substantial difference in employment prospects and for the future of those areas. On the working group to which you referred, I am advised that, with the approval of the Prime Minister, a working group is being established which will be convened under Minister Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The Minister will be well placed to bring together the key elements of reconstruction following Cyclone Yasi as well as more broadly ensuring that there is a long-term plan for agriculers ture in Northern Australia. The working group will look at resourced development in the five towns of the Queensland Gulf and Midwest in harvesting local water and inland resources. There is no doubt that throughout Australia there are opportunities to better use and more effectively use the water that we have. On many occasions, I have referred to the ambitions the government has within the Murray-Darling, of making sure that we can get healthy rivers, strong communities and sustainable food production. Those same three principles can just as easily be levelled towards the opportunities for Northern Australia. Climate Change",28
49,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why is it important to address the cost of carbon pollution through a market based mechanism?",29
50,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for a very important question because the government, unlike the opposition, believes that climate change is real and that we do need to transform our economy. But this is a very big reform for our economy, a very big structural reform. One of the reasons Australia has had 20 years of continuous growth is past governments and members of this House have signed up to fundamental market based reforms, which have given us a strength and resilience that have served us well and that have given us 20 continuous years of growth. This is a reform that we must embark on to ensure that we have another 20 years of continuous growth and do not fall behind the rest of the world. That is why economists like Nichols Stern and Ross Garnaut are telling us that there is a fundamental problem here that must be fixed. The problem is that the largest pollutjust continue to pump pollution into the atmosphere, and that has cost. It has cost to the environment, it has cost to the community and it has cost to our economy. That is why we must have a market based approach to deal with it. We need to give the largest polluters the incentive to reduce carbon pollution and that is what we have to do. That is why we describe this as a fundamental market based reform. Of course, we are not alone in this view. That is what the Treasury believes we must do. That is what the Productivity Commission believes we must do. It is what the OECD believes we must do. But all the oddballs on the other side of the House are now in climate change denial.",29

56,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I was making was that those opposite do not believe in the power of markets any more. This is a fundamental point. Nor do they apparently believe in the science of climate change. That is a powerful, destructive combination. Not believing in climate change, not believing in global warming and not believing in markets makes them almost the equivalent to the central planners of Russia, decades ago.",30
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will not debate as much.,30
58,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are in denial all of the time about the basic facts, not believing in the basic science and not believing in the basic economics. About 18 months ago some of them did believe in the power of markets, the power of markets to deal with carbon pollution. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say to David Uren and Lenore Taylor, in 2010: I was acting industry minister in 2002 when Peter Costello, David Kemp and I argued … in the Howard cabinet that we should have an ETS. He then went on to sayI believe the market mechanism is the best way price a commodity. That is what the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, believed in 2002. That is what he told a couple of prominent authors in their book about the power of markets and where the view was in the Howard cabinet. It is not the view now. That is why I do describe them-like the British conservative politician did-as oddballs, because they do not believe in the power of markets and they do not believe in the science of climate change. I can see the member for Wentworth over there somewhat embarrassed by the company that he now keeps. The shadow Treasurer has had more positions on climate change than hot dinners and there are plenty of others on that side of the House that fit into the same category. We on this side of the House approach this fundamental- (Time expired) Mr Hockey-I seek leave to table the minutes of the special meeting of the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus where it says, ‘Wayne and Julia said abandon the ETS.'",30

63,Ms MARINO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by the Chairman of to BlueScope Steel, Graham Kraehe, today that the carbon tax meant that there was ‘a high risk of the steel industry reaching a tipping point where it will no longer be viable to keep a steel industry in Australia; and compensation to industry is ‘like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.' Will the Prime Minister guarantee workers in industries like steel plant at Kwinana in outer metropolitan Perth that not one Australian job will be lost overseas as a result of her carbon tax?",30
64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. I am aware of media references to the supposed impact of a carbon price on BlueScope. I am aware of that. The government is aware of the issues confronting BlueScope and will continue to consult with them about the introduction of a carbon price. BlueScope and the broader steel industry were heavily consulted during the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme debate regarding assistance for emissions-intensive, trade exposed industries. Our commitment is to consult with the steel industry. Our commitment is to consult with businesses. We have a business round table for that purpose and, of course, we have a broader outreach than that. As we engage in that broader outreach, let me explain to the member that, with the carbon price mechanism we have announced, we will be putting a price on carbon and we will be getting the biggest polluters in this country to pay that price. That is because we want to cut carbon pollution. At the moment they can put that carbon pollution into the atmosphere for nothing. We will put a price on it. That will drive innovation and change. Then the money raised through that will be used to compensate households. Ms Marino- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. My question was whether the Prime Minister would guarantee that not one Australian job will be lost overasked seas. Mr Laming interjecting",31
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I assume that the member for Bowman is having a discussion with himself. The point of order raised was whether the Prime Minister is being directly relevant, but it was supported by a case that the could be characterised as seeking a direct answer. The standing orders were not changed to require that; so, to the extent that precedent exists, I am using that precedent. There is no way that the chair can dictate how the question is answered, as long as the material is directly relevant. I am listening closely to the Prime Minister's response but, at this stage, I believe it to be directly relevant.",31
66,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was making a point about the use of the revenue raised by putting a price on pollution, paid by the biggest polluters. We have already canvassed in question time today the use of that revenue, and it will be our single highest priority to assist Australian households. That is the assistance that the opposition is opposed to and would take away. The second use of that revenue will be to assist Australian industry. We understand that there is a transition that needs to be made here, and we will be supporting Australian industry in that transition. That is because I believe that we need to act to make sure that our economy has prosperity in the future. We want to protect Australian jobs. We want to make sure Australia has the clean-energy jobs of the future. That is why we need to price carbon. The third use of the revenue raised by putting a price on pollution, which will cut pollution, will be to fund programs to tackle climate change. On the direct engagement of BlueScope, can I say to the member who has the question: I referred a little earlier in my answer to the business round table that is continuing to meet and provide feedback to government. BlueScope is represented on that round table. Paul O'Malley was in attendance when the round table met in November and in February. We will continue to have that round table meet to provide assistance to government in the further design of the carbon pricing scheme. Climate Change",31
67,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister explain the scientific basis to take action on climate change? Minister, is there a credible scientific basis not to take action?",32
68,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Reid for his question, because he has had a long and continuing interest in climate change policy. Climate scientists are telling governments all around the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The scientific advisor to the government's Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the well-recognised scientist, Professor Will Steffen of the ANU, has indicated to the committee that there is 100 per cent certainty that temperatures are increasing globally and that there is 95 per cent tainty that human activity through carbon emissions is contributing to those increased temperatures. Of course, 2010 was the equal warmest year on record and the period 200010 was the warmest decade on record. The scientific evidence is very clear-and it is advice that it has been provided to all governments internationally. But not everyone in this House seems to agree. Eighteen months ago the Leader of the Opposition said: ‘We can't conclusively say whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to climate change.'  der, I put it to you that the question that minister was asked-which I am sure you were listening to as closely as I-did not allow any discussion for the Leader of the Opposition's views on climate change, carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes. It asked about the science to do with climate change, not about people's views in this House.",32
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I will listen carefully to the manner in which the minister directly relates the material to the question. He must directly relate the material to the question.,32

But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not want to be seen as an extremist or a denier these days. He is trying to invite a cloak of respectability.  of order. The minister is defying the indicacertion you gave to him that he must relate his answer to the question. He was not asked about anyone's views in this House.",32
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to the provisions in the standing orders to deal with disruptive conduct. Today we have had points of order to every question that has been asked during question time. It is only permissible for there to be one point of order with regard to relevance. That was the second by the Manager of Opposition Business during this question.",32
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will relate the directly the material that he is using to the question as it was asked. The question asked-and I paraphrase-was: will the minister explain the scientific basis for taking action on climate change and is there a credible scientific basis for not taking action? The minister must respond in a directly relevant way to that question. Whilst I apprefound ciate that there can be argument that is directly relevant-and I have some concerns about allowing argument-the argument must directly relate to the question.,32
76,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked whether there was a credible scientific basis for not taking action on climate change. Of course, when you stop denying the climate science, we will stop calling you a denier. That is the fact of the matter.",33

79,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has occasionally tried to suggest that he respects the science. Apparently, he has instructed the shadow cabinet to keep the debate away from climate science so that they can focus on their scare campaign tactics. He could not even follow his own advice. Carbon Pricing",33
80,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the climate change minister's confirmation today that his department has been in discussion with advertising agencies to conduct an ad campaign to promote her carbon tax broken promise. How is that consistent with her statement on Sunday that no decision had been made to conduct an advertising campaign? When did the government first approach advertising agencies about a carbon tax ad campaign? Why should Australians ever trust her again?,33
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flinders for his question. I have been studying material written by the member for Flinders, and it makes interesting reading. I this article from 20 May 1990, ‘A tax to make the polluter pay,' by Greg Hunt and Rufus Black. It made very interesting reading. In responding to this question from the member for Flinders, I want to let him know that I tracked down that article from 20 May 1990 because he cited it as a source in his thesis, would you believe? ‘Hunt on Hunt'that is how he sourced his thesis.",33

86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Flinders will resume his seat. Mr Hunt interjecting,33
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders is warned. I remind him that a warning is a precursor to naming. Saying this may get me into trouble with some, but the question was badly crafted in that it perhaps had a little too much argument and concluded with something that widened the possibility of a response not directly relevant. Having said that, I think that the Prime Minister has taken that opportunity a bit too far. She will relate her material directly to the question.",33
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was talking him up and I will stop doing that right now. On the question of the advertising campaign that the member for Flinders has asked me about, can I just say the following to him: the government is not ruling any options out; however, at this point the government has taken no decisions on advertising. The department is examining a number of options for public communications and this involves contact with public relations agencies, as is standard practice. Carbon Pricing",34
89,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism. Why is a price on carbon needed to provide investment in the energy sector?",34
90,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The debate about a price on carbon is a complex and difficult economic debate. As minister for energy, I know that better than most in the House. When you look at the fundamentals of the Australian economy, a highly efficient market energy driven system has been the key to the Australian economy. The Australian energy market is actually held up as the most efficient in the OECD world. That goes to a key issue which has to be resolved: our responsibility as a community to debate and finalise the debate about how we put in place once and for all a price on carbon. That goes to the question of certainty. At the moment, the Commonwealth parliament is not responsible for the substantial increases in the price of electricity. There are quite substantial price increases going through the system, because of the need to invest in distribution and transmission. But our problem is that the CEOs in the energy sector have outstanding investments of many billions of dollars going to the question of additional capacity from the point of view of electricity generation. When we talk about this additional capacity, let us deal with a few facts, because these are the problems that confront us as a community from an economic point of view at the moment, because of our lack of certainty with respect to where we go on a price on carbon. Firstly, it is estimated that over $17 billion of capital is required for power generation assets-that is, refinancing, capital expenditure and new build over the next five years. Secondly, and importantly, it is estimated that $6.4 billion of that $17 billion has to be refinanced for existing generation prior to the end of 2012. That is why Brad Page, CEO of the Energy Supply Association of Australia recently said on ABC. He said, ‘We are not talking about short-term investments. We are talking about investments made by the sector that really last for 40 or 50 years and we need stable policy.' With respect to some of these investments, these decisions have to be made in the next two or three years. That is complex at the best of times, because it goes to difficult issues going to environment or regulatory approvals. But, before we can even get to that point, to be able to bank these investments we have to know what the investment horizons are from the point of view of what is a price on carbon. If we do not get this right, then for the first time ever the Australian community will turn its sights on the Commonwealth parliament, because we will be the ones correctly held responsible for failing to guarantee the reliability of the Australian electricity sector. Historically, it has been a state and territory responsibility. If you have any doubts about that from a political point of view of potency, have a look historically at what happens to state and territory governments of all political persuasions when the lights go out. They are held responsible and they soon disappear from office. So I simply say, in conclusion, that the time has come for us to finalise this debate so as to maintain Australia's energy security and reliability and to ensure that the economic vandalism-which the other side of the House will be responsible for, for not allowing us to finalise this once and for all-is overcome. Asylum Seekers",34
91,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the case of three asylum seekers on SIEV 36 who were found by the Northern Territory Coroner to be part of a plan to cripple the boat that led to the deaths of five people, injured 40 more and put the lives of our Defence Force personnel at risk. Will the Prime Minister confirm that each of these people has been granted a permanent visa?",35
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question. I say to the member for Cook that I will make inquiries and report back to the House. Of course, I am not in a position to answer questions about individual visa matters across the many thousands of visas that are granted in the course of a year, but I will look at the matter and, I have something to report back to the House, then I will.  supplementary question to the Prime Minister: if these character test provisions were sufficient to keep out those who sank SIEV 36, how can she say that they will be sufficient to keep out those who are destroying the detention centre on Christmas Island and assaulting Commonwealth officers and destroying taxpayer property?",35
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's supplementary question, I would direct him to the statements of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in respect of his case-by-case assessment of applicants on Christmas Island where he has indicated that, as is proper under the Migration Act, he will assess this case-by-case and where he has also indicated very clearly that there is a character test and he will be applying that character test. I am very interested indeed to see that we have moved off the carbon price scare campaign. Maybe it is going the same way as the flood levy scare campaign. Rail Infrastructure",35
94,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. How is the government's investment in freight rail progressing? How is this helping the nation move into a low-carbon economy?,35
95,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank Member for Page for her question. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who just said we have moved off carbon, she understands that transport and infrastructure is a part of dealing with reducing our carbon emissions, which is precisely what the question was about. We on this side, because we are not sceptics and deniers, believe in action, and we believe in action across government. We know that one tonne of freight carried on rail if only generates one-third of the carbon emissions generated by freight carried on road. We have invested $3.4 billion in the interstate rail network over six years, part of our whole-of-government approach to reducing not carbon emissions. Compared to our predecessors, that is twice as much investment in half the time. Each 1,500-metre train equals 100 trucks-that is, 100 trucks off the road, resulting in less congestion on our roads and fewer carbon emissions in the air. Last week on the North Coast of New South Wales we saw another major milestone in this most extensive upgrade to the nation's freight rail network in almost a century. Last week we began work at Casino on straightening the main north-south line between Newcastle and the Queensland border. This project will take eight months. It will reduce the severity of the curves at some 58 separate locations by realigning the existing track, and this move alone will cut rail transit times across the seaboard by an hour. Under the Howard government, the proportion of freight carried by rail between Sydney and Brisbane actually fell from 24 per cent to 19 per cent. We are determined to reverse that decline. That is why we have a draft national freight strategy out there. is why we have a national ports strategy integrating land transport with our port system. This is investment in critical economic infrastructure. It will strengthen our economy and help secure our future and, in the meantime, it has created 2,000 construction jobs in the sector as well as supporting jobs in manufacturing at factories including those at Grafton in the electorate of the honourable Member for Page. This is good for business, good for productivity and good for reducing our emissions. Asylum Seekers",35
96,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that, in order to comply with the commitment given to rioting asylum seekers on Christmas Island for outstanding security assessments to be completed by the end of April, ASIO will not conduct individual risk assessments for each case but instead make a general assessment for each of the regions from which the asylum seekers originate?",36
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have questions based on chain emails, by the sound of it. I thank the shadow minister for immigration for his question. I can advise him of the lowing. The security assessment process that we do for people whose applications are being processed is, of course, an important part of our border security regime. We, as a government that has deployed more assets patrolling our border than ever before, will of course not be compromising on this very important part of our border security regime. I understand that floating out there are some chain emails and the like, but the facts are these. There has been no deal in regard to security assessments-that is completely untrue. You may have picked that up from an email sent to you, but it is untrue. Over recent months there has been ongoing collaboration between the Australian Security IntelThat ligence Organisation and the immigration department to streamline security checking arrangements to reduce processing times without compromising national security. That means that, for most existing cases, security checking for people whose claims have now been accepted will be completed progressively by the end of April. As you would expect, in some individual cases, completing security assessments will take more time. That is important for Australia's national security and important for the protection of the Australian community, and of course the time necessary will be taken to do those security assessments. That is the answer to the member's question. Carbon Pricing",36
98,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. What would be the impact of rolling back a carbon price on the family budgets of lowto middle-income earners?,36
99,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. A carbon price will, of course, be paid by the large polluters in our economy for every tonne of pollution that they omit. The number of companies fol- that will be liable under a carbon price mechanism will be less than 1,000. Importantly, every dollar raised from the large polluters in our economy will be used to assist lowand middle-income households to support jobs in the most affected industries and to tackle climate change. The assistance that the government will provide will pay particular attention to pensioners and lowincome households. That is because we are a Labor government and we look after people who need help the most. Yesterday, the shadow Treasurer confirmed that, if the coalition are elected, the coalition will abolish any assistance Labor provides to households. If they are elected, the Liberals will reach into the pockets of pensioners and low-income households and families and abolish any assistanceMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",36
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mackellar knows that she needs the call before she will be heard. I was waiting for the House to come to order. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Page 553 of the Practice states, under the old paradigm, that it was irrelevant to compare policies of the opposition with those of the government-that is under the old paradigm. For it to be, under the new paradigm, a direct answer to the question and for the minister to remain in order and continue his answer, he must come back to answering the question and not make those comparisons. It is the third paragraph of page 553, Mr Speaker.",37
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mackellar for her point of order. It is a point of order that she did raise on a number of occasions in the last parliament. For the sake of precision, the Practice does not refer to new or old paradigms-she added that. She should not have suggested that the Practice states that, but that is okay. As she has done in the past-and it is a very good aspect of her training-she has selected parts of page 553 that support her case. I simply invite her to read the full section about content of answers, which indicates that debates, regrettably, within answers have been allowed about the opinions of the opposition or others in the House. Whilst I have concerns, I believe that I have raised those concerns and it is the House to decide whether it wishes to take action. I am listening carefully to the minister's response because I would have thought that he is very conscious in this second opportunity to be directly relevant to the question. I will listen carefully in that context.",37
102,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker; I certainly am conscious of that issue. I was asked about what impact a rollback of the carbon price would have on the assistance provided to family budgets of lowand middle-income earners. As the Prime Minister made the point earlier, if we take the commitment that was made by the shadow Treasurer yesterday on behalf of the coalition to withdraw any assistance provided, if that assistance is provided in the form of tax cuts, the coalition is going to increase taxes. If that assistance is provided in the form of a pension increase, the coalition is going to cut pensions. If it is provided in the form of an improved family tax benefit, the coalition is going to cut the family tax benefit. We all know the truth about all of this: the coalition does not care about the pressure that households are under. Why would they take the assistance away?",37
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister should not drift too far!,37
104,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact of the matter is that, by withdrawing this assistance by potentially increasing taxes and cutting pensions, the coalition need that money to fund their subsidy scheme for large polluters. What we have is a very clear choice in politics: a carbon price paid by the large polluters, the revenue from which can be dispersed partly to support households, pensioners and lowand middle-income households in particular; or, alternatively, we have a slug to taxpayers to the worth of $30 billion, the equivalent of $720 a year for an average household-that is what their policy for means-in order to pay that money as a subsidy to hand-picked large polluters. That is the contrast in politics at this point in time. highlights the reason why the use of a market mechanism is extremely important in pricing carbon in our economy. This is what former Prime Minister John Howard had to say at the Melbourne Press Club on 17 July 2007 in relation to this specific issue of the use of market mechanisms. He said, in relation to people who will not respect the market: They are the real climate change deniers because they deny … rational, realistic and sustainable policy solutions. He went on to say: The moralising tone of utopian internationalism also not helpful. Institutions will only work and endure if they harness national interests. (Time expired)",37

106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Boothby precedent will be applied to the next person who does that. I have indicated that I will allow those who ask a question to attempt to seek leave to table material relating to their question. On two occasions in this question time there has been an attempt by members other than those who have asked questions to table material by leave, and that would give me some sympathy with the Leader of the House's case that that is disruptive behaviour. Mr Albanese interjecting",38
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House should not get too excited. Immigration: Christmas Island Detention,38
108,Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the minister detail when he or his office received warnings about the potenIt tial for increased violence on Christmas Island and who provided those warnings?,38
109,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gippsland for his question. I think the member for Gippsland refers to two reports in today's media. One was an Australian Federal Police report, looking at the added managed security at the North West Point Detention Centre. That report made nine recommendations and my advice is that all nine recommendations were adopted. That report also dealt with the potential for a detention centre capacity of 2,300, which was substantially more than the detention centre capacity is at North West Point at the time of last week's riot. I think that the honourable member is also referring to a report from a manager of Serco in relation to staffing at the North West Point Detention Centre. Both of these reports and any other reports that were provided by the department are matters for investigation by the independent review that I have established.",38
110,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting of order. The minister is not entitled to redefine the question. He was not asked about two reports in the media today. He was asked about any warnings that he or his office were provided with about the potential for increased violence at Christmas Island. That is the question he needs to answer.,38
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! As I have indicated in the past, this illustrates the dilemma that a Chair is in. The Chair does not know the answer. The question has been asked and I am in a position where I have to make sure that the standing order, which is direct relevance, is what we are seeing in the response. Centre So far, I believe that is the case. I understand-and I have repeated this-that sometimes when people ask questions they expect an answer in some form, but I cannot direct the form of the answer.",38
112,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The honourable member asked me about reports and I am referring to the two reports that I am aware of. These reports and other reports will be referred to the independent investigation that I initiated, the independent investigation which will be led by two eminent former bureaucrats, Dr Allan Hawke and Ms Helen Williams. I would invite the honourable member to share any information he has with that review. Health",39
113,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What progress has been made to reform Australia's health system? How have these reforms being received? What is the government's response?,39
114,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,39
115,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It was a great pleasure to be in his electorate with the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing just a fortnight ago announcing the details of the implementation plans resulting from health reform in South Australia. It was very good news in South Australia that, of the 179 subacute beds that are being provided, 159 of them are mental health beds that will be provided across South Australia. There are also upgrades to Modbury Hospital in the electorate of Makin and the Women's and Children's Hospital in the electorate of Adelaide. But even some of those opposite who are interjecting might be interested to know that there are investments at the Repatriation General Hospital in the electorate of Boothby, investments in Whyalla in the electorate of Grey, Mount Gambier in the electorate of BarkerMr Dutton interjecting Mr Briggs interjecting",39
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Dickson and the member for Mayo!",39
117,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Each of those electorates is receiving 20 extra beds. Those who are interjecting need to understand that they are not on the record as indicating whether they support a single cent of those investments that are being rolled out across the country. In New South Wales, for example, there are already 300 beds that are open due to health reform-18 at Blacktown Hospital, 45 at Westmead Hospital, 21 in Wollongong Hospital-and those opposite have never told the public whether they support our investments in those facilities. Last week I was in the electorate of the Minister for Trade announcing $175 million boost to the Logan Hospital that will add 50 more beds and triple the capital works upgrade at the hospital. Similarly, the member for Moreton and I announced a doubling in the size of the emergency department at the QE2 hospital with more help for Brisbane South families. Interestingly, as we get on with the business of health reform, we have also been moving legislation through this parliament. Yesterday the first piece of significant health reform legislation passed in parliament. It was opposed in this House by the Liberal Party. It was opposed in the Senate and again in the House yesterday and, ironically, the opposition led by Mr Abbott actually has opposed legislation that is permanently establishing a body that the Leader of the Opposition established temporarily when he was the health minister. I make this point because it seems that, whether it is carbon, health reform, or whether it is a rolled-gold, rock-solid guarantee, the Leader of the Opposition changes his mind from day to day.

I took an adjudication in running that, whilst it is a robust and perhaps an extreme sort of comment, I in the past indicated when I had another role that the member for Warringah is not necessarily a precious petal and he has a hide. Whilst it may be unfortunate I decided it was not something that I would ask to be withdrawn. But I did not take that point of order as an interruption. I think that that was properly raised with me, but I will allow it on this occasion.",40
120,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to quote to the House the comments from the member for Warringah in 2005 when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing in the days when he supported the need for a safety and quality commission. He said: … a national safety and quality commission will make it more important for doctors to have comprehensive records, access to the best possible information retrieval systems, and useable lists against avoidable mistakes. Apparently these are now good and important changes for the health system that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party no longer support because they are inconsistent and uncertain about every possible policy issue we are debating in this parliament.

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",41
130,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance debate is about the dishonesty and incompetence of the Gillard government. It is with deep regret that I come into this parliament to accuse this government of a pattern of conduct which is not straight, which is not honest, which is not upfront with the Australian public. But it is my job to tell the truth to the Australian public. It is my job to tell the truth about this government, and the truth is that this government has hardly given a single commitment, at the election and subsequently, which has turned out to be truthful. Let me go through a by no means exhaustive list of the deceits and deceptions of this government. There was the carbon tax that was not going to happen before the election but is going to happen after the election. There is the citizens' assembly that would happen before the election but is not going to happen after the election. There is the East Timor detention centre that was definitely going to happen before the election but which is never going to happen after the election. There were the onshore detention centres that were definitely not happening before the election but which are happening in superabundance since the election. There is an onshore detention centre coming to a disused military barracks near you, Mr Speaker, as a result of this government's deception. There was the mining tax, which was totally settled, allegedly, before the election the Ausbut which has completely unravelled and dissolved after the election. There was the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was going to be adopted, sight unseen, before the election but which has completely unravelled after the election. There was the hospital takeover that was so absolutely essential for the good governance of the public hospitals in this country. It was definitely happening before the election but was completely redundant and unnecessary after the election. There was the cash for clunkers scheme that was so important to preserve the environment of this country and indeed the whole planet before the election but which was swiftly dumped after the election. There was the national curriculum that was absolutely-honest to God, hand on heart and hope to die if I tell a lie-going to happen at the start of this year before the election. Now, of course, it is absolutely not going to happen. Then, of course, there was the tax summit that immediately after the election was definitely happening in the first half of this year and was going to debate all of the big issues. Now it is happening in the second half of the year and it is not going to debate any of the big issues. The summit has become a forum, which has become a kind of knitting circle because of the deceit of this government. The Prime Minister will not put a price on carbon. She will not be honest with the Australian public and put a price on carbon right now. I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker: she will pay a price for her consistent deceits. What we have seen from this Prime Minister is a consistent pattern of behaviour. We have seen it since the election, but we saw it before the election. Remember when the member for Sturt was consistently asking questions about the Building the Education Revolution program? He was making it all up! Nothing was going wrong! Everything was perfect-not a single bit of waste; a model of transparency! Now we know that there has scarcely been a more wasteful program in the history of this Commonwealth. This is a Prime Minister who, I regret to say, is addicted to falsehoods. What about the ad campaign? Before the election in 2007, the Prime Minister would tell us that taxpayer funded advertising was an abuse. That is what she said. But soon the printing presses would be rolling and there would be taxpayer funded propaganda galore to defend the Prime Minister's pre-election lie. But it does not stop there. She knows so much about China! This is the country which, according to the Prime Minister, is closing down coal-fired power stations left, right and centre, and yet the truth is it is opening a new coal-fired power station every fortnight to feed its voracious appetite for energy. This is the Prime Minister who tells us that as a result of her carbon tax there be jobs galore. There will be jobs at the corner store thanks to the carbon tax! All sensible economists have concluded that at least two jobs are killed in traditional industries for every so-called green job created as a result of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes. She tells us on the one hand that the rest of the world is acting on climate change and that we have to catch up. Then she tells us on the other hand that we have to provide an example to the rest of the world so that they might finally act on climate change. Then there is the fantasy island that this Prime Minister is living on when she starts telling the parliament, as she has repeatedly over the last few days, that somehow the coalition wants to hit people for a $30 billion carbon tax to fund our direct action program. We heard the Prime Minister yesterday boasting in the parliament about all the scripture she knows. Ooh, yes! Didn't she pay a lot of attention in scripture classes all those years ago! Well, I can remember one passage of scripture. I might not be able to cite scripture to match the Prime Minister, but I do remember ‘thou shalt not bear false witness'-and she has hardly done anything else in this parliament over the last few weeks. Somehow that must be one of the passages of the Bible that she forgot when she made that little stroll from scripture class to the Socialist Forum. Somehow, as she went from God to Marxism, she forgot that bit of the Bible that says ‘thou shalt not bear false witness'. In fact, I am not a doctor, but I think we are in the presence of a condition, a chronic condition: TDD-truth deficit disorder. That is what we have seen from our Prime Minister in recent days. As she comes into this parliament it is almost as if she is trying to earn frequent liar points, as she lies through question time. I have to say, I reckon frequent liar points would be a marketable will commodity inside this Labor caucus. Let me tell the truth about the government's carbon tax. It is that at $26 a tonneand that is the price that the Treasury put on carbon for the purposes of modelling the emissions trading scheme-a carbon tax will add $300 to the average family's power bill-just for starters. At $26 a tonne it will add 6½c to a litre of petrol-just for starters. At $26 a tonne it will add $6,240 to the price of a new house-just for starters. At $30 a tonne it will add $70 to the price of average annual rail transport in Sydney-and that is just for starters. Let me say this: no compensation is adequate for the seismic shock that this carbon tax will deliver to our economy. There will be 126,000 jobs lost in regional Australia, according to Access Economics. There will be 16 coal mines shut and 10,000 jobs lost in the coal industry alone, according to ACIL. There will 24,000 jobs lost in the mining industry more generally, according to Concept Economics, and there will be 45,000 jobs gone in energy-intensive industries, according to Frontier Economics. It is this cost in jobs and this hit on people's standards of living-the hit on the standard of living of struggling families who are already finding it difficult to cope-which meant that the Prime Minister had to tell an untruth before the election. That is why she had to deceive the Australian people before the election. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: does anyone in this chamber or this country honestly believe that the Prime Minister would now be in the Lodge if she had honestly said six days out from the election, ‘Yes, I cannot tell a lie; there will be a carbon tax under the government I lead'? Everything that this Prime Minister does, and everything that this government does, is built on a foundation of falsehood. It is now a fundamentally illegitimate government which simply cannot be trusted by the Australian people. Let me make a few observations, if I may, in response to some of the claims that we have had from the Prime Minister and her ministers in question time this week. A carbon tax is not an economic reform; a carbon tax, in the absence of comparable action by the rest of the world, is nothing but economic self-harm. It will seriously damage the Australian economy. Above all else, it will export jobs overseas. Under this government, Australia's latest export is going to be your job: that is the message to the workers of Australia. It will export jobs and it will damage the standard of living of Australians. Increasing taxes is not economic reform; reducing taxes-that is economic reform. A tax cut based on a tax increase is not a cut: that is a con. A tax cut based on a tax increase is a mirage-it is an absolute mirage, and yet that is what we are being offered by this government. Let me give some fundamental economics to members opposite: robbing Peter to pay Paul is not tax reform. Robbing Peter to pay Peter is even less tax reform, and what we have from this government is not tax cuts and not even the rumour of tax cuts. If they are fair dinkum about tax cuts, let us see them in the budget. The hole in the heart of the budget that is coming up will be its complete failure to reference (a) a carbon tax or (b) any tax cuts. This is a fraud from a fraudulent government. I say this to members opposite: if they are serious about tax reform, they know how it is done-or they should know how it is done, because they have the example of the former government to guide them. Serious tax reform is based on a serious and permanent reduction in government spending. Serious tax reform is based on a permanent policyinduced improvement in Australia's competitive position or in its productivity. That is the foundation of serious tax reform and that is the kind of thing that they would get from this coalition, should we have the chance. And that is the kind of thing that you will never get from this government-all you will get from this government is the kind of consistent deceit on a carbon tax that we have seen over the last few days. Not only is this government deceptive but it is a government which is increasingly a shambles. We saw that on the weekend: here you had the Prime Minister doing a half-hour interview on tax while, unbeknownst to her, the Deputy Prime Minister was tweeting about the tax summit. Here you had the Prime Minister of this country saying one thing about a no-fly zone while the foreign minister was saying a completely different thing about a no-fly zone. The fact is that they do not know what they are doing-they cannot even talk to each other. This is not a government; it is more like Wollongong council than an adult government of a decent country.",41
131,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have to admire the irony of the member for Warringah coming in here and speaking to a broad based, broadbrush MPI-there are no specifics in it at all-about conviction and about truthfulness. The member for Warringah-the Leader of the Opposition-is indeed a conviction politician. He has a conviction that he should have been Prime Minister and that he should have won the election last August. But he lost, and what we have seen since then is played out before all of the Australian people: that frustration and anger. Do you remember the Mark Riley moment? All of us saw that there, and we see it across the chamber in question time all the time: the anger, sheer frustration and aggressiveness that a position which he believes is his by right should not be just given to him. Let me tell you: you have to earn the trust of the Australian people. There is no reason whatsoever why the community should trust the Leader of the Opposition. You just have to listen to what he said himself. On 17 May last year in an interview on The 7.30 Report he said: … sometimes, in the heat of discussion, you go a little bit further than you would if it was an absolutely calm, considered, prepared, scripted remark, which is one of the reasons why the statements that need to be taken absolutely as gospel truth is those carefully prepared scripted remarks. So forget about everything that he has said in here today; he himself in his own words says that you cannot believe him because they were not carefully scripted remarks. There is no wonder that there is some nervousness from those behind him, because his colleagues do not trust him either. He said this during the Howard years, episode 4-it is a great little quote about the Howard-Costello leadership: Inevitably in those conversations you, to give comfort and reassurance to people, probably say things like “Mate, it'll be your turn pretty soon and I'll be on your side when that turn, when that time comes.” … … … Look, all sorts of things get said in those late night comfort sessions and I'm not going to say that I never said anything like that. … … … But it's one thing to pledge undying love late at night after lots of booze, another thing in the cold light of day to actually do some of these things. And it's wrong to think that late night love talk is necessarily going to be acted upon in the same way that a legal contract is going to be acted upon. The Leader of the Opposition in his own words-deceitful not just to the Australian public but to his own colleagues. Remember after August, when the Leader of the Opposition made grand statements about a kinder, gentler parliament? Remember that we were going to agree that the Speaker and Deputy Speaker would be paired. We were going to change the operations of this parliament. But he said, ‘I think we can have a kinder, gentler polity;' on 24 August. On 18 September he said: The important thing in the weeks and months and years ahead is to channel that disappointment and that frustration constructively and the only structive way to channel that frustration and appointment is to redouble our attacks on the Labor Party. That is what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition: whether it is on the National Broadband Network, national health reform or tackling climate change, his first instinct-indeed, his only instinct-is to oppose. Remember that he said on 3 February 2010 on the Neil Mitchell program: No, no, we'll go to the election campaign, Neil, with a list of promises, a list of commitments and we will fund them without new or increased taxes. That lasted till May and his budget reply, when he said on 13 May 2010: … the fairest way to have a paid parental leave scheme anytime soon is through a modest levy on companies' taxable income … Lasted three months, that one. But, of course, earlier on, when he was actually in government and in a position to do something about something that this government has fixed, he said: I'm dead against paid maternity leave as a compulsory thing. … … … … compulsory paid maternity leave: over this Government's dead body, frankly. It just won't happen. So when he is in opposition, after this government takes action on this issue, he says: It's high time this country had a national paid parental-leave scheme. Of course we remember what he had to say about Work Choices. He says, of course, that they are not going to return to Work Choices, but this is what he had to say on 19 March 2008: The Howard government's industrial legislation was good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers and let's never forget that. He went on, on 13 August, to say that workcon- place reform was one of his greatest disachievements. In Battlelines in July 2009 he said: Work Choices was a political mistake, but may not have been an economic one. So we know from the whole frame of policy that the Leader of the Opposition is someone who has no vision for the country and is determined to oppose for opposition's sake. That is no way to appear to be an alternative leader of the country. But, of course, there is nowhere more critical to his failure than in his attitude towards taking action on climate change. He was part of a government that was frozen in time while the world warmed around it. While other countries were taking actionwhile the north-east states in the US were setting up an emissions trading system, when the Chicago Climate Exchange was being established, when the Europeans were introducing an ETS-the Howard government, of course, captured by climate and market sceptics, refused to act until the end. We know that the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, in 2002 took an ETS to the cabinet and got rolled. Then Prime Minister Howard refused to take action on climate change until he was in trouble in the lead-up to the 2007 election. He had a bit to say at the Melbourne Press Club at the Hyatt hotel on 17 July. I encourage those opposite, who say they are the inheritors of the Howard legacy, to go have a look-not the shadow Treasurer, who gets it and knows in his heart of hearts that action on climate change is necessary, as do the member for Wentworth and a range of people over on that side of the House. They know that some action has to be taken on climate change. But this is what Prime Minister Howard said in 2007. Think about the current debate that is going on when you listen to these words: In the face of risk, a prudent conservative takes insurance. We should, in the words of Rupert Murdoch, give the planet the benefit of the doubt given the potential dangers of climate change. That is a pretty good sentiment. We agree with that. He also spoke about the responsibility that this generation has to future generations. He termed it, perhaps differently from how I would: The Burkean sentiment-that society is a partnership between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are yet to be born-comes as second nature. I disagree that it is second nature to those opposite. I think one of the defining divisions in Australian politics today is between those on the two sides of the chamber. We take a view about the long term, whether it be action on climate change, action on the National Broadband Network, investing in education or investing in infrastructure. But this is what then Prime Minister Howard had to say further on: Now we must position Australia for a low carbon future. We face a major new reform challenge in designing an emissions trading system and setting a long-term goal for reducing our emissions in absence of a global carbon scheme. He then said: Australia brings formidable assets to this challenge: an educated, can-do and adaptable people a modern; flexible economy; world class scientific expertise; deep global engagement and an enviable reputation for institution-building and reform. We have mobilised these assets before and will do so again to help build a new global climate change framework and to facilitate Australia's transition to lower carbon emissions. No great challenge has ever yielded to fear or guilt. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to think about that. I say to those opposite that this government will also not be yielding to the fear campaign of the climate sceptics opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, then Prime Minister Howard went on to talk about the importance of market based mechanisms and those who oppose market based mechanisms. He said: They are the real climate change deniers because they deny rational, realistic and sustainable policy solutions. He went on to say: Being among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will bring new opportunities and we intend to grasp them. It is extraordinary that those opposite have walked away completely from that view. It took John Howard a long time to get to that view, but eventually he did get there-in July 2007. We know that Lord Stern in his seminal report referred to climate change as the world's greatest market failure. Indeed it is. Because we fail to put a price on emissions, high carbon polluters can emit for free and someone else pays the cost. The idea that it is free is an illusion. The cost is paid not just by this generation but by future generations, which is why this government is determined to ensure that polluters pay and that we use the that payment by the big polluters-up to the 1,000 top companies emitting pollution-to provide assistance to households and businesses for adjustment and support for climate change action. Those opposite want to take taxpayers' money and give it to the big polluters-$30 billion of it; $720 each. They want to put their hand in everyone's pocket. The shadow Treasurer said yesterday that they not only want to remove the price on carbon but will remove any assistance that is there, whether it be tax cuts, direct payments and assistance, support for pensioners or support for industry. That is an extraordinary proposition from those opposite. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has made a fundamental error, because straight away he was out there just opposing the price on carbon. The second position he took was that he would not just oppose that but oppose the assistance measures that will occur. And then there is this nonsense about, ‘Put it in the budget.' We have announced when it comes in-1 July 2012. We have made that announcement, so you can discount this nonsense and windbaggery from those opposite. The third and perhaps most significant mistake he made was completely aligning the opposition with the climate change sceptics and ratbags. There are people out there who have extreme positions on these issues and the Leader of the Opposition wants to mobilise them in his so-called people's action-and we will see some of it outside Parliament House tomorrow. He has become a hostage to these climate change deniers and that is why we see contradictions day after day. Last week, within 24 hours, we saw: ‘Climate change is nonsense; the science is not proven,' and, ‘No, I think climate change is real.' That was within 24 hours because he is, as the member for Wentworth said, trying to be a weathervane on these issues. The same person who says, ‘There is no doubt that climate change is real; there is no doubt that mankind contributes to it,' is just as capable of saying, ‘Climate change is crap.' Then he has the gumption to come before this chamber and speak about truthfulness and being fair dinkum with the Australian people. Just as the flood tax scare not work, the scare campaign on this will not work. The Australian people are better than that. They want a positive future not just for them but for their kids and their grandkids. Those of us in this chamber who have had the privilege of seeing the Great Barrier Reef want our kids and grandkids to have that privilege as well. (Time expired)",44
132,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As each day passes in this place and in public life you build your integrity, like putting aside grains of sand one at a time, with the Australian people and the people you represent in this place. Over time when you have to make hard decisions you will go to that bank and spend a bit of the good fortune. What we have seen from this government, particularly in relation to the carbon tax, is the expenditure of everything in the bank and a request for the Australian people to go into deficit. This government from the very beginning, as my leader said earlier today, has engaged in deceit. It has engaged in deceit on a spectacular level. The now Prime Minister wants the Australian people to believe that she has had to undertake this deceitful path because she does not control the numbers in the House, but the truth is that in the caucus minutes of the special meeting of the federal parliamentary Labor Party on Thursday, 24 June, Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard were referred to specifically by the Prime Minister they had deposed overnight. That Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, said: Equally strong was the advice from Wayne and Julia that the emissions trading scheme policy had to be abandoned. He did not say why. This Prime Minister feigns significant concern about the environment. I do not know whether she has been asked this question but I think she needs to give the Australian people an answer: why did did she in April last year advise the then Prime Minister to dump the emissions trading scheme? Why did the Treasurer advise the then Prime Minister in April of last year to dump the emissions trading scheme? Now everyone in this 24-hour opinion cycle has a view, but the view I want is from the mouth of the Prime Minister. Why did she advise Kevin Rudd to dump the emissions trading scheme? If it is a matter of such grand principle, if this is the fight to end battles, the Prime Minister needs to explain to the Australian people why she shirked that fight in April of last year. And the Prime Minister needs to go further and explain to the Australian people exactly why she emphatically promised them not once but twice during the course of an election campaign that she would not lead a government that had a carbon tax-specifically referring to a carbon tax. The Prime Minister was doing that with the full knowledge that, were she to be re-elected, she would rely, almost inevitably, on the Greens for the balance of power in the Senate. That is the second great deceit in relation to this matter. The third great deceit is the announcement, in the presence of Bob Brown and Christine Milne, of the carbon tax itself. I am still amazed that the Treasurer of Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, was not there for the announcement of what he keeps referring to as a major economic reform. It is quite extraordinary that the Treasurer was not there. But what is more interesting is that the Greens' deputy leader said it was a shared power arrangement between the Labor government and the Greens. I wonder what the earlier speaker in this debate, the member for Grayndler, would have thought about thatas he comes to the point where his wife is about to be knocked off by a Green in her seat in New South Wales on Saturday. There is the Prime Minister praising the Greens, and now the Greens are the mortal enemy of the Labor Party in New South Wales. How does that work? Not only is Carmel Tebbutt in serious trouble, but the member for Grayndler's protege, Verity Firth, is in trouble. If there are going to be those defeats on Saturday, I say to you: Julia Gillard's unstinting praise of the Greens must have had some impact, because Julia Gillard was endorsing the Greens when she was not endorsing Carmel Tebbutt, Verity Firth, the Labor canall didate in Melbourne or Labor senators who have aspired to try to knock off the Greens in the Senate. What a confused web we weave. It goes further. The government then sees that it is bleeding. It announces a tax without a price. It announces that it is going to exclude one industry, agriculture, but it does not talk about other industries. It is a confused announcement. Out of that we had a great revelation. It was the fact that the government was caught without any clothes in relation to compensation. The government was clinging to the debate about the environmental justification for the carbon tax but it was losing; it was sinking. Along comes Ross Garnaut, who says: ‘Well, here's the Henry review. Remember this? We'll dust it off.' The government adopted three of 138 recommendations. ‘Guess what: let's grab the Henry tax review tax cuts. That's the way we can provide compensation.' At first the government thought that was a great idea and its great advocates in the gallery and great commentators out there were saying: ‘This is brilliant politics. Give tax cuts. The coalition can't oppose them.' The only problem was that the Henry tax cuts actually delivered significant financial benefits to people earning above $200,000. In fact, if you earned $300,000 you would get nearly $5,000 in the Henry tax cuts. We do not oppose those sorts of tax cuts, but what we have a problem with is that middle Australia is going to pay more. Those on $40,000 to $90,000 are actually going to pay more, not less. The government went, ‘Hang on; this is a problem. We didn't think about this when we talked about Henry. Ross Garnaut? Well, he's an adviser. He's not part of the team, really.' So what happens is another thought bubble from the government, the low income tax offset. ‘Let's pull that out of the can: the low income tax offset, a great idea. We can run with that. That's how we'll provide compensation to low-income Australians.' There is just a little problem. Ken Henry recommended it be abolished. ‘Don't worry about Ken Henry. No, we'll get the dust back on that report. We'll never see it again. Aha-the low income tax offset!' But there is just a little problem: it is a rebate, people will be out of pocket as the tax kicks in. They will only get a rebate at the end of the financial year-or, for some, they will get up to 50 per cent, but they will be worse off. Oh dear! The government says, ‘We're going to give compensation and we're going to give tax cuts.' Today, on Neil Mitchell's program, the Prime Minister was asked repeatedly about the numbers. She could not answer. That is because they do not have an answer. That is because they are making it up as they go, and this is the fundamental point. When we get criticised by some for winding back compensation it is a simple point: if you do not inflict pain, you do not need painkillers. It is simple. And do you know what? This government wants to impose a carbon tax. You do not have to have compensation if you are not penalising people with a carbon tax. I felt I was in another universe during today's question time, when the Prime Minister was speaking like a modern-day riddler. What the hell was she saying? How confused is this debate that the Prime Minister has led Australians down? All she can do is say that we are running a scare campaign. We are not doing it-the Prime Minister is doing it. It is all her own work. She is the master of the evil. She is the one that is running this scare campaign, because she does not understand what she is saying. So I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we will oppose the carbon tax because it is bad policy. We will not need to compensate people because we will not inflict pain on the Australian people. This is a government that does not know what it is doing. You have a Treasurer that did not know that John Fahey was going to be appointed. You have a Prime Minister that did not know a Treasurer was going to announce a tax summit. You have a government that is in confusion and denial. You have a foreign minister that is declaring so war on Libya and a Prime Minister that does not want to do it. What is going on in the joint? The clowns are running the show. (Time expired)",47
133,Ms ONEILL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I relish this opportunity to speak to today's matter of public importance. I seize it as an opportunity-I will see if I can keep the volume up to the same level as the member who has just finished speaking-to put on the record yet again evidence of the competence of this Labor government and to highlight our proud record in these dark days of fear and loathing propagated by those opposite. What we have endured today is just another tedious moment in the farrago of fear campaigns mounted by those opposite. That is right: a farrago of fear campaigns. This Labor government respects facts and their context. That is why we are getting on with the job of dealing with the pressing realities that we face as a nation-not the myths and mysterious machinations of those opposite who are trying to create some ‘fear bubble' that will prevent the whole of Australia from moving forward. I particularly want to point out the facts around our determination to move to a clean energy future for our kids and for our nation. Carbon pricing: it is the hot topic. You want to talk about it? Well, to quote a great Australian woman, our Prime Minister: ‘Let's bring it on.' Let's talk about the factual basis and the reality that we need to face on climate change. Let's talk about the fact that the multidecadal trend from 1980 to 2009 has been warming at 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. That is a fact; let's get some facts on the table instead of this hypocrisy that we are hearing from the other side of the chamber today. This trend has not slowed down during the 2000-09 decade. It is a fact that the decade 2000-09 was the warmest decade on record-significantly warmer than the 1990s, which in turn were significantly warmer than the 1980s. These are inconvenient facts for those opposite, and we have seen them take every political position on this issue from 1980 through to today. They have form in this area, a vacillation: ‘We do believe it', ‘We don't believe it', ‘We do believe it'. It changes quicker than the weather. Take a look at the spike in the graph of northern hemisphere surface temperature in the post-industrial age. It is a fact. It cannot be denied by those who attend to facts, but those who want to make it up as they go and change the story from day to day continue to look for signs that they read in the waters or something, about the mythology that they create daily here in this place. Look at the loss of the Arctic Sea ice. Look at the graph of global sea-level change between 1970 and 2008. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. It is really happening, guys. You need to open your eyes, you need to look around, and you need to listen to the factual evidenceMr Laming- Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would ask that the member address members by their title.",49
134,Ms ONEILL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Climate change is evident from all of these increases in global average air and ocean temperature. There is melting of snow and ice. There is a rising of sea levels. This is scientific fact-not science fiction, as preferred by those opposite. It is this government that is taking the action necessary to meet the reality that exists right before our eyes. In the past, conservatives in our society have been wont to deny science that challenges their cosy little world view. With Darwin and the theory of evolution, Galileo and the fact that the Earth revolves around the sun, Einstein and the theory of relativity: there were sceptics to all of these things. However, these are scientific facts. They are facts that challenged the orthodoxy of the time and they were hotly disputed. As surely as the Earth goes around the sun, there will be those who, for whatever reason, are challenged by science fact. Perhaps they did not pay attention in year 8 science and they did not quite get the concepts mastered. If most of the scientists in the world are scientists the who publish in peer reviewed journals, if 97 out of 100 specialists in a field are telling us that something is a fact, it is time to pay attention. There were people in the 19th century who misconstrued the theory of evolution and insisted that they were not a monkey's uncle. Just as we had that kind of wilful misconstruing of the facts in the 19th century, we have it as well today in relation to the climate change debate by those opposite. In place of the monkey's uncle, we have got the modern equivalent in this chamber. We have people like the member for Tangney, who plays games like dunking bits of carbon at the doors. They rail and rant against the increasing and overwhelming body of reputable scientific evidence. It is clearer every day to the Australian people that our government, the Gillard government-in stark contrast with those opposite-is willing and has the courage to act on factual information across so many policy areas. It just so happens that these are the areas of policy failure amongst those opposite. And so to the matter of competence. Competence begins from a base when you actually get the facts right. We got the awful facts right when we took over from the Howard government and had to clean up the mess that the Leader of the Opposition left in his previous role as John Howard's minister for health. What we inherited was a completely run-down system from which $1 billion had been ripped out. It was a system that was in crisis due to a lack of foresight and a loss of vision for this country, a system that had been robbed of proper funding and training places for doctors and nurses, a system that was experiencing crises in staffing every day because those opposite could not see the reality. They could not identify the facts. They still cannot; but we did. That is why, since we were elected, we have moved to implement our landmark health and hospital reforms: reforms that will provide better health and better hospitals for Australian working families. This was the most significant reform to the Australian health and hospitals system since the introduction of Medicare-and it took a Labor government to do it. We are not frightened of the big tasks that lie at the heart of leading this great nation. What was the Leader of the Opposition's response? As the Prime Minister noted in question time today, the day she forged the agreement with the states, he denounced it before she had even announced it. Carping negativity can do nothing to enhance the outcomes for our Australian people. What a disgrace! These health reforms, which will deliver $7.3 billion in investments over the next five years, 1,300 new sub-acute hospital beds, elective surgery delivered in clinically recommended times for 95 per cent of Australians and training for 6,000 more doctors, including doubling the number of GPs trained every year, were denounced before they were announced. We know the Leader of the Opposition suffers from envy. Perhaps it is the only way in which he is ‘green'. And why would he not be envious of this great government led by our Prime Minister? There will be better support for nurses working in GP and primary care, aged care and mental health; a national after-hours GP service, with a 24-hour hotline that provides GP advice and can arrange a follow-up visit in your local community; support to upgrade around 425 GP practices and health clinics across the country so that GPs can expand their facilities and locate more services in a single community location; support for 2,500 additional aged-care beds; a personally controlled electronic health record for every Australian who wants one; new investments in prevention, including tough new action tackling smoking; and new investments in mental health services, with 20,000 extra young people per year to get assistance. This is a small smorgasbord of our competent action in the area of health. It is a testimony to the fact-yes, the fact-that it is the Gillard Labor government that is absolutely acting in the interests of ordinary Australians. Our action is competent, welcomed and determinedly improving the health and well-being of our young, our aged, our environment, our economy and our future. When it comes to health, infrastructure and climate change, it is not just an inconvenient truth. When it comes to all the substantial issues of fact that we are addressing as this government, the Leader of the Opposition just cannot handle the truth. He is far more comfortable with-what is that word we are not allowed to say?-denial.",50
135,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cook) (4.25 pm)Today's matter of public importance deals with the government's failure to act competently and provide factual information. In my own portfolio of immigration and citizenship-to borrow a phrase from the previous speaker-there is a lot of inconvenient truth for the government. In the short time. I have available, there are many matters that I could mention to highlight how misleading and how untruthful the government has been and the extent of the failures of this government in this area of policy. We could go back to the great statement of the former Prime Minister, who said in relation to the Oceanic Viking that there was no special deal. We all remember that one, and we all remember the very special deal that they received on that occasion. Or we could go to another example-when, as recently as this morning, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship told Fran Kelly on the ABC that all of those who had broken out of the North West Point detention centre had been accounted for. But in the Senate this afternoon we learnt that all had been accounted for except for four. Apparently, four detainees here or there breaking out of our detention centre is not something we can take terribly seriously, according to the minister. This is a government that continually peddle mistruths, misunderstandings and inaccurate information about the scale of their ings. Most fundamentally, these failings and these mistruths appear in one of the most important documents the government publish each year, and that is their own budget. In the budget this year, for 2010-11, the government came in here and asked for $471 million for asylum seeker management. That is a lot of money-and it is certainly a lot more money than they asked for the previous year, which was around $170 million. What was more troubling was that they said that this was only going to be in order to accommodate some 2,000 arrivals this financial year. That figure was exceeded by about December in this financial year, if not earlier. government then came back into this place for their own budget most recently and asked for another $290 million, on top of the $470 million, to pay for the blow-out in their costs due to the failure of their policy of asylum seeker management in this country. It is now costing $760 million in the additional estimates. But the untruths do not stop there, because it says in the additional estimates that the costs for asylum seeker management are going to fall from $761 million this year-and this is in the government's budget-to $239 million next year. So there is going to be a half a billion dollar decline in the government's budget from this year to next financial year. That is the untruth that this government are trying to present to the Australian people about the cost of their failures in border protection. If costs stay at the current level of $760 million a year over the next three years, that is going to blow a $1½ billion hole in the government's budget. That is on top of the $1.4 billion excess they have already had in blowing out costs in this area. So the government cannot even get the costs right in their own budget or tell the truth about the real costs of their policy failures. Then there is the great statement from the failgovernment about push factors causing the problems that we are seeing writ large on a daily basis-whether it is riots or boats turning up or the various other chaos we see around the country in relation to this matter. They say that it is all because of push factors and they are not to blame. The UNHCR recently released their figures for the first six months of 2010. That showed that, in the 44 industrialised countries, there was a 13 per cent decline in asylum applications around the world, but in Australia there was a 78 per cent increase. There was a 78 per cent increase in Australia compared to a 13 per cent decline all around the world-whether you The are talking about the European Union, where figures fell by as much as 15 per cent, or if you are talking about non-European countries or North America, where figures showed there was an 11 per cent decline. In Australia we defied the rest of the world, and the government say it is due to push factors. No, it is due to their own policy failings. They also said that Nauru and the Pacific solution did not work. I do not know what figures they are using to back that up; all I know is that in the six years that followed the introduction of that solution the boats basically stopped coming. One day in 2008 they started coming again; that was when they reversed the policies of the previous government. They said that the Pacific solution was a terribly costly solution. In fact, Senator Evans, in February 2008, said: The Pacific solution was a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise introduced on the eve of a federal election by the Howard government. By the government's own admission in this statement, the total running costs for the Pacific solution at both Nauru and Manus Island was-and you may remember this figure-$289 million. That is less than the government asked for in this year's budget alone as a top-up. Apparently that $289 million was an excessive waste of money over almost six years; but they spent that in six months. This is what the government says is a waste of funds. They also say that basically everyone who went to Nauru and Manus was ultimately resettled from the OPCs to Australia or other countries. In fact, they say it was 90 per cent; that is the minister's favourite figure. But I have to refer him to the statement of Senator Evans: A total of 1,637 peoplethis is while Senator Evans was the minister for immigrationwere detained in the Nauru and Manus facilities, of whom … 70 per centnot 90 per cent but 70 per centwere ultimately resettled from the OPCs to Australia or other countries. Of those who were resettled, around 61 per cent … were resettled in Australia. Of more importance was the report by Labor Senator Peter Cook about the Pacific Solution. He said: The so-called Pacific Solution has achieved its objective of preventing on-shore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals. … those who are successful in their claims have no presumed right to resettlement within Australia. That is why the boats stopped: because we took away the certainty of the product that the people smugglers were selling in Indonesia and throughout the region. That is why it worked. The government does not want to believe this works, but the figures speak for themselves: the boats stopped and the program worked. It has cost less in six years than this government asked for in six months, yet they peddle this myth that they do not want to go back to Nauru. They also said before the election that they would not be expanding the onshore detention network. They were almost rightexcept for 4,900 additional beds that they have announced since the election. This is a government that has announced more beds in the detention network than they have announced for public hospitals-and they are apparently the ‘health government'. Maybe, if public patients were able to get a bed in a detention centre, they would be better off. But they cannot get a bed there because all of those beds in our detention network are very much full. This is a government who said they would not be expanding the onshore detention network. They did say they would open beds in East Timor though. It has been eight months since the Prime Minister stood at the Lowy Institute and said, ‘We are going to establish this you-beaut processing centre in East Timor.' Eight months and more have passed and we are no closer to it today-in fact, we are further away from it than at any time prior. I compare that to the performance of the Howard government, who announced the establishment of Nauru and 19 days later it was open for business. So in 19 days John Howard achieved what this government has not been able to achieve in eight to nine months. We continue to see this East Timor processing centre being something of the never-never. There is also the great deterrent the minister has talked about, ‘If people get a no, they go home.' On 19 October the minister said that the biggest disincentive we could put on people coming to Australia is, ‘If you are not a genuine refugee, you will be sent home.' Senate estimates revealed that over a period of two years when the boats have come, four people from Afghanistan have gone home voluntarily. This is the big disincentive and it does not operate when you get to the ground. Finally, I note that the asylum freeze has probably been one of the greatest contributing factors-other than boats arriving-for this government which has created the chaos we have seen on Christmas Island in recent times. The Prime Minister described this when she was Deputy Prime Minister as a ‘decision in the national interest'. I ask her this: is it in the national interest that we riots on Christmas Island caused by the failure of this government to get a handle on its borders and its detention network. It is clearly not the case.",51
136,Ms GRIERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a great pleasure to rise on what I see as an MPI set by this incompetent opposition-an own goal, all its own work. It is quite ironic to be speaking on a motion that speaks of the failure to act competently or provide factual information. I noticed when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, he was not speaking from carefully prepared and scripted remarks. So I suppose again: no gospel truth, nothing we can rely on, and acts of deceit quite possibly. What a great opportunity this MPI presents to outline what it feels like to be part of a competent government: a government that does act in the national interest, that is committed to reform, that will make the tough decisions and that will make those decisions informed by evidence and sound advice, just as we acted competently in the global financial crisis-again providing leadership in the national interest; again, a government that will contribute on the national and international stage to resolve the challenges of this century. We will continue to act competently. We will continue to make the reforms that are needed, because we are not afraid to create the future for this nation. We are not afraid to introduce the big reform agenda that we are currently prospering and delivering. We will not use fear, we will not use scaremongering and we will not diminish the economic and scientific evidence put forward by Australians, fine Australians, great Australians and great Australian institutions-institutions like the CSIRO and economic advisers like Ross Garnaut. We will not tear down those things that have make this a great nation: the power of science, innovation and knowledge; the wealth derived from the skills and talents of our people; the value of economic policy informed by experts. We will continue to act competently and we will deliver the big reforms such as the National Broadband Network, which will transform the way we live, the way we do business and the way we engage with each other. Big reforms such as the NBN will create economic opportunity for regional Australia. We will continue to invest in infrastructure such as the Hunter Expressway and the ARTC infrastructure, through which we can envisage the possibility of high-speed rail on the east coast of Australia, and we will continue to have a national ports and freight strategy and to look at our airport strategies. These things were lacking for 12 miserable years. We will keep finding ways to use the revenue from the mining boom to invest back into our economy for future prosperity, and we will do the big one-the price on carbon. I know the power of reforms because I am the member for Newcastle. I know that the path to prosperity is through reform and change. The economic transformation of Newcastle over the last 10 to 15 years from a heavy-industrial, one-company town to a leading centre for innovation, productivity and prosperity is something that we can be proud of. We have gone from 17 per cent unemployment in the mid and late 1990s to five per cent unemployment now in 2011. Over 88,000 jobs have been created in my region in the last decade-and why? Because we invested in high-tech and in knowledge; we invested in innovation. We diversified our economy and took on the skill challenge. By the end of 2010, employment in knowledge based industries had increased to the point where it was around 66 per cent higher than employment in goods-producing industries such as coal. What a turnaround has occurred-and why? Because of reforms undertaken by Hawke and Keating, Rudd and Gillard. We know now that our future prosperity will depend on putting a price on carbon. That is something we embrace and have waited for much too long. We want some consistency. Business wants some consistency. They want some certainty and they want to know what things will look like in the future. They want to know what they can do to create the optimum outcomes for themselves, and the most powerful market signal will be a price on carbon. We also know that it is the early adopters in this world, in business and in life, who thrive and survive. Yet I look across at the Neanderthals on the other side and despair for the nation should they ever regain government. They have no imagination, they diminish those who could advise them well and they rush headlong into a divided world of scaremongering and fear. A price on carbon will allow industry to start auditing and measuring their carbon footprint and to do the economic modelling that could make their businesses successful. They will know the cost of that pollution, and they will then know the opportunity for new investment and what it is worth. They will know what the use of offsets will do to create businesses of the future. I know a little bit about those wonderful businesses of the future because in Newcastle we have the Australian Solar Institute, the Clean Energy Innovation Centre, the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, the CSIRO Energy Transformed Flagship and the energy centre for the nation. We know that these innovation centres will create the future, but I want to tell you how hard that will be without a price on carbon. Last week Commercialisation Australia and AusIndustry met at the Newcastle University Institute for Energy and Resources, which was also funded and set up by the Labor government. We were looking at two great products. One was solar paint-water based paint-and the other was geothermal capacity to increase the efficiency of existing power plants. Commercialisation of those ventures is very attractive to overseas markets, but it is not attractive to Australian markets because there is no incentive to invest in these new products. How tragic it would be if these great innovations were to go overseas. Yet that is what the opposition would see happen. Neanderthal man across there-the Leader of the Opposition-has aligned himself with the climate change sceptics. He has aligned himself with people who deny science and deny the future, he has diminished the credible voices that would shape that future and he is certainly committed to political expediency. He has gone from the argument that climate change is ‘crap' to the following, which he said at his press conference on the day he took over the leadership: Look, certainly I think the politics of this have changed. I don't think my assessment of the science or of the policies ever changed that much. I think all that really changed was my assessment of the politics of the issue. So we have over there a leader who will use political expediency. He does not care about the science and asserted he does not care about the national economic benefits; he only cares about the politics of this issue. I guess he has put forward his credibility and his competency in this MPI discussion. His competency saw him put forward a policy on climate change that was unfunded at a cost of $10 billion. Who would pay for that? The shadow finance minister answered that question today. He said, ‘You have to actually cut spending to pay for things.' That is exactly what they will do it if they want to have their action agenda on climate change-they will cut spending. Yet Tony Abbott would not say where he would make those spending cuts. As the Leader of the Opposition during the election campaign, costing of his election commitments found a $10 billion hole. That is the real Tony, a fairly incompetent Tony and one whom I think brings great disrepute to the party and this parliament.",54
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member will refer to members by their appropriate titles.,56
138,Ms GRIERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition also spoke about a kinder, gentler polity in this parliament, but we have not seen that today; instead we have again seen the power of scaremongering and disrespectful language. I tire of the misogynist language of the Leader of the Opposition-the use of the phrase ‘the knitting circle', the repeated use of the words ‘she' and ‘shrill'which serves to diminish and insult and personalise. It is not good enough for someone who sees himself as a future Prime Minister. Then, of course, we have the member issue Cook wanting to talk today. He was hidden from this parliament for the last couple of days, but he must be getting his act together now. All he wants to do is to say that the policies of the Howard government were successful. No, they were not. We remember SIEVX and we remember TPVs that made people have to beg to survive in this country. It was a ruthless regime that paid absolutely no attention to the displacement caused by international events. I think it is shameful that the other side continue to diminish the parliament and diminish this nation. (Time expired)",56

141,Mr RUDD,AUSTRALIAN CIVILIAN CORPS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Over the past few years, we have witnessed the unfolding of many natural disasters and many conflicts across the world, far too many for all of us. Regardless of their causes, disasters and conflicts shake nations and communities to their absolute core. The familiar is replaced by the unfamiliar. We have a natural instinct to want to help when as our fellow human beings are in trouble. The Australian Civilian Corps has been to set up to do exactly this. Australians are among the most generous people in the world, so it is no this surprise that, when disaster strikes, one of the most common questions that people ask is: how can I help? The Civilian Corps will provide another way for Australians to help out in times of crisis across the world. Australia is joining other members of the international community in establishing a capacity for deploying civilian specialists. This idea emerged from the 2020 Summit in 2008. This is an important initiative that enables rapid deployment of skilled civilian specialists to assist countries experiencing or emerging from natural disaster or conflict. Australians will assist these countries to restore essential services, rebuild government institutions and support economic and social stability. The corps will have the flexibility to deploy in a stand-alone capacity or alongside Australian military or police personnel. insert: In some cases, the corps may work closely with civilian corps from other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The Australian Civilian Corps Bill 2010, incorporating a number of government amendments, has now passed the Senate. The government amendments address the recommendations by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. As recommended by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, the bill has been amended to provide for external instead of internal review of decisions made by the Director-General of AusAID concerning the contract of Civilian Corps personnel. A number of minor amendments have also been made to implement other recommendations that are consistent with the intention of the bill. For example, the bill has been amended to expressly prohibit patronage and favouritism in relation to the engagement of Civilian Corps employees. I thank the senators who spoke on the bill yesterday for their strong support for this legislation. If you are ever thinking about a career change, I would say to those in the Senate-and perhaps also to those in the House-that the Australian Civilian Corps lies waiting for you. I would like to provide some clarification of a number of the issues raised in the debate. The Australian government takes its responsibility for the safety of Civilian Corps personnel seriously. Before AusAID conducts a deployment, a comprehensive security assessment will be undertaken. The risks will be anticipated and we anticipate also to manage those risks appropriately. The Director-General of AusAID will ensure appropriate safety and security arrangements are in place for Civilian Corps personnel, in compliance with AusAID's legal obligations as the employer of those personnel, in order to mitigate those risks. As to who will determine whether a person will be deployed as an AusAID employee or a Civilian Corps employee, the Director-General of AusAID is best placed to make operational and staffing decisions based on the particular requirements of the host country. This is a significant initiative: $52.3 lion has been allocated over five years to meet the costs associated with the establishment of the Australian Civilian Corps and to manage its operations. Accordingly, the bill itself has no financial implication. AusAID aims to build a register of 500 trained personnel for the Austrian Civilian Corps by 2014. To date, 47 civilian specialists have been selected, screened and trained for inclusion in the Australian Civilian Corps register, and recruitment is ongoing. I am pleased to inform the House that the first deployment from the register is expected to be to Haiti next month. This deployment will complement Australia's $24 million commitment to help rebuild Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010 that killed more than 200,000 people. By providing an employment framework tailored to the Civilian Corps, the bill enhances Australia's capacity to meet both the needs of developing countries and the desire of Australians to lend a hand. The corps will make a significant difference to those receiving assistance but will also make a difference to the lives of Australians. It gives Australians the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the lives of those struggling to recover after disaster and conflict. There is no better feeling than helping to lift others up when they have been knocked down. This is a good piece of legislation; it is a good piece of public policy. I commend those opposite on the bipartisan spirit they have brought to this legislation both in the House and in the Senate. Once again, I commend the legislation.",58
142,Ms JULIE BISHOP,AUSTRALIAN CIVILIAN CORPS,"I am pleased to again speak in support of the Australian Civilian Corps Bill 2010, with the amendments. The events of the past few months have given us reason to reflect on the terrible impact of natural disasters and milthe need for a coordinated response effort. Disaster after disaster has been felt not only here at home but also by our friends abroad. Australians were united in grief as images from Christchurch were relayed into our living rooms and again when the Japan earthquake occurred, where the loss of life, devastation and destruction were on an unimaginable scale. We have also witnessed historic moments in Egypt and Tunisia, where freedom has emerged from years of repression and is looking to take root. Out of these movements, a window of opportunity has opened for Australia and other members of the international community to work with the people of Egypt and Tunisia to bring about long-lasting reform. In speaking in support of the bill last year; I drew on the idealism and inspiration of John F. Kennedy who challenged American students to appreciate the bigger picture around them. Like the United States Peace Corps, an Australian Civilian Corps will harness the boundless energy, goodwill and abilities that are present in the Australian community and put them to work where they are most needed. In passing on the skills and knowledge that participants have developed over their careers, an Australian Civilian Corps will help rebuild those communities that have suffered the ravages of natural disaster or conflict. It is the coalition's hope this initiative will bring the prospect of a brighter future to parts of the world where little hope exiisted. In speaking on this matter last year, I did raise two concerns. The first concerned the financial impact of the bill. While the explanatory memorandum stated that there would be no financial impact from the bill, according to AusAID: The Australian Government will provide $52 million to enable the rapid deployment of Australian civilians into overseas disaster or conflict affected countries. It was important that this confusion was removed. My second concern related to the potential for a conflict of interest involving government employees. Given that many of the eligible public sector employees will be existing staff of AusAID, it is important that safeguards are put in place to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are properly managed. For these reasons the coalition recommended that the bill be referred to a Senate committee for inquiry and the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has looked at both these matters and has reported back to parliament. I note the strong support from the committee for this bill. While questions still remain over the final cost of the initiative, the coalition accepts the view of the committee that matters relating to the cost of the program will become clearer as the Australian Civilian Corps is further refined. The coalition also accepts the view of the committee and the Australian Public Service Commission that existing procedures governing the Australian Public Service are sufficient to manage the selection and management of personnel on the Australian Civilian Corps Register. We join with the committee in calling on the government to ensure that ‘the selecthat tion process is transparent without patronage or favouritism and based on merit'. In referring the bill to the committee, the coalition has acted to strengthen what is an important step forward in Australia's overseas development program and a valuable way of encouraging development and reconstruction in other parts of the world. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (ELECTION NA MEASURES) BILL 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 March, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",59
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Menzies has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. The question now is that this will be now read a second time.,60
144,Ms OWENS,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. It is a bill that will have a positive fect on many of my constituents in Parramatta and it is a bill which delivers on a number of election commitments that the government made prior to the 2010 election-commitments that I was pleased to see made and which I am even more pleased to see on their way to delivery today. There were three main election commitments and all are very special for people in my electorate. The first was to provide for baby bonus claimants to have a large proportion of their baby bonus paid to them upfront from 1 July 2011. The second one provided benefits to families with children aged between 16 and 19 who are in full-time secondary or vocational education, and the third extended the pension work bonus to better reflect the realities of many pensioners who work on an ad hoc or part-time irregular basis. It is these last two that I am particularly going to speak about today. The bill through its improvements to the work bonus expands on a great deal of work we have already done when it comes to pensions. We delivered the Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package back in September 2009 that already built on a $500 bonus which was paid to pensioners in 2008. But the provisions introduced through that Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package were the most significant reforms to the pension system in 100 years and they were reforms that were well and truly overdue. We introduced a one-off increase in the base rate of the pension, a new pension supplement, a pension work bonus and a new indexation system. From 20 September we delivered one-off increases of $32.49 per week for singles who receive the maximum rate of the pension, and $10.14 a week combined for couples on the maximum rate. These increases were made up of a rise in the efbase rate for single pensioners and a new increased pension supplement for all pensioners. We also changed indexation arrangements to make them fairer and to respond to pressures on the cost of living, indexing them twice yearly. In fact, from 20 March this year pensioners receive an extra $13.20 per fortnight for singles on the maximum rate, and $19.80 a fortnight for couples on the maximum rate, and increases every six months tend to reflect similar kinds of amounts. This is a significant improvement from the way the pensions were indexed before 2009. We also increased the utilities allowance from $125 to $500 a year, and that utilities allowance was first paid in March 2008. For the first time the utilities' allowance was also extended to all recipients of the carer payment, disability support pension, widow B pension, income support supplement, partner service pension, wife pension, and bereavement allowance. The Commonwealth seniors health card holders and certain veterans' affairs gold card holders also received an increase in seniors concession allowance of $500 a year, which was paid quarterly in line with the utilities allowance. We also increased the telephone allowance to $132 a year for those who have the internet at home. This is available for eligible veterans, income support recipients of age pension and a number of others who have home internet connection-all very important contributions to the quality of life of seniors in my electorsand ate and around the country. We also provided extra assistance for dental and aged-care costs and worked with state and territory governments to introduce national reciprocal transport concessions for older Australians with a seniors card when they travelled interstate. All these reforms have meant that since September 2009 pensioners on the maximum rate have had their pensions increased by around $115 a fortnight for singles and $97 a fortnight for couples combined. These are changes to the circumstances of pensioners that I am very proud of. This bill builds on that work by improving the existing work bonus. We have already introduced a work bonus which provides that the first $250 of $500 that a pensioner earns each fortnight would be exempt from tax. But the reality for many pensioners is that they do not work regular weekly jobs; they actually work for a number of weeks of the year. For example, some of them may work in schools, so they may work 40 weeks of the year and they do not get paid for the remaining 12. Others may come back at tax time-they may be a retired accountant who works for a few weeks or a few months around tax time. For them, because their income is averaged over the year, the amount that they earn perhaps impacts on their pension more than it should. This change to the work bonus recognises that. It allows a pensioner to earn $250 a fortnight without it being assessed as income under the income test, and pensioners are able to build up any unused amount of their $250 bonus every fortnight to a maximum of $6,500 a year. Pensioners will effectively be able to annualise their income and carry forward an income bank of up to $6,500 across years. In Parramatta we have a significant number of pensioners, currently about 21½ thouof them, with all sorts of work arrangements. It is a very large number of pensioners for one electorate. You can compare that to Warringah or Wentworth, which have about 11,000. I am very pleased to see this legislation introduced to parliament today because it will dramatically impact on many of their lives. The second thing I want to talk about was, again, a great announcement made during the election campaign, and it is great to see it delivered through legislation today. There was a promise to reform the family payment system to encourage more teenagers to stay at school and to help families meet the higher costs of older children. It is very important that students finish their education because it gives them the best possible chance to fully participate in life, to get a job and the skills they need to flourish in society. The ‘How young people are faring' report of 2008 found that young people who leave school early without adequate qualifications struggle in the move from school to work. They are at high risk of becoming disadvantaged and they are at high risk of spending long periods of time out of work, especially in times of economic slowdown. We also know that children from low-income families have lower levels of school completion. We want to stop the cycle of disadvantage and target support for children from lowsocioeconomic backgrounds so that they can gain a foothold in society and have what so many of us take for granted. A strong educational system will compensate for an unequal start. As the Prime Minister stated when first making these election promises: I don't want to live in a nation where we stand by and kids can get lost. They can get lost out of their school journey: they can fall out of school, fall out of work, end up in aimlessness, drifting through their latter teenage years, meaning that for the rest of their lives, they will probably struggle to get a job and hold down a career. What we want to do is to make sure we are investing in kids so they can stay in school. As early as 1999, researchers such as R Cowie were finding that deliberately targeted federal government policy such as the Hawke government's Participation and Equity Program, a successor to the Disadvantaged Schools Program, could significantly reduce the numbers of young people leaving full-time education. This government is doing all we can to undo the effects of the inertia around educational opportunity that characterised the Howard years. One of the great failures of the Howard government was its inability to accept the recognised link between investment in education and innovation on one hand and economic growth on the other. Under the Howard government, Australia was the third lowest investor in primary and secondary schooling in the OECD and spent twice as much as other OECD countries on private education. His government cut programs like the Disadvantaged Schools Program, which was started under the Whitlam government, and we are facing the consequences of his lack of vision. For the last decade of the Howard government retention rates to year 12 in Australia did not improve in any meaningful way. They increased from 40 per cent to 72 per cent under the previous Hawke and Keating governments and essentially stagnated between 72 per cent and 74 per cent for the next 12 years. Those retention rates are low by OECD standards. I point out that 12 years is the length of time it takes a child to go through school from start to finish, so it is clearly more than enough time to impact on the number of children that stay at school. This government is committed to improving year 12 or equivalent vocational completion rates and to reach our target of a 90 per cent year 12 attainment rate by 2015. We have already seen retention rates increase to around 78 per cent in 2010. This bill is a great example of how tackling this issue in a holistic way through a number of initiatives across portfolio areas contributes to strong outcomes. We are spending $723 million over four years on our National Partnership on Youth Attainment and Transitions program to improve retention rates. This includes $100 million for the states and territories in reward payments for increasing school participation. We are investing heavily in early childhood education because the research shows that this is crucial to retaining students long term. The National Partnership on Low Socio-Economic Status School Communities which will address the complex challenges facing students in disadvantaged communities will also ensure that children from those areas do not fall through the gaps. This bill goes further, by helping families whose children are between 16 and 19 to keep those children in school. Under the existing system, the maximum tax benefit part A drops from $214 per fortnight to $53 a fortnight when a child turns 16. This is a significant drop in income and encourages teenagers to leave school early if their family is unable to support them in full-time study or training. We all know that the costs of children do not go down as kids grow up. This bill raises the minimum rate for family tax benefit part A. Payment rates for eligible children aged 16 to 19 who are in full-time secondary or vocational educational will be the same as for 13to 15-year-olds. As promised, the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A will be increased by around $160 per fortnight, a significant increase for families in the lowto middleincome bracket. Over the next five years, the families of around 590,000 teenagers will benefit from up to $4,000 per year in additional financial assistance. These amendments will also mean that older children will now be eligible to be considered a rent assisnot tance child. Rent assistance was previously only claimable for 13to 15-year-olds. We are also simplifying the system by helping families with kids under the age of 18, making FTBA the main payment for at-home children in high school or a vocational education equivalent. This bill targets issues that are very for many families in Parramatta. Around 23.3 per cent of Parramatteans have a schooling level lower than year 11, and in Merrylands this rises to 32.5 per cent. We have an incredible amount of work to do with our younger generation in areas such as this to improve those statistics. There are more than 16,000 families in Parramatta receiving family tax benefit part A, and many of these families potentially stand to benefit from the bill before us. On average, nearly 20 per cent of Parramatteans are classified as low-income households. In Dundas Valley this rises to 23.9 per cent and in Telopea to 27.5 per cent. These households receive less than $500 per week before tax, so the kinds of increases that we are talking about in family tax benefit part A are substantial for many, many families in the Parramatta region. These are sobering statistics, and ones that we are determined to do something about. In summary, I commend the bill before the House. As the Prime Minister has stated, no child's fate should be predetermined before they reach adulthood.",61
145,Mrs MIRABELLA,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to specifically support the amendments to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 put forward by the member for Menzies, and I note that the issue of an inequitable youth allowance is a matter that the Labor Party desperately do want to talk about. They want it to go away and they certainly do not like the opposition talking about it. They do not want to debate it because they know that they have been wrong. We all know that most of those who sit opposite do not really have much affinity with country people because they do not represent many country electorates. I real suspect, though, that some Labor members who do reside in or have some experience with regional areas must be as frustrated as we on this side of the House are regarding the government's total neglect of and lack of respect for regional students and the particular difficulties and challenges they face in accessing tertiary education. We have a Prime Minister who loves nothing more than to gloat about her passion for education. She talks about education as the great equaliser and says she believes that every young person deserves the right to a quality education. If that is the case then her actions need to match her rhetoric. If you look at the Prime Minister's position on the youth allowance, it becomes clear that her statements regarding education are nothing more than empty platitudes designed to give the impression that she genuinely cares about educational equality, but when it comes to regional students it seems she does not. Labor's changes to the youth allowance legislation fly in the face of everything the Prime Minister supposedly stands for and they exemplify a very inequitable and hypocritical position taken against country students. When these ridiculous, discriminatory changes were legislated, there was uproar within the rural and regional student community. Students in my electorate were absolutely gobsmacked. Having been advised of the rules that applied to youth allowance eligibility, they planned their gap years and made appropriate arrangements, only to discover that everything they had been told was about to change. Labor effectively said: ‘Well, too bad. You can't go to university anymore; we've decided to change the rules.' In fact, they have not even apologised about the distress and the disorientation they caused in regard to the academic careers of many country students. They arrogantly lectured country students that the Gillard government knew what was best for them. Now I am somewhat encouraged that, after some 12 months of pressure and much community activity-and I commend all of those who have been involved in community rallies and who have pressured their member of parliament, particularly Labor membersthe Labor Party has admitted that it got it wrong. However, its commitment to the Independents to bring forward a review of the youth allowance to report by 1 July this year does not address the problem now, and there are students now who are faced with this inequality created by the government's legislation. Furthermore, Labor has not given any firm commitment to fixing the independent youth allowance problems. In a media release, the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, stated: The review will report by 1 July this year, and Government will move to implement any new eligibility arrangements from 1 January 2012. Senator Evans said the review will consider appropriate savings that can be made to pay for any extensions in eligibility for Youth Allowance. Any new arrangements must be offset by savings. So, even if they do make the appropriate changes after the review, it is going to be too little too late for those classified as inner regional students who left school in 2009 and had a gap year in 2010, as they are now still required to work an average of 30 hours a week and defer their studies up to two years. Had the coalition's bill passed, they would now be relieved of these unfair criteria. Last year's school leavers are also left in limbo, wondering what to expect after the review, and there are clearly already cracks in Labor's deal with the Independents and, of course, many unanswered questions. How can regional students and their families trust Labor to deliver on this promise given this government's dismal record on delivering on its promises? They cannot, and that is what is creating great anxiety out there in rural and regional communities. Labor has shown nothing but arrogant disregard for country students. There has been report after report and survey after survey that clearly illustrates the divide between country and city students. There are clear disadvantages that are faced by students from nonmetropolitan areas. You would think that any reasonable government, particularly one that purports to place education high on its list of priorities, would make it a priority to address the imbalance between rural and city students. Yet not only has the Labor Party not sought to remedy this inequity; they have actually made it worse. For the benefit of those who sit on the other side, it is important to put some facts on the table. I appreciate that the Labor Party has a limited understanding of some of these the issues, so it is important to put them on the record. Firstly, most students from regional areas need to relocate to attend a university because there is no university in their local town, and often one that is there may not offer the appropriate courses that they wish to pursue. Secondly, public transport is severely limited or non-existent for towns that are close to large regional centres with tertiary institutions. In most cases, students actually have to drive or get their parents to drive them. Take, for example, a couple of local young women in my electorate, Stephanie Butler and Eliza Flanagan. They drive more than 150 kilometres from Wangaratta to Charles Sturt University over the border in Thurgoona because they cannot afford to live out of home. If Labor had not inflicted these discriminatory rules on the youth allowance, Stephanie and Eliza would have been able to move closer to Thurgoona and commit considerably more time to their studies. They would not have to spend about two hours a day on the road and hundreds of dollars a week on petrol. But Stephanie and Eliza are the lucky ones; fortunately for them, their courses are offered a university relatively close to home. What about students who want to study courses that are only on offer in city universities? Does this government expect them to drive more than three hours each way to attend classes? The reality is that the 30-hour workplace rule that Labor has inflicted upon country students is so strict that most students from areas classified as inner regional areas will be unable to qualify for the higher, of course, independent rate of youth allowance, and many of them will not get the opportunity to go to university at all as a consequence. The requirement to average either 120 hours in each of the 19 periods of four weeks or 390 hours in each of the six periods of 13 weeks is quite simply unworkable and unreasonable. What the Labor Party does not understand is that much of the work that is available in country Australia is actually seasonal. People work very long hours during the busy times of sowing, picking, mustering and harvesting, but the work is not available on an even scale throughout the year. It makes life extremely difficult for students attempting to meet these ridiculous criteria. Manufacturing and factories in regional areas also have sonal work available: it is not always an option to have the same hours available for part-time, casual or even permanent staff. Let us be very clear from the outset: if these rules introduced by the Labor Party remain in place, fewer country students will actually attend university. This point goes beyond the realms of education; it goes to the sustainability of regional economies. Country Australia faces many challenges, and labour shortages are one of the biggest challenges impacting on growth in regional and remote Australia. Countless studies have shown that people who are most likely to live and to work in at the bush and those who are most likely to take career steps away from the urban environment are those who have spent time in regional Australia. Whilst there may be a percentage of workers in the areas of health, education and public administration who come from the city to work in country Australia, most serve their obligatory two or three years and return to the cities. But the ones who tend to stay on and serve country communities for greater periods of time, often in a more meaningful way, are those who originally came from country Australia themselves. They are the ones who are our long-term workers and community leaders. If we place university participation hurdles in front of those who come from regional areas classified as inner regional areas, we will actually shrink the pool of people who serve and work in country Australia. Our higher education students who come from inner regional areas are exactly the same people who often want to stay longer in regional and remote Australia when they commence and continue their careers. By denying them an opportunity to gain a higher education-which is effectively what is happening to many of them through these changed eligibility rules on the youth allowsea- ance-we are in the long term denying rural Australia the ability to attract and retain the much-needed workers. With all of this in mind, I do respectfully ask the regional Independent members of the House to consider the impact of the Labor Party's legislation on their own communities. I am sure that there are plenty of students in the electorates of New England and Lyne who are just like Stephanie and Eliza from Wangaratta. I am sure that there are aspiring students in those electorates who want nothing more than to pursue their dreams of tertiary education to find meaningful roles for themselves in their communities and to contribute to them in a meaningful way. I am also sure that those communities face the very same challenges that communities in my electorate in north-east Victoria face. If we are serious about maintaining the viability and facilitating the prosperity of communities outside major cities then we need to lay the appropriate social infrastructure and foundations for future growth. That necessarily demands fair access to support during tertiary education studies. If we want to maintain first-class services and retain skilled workers in country Australia, we cannot continue to place hurdles in front of aspiring students. I understand the difficult position that this puts the member for New England and the member for Lyne in, because both have previously sided with the Labor government in relation to youth allowance, but I ask them to please consider the pleas of students not only in their own electorates but in electorates across Australia. They have an opportunity to fix in a constructive way a mess that has been created by this government-an opportunity that often does not happen in this place in the term of the same government. It is an opportunity to right a wrong and an opportunity to help create a better life for regional communities. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (5.23 pm)-It is my pleasure to be speaking in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Labor has always been at the forefront of ensuring fairness for those most in need in our community. We saw it in our first term of government2008, 2009 and 2010-with the reforms that we took up in relation to families and pensioners. We saw an increase in the childcare benefit to assist those families most in need with their costs. We saw it with the increase in the base pension rate and the change to the indexation to ensure that adequate increases were occurring in line with cost-of-living pressures. We saw it, when the government needed to step forward to deal with the global financial crisis, in how it gave money to individuals and homeowners through the stimulus package. That stimulus package went to those most in need in our communities. This is just another step in Labor's commitment to those most in need in our community to ensure fairness in how we deal with them and also how we provide support for them in the workplace and in the home. That is why it is my pleasure to support all of the initiatives in this bill-for example, the work bonus. My electorate has a large elderly population-over 20 per cent of my electorate are 65-plus-and they welcome this initiative. The groups that I have had the opportunity to talk to at retirement villages about these improvements in the work bonus certainly look forward to these changes being implemented. We came a long way with the Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package in 2009, when we introduced the work bonus. Now, arising from our commitment in the 2010 election, we take that even further to help those in our community. So what does this bill provide for? The amendments contained in this bill have two main components in relation to the work bonus. Firstly, the first $250 of employment income a fortnight, rather than 50 per cent the first $500 as it is currently, is excluded from assessment under the income test for pensioners of age pension age or qualifying age. Secondly, an employment income concession bank is introduced to enable pensioners to accrue any unused amounts of the $250 fortnightly exemption to a maximum of $6,500. Any credit in this bank could then offset employment income that would otherwise be assessable in the future. This is a great benefit to those in our community who are retired and on the pension and want to supplement their pension but who quite often do it irregularly. For example, they may pick up some extra work at Christmastime. We have heard the example that many may help with tax returns at the end of the financial year. This will give them the benefit of being able to accrue that concession bank and offset up to a maximum of $6,500. I am very proud of the improvements to the work bonus that will come about in accordance with this bill and that those changes will occur from 1 July 2011. Second is the assistance for families with studying teenagers. As parents, whether your child is a teenager or not, we remember when we were teenagers, and the fact is that teenagers certainly do not eat less and certainly do not cost less when they are still living at home. I think this is an important amendment that is probably long overdue. We will probably all sit back and go, ‘Why wasn't this done earlier by anybody?' but the fact that it is a Labor government doing it should not surprise anyone. The fact is that we have acknowledged that children from 16 to 19 years old do cost more money, not less than and probably not even equal to younger children. We are bringing some equity to this. And what does this amendment mean? From 1 January 2012, the maximum rate of family tax benefit A will increase by around of $160 per fortnight for teenagers aged between 16 and 19 who are in secondary school or a vocational equivalent or who are exempt from this requirement. And it is important that we emphasise that these young people still need to be at school or in full time vocational studies to be getting this, because we want these young people to be going out to get their education. But we need to support these families at home to help them deal with that. Under the existing system, the maximum rate of family tax benefit A drops from $214 per fortnight to $53 per fortnight when a child turns 16. It is unbelievable that that is the drop in the rate. It is with great pride that I stand here today as part of a Labor government to say we are going to bring equality in family tax benefit A for families with children up to the age of 19. Importantly, those children are still at school or in full-time vocational equivalent. So this is a great benefit that will assist families in my electorate. Mr Tehan interjectingMrs D'ATH-The member for Wannon may not care whether families in his electorate benefit from thisMr Tehan interjecting",64
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"The member for Wannon! You may want to get your chance to speak. Mrs D'ATH-I can say very confidently that the families in his electorate who have teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 will appreciate this change that the Labor government is bringing in. In addition, we are making improvements to the baby bonus. I am a big supporter of the changes we previously made to the baby bonus-that it be fortnightly payments. We also need to acknowledge that, when you are having a baby, there are up-front costs. There are costs involved in purchasing cots, nappies and all the things that come with having a baby. As any parent knows, although they do not eat a lot of food at that age, the family certainly do need a lot of things at home in those first few days and weeks. That is why it is important we are making these changes to the baby bonus. There will be a part lump sum up front to assist families and the remainder of the payments will be made over a period of time. The baby bonus will be paid in 13 fortnightly instalments. As a result of this change, from 1 July 2012 claimants will receive $500 more in the 2011-12 financial year in the first fortnightly instalment, and then in the 12 subsequent fortnightly instalments they will receive the remainder of the baby bonus. I think that is a fair way to provide this assistance to families, and I certainly support it. There are other important amendments. I guess too often across our society now we forget about the people who were affected by thalidomide. We should not, because there are still survivors of thalidomide in Australia. There are 36 Australians who are dealing with the devastating effects of the drug. They have birth defects as a consequence of their mother taking that drug. It is important that amendments are made to ensure fairness in relation to how the payments made to the survivors under the arrangement entered into by Diageo plc, which acquired the company that initially distributed the drug, affect their social security payments and the income and assets test. This is a really important amendment, and I certainly support it. There are some other amendments in this bill in relation to income management. I do not intend to go through those in detail, but they are important measures that again go to improved administration and support for families and pensioners across my community and across the country. On that note, I reiterate that all the initiatives in this bill important. They will see benefits flow to people in my electorate. They are commitments that the government made in the 2010 election. There are three election commitments and two non-budget measures dealt with in this bill. It is my pleasure to support this bill before the House.",68
147,Mr TEHAN,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise on behalf of equality and fairness this afternoon and supporting the second reading amendment that should be made to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The amendment reads: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House require the government: (1) urgently to introduce legislation to reinstate the former workplace participation criteria for independent youth allowance, to apply to students whose family home is located in inner regional areas as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics instrument Australian Standard Geographical Classification; and (2) to appropriate funds necessary to meet the additional cost of expanding the criteria for participation. It is an absolute disgrace, what the Gillard government have done-with the changes they have made to the independent youth allowance-to regional and rural students. They say they are a government of fairness. Well what they have done to regional and rural students is not fair. I have received numerous letters that highlight this fact. I received a letter from Rosanne Baird, which states: Dear Dan I am writing to you regarding the current Austudy boundaries. Our son Nicholas has just completed are a ‘gap year' and is heading off to University of Ballarat to study business/sport management in late February. I contacted Centrelink today to see what he was eligible to claim. Nic has worked hard for the past four years, commencing a part time job at the local supermarket, going onto full time during school holidays and then gaining full time employment once he had completed his VCE. He resigned from the supermarket in December 2010, and commenced at the local abattoir, working 40 hours per week. It is therefore very disappointing to discover that he is not able to claim Austudy automatically, as we live in Stawell, 5 minute drive from us at Deep Lead is in the eligible area!!!!! I am at a loss to understand how these kids are to further their education under this system, we are rural people and all should be treated the samemaking life a little easier for our kids. I know we have to prove that Nic has earned ‘X' amount of $ and worked ‘X' amount of hoursthis will not mean that he will be eligible-it only gives him a chance! My husband and I earn just on $100,000 per year, whilst it sounds okay, it is not enough to be able to support a full time student and another child still at school. We are not eligible for anything under the family tax benefit because we earn too much!!! The only answer for this family is for my husband or I to get a second job to support Nic in his studies. I would be pleased if you would consider our plight, on behalf of average working families trying to support our kids education. A second letter that I received is from Anna Zebra. It reads: Dear Dan It is with pleasure that I take the opportunity to write this letter to you after speaking with your office. I have been increasingly frustrated with the Youth Allowance situation and the fact that it directly disadvantages country students. I am more than happy for you to use our situation as an example, and will outline our story. We have four children, and at this stage two have chosen to pursue a tertiary education, which in both cases involves them moving over two hours from home to do so. We live about 10 minutes from Hamilton in a small town called Tarrington. Unfortunately we are not in a financial position to support two children living away from home. My daughter Jaz completed year 12 in 2008 and took a year off in 2009 to work and travel, then commenced her tertiary study in Melbourne in 2010. She qualified for Youth Allowance as an independent having satisfied the requirements, and is continuing to study and support herself this year. My son Tyler completed year 12 in 2009 and also took the following year off to work so that he could also qualify for Youth Allowance. Unfortunately the requirements were changed … And who changed them? We know-the Gillard government, in spite of their so-called fairness. … in this period so that now due to the “zoning” rule he cannot receive the payments and will have to try to support himself in studies at Ballarat University. I will outline his situation in point form below: - completed year 12 2009 - accepted into Ballarat University; deferred position for 12 months to work - worked full-time at Iluka for 12 months from Nov 09 to Nov 10 - tried to apply for Youth Allowance for tertiary study commencing in 2011 (realising he would not be able to receive any payments until a full 18 months had passed from the time he finished year 12), satisfied all the requirements as an independent student except the residential location, thus due to this he cannot receive any payments - other students who live 10 minutes from us in towns such as Penshurst are zoned differently so will be able to qualify. I hope that this is enough information for you to be able to use our case. This poor boy-his older sister is getting independent youth allowance and going to university, he has met exactly the same requirements as she has and he cannot. Fellow students who live five to 10 minutes down the road are also eligible to get independent youth allowance, but he is not. This policy is an absolute disgrace. It is unequal, it is unfair and Prime Minister Gillard, whose policy this is, should act to change it immediately, because if she does not then she is disadvantaging regional and rural students. I want to touch on a few points that are relevant here and go to the heart of the two amendments. I would especially hope that all rural and regional members of the ALP-and I know there are not a lot of them-would support us in making sure that these amendments are supported. Here are some facts about what we are dealing with. Finding full time employment in regional areas and small communities is often very difficult for these students, so they have a hard time trying to just get the employment. When they do and they qualify we should enable them to get independent youth allowance so they can go and get a tertiary education. The legislation does not take into account seasonal employment sectors such as tourism and agriculture in regional areas, creating further barriers for regional students. So it is hardship upon hardship that the government is putting on these rural and regional students. Rural and regional students face significantly increased costs associated with relocating for study; this is proven and factual, with no debate. Everyone knows that this is true, yet what we are seeing is a government that will not stand up and do the right thing by these students. Many regional students have no choice but to relocate to study. The major universities are in our capital cities. We have some, fortunately, in regional areas. We have a very good university, Deakin, in Warrnambool in my electorate, and RMIT in Hamilton, but unfortunately they do not yet offer the variety of subjects that all students need, so students are forced to go to the capital cities-and that costs them a serious amount of money. Evidence has shown that it is a financial barrier of between $15,000 and $20,000. These students are prepared to do the work so that they have some money to go to university, but what is the Gillard government doing? It is taking away from them the opportunity to get some assistance for these costs. Mr Craig Kelly-The education revolution!",69
148,Mr TEHAN,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Yes, the education revolution! It is all about education, all about fairness and all about equality-the so-called education revolution. All it has done is revolutionise the difficulty for these regional and rural students to access tertiary education, and there is not an issue that young people raise with me more than independent youth allowance and what this government has done to make it harder for them to go and get a tertiary education. We have had petitions. We have never seen such support for petitions that have been put in the offices of people right across the country, and I am sure that in Townsville the response has been equally strong as in Warrnambool, Hamilton and other areas where regional and rural students have been disadvantaged. Another fact that we need to take into consideration is that students who defer tertiary studies for longer than 12 months are less likely to attend university. So it is not even a great policy to ask students to defer so that they can earn the income to qualify for independent youth allowance. Very few universities accept deferments longer than 12 months, meaning that those who have to work a 30-hour week for 18 months over a two-year period will have to give up their spot and reapply later. The university enrolment system that is in place also makes it harder for regional and rural students. Yet we have a government which continues to defend this shameful policy-which was introduced under the concept of fairness. There is nothing fair about it. In fact, a Senate inquiry found that 55 per cent of metropolitan students go on to tertiary education compared with only 33 per cent of students from regional areas. Given that fact, you would think that the government would be working towards assisting regional and rural students to go and get a tertiary education. You would think that they would like to close that gap. If your core belief is education, if that is at the heart of what brought you to this place, you would think that you would try to close that gap. Yet what we are seeing is a policy which is going to make that gap widen. We are proposing a couple of amendments. I say to those opposite: if you want to do the right thing, if you want to get on the side of fairness, if you want to get on the side of equality, you will support our amendments. The figures and the facts are there for all to see. I could read into Hansard a lot more letters and a lot more cases than what I have outlined today. This policy is a disgrace. It is hurting and harming regional and rural students who want to get a tertiary education. We have two simple amendments to this bill. They are not complex. All you need to do is come across to this side and you will do something which will help to bridge the gap between regional and rural students and their city cousins. We have no issue with 55 per cent of metropolitan students going on to tertiary education. That is a good statistic, and hopefully we can see that rise. But we need to also see an increase in the number of students from regional areas going on to get a tertiary education. Thirty-three per cent is not good enough. We need to get that figure up above 50 per cent. These two amendments will do it. I call on the two country Independents in particular to get behind these amendments, because their electorates are hurt by Prime Minister Gillard's policy which has done more than anything to damage the attempt to bridge that gap. I call on the two rural Independents to get on the side of right, get on the side of fairness, and support the coalition on these two amendments. This is their chance to stand up for their electorates. It is their chance to get on the side of the coalition, which cares about regional and rural areas and which goes into bat for regional and rural areas continually. This is their opportunity. Stop the game playing; these two amendments will do more than anything else to help these regional and rural students. I call on them to vote with us and to make sure that these two amendments get up.",71
149,Ms RISHWORTH,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"What we are seeing from the opposition today is politics. Before the House today we have some very sensible legislation, the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Perhaps it is because this legislation deals with Labor election commitments that the opposition find that they just cannot deal with it. We have not heard from members of the opposition as to whether they will even support our sensible legislation which has been welcomed by the community. Instead they are playing politics with this important legislation. I am not sure why. Perhaps it is part of the Leader of the Opposition's tactic to continually oppose everything, to start scare campaigns and to not work in a bipartisan way on anything. It is not surprising that we have seen these tactics today. I am not sure when these tactics were dreamt up by the opposition, but before the House today we have some very sensible, important and meaningful legislation, and I hope that members of the opposition will actually address the substantive legislation and tell us whether or not they are going to vote yes for the substantive legislation. As I said, the reason for these tactics might be that this legislation delivers on bor's election commitments, but I would welcome the opposition showing some bipartisanship for once and working in the nation's interest and in the community's interest, because this legislation is widely supported. I am pleased to support the substantive legislation. The Gillard government is committed to providing support and financial assistance to Australians who are most in need. This bill delivers on three significant election commitments that were made by Labor during the election to support families and senior Australians. The bill also gives effect to non-budget measures which will make things fairer for Australians affected by the morning sickness drug thalidomide and which will better support Australians on income management. Firstly I would like to deal with the work bonus. This bill delivers on our commitment at the recent election to expand the existing seniors work bonus measure to allow working pensioners to keep more of their pension when they undertake paid employment. Introduced in September 2009 as part of the government's secure and sustainable pension reform package, the seniors work bonus allows for a certain amount of income earned by a person who is eligible for the age pension to be disregarded for the purposes of social security and veterans' affairs income tests. This way, senior Australians are able earn a little extra money to help out with everyday expenses without losing out when it comes to the government assistance they receive. This initiative is about acknowledging the valuable contribution senior Australians who choose to undertake part-time work or occasional work make to our economy and to the communities around the nation. By providing financial incentives, we are encouraging La- other senior Australians to do the same if they wish. That is why we have committed to expanding the work bonus so that the first $250 earned in a fortnight will not be treated as income for the purposes of social security and veterans' affairs income assessments. This will mean that senior Australians can earn more without affecting their pension. Furthermore, this bill will make things fairer and simpler for senior Australians who undertake intermittent or seasonal work. Although the work bonus is an extremely popular initiative in my electorate of Kingston, a number of constituents have raised with me the fact that it is not always worthwhile participating in seasonal paid employment, because you can lose as much from your pension as you gain from the work. This often happens. We heard from the member for Petrie about accountants and people who just work at tax time. One of my constituents works as a Father Christmas-a job which I am sure many people can imagine is a very seasonal job. He raised this issue with meas did a number of others. He said that, under the current system, the income he derives from his work in the Christmas periodalthough some might say that Father Christmas has to work all year round, but he specifically works during the Christmas period-is assessed for social security purposes and his pension is significantly reduced for that period, making it hardly worth his while to to have undertaken the paid employment in the first place. One would say that it is a valuable job, because he does bring a lot of joy to the young people in the communityand it is unfair, because he does not earn any additional income for the rest of the year. This bill will do away with the anomaly by effectively annualising the work bonus. Senior Australians will now be able to build up any unused amount of their $250 bonus every fortnight up to a maximum of $6,500. The income bank amount can be used to offset future employment earnings. Seasonal workers will now be able to save up their fortnightly work bonus throughout the year so that more income they derive from seasonal work will be exempt from the income test. This is a very important change, and a change that I think is wildly welcomed by many seasonal workers across the country. I urge the opposition to indicate whether or not they support this important change. As of yet, from the contributions from those opposite, we have not heard whether or not they do support these important measures. In addition, this bill looks at assistance families with studying teenagers. It delivers on our commitment to provide more financial assistance to families with teenagers who are still at school or a vocational education equivalent. We know that families are struggling with the rising costs of living, and it is not cheap to send children to school. We also know that the costs actually increase rather than reduce as children get older and their clothes and school supplies start costing more. That is why the government is increasing the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A by around $160 per fortnight for teenagers aged 16 to 19 years of age. This could mean up to $4,200 a year for Australian families with teenagers who are studying and will bring their rate in line with what is available for 13to 15-year-olds. Under the current system, the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A drops from about $208 per fortnight to $51 per fortnight when a child turns 16 and rent assistance stops completely at this point. This sharp drop in financial assistance can make it really tough for parents to continue to support their children to finish their studies. I have heard from many people in my electorate just how tough this is. We as a government want to make sure that we encourage families to encourage their children to stay at school and to finish year 12, because we know that finishing year 12 is a passport to the rest of their educational life. So it is incredibly important. As the member for Petrie said, it is not surprising but it is a Labor government that is bringing this in. This is something that we committed to in the election and we are now delivering on in this parliament. We are investing in education to raise secondary school or vocational equivalent completion rates for all Australians regardless of their socio-economic background. We do not want the suburb people live into be a barrier for to reaching their potential to gaining an education. That is why this measure is so important. By providing greater assistance to families of teenagers at this critical point, we are helping to reduce the financial pressures associated with supporting teenagers who are studying and we are helping to diminish the necessity for teenagers to leave school to support themselves. There are 2,150 local families in my electorate who are set to benefit from the increased financial assistance and around 590,000 families are expected to benefit nationally over the next five years alone. This is about making a real difference, and it is this government that is doing that. Youth allowance will of course still be available for teenagers aged 18 who are independent and eligible for the away-fromhome rate and not in full-time secondary study. This payment will continue to provide ongoing support to young people as they progress into further education and training. The third element is improvements to the baby bonus. Additionally, this bill will improve the way the baby bonus operates so that parents of newborns are better equipped to meet the initial costs associated with adopting or having a new baby. The birth of a child is a wonderful time for parents but it can also be a stressful time. The baby bonus recognises the extra costs incurred at the time of birth and helps parents with some of these expenses. Under the current rule the baby bonus is paid in 13 fortnightly instalments. This is really important to ensure that there is ongoing support over that initial riod of time. However, the changes that we are bringing in today recognise that there are some up-front costs when having a baby and that a little extra cash does go a long way at the time of having a baby. From 1 July 2011 parents of newborn babies who receive the baby bonus on or after the date will receive $500 more in the first fortnightly instalment than the 12 subsequent instalments to assist in meeting the initial costs of welcoming a child into the family. This is about providing parents with a little extra money to purchase some of the bigger and more expensive items that one needs straight away-things like prams and cots. Although the total amount of the baby bonus will remain the same, the passage of this bill will adjust the baby bonus to assist families with the up-front costs of having a new baby when they need it most. The three examples I have outlined are examples of this government getting on with the job of implementing our election commitments. As I said before, I would like to know whether or not the opposition are going to support these important amendments that will make a real difference to people's lives. Obviously we have seen the opposition come in here today and play politics with it. I they would be up-front and make it clear whether or not they will support these, because I know that there are people in my electorate who are eagerly waiting to hear that these amendments have gone through the parliament. There are a number of other nonbudgetary measures in this bill. One includes looking at the payments provided to people affected by thalidomide. Although this amendment does not apply to many people, just 36 Australians, it is very important to those who are affected, so I certainly welcome this measure. This measure is not compe- pensation; it provides important payments to those who are affected. In addition, there are some minor administrative improvements to income management provisions. Under the current match savings scheme payments, payments are made to people who are subject to compulsory income management and who accumulate savings while undertaking an approved financial management course. However, at present, only savings accumulated after the commencement of the course qualify. The bill before us today simply modifies this so that these people can begin saving as soon as they have registered for a course. It is a minor change but one that I am sure will make a difference. This bill also clarifies the role of nominees under income management arrangements and will improve debt recovery so that customers on income management are not out of pocket. These measures deliver on significant election commitments, allowing pensioners to keep more of their pensions when they undertake part-time paid work, providing families with greater assistance to support teenagers who are completing their secondary studies and changing the way the baby bonus operates so that parents of newborn wish babies receive more money immediately after the birth. It also improves income management provisions and provides a fairer income test for thalidomide survivors. The substantive bill is an incredibly important one. I would urge the opposition to stop playing politics with these important issues before the House today and to support these measures which are widely welcomed by people across Australia. People are waiting for these measures to be introduced. I commend the substantive bill to the House and call on the opposition to support it. WYATT ROY (Longman) (6.04 pm)Today I rise to speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011, which seeks to introduce legislation that will re-introduce previously applicable criteria for the assess the ment of eligibility for youth allowance by inner-regional students. Prior to the government's changes to the eligibility for youth allowance, it could be assessed in a variety of ways. Students could work part-time for 15 hours a week for two years after leaving school. Students could have been out of school for 18 months and have earned at least 75 per cent of the maximum rate of pay under wage level A of the Australian pay and classification scale in an 18-month period. Students could work an average of 30 hours per week for 18 months out of two years. Now inner-regional students can only access youth allowance under the third criterion. The only criterion applicable to them is that they must have worked an average of 30 hours per week for 18 months out of two years. This change is going to make it much harder for some regional students to access tertiary education. Fewer students from regional areas are going to be in a position where they can go to university. Thirty hours a week is practically a full time job, and finding full-time work in the regions can be difficult. Many students in regional areas access seasonal employment in the agricultural and tourism sectors, and the government's changes to youth allowance eligibility criteria simply do not take this into account. In addition to these issues associated with the availability of work, there are issues associated with entry into university after 18 months. Many universities do not accept deferrals for periods longer than 12 months. If any more time is needed, students are required to re-apply for a place in a university course of their choice. But eligibility criteria for courses change. Whilst you may get into your chosen course one year, there is no guarantee that this will be the case two years later. In addition, the longer students defer, less likely they are to pursue tertiary study. It is already the case that over 20 per cent more students from metropolitan areas go to university than regional students. Instead of attempting to facilitate access for regional students and narrow this gap, the changes to youth allowance will only make it more difficult for these young people. Not only are there costs of studying incurred by having to move away from home to pursue study; there are also significant re-allocation costs to be met-estimated as being in the vicinity of up to $20,000. This is a further significant barrier to regional students wanting to go on to tertiary study. Unrestricted access to further education is vitally important for our nation. Further education and the attainment of skills will improve productivity and make Australia more competitive. Many regional areas rely on their young people returning to the regions to work after they have completed their study. For example, medical professionals are very difficult to source in the regions. A witness to the Senate inquiry made two points: firstly, that the government should make it easier for regional students to access university education in the hope that some may return to share their expertise with their communities and, secondly, that professional people living in the regions should not feel forced to move because their children cannot receive the education they want. It is important that all young people, regardless of where they live, be able to pursue further education if that what they want to do. The government's changes to youth allowance eligibility criteria have just made this so much harder for many young people in regional Australia. There is no equality and no fairness in this. The restriction of access to youth allowance is having many detrimental effects on young people who are classified as living in regional areas. Many are suffering, as they feel-and rightly so-that an option they once had has been removed. They are feeling isolated and guilty for putting pressure on their families to send them to university. Some families are having to make impossible decisions about which children to send to university. The provision of equal access to further education is fair and right. This big issue for these students and should be a big issue for this Labor government. It is a big issue for the coalition, and honourable members would be aware that the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 introduced by Senator Fiona Nash was passed in the Senate during the last sitting period. Senator Nash reiterated the coalition's position that gional students should have fair and equitable access to educational opportunities.' The Labor-Greens coalition opposed this bill whilst it was supported by Senators Nick Xenophon and Steve Fielding, who voted with the coalition. A Senate inquiry held into the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 [2011] recently received over 200 submissions and heard testimony from witnesses who overwhelmingly stated that the revised criteria for cessing youth allowance by inner-regional students is unfair. These students and their families are asking for a hand up, not a handout. They want to access university studies on an equal basis to their metropolitan counterparts. In conclusion, I urge all is members to support this bill in the interests of fairness for all regional students.",72
150,Mr LYONS,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I am pleased to speak on this bill today because the bill will make a real difference for many Australians. This bill essentially gives effect to three election commitments and two nonbudgetary measures: expanding the seniors work bonus; supporting families with teenagers through family tax benefits; making improvements to the provision of the baby bonus to eligible families; ensuring annuities are paid to people affected by thalidomide; is a and making minor administrative amendments to income management measures. The amendments that the Gillard Labor government has put forward today demonstrate its commitment to the Australian people. For seniors, this bill seeks to expand the existing seniors work bonus measure to allow working pensioners to keep more of their pension when they undertake paid ‘re- work. This is a very important measure. Older Australians have made our nation strong and prosperous and deserve to be supported in their later years, whether in work, in retirement or in their caring roles. Many age pensioners take on part-time or occasional work and should be encouraged and rewarded for these valuable contributions to our community. This expansion will allow this to happen. Many age pensioners or veterans affairs income support pensioners of qualifying age, and even some of the grey acnomads, want to undertake seasonal work but are concerned about the impact on their pension. These reforms will increase the amount age pensioners can earn before the income affects their pension. This follows on from the Labor government's election commitment to expand the existing seniors work bonus, which was introduced in September 2009 as part of its secure and sustainable pension reform package to support pensioners who are continuing to make a valuable contribution to the economy via their part-time employment. I am sure pensioners in my electorate of Bass will be pleased about this measure. If they choose to work a few hours a week over the Christmas period or to help out in a busy season, they will now be able to do so with our more generous work bonus. The new work bonus will allow pensioners to earn $250 per fortnight without its being assessed as income under the income test. Importantly, under these changes, the work bonus can be annualised. This means that pensioners will be able to build up any unused amount of their $250 bonus every fortnight for up to 12 months, and the unused amount can be carried forward between years up to a total of $6,500 per year. This measure improves awards for age pensioners who work and ensures that they will be able to keep more of their pension when they are working part-time. The second measure I wish to speak on today relates to helping Australian families with teenagers. This bill delivers on the ernment's key election commitment to increase family assistance by up to $4,200 a year for teenagers in secondary studies. Currently, most lowand middle-income families experience significant reductions in govagers ernment assistance when their child turns 16. This is despite the fact that most 16to 17year-olds, and a significant number of 18and 19-year-olds, remain in full-time study and under the primary care of their parents. From 1 January 2012, the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A will increase by around $160 per fortnight for teenagers aged between 16 and 19 who are in secondary school or its vocational equivalent. During the election, we announced that the level of assistance would be increased for 16to 18year-olds, but the Labor government has extended this to 19-year-olds who are finishing off their schooling. This significant increase will help families meet the higher costs of older children and encourage more teenagers to stay at school. This initiative supports the Gillard Labor government's objective to improve completion rates of year 12 and its vocational equivalents. Research shows that children from lower income families have lower levels of school completion. This finding demonstrates that the cost of educating teenage children is an important barrier for families on low incomes. The independent review of Australia's future tax system recommended: Rates of payment should increase with the age of the children to recognise the higher costs of older children. The Gillard Labor government recognises this, knowing that families with older children can face higher costs, including the costs of groceries, clothes and family activities. But, under the existing system, the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A drops from $208 a fortnight to $51 a fortnight when the child turns 16. Rent assisgovtance also stops when a child turns 16 and families may lose eligibility for family tax benefit part B, the large family supplement and the multiple birth allowance. This sharp drop in family support can encourage teento leave school early if their family is unable to support them in full-time study or training. The drop in family assistance when a child turns 16 is also one of the features of the family assistance scheme most frequently criticised by parents. This government understands the importance of this measure for Australian families. With this measure, we are resolving problems of the past. We are a government that is listening to the community and supporting families. The Gillard Labor government is committed to a fair family payment system that targets family support to lower and middle income families. The Labor government believe in supporting families to bring up children, continuing the education revolution to give every child a great start in life. We will continue to support families as they raise children and encourage their children to continue in education. Every child deserves the right to a good education and every child should be given the opportunity to meet their full potential. Another election commitment was to change the baby bonus to help Australian families. This amendment provides for eligible baby bonus claimants to have a larger portion of their baby bonus paid to them upfront, from 1 July 2011, to assist them to meet the initial costs of welcoming a child into their family. Under the changes, parents will be able to get an up-front $500 payment of the baby bonus to help with the arrival of a child. This will help Australian families buy some of the essentials that they need-a safe car seat or a pram, for example. The changes will give families better access to their entitlements in a way that more directly meets their needs. I am sure this is a measure that the people of Bass will warmly welcome. This is a move that shows that the Gillard Labor government understands the issues facing Australia families and is taking steps to address these issues. The people of Bass know that the Labor government will look after them. We have a good track record with families, with measures including paid maternity leave and investing in our children through building infrastructure in schools with the Building the Education Revolution projects. The people of Bass know that those opposite are a risk to their families. They know this because some of those opposite were key players in orchestrating the most family unfriendly policy in Australian history: Work Choices. Families need security. Without security families are unhappy-it is as simple as that-and the Liberal Party found out about that in 2007. This bill delivers on three of the government's important election commitments: improving support for families, improving the delivery of the baby bonus to new parents and better supporting pensioners who work. The bill also makes minor amendments to income management and recognises the unique plight of thalidomide survivors. The Gillard Labor government is committed to supporting Australian pensioners, families and students. We will continue to strengthen our support through these measures. I commend the bill to the House.",77
151,Mrs GASH,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I wish to speak to the amendments to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 relating to families with teenage children. I agree with the member for Bass that every child should have the opportunity to reach their full potential, but that is where my agreement ends. First of all, I want to thank the hundreds of students who attended the public meetings in our electorate with their parents and told me about their concerns with regard to the youth allowance. The Prime Minister and her Labor Party clearly do not understand or care about our regional students. They do not understand the huge financial hurdles regional students are facing to even get to a university. The train line in my electorate of Gilmore does not even make it to Nowra. The electric track stops at Kiama and an infrequent diesel service only goes to Bomaderry. Students in the southern part of Gilmore have almost no option but to take the costly option of moving away from home to attend university-not by choice. Students in Gilmore are doing it hard. The Labor Party is simply out of touch on this issue. The Shoalhaven youth unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent, yet the government still demands that students from this area find an average of 30 hours work every week for 1½ years before it will give them given adequate help to get to university. Is this opportunity? Is this choice? I think it is particularly relevant to point out the fact it was the Prime Minister herself who personally changed the rules. Employment of young people in the Shoalhaven is overwhelmingly seasonal. Employment comes and goes with the tourist season. Some weeks ago, the coalition introduced the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 into this place to change the independent youth allowance rules back to what they were under the Howard government. If the government had passed our bill, instead of having to work 30 hours every week for 1½ years, students would be automatically eligible to receive independent youth allowance as soon as they earned $26,000, regardless of their working hours, within those same 18 months. The government were too afraid to debate their mistake. They hid behind pomp and procedure to avoid even talking about the real issues. I know the coalition's change does not seem like much to those opposite, but the truth is that regional students are ing it tough, and this would be one small change that would have allowed tens of thousands of regional students a real chance at university education. Many families from Gilmore have two or three children going to university and it is very difficult to explain that students in adjoining areas are eligible, yet in Gilmore they are not. The families should not have to choose which child they can afford to send to university. It is time for the government to put aside their pride and admit that they have made a mistake. On behalf of the hundreds of students in Gilmore that have been cheated by this government, I am begging the Prime Minister to put aside her pride and change back the rules. I have heard all the horror stories and I am sure that she has too. We do not need another inquiry. We do not need another review. We need real action that from this government. If the Labor Party truly cared about our regional students, they would stand up, show some courage and pass the coalition's amendments.",79
152,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"It gives me great pleasure and a certain amount of satisfaction to be here today to speak in support of the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 [2011]. The content of this bill was the subject of communications and discussions within my electorate of Hindmarsh during the 2010 election and people in my area did support these measures-they supported them with their votes. The interest in these policies was clearly evident after the announcement by the Prime Minister and prior to the day on which most electors cast their votes. The satisfaction that I feel in supporting this bill comes from my knowledge of the benefit that people will derive from the measures contained therein. These measures will make a material differdo- ence to many, many people's lives. People favoured these policies in the context of an election. They voted accordingly and it is satisfying to recognise that they will have the value they placed in their democratic participation meaningfully acknowledged through legislative change. As we heard earlier from the many speakers who have spoken on this side of the House, there are two principal elements to this bill, and I would like to note them today. The first of these is the effective removal of the distinction within the family payment structure between 13to 15-year-olds, and 16to 19-year-olds engaged in full-time secondary study or a full-time vocational education equivalent. The impact of this measure is up to $4,000 more per year for a family with a teenager. That is a terrific amount of money and additional assistance to help families keep their children focused on successfully completing their secondary education. The family tax benefit part A has dropped by 75 per cent once a child turns 16, the age at which secondary schooling becomes ‘voluntary'. The benefit has dropped from $208 per fortnight to $51 per fortnight. Rent assisat tance also stops when a child turns 16. This drop in family support is one of the main issues that parents consistently raise concerns about with the government. We do need young Australians to take on many highly varied occupations and, as we have heard before in debates in this place, not all need either a university education or extensive training. There are opportunities for young people to engage in work and develop skills and a career within the workforce. Nevertheless, I think on balance we would all prefer the great majority of young Australians to complete their secondary schooling or equivalent and enjoy the experience without acute financial pressures. This bill will help families of some 590,000 teenagers avoid those financial pressures over the next five years alone. I also hope that young people stay at school long enough to practise and learn and to get the benefits of personal reading and self-managed study that they will require. This mode of learning, evident in late secondary education but typically more so at university, will invariably be the mode of learning engaged in by the majority of people through most situations they find themselves in and it will help all people immeasurably throughout their lives. People's lives, their work lives and their private family lives, may well be more dynamic and subject to radical change over time than ever before as the workforce and technology change. Be it as a result of increasing reliance on private wealth invested in topsy-turvy stock markets, technological revolutions, shorter careers within any one field of work, or the greater choices that are made available to people through their lives, the one thing that we can predict these days is how unpredictable life is likely to be. We fare better if we can adapt to what life throws us. Hence, to me, learning the utility of study and how to study are the greatest and most priceless lessons of all. The lessons I hope most young people learn in later secondary education will better equip them to successfully navigate in an ever-changing world for the long haul. Another thing that has been changing over time is how much longer our lives are likely to be. We face opportunities through considerably longer lives, but with that also comes uncertainties. With better health and greater longevity, age pensioners are not relying exclusively on their pension. Senior Australians are keeping more cash coming into their households through wages irrespective of when they ‘retired'. Many cannot do that, but those who can and do should be congratulated for their ongoing ability to manage their life situation and their cash flow and the way they govern their own quality of life. For years we have heard governments of both persuasions encouraging people who reach retirement age to continue to work and fund their lifestyles. There have been structural elements which may have discouraged pensioners from doing so in the past. People may have been able to take two steps forward only to have the impact within the social security system slide them one step back, or more. For increasing numbers of age pensioners more of what they earn over the threshold is effectively lost to the government through decreased pension payments. The age pension income test has been increased for new pensioners from 40 per cent to 50 per cent on additional income over the threshold. I have said this before in this place: vour a system in which the rate of withdrawal of the age pension is similar to marginal tax rates. But I do acknowledge that this change was made in September 2009 to help fund the substantial increase in the age pension at that time, further helping hundreds of thousands of pensioners doing it tough out there, especially the bulk of single pensioners who need to pay a much greater proportion of their pension on the basics, be it accommodation, vehicle or electricity costs. Ongoing comparatively high effective marginal tax rates do, and will continue to, decrease people's incentive to engage in post-retirement work. The government in its wisdom created the work bonus system introduced as part of the Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform of September 2009. It provided additional incentives for age pensioners to engage in work by quarantining wages of a certain value each fortnight from the pension income test. People in semiretirement do not always have a steady, uniform income throughout the year. Many have a period of casual or contract work. I met someone recently who had some contract work marking exams that only came around for a short period a couple of times a year. This is all within the seasonal work market. This type of work is labour intensive but only for a short period of time each year. The fortnightly income earned in such a period is no reflection whatsoever of what a person earns over the course of the year. It is fundamentally wrong, I believe, for these fortnightly incomes to be extrapolated and used to calculate a person's pension going forward through the year, wrongly presuming very high ongoing income. The measure within this bill adjusts the work bonus scheme to increase the amount of income a pensioner may earn external to I fathe pension income test to $6,500 per year. The first $250 earned in any one fortnight will not be treated as income for the purposes of social security and veterans' affairs payment calculations. Most importantly, where a person does not have uniform earnings of at least $250 each and every fortnight, this bill will enable those pensioners to roll over any unused fortnightly work bonus value to successive fortnight reporting periods up to a maximum of $6,500 per year. If you do not learn anything in one fortnight, you do not lose the potential value of the work bonus; you carry it forward through successive fortnights until you do the work. The $6,500 value is not limited in its application or use to the one financial year from which it was derived. The work bonus can be accrued from one financial year to the next. A person who earns wages each December, for instance, will not be limited to the value of the work bonus unused since 1 July of that year. People in this situation will have access to the value of the work bonus accrued since they last work, which would be December of the previous year. These changes to the work bonus system will commence from 1 July 2011. We have in this bill measures that will substantially increase the capacity for people doing it tough to get by. Whether they be families raising teenagers engaged in their last year of very important secondary studies or retirees working an amount of casual or sessional work to make it just that little bit easier to make meet, these measures will be a great assistance to many. I wholeheartedly commended the bill to the House.",80
153,Mr COULTON,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise tonight to speak on the amendment moved by Mr Andrews to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This youth allowance saga has been running for some time now in this place and the effects of it have been felt widely across regional Australia, no more so than in my electorate. It seems rather unfortunate that we are trying to deal with this as an amendment to this piece of legislation when the Prime Minister would have the ability to fix this today if she so chose. We are at this point, having to take measures such as this to get this issue dealt with House, basically because of the Prime Minister's stubbornness in dealing with this issue. Indeed, her original changes to youth allowance when she was education minister started this whole process going. Over a period of time through different actions we have had the original criteria for youth allowance restored to remote and outer regional students. Indeed, they have been restored to a large geographic area of my electorate. Unfortunately, my biggest town, Dubbo, and probably the second-biggest town in my electorate, Mudgee, have missed out. While the independent youth allowance is by no means a perfect way of financing tertiary education, I believe it has been quite effective. A person leaving school and working independently for 12 months to gain that $19,500 income and then being able to start university the following year is a good thing for a couple of reasons: it gives those students a time to reassess their priorities, rethink maybe what their interests are at uniends versity; and it gives them an opportunity to be truly independent-to work for someone else. Indeed, if they are going into tertiary education, sometimes when they go back into the workforce it is at a higher level and the work that they do in that year of qualifying for independent youth allowance is good grounding for them so that when they go back to work in a management position, they understand the other end of the workforce spectrum because they have spent time at end. Students in my electorate traditionally get jobs during the grain harvest driving tractors and headers; they go and pick grapes, apples and oranges; they stack meat in abattoirs. They have done all sorts of jobs to earn that money. They then go off to university at the start of the next year and by June they are eligible for independent youth allowance. in the Now with inner regional areas being disqualified from independent youth allowance, I have the anomaly in my electorate of people living on opposite sides of the street where the people on one side are eligible while those on the other side are not. When we talk about educating rural kids, is we think about kids who are living out on farms and away from town. Indeed, there is a proportion of those kids and it is very important they get the education they deserve. But the families that are impacted now are living in Dubbo and Mudgee. The people who have been contracting me have been police officers, school teachers, people who work on the council or in health-all those vital services that country areas rely on. In a city like Dubbo that services a large part of western New South Wales, a large number of public servants are in that area. What they are telling me is if they have two, three or four kids they are deciding which one they can afford to send to university and which one will have to make other arrangements for employment. That is a disgusting situation in 2011. I believe in Australia we should have equal access to education regardless of where we live. Country kids, given the opportunity to gain an education, go on to become wonderful productive Australians because that resilience, that independent streak and that benefit of growing up in a community where they know their neighbourhood, where they are respected for who they are as a child and a young adult is a great grounding. After the grounding they get at the good country schools, once they get the opportunity for tertiary education, they go on to be very high-achieving Australians and very productive Australians. Hopefully, they will decide eventually to come back to the regions that supported them in the first place and continue to contribute to regional Australia. It is not a huge amount of money we are speaking about to fix this. I cannot believe the pig-headedness of the Prime Minister over this issue. In the four years I have been in this place, from when she was education minister and now as Prime Minister, she has defined herself as someone who is an advocate for education, who has succeeded because of the education she received growing up, but she cannot see the double standard that she has inflicted on the students of regional Australia by not allowing them the same opportunity. The effects of this go further than the cation of those children because, ultimately, what is happening in regional Australia is that whole families are relocating so they can do the best for their children. My wife and I raised three children, 50 kilometres from the nearest town. The one thing that we were focused on with those children of ours was to give them a decent education. If these families cannot afford to give their children the education they need then they relocate to the city. Not only are we losing the child, we are losing entire families. So we have massive gaps in service delivery and a lack of professionals in these regional towns like Dubbo and Mudgee. As the congestion in the cities grows, people are forced to live in metropolitan areas under a lower standard and quality of life, but they are doing that to give their children an education and so regional Australia misses out. It is with great frustration that I am standing here tonight speaking on an amendment on a bill that is to do with something else but we are determined, on this side of the House, not to let this issue die. I would call upon those that sit behind me in this place, the crossbenchers, to stand up for the electorates they represent. During the debate on the motion moved on this issue by the member for Melbourne some weeks ago, we had the bizarre situation where the member for Lyne seconded the motion, went outside, had a conference with the Prime Minister for 20 minutes, came back in and voted against the motion that he had seconded. The people of regional Australia, quite frankly, have had a gut full of these smart deals that go on in shady rooms around this place to try to keep government going rather than focus on service delivery for country students. There is no greater investment that a country and a government can make than the education of the next generation of Austraedulians. We have a double standard where if someone lives in a metropolitan area they can live at home with mum and dad and attend university-they would probably have a choice of several universities-but someone that comes from regional Australia, from a town like Dubbo or Mudgee, would miss out purely because of a line on a map. These kids are getting a good education. There are excellent education facilities in Dubbo; likewise, in Mudgee. They are getting up to the point where they are becoming young adults and they have done very well. They are getting huge tertiary education rankings and then they are being cut off at the knees because of the lack of an opportunity, financially, to attend university. strongly support the amendment moved by Mr Andrews to this bill and, hopefully, when we come to divide on this later on we will gain the support of the crossbenches. Supposedly, in that conference that the member for Lyne had with the Prime Minister some weeks ago, there was some deal done. From what I can find out-and please correct me if I am wrong-there has been a promise of a review that may happen later in the year, the students that left in 2009 and 2010 are going to miss out. That is why there is an urgency. That is why we keep putting up this amendment. We need to make sure that those students who left in 2009 and 2010 do not become a gap where one whole cohort of students have missed out on a tertiary educacusing tion because of the pig-headedness and the stubbornness and the deals done in this place to keep government going at the expense of country students. I strongly support Mr Andrews' amendment.",83
154,Mr NEUMANN,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I will first address the issue of the amendment put forward by those opposite. Through their amendment they want to reinstate the former workplace participation teria-and I want people who are listening to note that-and to appropriate funds necessary to meet the additional costs of expanding the criteria for participation. So they want us to reinstate workforce participation criteria and to allocate more money. That is pretty much what the coalition always likes to do, because they have never found an opportunity to spend money that they did not like. We saw that in the last five years of the Howard coalition government: real spending growth of 3.7 per cent per annum, five times greater than the average spending growth So I over this year and the budget estimates, which is 0.75 per cent. This is from a mob who say we should appropriate more money but are blocking $5.2 billion of savings measures we have previously proposed in respect of private health insurance reforms and replacing the chronic disease dental scheme with a Commonwealth dental health plan. They have opposed those measures and many of our $83.6 billion in savings over the but last three years. So: spend more money and block the savings that are necessary to spend it. That is what we have seen. I warmly welcome the announcement by the federal Labor government to bring forward by 12 months a comprehensive review of student income support, particularly foon the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. The eligibility for youth allowance is of particular significance and importance to students and families in regional and rural areas. We recognise that we need to eliminate eligibility distinctions between inner regional and outer regional students. That review will report by 1 July this year-contrary to what the member for Parkes had to say-and the government will move to implement any new eligibility arrangements by 1 January 2012. The review will consider appropriate savings and pay for the extension of eligibility for the criyouth allowance. Improving university participation for regional students is central to the federal Labor government's commitment to higher education reforms. The changes we brought into the parental income test have benefited 492 young people in Ipswich and the Somerset region and a further 661 young people have benefited from student start-up scholarships in my electorate of Blair. In addition, 102 young people in Ipswich and the Somerset region have benefited from the relocation scholarship. A better deal under us than under those opposite-those are the facts, not the fiction we have heard from those opposite. I have two universities in my electorate of Blair: the University of Queensland Ipswich campus and the University of Southern Queensland Springfield campus. They do a fantastic job. Let us look at a few facts when we talk about youth allowance statistics. We have got over 100,000 students benefiting from the increase in funding that we have provided and assistance we have given. The parental income threshold increased from $33,300 to $44,165, with a 20 per cent family taper introduced. So 100,000 students have benefited who would not have benefited before, and students are allowed to earn more money through part-time work before their payments are affected. Those are the facts, not the fiction from those opposite. Now let us have a look at what they would do. They went to the 2010 federal election with a plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding designed to attract lowincome students to attend university. Look at their policy-not what they say in this chamber nor in the Senate just down the corridor, but what they took to the last election. Despite what they say here today, they actually took a plan to the last election to cut funding for universities which would attract low-income students. That is the reality. Their changes, recklessly introduced, would mean spending of more than $300 million without identifying additional savings to pay for it. That was their policy. When they came up with the idea of some savings, and the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation had a look at it post the election-because the coalition did not have the courage, fortitude or indeed the honesty to submit it under the Charter of Budget Honesty, which they had brought in-what was found was $10.6 billion worth of black hole. When we proposed and brought in the flood levy they said it was going to be easy to find savings. But did they come up with any? They came up with another billion dollar black hole across the forward estimates. Now they say, ‘Let's spend another $300 million,' but not one dollar of savings are they proposing. They say, ‘We want to help regional and rural students; we want to lift their workplace participation, change the criteria and do it.' Well, let us look at their record, not what they say. During the coalition's time, when John Howard sat at the table-where the member for Blaxland is currently sitting-and behind him sat Peter Costello, the Treasurer, what happened to participation rates for regional and rural students? Did they go up? No. And, gee, didn't the National Party do a good job then in influencing John Howard and Peter Costello! Did participation rates for regional and rural students in this country increase? They did not. The fact is they went down. For example, between 2002 and 2007, participation rates for regional students at tertiary institutions fell from 18.715 per cent to 18.08 per cent. That workplace participation criterion helped them a lot! It really assisted regional and rural students! The fact is that the changes we brought in benefited people in rural and regional electorates like mine. Hundreds and hundreds of young people will get additional assistance through the changes we have made. The Nationals say one thing here, parading and prancing about in the House, and say another thing back in their electorates. But the reality is that, when they had a chance to increase participation rates for rural and regional students at universities-when they had stewardship of the treasury benchesthey did nothing. In fact, things went backwards. Then they took a policy to the last election to actually reduce funding assistance for university students and participation of students from rural and regional areas. That is the reality, as opposed to the rhetoric, from those opposite. This legislation is important. It fulfils election commitments and some non-budget measures. One is in relation to the work bonus, and I am pleased to speak on and support that. The work bonus allows working pensioners to keep more of their pension when they undertake paid work, and a number of my caucus colleagues have given the particulars of that in the chamber. The second election commitment fulfilled provides better access to family payments for families with a teenager aged 16 to 19 in full-time secondary education or the vocational education equivalent. Everyone who has teenagers knows that the cost does not decrease as they get older. Clothes, shoes, high-school textbooks, recreational pursuits-the costs all increase. The funding provided for here will benefit families and will have the effect, we believe, of lifting high school completion rates from that miserable 75 per cent of students under the Howard coalition government to an aspirational 90 per cent by 2015. The third election commitment fulfilled, which I fully support as well, is improvements to the provision of the baby bonus. We changed the baby bonus arrangements to make them fortnightly across 13 fortnightsa good measure, in my view-and we are also providing an upfront payment of $500 in the first instalment which will assist in terms of prams, nursery items and the other things that mums and dads need for a new baby once it is born. While there is no change to the overall amount, I think that upfront measure will help. A further measure in the bill exempts payments to people affected by thalidomide from being assessable for welfare or income tax purposes. Today, those opposite have waxed lyrical about their commitment to helping families, but I think they need a bit of a history lesson on assistance to families in regional and rural areas and communities across this country. The global financial crisis did not stifle our government's commitment to reform when it came to tax relief, and we brought such measures forward three years in a row. Nor did it stifle our commitment to reforms for pensioners. We have assisted our 3.3 million pensioners-age pensioners, disability support pensioners, carers and others. Indeed, as early as March 2008, we extended the utilities allowance of about $590 per annum to disability support pensions, something that was never graciously given by John Howard when he was in power. Those opposite discriminated between people on disability support pensions and those on age pensions. The 2009-10 budget provided $14.2 billion under our secure and sustainable pension reforms, increasing the adequacy of the level of support; increasing certainty in terms of payments; making the pension system in this country simpler, more understandable and more flexible; and making sure our social security system is secure and sustainable. From 29 September 2009, there was a weekly increase in the age pension of $32.49 for singles and $10.14 for couples. We also legislated to make sure there was a benchmark that guaranteed the pension for singles would be 27.7 per cent of MTAWE. We gave $1,400 to singles and $2,100 to couples at the time of the global financial crisis as a short-term stimulus payment. The new permanent carer supplement helped about 500,000 people across Australia who make significant sacrifices to assist their loved ones each and every day. You cannot solve their problems, but you can give them a helping hand. About 140,000 carers who receive the carer payment received a supplement of $600 annually. As I said, we increased the single rate for the age pension-in accordance with the recommendations of the Harmer review-to bring it up to two-thirds of the combined couple rate, and we changed the indexation with respect to pensions as well. We said that there should be a new pensioner and beneficiary cost-of-living index and that, if it was higher than the CPI, which it has proved to be, it would keep better pace with the rising prices of goods. In particular, I think that work bonus will be greatly appreciated by pensioners, because many of them do not fully leave the workforce when they transition to retirement. Part-time work for pensioners is important in terms of their financial independence, but it is also good for our economy and our community. Workforce participation is encouraged by the work bonus introduced by this government. So the work bonus we are achieving for our senior citizens was introduced by a federal Labor government. Again, the coalition failed in this regard. The Howard government's pension bonus scheme was too complex and failed to achieve the objects of increasing workforce participation. Do not just trust me on this because that is what the Harmer review found in relation to workforce participation. Whether it is participation and universities for regional and rural students or workforce participation for our senior citizens-those making the transition into retirement-the coalition's record in this regard is atrocious, absolutely disastrous. They had no commitment to the value of work; they had no commitment to regional and rural areas. They will say whatever they need to make sure that they get their fear campaigns heard in their local country newspapers and on their country radio stations, but when it comes to delivering for regional and rural areas they know nothing. They know nothing about road, rail, community infrastructure which we delivered in these areas for the first time. They know nothing with respect to education reforms. In my regional and rural seat, for the first time, we have seen education treated as a priority. We have seen 220 projects and $108 million under the BER funding. This is the kind of commitment to regional and rural Australia that is so evident by this federal Labor government that cares for those who need it.",85
155,Ms MARINO,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise the to speak on the amendment moved to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 by the member for Menzies in relation to the youth allowance and workplace participation criteria for independent youth allowance. I would have to ask why this government continues to discriminate against students in my electorate and right around Australia who meet the inner regional classification? That is the one question that no-one is prepared to answer: why is it that this government continues to discriminate against educational opportunities for these great young people and put additional pressure on families. We have heard that families have to move and I deal with these families on a regular basis. I had a parent ring me just recently to say that his daughter who will not qualify, because of the deal that has been done between the Independents and the government in the latest review, given her position as a 2009-10 student now has to stop her tertiary education because she cannot afford to continue. She was hoping to be one of those who would achieve support through youth allowance. She now has to come back to her hometown and her dreams of an education and a career have been seriously compromised. This is the reality that this decision has delivered to regional areas. Apparently there are up to 20,000 great young people around this nation who are affected by this decision. The requirement that forces these young people to find 30 hours of work a week over 18 months is sometimes impossible in a regional area. It really reinforces to me the that a Labor government does not understand how a regional area works. I have young people who live in places like Donnybrook, Dunsborough, Brunswick, Harvey and Collie. These are not necessarily big community centres, but how do these young people find 30 hours of work a week over 18 months? A lot of employment that is available is seasonal, so it is just not possible for these young people to meet the commitments of having to find 30 hours of work a week and meet the blocks that they are required to do. Plus they then will have two years away from study. Our concern is that their participation rates will fall even further because the longer they stay away from tertiary education the less likely they are to continue with their higher education. So this is where these young people find themselves. I have had mothers in supermarkets say to me, ‘We now have to try to find a second extra job ourselves'. These are husbands or wives who have to fund their child's university education. This is Australia. This is what we have done. This is what the Labor government has done for these great young people and these families. We are seeing a loss, a drain, of these young ple and families from our communities. The students already face significant problems in accessing youth allowance and in accessing an education. All they are asking for is a fair go-access to youth allowance-and they will go on and do the best they can and come back and work within the regional areas quite frequently and bring great skills and knowledge back to our communities. They have no choice but to relocate to study. That is the way it is in a regional area. You cannot just go up the road to the university, there is not one there. You have no choice but to relocate and yet you are being denied the opportunity to access youth allowance to do so for at least two years. The fact universities are even saying now that they are not going to hold their places. Where does this leave those young people? The 2009-10 cohort are in no-man's-land. They were not picked up by the previous criteria and they are certainly not now under the current review. They are nowhere. What plans do they make? What plans do their families make? They cannot plan. This is where this has left them. It is the most appalling discrimination. When the families ask me, ‘Why has the government done this?' I do not have an answer. Why are your children not eligible but other ones in the same school are? I do not have that answer, only the government has that answer. Only the Prime Minister has that answer because she made this decision. We do know already that 55 per cent of metropolitan students go on to tertiary education compared to only 33 per cent of students from regional areas. The disadvantage is quite serious already but this is enhancing that disadvantage and I do not understand why the government has made this decision. We have repeatedly, as have the parents and the students, made the government aware of just what this is doing to the stupeo- dents. The government have had opportunity after opportunity, through motions and through bills and even through their own decisions, to change this. Why not introduce a bill or a motion yourselves? Why not fix it? Why not give yourselves the opportunity to fix it? The opportunity is there every day in this parliament to fix this anomaly that you have created. Please take that opportunity. Do not continue to discriminate against these students and do not continue to put their lives, their careers, their families and their educational opportunity on hold or at risk or make it non-existent. You can fix this. I have here one of the latest emails I have received. It says: I am a 2009 school leaver classified … as an Inner Rural student, meaning that I have to work an average of 30 hours per week over … 18 months … At the time of my graduation, the new changes were still unconfirmed, and so I chose to take a gap year in the hope that I would still be able to qualify somehow. How does that make us feel? I know how it makes me feel and I hope that is how it makes some on the other side feel. The email continues: I live at best, two hours by car (and longer ing public transport) away from my university … There is no public transport in the majority of regional areas. It is not there, and certainly not to a university that is in Perth. She actually lives over two hours away from a university, and that is not even taking into account the cost of travelling, such as petrolor, if she were able to access public transport, by train or bus. She says: … my only real option is to move up to the city, where I'd need to find and pay for accommodation. Under the old Youth Allowance laws, I would have had to earn … 75 per cent of the minimum wage. When the changes were announced, we'd originally hoped that at the very least, I could qualify by working 40 hours a week for … 12 months therefore averaging the same amount of hours … But that is not possible under what the government has done. She continues: My university will not let me defer for any time period longer than a year, and under the new laws I would have to relinquish my place were I to pursue Youth Allowance. How do you think this makes this young lady feel? How do you think it makes her parents feel? One of the most tragic real-life stories I have heard-it is not a story; it is the reality-comes from the parent who says to me, ‘We have to choose which one of our children we can afford to send to university.' How do you choose and what happens to the family dynamic? What happens to those who you cannot afford to send? When I go into schools, what is even worse is that great young people in regional areas like mine say to me when I meet them: ‘I have actually changed my year 11 and 12 focus. I am not going to pursue the courses that will take me to university because my family cannot afford to send me.' So they are consciously if takmaking the decision. Some of the drop-out rates will not be showing because these young people are making very practical decisions that have been forced on them by the decisions that this government has made. They will not show up in some of the figures and statistics, but these kids will be victims of this. That is what is ahead of us here. These young people have to take the decision now of not doing year 11 and 12 as they should be doing. They are taking a voc ed or other type of course or they are going to make another decision to do some form of training if they can secure it. These are conscious decisions that are being made by young people in inner regional areas. I have another email here. It says: Thankyou for your continuing efforts to get our kids the same financial opportunities as all other regional kids when they choose to attend university education. I also find the changes very frustrating, restrictive and unfair with regards to the 18 month criteria. My son and many others from his school finishing in 2009 have chosen to begin their university studies this year because their course does not allow them to defer longer than 12 months or they want to begin following a 12 month enforced break. My son has very little chance of qualifying for youth allowance now because he has not fulfilled the criteria of the 18 months. He will be using savings to fund his university course and all ing expenses incurred as a result of having to relocate to Perth. I cannot understand why the 18 month time-frame, other than a means by which many more students will be eliminated from receiving any financial assistance. This mother says at the bottom of the email: What else can concerned parents do to make Labor and the independents see what they are doing? I have asked that question over and over. My colleagues and I have tried over and over to get this changed, to give these great young people equity of opportunity. They are asking simply for a fair go. As I said here previously, there were many phone calls to my office when the Prime Minister made her statement in Washington-when she said that perhaps the ultimate importance is the right to education, that she was passionate about education, that education is the key to all our opportunities and that education is the one thing that no-one can ever take away from us. That is true, Prime Minister, but you have to be able to access the education in the first place. Prime Minister, the changes that you have made have disaffected great young people. They have taken away the opportunity for education from those young people who have no choice but to not pursue their preferred courses and their preferred career. They have no choice because they cannot afford to go to university. They cannot afford to go without the support of the independent youth allowance. So many people have said to me, ‘If the Prime Minister believes this, why did she make those changes?' I do not have the answer either. The comment made in the US was really a slap in the face. People said to me, ‘If the Prime Minister is really genuine about that, why isn't she making the changes his that she has been given the opportunity to liv- make?' My other request is: why can't the Prime Minister and this government make those changes voluntarily? Why does it have to take the will of the people, the will of the two houses here? Both houses voted for the changes to youth allowance because they wanted fairness and equity for the great young people in this nation-the great young people from the areas defined as inner regional. The government has resisted this opportunity over and over. But why? Why would you resist the chance to give an opportunity to a young person in a regional area to pursue higher education? Education should be a priority. It is a priority for me and I was hoping that it was a priority for members of both houses. Both houses voted for this and I have presented petitions. The will of the people, through the voices in both chambers, is for this government to fix this, but the government continues to resist it. I support the amendment. This offers the government yet another opportunity to fix a problem that they have created. It is a problem that has been visited upon these great young people and their families in rural and regional areas. As I said earlier, all they are asking for is simply a fair go. They want a fair go because they will make the most of the opportunity. They come from a regional area. They will go; they will study; they will learn; they will commit themselves. Hopefully, part of the development of regional areas will come from these great young people who bring their skills back to us. That is the key to regional development in so many senses. It is not necessarily well understood by some, because if it was, the government would not have made these changes. These young people will bring so much back to the regional areas and I support the amendments as moved by the shadow minister.",88
156,Ms HALL,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 legislation that we have before us in the parliament today and to oppose the amendment. This piece of legislation is good news for Australian families. It is good news for Australian seniors and it is good news for those people who are having children. This legislation gives effect to three election commitments and two non-budget measures. I will come back to discuss these in detail. The first election commitment in the bill is the expansion of the existing seniors work bonus measure to allow working pensioners to keep more of their pension when they undertake paid work. The second election commitment provides for better access to family payments for families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full-time secondary school or vocational education equivalent. The third election commitment provides improvements to the provision of the baby bonus for eligible families. The fourth measure ensures the annuities paid to people affected by thalidomide are not treated as assessable income for income support tests or for income tax purposes. Lastly, the bill makes minor administrative amendments to the income management measures. I will start with one of the last measuresthat which deals with thalidomide. I think this is an important measure. Those of us who are familiar with thalidomide know that it was a morning sickness drug that was given to mothers back in the sixties and seventies. It led to birth defects. A trust has been set up and payments have been made. This legislation exempts those payments from income tests. That is really in the spirit of what was intended. These annuities will be excluded from social security and veterans affairs income tests and from income tax. These annuities are not compensation payments, so they can be treated in that way, whereas a compensation payment does have an impact on income tax and on social security and income tested benefits. These are annuities and not compensation payments and this measure ensures that those payments are treated as was intended. The other issue that I would like to touch on quickly is the matched savings scheme payment. That is designed to assist those who are on compulsory income management. Currently the qualifying savings period starts when the person commences a course. This will be changed so that the person can begin saving as soon as they register for a course rather than having to wait. That is a very positive change, which will help people to save a lot quicker. I would like to turn to the three parts of this legislation that were election commitments. The first of those relates to the baby bonus. This legislation allows for the first payment of the baby bonus to be $500 and the remaining 11 payments be reduced slightly. The impact of this is to allow a larger upfront payment at a time when families or mothers need that payment. Particularly if it is your first child you have to buy cots, bassinettes and prams. Even that $500 goes nowhere near the cost that will be incurred. For a subsequent child there are still costs associated with the birth. So this is a very sensible change. It is a change that recognises the fact that families-mothers-incur a greater cost at the time of the birth of their child. I feel that this is really good news for families. This is a change that will benefit all people who need to have that little bit extra up front at the time of the birth of their child. The next measure in this piece of legislation provides better access to family payments for families with a teenager aged 16 to 19 in full-time secondary school or vocational education. Under the current scheme, payments for family tax benefit A are reduced when the young person reaches the age of 16. From 1 January 2012, when this legislation comes into force, family tax benefit A will increase by around $160 per fortnight for teenagers aged 16 to 19 who are undertaking study. Under the existing scheme, the benefits paid under the family tax benefit decrease from $214 to $53 per fortnight when the child turns 16. It is important for the House to note that the later years of study are the years that attract the greatest cost. The Henry review argued: Family payments should be the main form of assistance for childrenor young peopleaged up to 18 years, or until the completion of secondary school … This change recognises that family tax benefit will be the main form of support for those young people. It continues: Beyond these points, youth payments focused on encouraging study … should be available. There should be a seamless transition assistance to income support for young people. This should be based on the person's circumstances and only one payment should be available … This legislation picks up on that recommendation in the Henry tax review. The Gillard government views education as vitally important and recognises that, if a young person completes their education, their work opportunities are much greater. This change will encourage young people to stay at school longer. It provides greater support to families and, in doing so, gives those young people better opportunities for the future. This is a very important change and one that I am sure all members of this House will embrace. I would like to turn to the changes to the work bonus. The introduction of the work bonus by this government in 2009 was groundbreaking. Currently we are trying to encourage more people with skills to stay in the workforce. The work bonus was introduced as part of the government's Secure and Sustainable Pension reform package and worked as an incentive for older Australians to stay in the workforce and thereby stay engaged, utilise their skills and continue to contribute to the welfare of our countryalthough I might add that people who choose not to work after the age of 65 still make enormous contributions. This is a way of utilising the skills of a very important group in our community. When the work bonus was introduced it was groundbreaking legislation, encouraging senior Australians to engage. This legislation expands the work bonus. The first $250 earned in a fortnight will not be treated as income for social security and veterans affairs purposes. Pensioners will be able to build up any unused amount of their $250 fortnightly bonus in an ‘income bank', up to a maximum of $6,500. This ‘income bank' can be used to exempt future earnings from family from the pension income test. I-and, I am sure, a number of members of this parliament-have been approached by pensioners and seniors that work in blocks. Two particular groups in my electorate of Shortland come to mind. One is the group of people employed as Santa Clauses. Santa Clauses only work at one particular time of the year, and they earn a significant amount of money-although nowhere near $6,500. It is seasonal, intense employment, in which they earn more than the $250 a fortnight that they are exempt. This legislation will allow all those seniors that really enjoy working as Santa Clause at Christmastime to bank their work bonus. The other significant group-a very significant group-is seniors and pensioners who work supervising university exams. A number of pensioners who have come along to see me have said that the $250 exemption is great but it does not work as effectively for them as it could. The changes in this legislation allow them a maximum of $6,500, which well and truly covers the amount of money they earn. The changes will ensure that pensioners are able to keep more of their pension when they work. At this time. I would like to put on record that I think that one of the truly untapped resources of our society is senior Australians, those people that would still like to contribute through working. I feel that as a nation we need to embrace the fact that they have skills to offer and we need to be more mindful of the fact that mature workers in Australia should be embraced and welcomed into the workforce. This is one way of acknowledging that older Australians that are in receipt of a pension can make an enormous contribution. This is great legislation. It is really good news for all those Australians that are affected by it and I recommend it to the House.",92
157,Mr CHESTER,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to speak in support of the amendment to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is a very important amendment which seeks to provide a fairer and a more equitable system of student income support via the independent youth allowance. In particular, this amendment deals with the workforce participation criteria for the independent youth allowance and the discriminatory system of inner regional and outer regional classifications, which is unfairly affecting students in Gippsland and across regional Australia. I have spoken on the broader issue of income support on many occasions during my almost three years in this place. It is important to remind the House about some of the history of this debate and, some would say, the history of this debacle. The former Minister for Education Julia Gillard created a mess in the May 2009 budget with her attack on gap year students. The retrospective nature of the government's legislation caused the problems for regional students in the first place. What erupted was a fight right across regional Australia-not just in Gippsland but in every regional community. The member for Cowper, who is with me tonight, and other members right across regional Australia were inundated with calls from students, from teachers and from parents and friends of students. They were angry and they are still angry today. Dozens of petitions were presented to this place, with many thousands of people protesting about the gap year arrangements as proposed by the education minister of the time. There were rallies in many regional communities where students spoke out against the injustice that was forced upon them by Julia Gillard as education minister. To her credit, the minister finally backed down, but the only reason she backed down was that she realised she had a political problem. I would like to tell the Prime Minister now that she has another political problem. This system of discriminating against regional students on the basis of lines on a map will hang around her neck like a dead albatross until the next election. Regional MPs opposite may think that this is some sort of political game. Let me assure them that when it comes to student income support I am not about political games. This is about achieving a fair and equitable outcome for regional students who right now are being discriminated against by this government-and this government knows it. The political futures of regional MPs-and I include Labor MPs and Independent MPs-are at stake in this debate. There is a depth of passion in regional communities which you probably have not noticed. If you do not wake up to it soon, the price you will pay at the ballot box will be extreme. I appeal to Julia Gillard as a former educastatus, tion minister and as Prime Minister to finally understand: you have completely misread regional Australia. You have completely misread this issue from start to finish. Rural people are very slow to anger, but I can assure you they do not forget and they will not forget a Prime Minister who had the capacity to deliver a fairer and more equitable system of student income support and failed. They will never forget that they had a Prime Minister who came in here and talked about the education revolution, who staked her whole career on her reputation in relation to education, but who, when she had the chance to do something which was in the interests of students right across regional Australia, failed miserably. Students across Australia and their parents and teachers want us to fix this mess, and this amendment before the House tonight is the first step. I am concerned that the Independent MPs from the regional communities-the member for Denison, the member for Lyne and the member for New England-have fallen for the sucker punch here. They believed this government's assurances just a couple of weeks ago that it will take action in January next year to try and fix the mess in relation to the inner regional and outer regional classifications. But surely they are beginning to realise that a promise from this government is not worth anything and it is certainly not worth anything to the students from the 2009 and 2010 cohorts who will miss out while the Independent MPs continue to support the Gillard government's procrastination on this issue. The workforce criteria problems as they exist right now exist because we have two systems in place-this classification of outer regional and inner regional. If you are regarded as an outer regional student, you face easier criteria to achieve the independent but for students in inner regional areas-and in my electorate these include towns like Sale, Maffra, Hayfield; these are very small towns which are regarded as inner regional-finding full-time employment in those regional areas and small communities is often very difficult for the students. They struggle to achieve the independent criterion of 30 hours per week over a total two-year time frame. This legislation also does not take into account the seasonal nature of many jobs in regional communities-particularly the tourism sector and the agricultural sector in my electorate-which creates another barrier for regional students, and here I am referring particularly to inner regional students. What we are talking about here tonight with this amendment is a system of fairness and equity of access for all regional students, who, as we understand, are often forced to move away from home to pursue higher education. The Prime Minister needs to end the hollow rhetoric about an education revolution and start cleaning up the mess that exists in student income support. Even the current Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations has acknowledged this is a mess. He was on ABC Gippsland radio recently and said the current system ‘was an inelegant solution' and he also admitted it was ‘a bit untidy'. The students, parents and teachers listening would have other words to describe the mess that has been created by this government. The pathetic solution that is being put forward now is to bring forward an inquiry and make it report a bit earlier, by 1 July this year. But the minister himself is already backing away from any suggestion that he will address the issue of inner regional and outer regional classifications for the purpose of accessing independent youth allowance. The Independent MPs should be taking note of every word that comes out of the education minister's mouth in relation to this. They did a deal a fraction over two weeks ago, and he is already backing away from that deal. I take note of the earlier comments of the member for Shortland. She said that the Gillard government views education as vitally important. People on this side of the House view education as vitally important as well, and we are demanding a fair go for students in regional communities. This, as I said, is a major issue right across regional Australia, and it is another fundamental breach of trust by the Gillard government. The members who shake their headswho come from metropolitan areas or from regional communities and who think that we are playing a game on this particular issueneed to understand the stress and the uncertainty that they have created right throughout regional Australia with these changes. I would probably be getting 10 calls a week in my office from parents in the inner regional area who are trying to find a way for their child to access youth allowance. I acknowledge that there are two ways to access youth allowance: either dependent youth allowance or independent youth allowance. I have acknowledged from day one that the changes to the income threshold for dependent youth allowance have been well received in regional communities and they have been seen as positive steps right throughout regional Australia. I commended the Prime Minister for those changes when she was previously the Minister for Education. But the issue of independent youth allowance is where the government has failed miserably and caused enormous confusion and enormous uncertainty. What people opposite do not seem to understand is that these students make their decisions years in advance of actually going to university. They start setting their career pathways in year 9 and year 10, in consultation with their careers advisers and their school principals. So this uncertainty and the confusion over how the criteria will apply for independent youth allowance has already affected students from the 2009 and 2010 cohorts. Continuing this holding pattern until January next year is just making it more difficult for students right throughout regional areas. The real holding pattern from 1 July this year should be to abolish the current arrangements of inner regional and outer regional and give all regional students the same access to independent youth allowance. That should be the holding pattern until this review is completed. Then the review should continue, and the review should completely overhaul the system of student income support. The changes from 1 January next year, rather than talking about changes in inner regional and outer regional, should be looking at a complete overhaul of student income support, with a tertiary access allowance which addresses this fundamental inequity for regional students. Mr Deputy Speaker Kelvin Thomson, I acknowledge that you represent an inner Melbourne seat. But the members who represent regional seats see that the extra costs borne by parents from our community to send their children to university are becoming such an onerous burden that students are simply bailing out of the system. We have young people who have the potential to go on to achieve great things at university who are making the decision, for economic reasons, to remain in a regional community, and I fear we are selling those children short. I believe we can do better in this place than to have regional students curtailing their ambitions and forfeiting their dreams of higher education simply because we have a government that talks big about an education revolution but fails to deliver when it comes to real support for regional families. This is social issue and it is an economic issue. We are taking money out of regional towns to pay for the accommodation for country students when they go to metropolitan areas to attend university. We are stripping wealth out of regional communities to do that. There is no compensation whatsoever for the families, and it is becoming more and more difficult in these times of increased costs of living for families to make those financial commitments. As you heard the member for Parkes refer to earlier, families are making very tough decisions and having to choose which one of their children can attend a university and which student has to remain in the regional community. We in this place need to reduce the economic barriers for regional students who are forced to leave home to attend university. The social issue is very apparent to all of us who live in a regional area. The importance of regional communities having opportunities to train our own young people to take on roles in areas such as health, engineering or other tertiary-qualified areas is well understood. We know-and various studies have proven this-that if country kids get the opportunity to go to university then they are more likely to return to a regional community in the future and contribute their skills to that regional area. They much more likely to return and address some of those major issues we have, particularly in the area of health services. But our participation rates in regional communities when it comes to tertiary courses are much lower than those of our metropolitan counterparts. Unless you fundamentally believe that country kids are dumber than city kids, there must be an issue. The issue is the economic barrier. We in this place have the power to start reducing the economic barrier and stop robbing country kids of the opportunity to achieve their full potential. This is a chance a for us here in this place to stand up for regional students. It is a chance for those opposite to live up to their rhetoric about the education revolution and actually start delivering on the transformational power of education that they talk about but unfortunately have failed to deliver in their time in this place. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues, both in this chamber and in the other place, for their determination in pursuing this issue. Those opposite may be getting sick of us standing up here, talking about youth allowance. They may be getting sick of us attaching amendments to various bills. Let me assure them that we will continue to pursue this issue until we finally get a fair result for regional students. I want to thank the thousands of parents, teachers and students who have rallied to support this cause right throughout Australia. From the day we rallied together in 2009 to stop the unfair treatment of gap year students, we have held the Rudd government and the Gillard government to account on this issue. We must continue that fight. To those people from regional communities who are listening tonight, let me assure you that there are members in this place, on this side of the Housesuch as the member for Parkes, the member for Cowper, the member for Mallee, the member for Menzies, the member for Calare are and the member for Mackellar, who are all in the chamber-who are determined to fight this case until we finally get a fair and equitable system for regional communities. I would also particularly like to thank Senator Fiona Nash for the work that she has done on this issue, along with the member for Sturt-the shadow minister for education-and the member for Forrest, who we have heard from tonight. They have been at the forefront of this issue and are continuing to pursue the government in relation to getting a fairer deal for regional students. There have been many other coalition members. I have just named a few-who have fought the good fight. We will continue that fight, and I urge all concerned Australians who may be listening to this broadcast tonight to raise issue at every opportunity. Write to your Labor regional MP. Write to your Independent MP in regional communities and demand a better deal. Write to them. Send them an email. Ring them up. The only way they are going to listen is with people pressure. Once this Prime Minister realises she has a political problem, she will take action. That is the only way this government listens to the people of Australia. We must continue to highlight this issue in the interests of fairness the interests of equity for regional Australian students. I thank the House.",94
158,Mr JOHN COBB,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"I rise to support the amendment to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. You just heard the comment made that this is a social issue and an equity issue. It is also an issue about the future of regional Australia. It is a very well-known fact that when Australian kids go to a place like the UK they have no trouble getting a job, because their work ethic is recognised. It is also a well-known fact that when country kids go to the city they have no trouble getting a job in Australia, because their work ethic is recognised. We do not have a problem in the bush and regional Australia about having kids with a work ethic and the desire to use it. But we do have a problem in that the professionals we need and who we retain-the medical profession in particular-tend to be the ones who were born and grew up there. Most of the occupations to which I refer require further education after year 12 in high school. By and large, they cannot get that in regional Australia. It is a very real issue, even in an electorate like mine is now-almost small, as opposed to before; it is a mere 30,000 square kilometres-which does have a university at Bathurst and varithis ous outreaches. The chances are that even in that area either students cannot get into the course they want to do or the course does not exist where they want to do it. As you have heard others say, the Prime Minister only backed down on the youth allowance in the outer regional and more remote areas of Australia when she had no choice politically. What is the difference from living in Cobar and having to travel to Sydney? You still have to live away from and home. They are great people in Cobar; I know them very well. However, if you live in Orange, Bathurst, Lithgow, Forbes or Parkes the chances are that you will not be able to do your tertiary education locally unless you are lucky enough to get into Bathurst-and most cannot. You have to go to Armidale, Canberra, Sydney or one of the other universities in Australia. You certainly cannot go there and live at home. So I am rather puzzled as to why-quite correctlythe decision was made that the more remote areas should have the old system applied of one year in which you had the opportunity to earn the $15,000 when those who live in what is now termed as ‘inner regional' do not. It is extraordinarily important for our future and for the ability of regional Australia to stand on its own two feet and not to have up to 45 per cent of our doctors foreigners brought in; not to have professionals from outside; and not to have to go away when you need to get a medical service done. Mr Deputy Speaker, you just heard my colleague make comments about thanking people for what they do. I remember when the original Senate inquiry was held; four students from Orange and Cowra gave evidence to that Senate inquiry. They had never done anything like that before, and these were kids who were still at school. I have never seen a school community-teachers, parents and students, including ones who had already left school-combine on an issue like it in my life. I have never had so many calls on an issue from desperate and frightened parents in my life. The need for their children, and for their own community, to get that extra education, university opportunity or whatever is just enormous. I keep coming back to the fact that if you have to leave home then you have to leave home. Quite correctly, outer regional areas have that ability now to have the one-year gap and not to lose their places as the two-year gap does, making it almost impossible for them. I am totally puzzled as to how any bureaucrat or politician could sit there and say, ‘The outer regional people have to leave home but the inner regional people do not'of course they have to leave home. It is a very real and serious matter. It is not as though most of them can leave home and go to the regional universities that are easier cheaper to live in; to do things like medicine there is absolutely impossible. They have to go to the metropolitan areas. I think this is simply an issue of fairness. The cost of children going that distance is just prohibitive. Australia needs the people who probably have the best work ethic of any young people in the whole country. They come from an area where they totally know and expect it-as most do. In country Australia it is just accepted that that is what do. We should give those people the opportunity to have the education to be whatever we and their communities need them to be. I always say when I go to schools, ‘Go away, as you have to finish your education and your training-but come home to practise it.' It is the kids who are born out there who will come home to practise it, but mostly they cannot obtain the qualification that they need, that we need, that the community needs, that regional Australia needs and that the whole of Australia needs them to have. It is an issue about the future of regional Australia. It is an issue of justice. I can only say to the previous Minister for Education, the current Prime Minister, that this is not something that will go away. It is not something that all those people who believe so strongly in it will let die. It is something that is incredibly necessary. Please think about this from the point of view of the people who live out there.",98
159,Ms COLLINS,COMMITMENTS AND OTHER,"Franklin-Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services) (7.53 pm)-During the election campaign this government made a number of significant commitments to better support older pensioners who work, families with teenagers in full-time secondary study and families with new babies. The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill and 2011 delivers on these commitments. The seniors work bonus is expanded by this bill, so an age pensioner or service pensioner of qualifying age will be able to earn $250 per fortnight without any of those earnings affecting their pension entitlements. A pensioner will also be able to bank unused amounts of their work bonus, up to a maximum of $6,500. These banked amounts can be used to offset income that is earned in a later period. These changes will provide adyou ditional support to age pensioners and service pensioners who work, particularly those who undertake part-time or occasional work. This bill also makes changes to the family assistance law to help families with teenagers in secondary study or a vocational education equivalent. From 1 January 2012, the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A for teenagers age 16 to 19 who are in full time secondary study and under the primary care of their family will increase to $214 per fortnight, bringing it into line with the rate for teenagers aged 13 to 16. In addition, these changes will extend rent assistance to families with children aged 16 to 19 who receive more than the base rate of the family tax benefit part A. This additional financial assistance will help families support their teenagers' continued participation in secondary education or a vocational education equivalent. This bill also improves the delivery of the baby bonus, providing for parents of new babies who are eligible for the baby bonus to receive more of their payment up front. In 2011-12, the up-front amount will be $500 in addition to a regular fortnightly instalment. This will assist families with meeting the initial costs of welcoming a new baby into their family. This bill also exempts annuities paid by the Thalidomide Australia Fixed Trust from income tax and from social security and veterans' affairs income tests. These annuities are paid to people who have been affected by the morning sickness drug thalidomide. This bill ensures that these annuities are not taken into account as income in the hands of the beneficiaries. Finally, the bill makes some minor amendments to the income management arrangements. Amongst other things, the start date of a savings period for the matched savings payment scheme is clarified so that people can begin saving as soon as they register for an approved course. This bill delivers on a number of important government election commitments that will benefit families and pensioners. On behalf of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs I want to thank speakers for their contributions to the debate. Disappointingly, for the opposition even these important measures for pensioners and families are not above political games. Instead of supporting this bill and supporting measures to assist Australian families and seniors, the opposition has once again employed its customary cheap ambush tactic and moved amendments that could jeopardise the passage of an important bill. As those opposite will know, the government has brought forward a legislative comprehensive review of student income support with a particular focus on the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. But the opposition continues to wreak havoc, pull down and play games with the Australian people. While they put politics above policy, the Gillard government is getting on with the job of delivering on our election commitments and delivering for Australian families and seniors. Accordingly, the government will oppose the opposition's amendments and commends the bill to the House in its current form.",99

One work, for the Department of Defence, involves the construction of workshops, vehicle bays, hardstands, classrooms, warehouses and a gatehouse at various locations in Queensland and Victoria. The second work is a building fit-out for the Australian Taxation Office in Albury, New South Wales. Let me first turn to the Land 121 project for the Department of Defence. This work will provide the department with new facilities to assist with the rollout of new vehicles for the Australian Defence Force. The facilities will provide for the reception, inspection, refitting, operator training and nance training associated with these new vehicles. The committee sought evidence from Defence about why they had chosen the particular sites in question and how the facilities would fit into the overall defence infrastructure. The committee is satisfied that the scope of works proposed by Defence will meet the needs of the project. The committee was concerned to learn at its hearing that there has been a significant delay in the transfer of a piece of land from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to the Department of Defence necessary for the project to be completed. Due to Immigration's uncertainty, Defence is unable to give a date by which the land transfer will be complete. The committee is not satisfied with this state of affairs. Whilst Defence has assured the committee that this will not delay the commencement of works, the committee is nonetheless uneasy that Defence was only informed of the latest development regarding this transfer on the date of the hearing. Agencies must ensure that they are aware of factors outside of their control, such as the decisions of other agencies, and that these factors do not cause surprise at the last moment. The second work addressed in this report is the fit-out for the Australian Taxation Office in Albury. This is the third fit-out project for the ATO that the committee has considered in the past year. The committee is always interested in ensuring that the Commonwealth gets good value for money. The ATO gave evidence at the hearing that the project will save money over the long term due in part to more efficient building systems. The ATO is a major employer in Albury and the site in Albury is one of the ATO's larger facilities. The committee was pleased to see that the project will create significant local employment during construction as well as ensuring the ATO can remain mainte- a significant employer in Albury. I thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. I commend this report to the House.",101
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I will deal with the division that was called earlier. I took the view that the deferred division should not be proceeded with until the member speaking at 8 pm had completed her speech, and so I did not interrupt the member.

166,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's 74th annual report concerning the committee's activities in the calendar year 2010. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,103
167,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report is a requirement under section 16 of the Committees Act and the committee presents its summary of its proceedings shortly after the end of each year. During 2010, the committee conducted inquiries into nine works with a combined cost of $491.5 million. Appendix A of the report lists all works and their vidual costs. The committee also considered 51 medium works projects, those with a budget of between $2and $15 million and the combined costs of these works was $416.8 million. Appendix B of the report lists these works. The committee held 24 meetings throughout the year in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin and Sydney and these are all listed in appendix C of the report. There are a few matters that I would like to highlight. The committee is rightly proud of the efficiency with which it conducts inquiries. In 2010, the average time from the referral of a work to tabling the report was nine weeks. The committee also introduced a new procedure manual, which increases the detail of the committee's scrutiny of Commonwealth expenditure with new referral requirements for agencies proposing works. These requirements seek information that has not previously been collated by agencies. Agencies have reported that the new requirements help improve their internal preparation as well as providing the committee with more useful detail for its scrutiny role. The committee reiterates the importance of all Commonwealth agencies fulfilling their obligations to the parliament, including the Report requirement to bring medium works to the committee before any contracts are let. The committee continues to work hard to ensure that projects do not fall through the cracks. A number of works were exempted from committee consideration in 2010 and the committee considers this an unacceptable state of affairs. The exemption provisions in the Committees Act are for unforseen and truly urgent circumstances, not for remedying poor planning by agencies. As I noted before, the committee has a speedy process and the committee expects all agencies, no matter how big or small, to be aware of their obligations to the parliament indiunder the Public Works Committee Act. I would like to give special thanks to officers of the Special Claims and Land Policy Branch of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, who assist agencies in preparing their proposals for committee consideration. I also thank members and senators for their work throughout 2010 and, in particular, I thank the members of the committee of the 42nd parliament and my immediate predecessor as chair, Senator the Hon. Jan MCLucas. I would also like to specially mention the deputy chair, Senator the Hon. Judith Troeth, who has been able to offer me very professional and collegiate support in my role coming in as a new chair. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat, including the previous secretary, Sharon Bryant; acting secretary, Alison Clegg; inquiry secretary, Anthony Overs; senior research officer, Thomas Gregory; and administrative officers Shaun Rowe and Claire Young. I commend the report to the House. Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity Committee Report",103
168,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I present the committee's report entitled Examination of the annual report of the Integrity Commissioner 2009-2010, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",104
169,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am very pleased to speak on the tabling of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity's examination of the Integrity Commissioner's annual report 2009-10. As a matter of process, I can say at the outset that the committee has found that the annual report is fully compliant with the Law Enforcement Integrity Act 2006 and regulations as well as with other relevant government requirements. This annual report is the fourth provided by the Integrity Commissioner and covers ACLEI's third full year of operation. The committee's review of the annual report is one of its critical recurrent functions, and as the committee chair I am happy to say that the 2009-10 annual report demonstrates the further evolution of ACLEI, which in a short time has become an important part of Australia's anti-corruption architecture. As part of its review of the annual report, the committee has noted the changes that have been made to ACLEI's reporting framework, in the form of a revised program statement whose first outcome is to provide independent assurance to the Australian government that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and their staff act with integrity by detecting, investigating and preventing corruption. The second outcome is to detect, investigate and prevent corruption in prescribed law enforcement agencies and to assist those agencies to maintain and improve the integrity of their staff. In terms of the substantial work and operations of ACLEI, it is pleasing to see reported that there has been an increased rate of referrals to the commission, indicating that it is becoming established as an effective and trusted recipient of matters which include integrity or corruption concerns. Indeed, as I have noted previously, ACLEI has experienced constant growth in potential corruption issues notified and referred since it commenced operations. It was therefore appropriate that the government announced an additional $1.6 million over four years in the 2010-11 budget. This additional funding has enlarged ACLEI's capacity, and the corresponding expansion of its activity has been supported by a range of operational and resource improvements, namely: new funding for five staff; the near completion of a secure operations facility, which will help to ensure ACLEI's functional independence from other agencies; and a new strategic approach to counter the possible relationship between corrupt law enforcement agency staff members and organised crime. The committee is well aware that significant challenges lie ahead for ACLEI, notwithstanding its strong achievements to date, and particular consideration has been given to the opportunities and adjustments that are likely to flow from the expansion of ACLEI's jurisdiction to cover the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, as of January this year. ACLEI was created to detect, investigate and prevent integrity failures in law enforcement agencies. An important issue noted by the committee during its review of the annual report is the need for ACLEI to move towards its third objective, which is prevention measures, in addition to the work it is already doing in the areas of detection and investigation. Corruption prevention, by building and promoting cultures of integrity, ought to be a key activity of ACLEI in the future, and the committee will be working with the agency to explore how that role can be developed and resourced. On receipt of the annual report, the committee commends the Integrity Commissioner and the staff of ACLEI for their essential contribution to Australia's system of corruption checks and measures. Finally, I take this opportunity to thank all my fellow committee members including, of course, the deputy chair, Senator Ian Macdonald. I also thank the committee secretariat for their continued hard work in supporting us. I am very sorry to note that committee secretary Tim Watling will shortly be moving to another area, so I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his invaluable assistance and to wish him well.

170,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Order that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",105
171,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I am pleased to present the committee's Advisory report on the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011. The bill was referred to the committee by the Selection Committee on 3 March 2011. This bill is the next step in the process of the government's historic agreement with all states and territories to undertake fundamental reform of our health and hospitals system. The bill amends the proposed National Health and Hospitals Network Act 2011 to establish the National Health Performance Authority, which will be the new watchdog for Australia's health system. This new watchdog for Australia's health system, the performance authority, will develop and proantiduce reports on the performance of hospitals and healthcare services, including primary health services, and it will transparently and publicly report on primary healthcare services and the outcomes in local communities. The committee takes very seriously its responsibility in dealing with a matter referred to it by the parliament. In determining the nature of this inquiry, the committee noted the history associated with this matter and, in particular, the two previous Senate inquiries into the proposed National Health and Hospitals Network as well as the separate Senate inquiry into the proposed financing arrangeReport ments to give effect to these changes. So, in executing the present inquiry, the committee was cogent of the previous inquiries conducted into the National Health and Hospitals Bill. The submissions that the committee received were largely supportive of the need to establish a national framework of health service standards, monitoring and reporting, and recognised the performance authority as an integral component of this. Much of the support for establishing a National Health Performance Authority was premised on the belief that the collection of robust and meaningful data is an important mechanism to drive improvement in the quality and efficiency of health services at a national level. The committee is of the view that the bill to establish the performance authority adequately sets out the authority's essential erational and structural parameters. The committee was particularly interested in considering different mechanisms to enhance the performance authority's reporting requirements with a view to improving the overall transparency of the data collected on the performance of healthcare services. With greater transparency comes a greater change of improving public services and empowering the public to make decisions that are based on the best information. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the House pass this bill with a further amendment that the performance authority presents a compilation of its performance monitoring activities to the parliament annually in addition to its publication on the authority's website. The committee, in recommending that the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 be approved, concluded that the parliament, through its publicly elected members, will ultimately have to resolve this ter.",105
172,Mr IRONS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the coalition members of the committee, the member for Hasluck, the member for Parkes and myself, and in my capacity as the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I rise this evening to speak to the dissenting report to the committee's inquiry into the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011. We cannot support the government's sole recommendation from this inquiry that: The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives pass the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 with a minor amendment to clause 60(1)(b) relating to reporting requirements. Throughout the course of the inquiry it beop- came clear that a wide range of stakeholders are concerned about the lack of deal in the legislation, especially with regard to the functions of this proposed authority. In short, we believe that this inquiry has raised more questions than the government has been able to answer and, as such, should not be debated in the House before the government has clarified the areas causing concern to stakeholders. Many of these problems have been acknowledged by the inquiry in its report; yet the government response has failed to address them, saying it is of the view that the bill adequately sets out the authority's operational and structural parameters. We do not accept this as a good enough response to some serious questions raised by the stakeholders. As stated in the dissenting report, there is confusion over several aspects of the functions of the proposed authority. These include (1) the range of health services to be monitored; (2) how the data will be obtained; matand (3) how requests for data will be enforced, given that the powers of the authority will be limited. With stakeholders suggesting that they are struggling with a significant regulatory burden already, any proposed compliance burden is clearly important and needs to be clarified and addressed. In addition, a fourth concern has been raised by stakeholders in relation to what the reporting requirements for the proposed authority would be. We acknowledge that the report recommends an annual report be prepared by the authority and presented to the parliament, but there is no explanation as to what form this report should take. For example, it is unclear whether the authority will use the data collected to produce league tables which will be published on the MyHospitals website. A further area of concern for the stakeholders is the relationship between the proposed authority and two other agencies the government has created or is creating. The first is the recently legislated Australian Commission on Safety and Quality of Health Care and the second is the proposed Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. As documented in the chair's report, the Australian Medical Association in their submission stated: We are also concerned that the legislation not provide for appropriate interaction between the Authority and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) or the proposed Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. It is unclear what the interactions between these organisations will entail and where the responsibilities will lie. Data-sharing arrangements, responsibilities and functions of these government agencies have not been properly justified or explained. It is unclear whether these organisations will overlap. I want to make one more point before tabling this dissenting report on behalf of the coalition members of the committee. In addition to the concerns about the workability and functionality of this proposed authority, it is understood that a number of stakeholders who wanted to contribute to this inquiry were unable to because of the haste with which this inquiry has been conducted. As the inquiry details, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing by the Selection Committee on 3 March. We are reporting today, just 19 days later. The time allocated for submissions was little more than a week. And it is noted that more public hearings were unable to be arranged due to the short reporting time frame. In fact, there was just one public hearing and only people from the Department of Health and Ageing were allowed to attend. None of the private stakeholders concerned with this bill were given the opportunity to attend. Given this, until the stakeholders have had adequate opportunity to raise their concerns and have them properly addressed, it would be unwise for the committee to advise the House of Representatives to pass this legislation. The coalition members of the committee believe there are too many unanswered questions about the National Health Performance Authority, its role and functions and whether it can fulfil its stated aims for the governdoes ment. In conclusion, the House should not debate this bill until the government clarifies this matter.

Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (8.34 pm)-I rise today in support of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. I cannot recall an easier bill to speak in support of. Smoking kills Australians every day. How can members of this place do anything but work as hard as they can to prevent this? We have heard the statistics listed during this debate and they are grim. Approximately three million Australians smoke every day, and smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Not only does smoking kill 15,000 Australians every year; it also costs the economy over $31 billion. Smoking leaves a horrendous trail of destruction through our lives, at a horrible cost to our society and our economy. I believe it is up to us to take action; we cannot afford not to. This bill is another step forward in tackling this issue. This bill will make it an offence to advertise tobacco products on the internet or any other form of electronic media unless compliant with state or territory legislation or Commonwealth regulations. As part of the Gillard government's ambitious health reforms, we are taking strong action through a multifaceted and comprehensive plan to reduce smoking. All governments have committed through COAG to reduce the daily smoking rate among adults to 10 per cent by 2018 and to have the daily smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This year the government offered smokers support to quit by subsidising nicotine patches and the antismoking drug varenicline through the PBS for the first time. We already have a history of coordinated federal and state plans to reduce smoking. Through historic bans on smoking in the workplace and public spaces and removing advertising, we are making it harder for Australians, and particularly for our children, to fall into the trap of taking up smoking. This bill is just the next step in the government's antismoking plan. It includes a 25 per cent excise increase, announced in 2010; a record investment in antismoking social marketing campaigns; and legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products. This government is offering the community the best support it can to help kick the habit. By helping to communicate the dangers of smoking and by offering support through subsidised medication, we are encouraging and supporting Australians to quit for good. This is the responsible thing to do. This is the right thing to do. Why do we need this bill? In 1992, the Keating government introduced the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition act-the TAP Actto comprehensively ban tobacco advertising in this country. Since the passage of the act, however, we have of course seen an explosion in the use of the internet and mobile phones. The application of the act to internet and mobile phone advertising of tobacco products is currently not clear. The use of the internet and mobile phones as advertising media has become increasingly widespread. In using these technologies, our young people are increasingly exposed to tobacco advertising. There is not much point in regulating other forms of advertising while allowing the internet and mobile phones to be a free for all where tobacco can be promoted without regulation. This lack of arbitration also undermines the effectiveness of the rest of the TAP Act. It is an unregulated loophole that we must close. It is important in considering this bill to also consider the ever-increasing number of young people accessing the internet and the number of young people smoking. The Australian Bureau of Statistics report titled Tobacco smoking in Australia: a snapshot, 2004-05 noted: People who start smoking when they are young are more likely to smoke heavily, to become dependent on nicotine and to be at increased risk of smoking-related illness or death. I note the youth trends in the explanatory memorandum of the nationally conducted study, led by the Cancer Council of Victoria's Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, called Smoking behaviours of Australian secondary students in 2005. This study found that in 2005 just over 140,000 Australian school students aged between 12 and 17 were then current smokers. This equates to around seven per cent of 12to 15-year-olds and 17 per cent of 16to 17year-olds. With the use of the internet in the everyday lives of our youth, we need to ensure that we provide the same amount of protection from tobacco advertising through this medium as we provide from tobacco advertising through other media. Research shows us that messages and images promoting the use of tobacco products can normalise tobacco use, increase the uptake of smoking by our young people and act as a general disincentive to quit. There is a good reason that you do not see movie stars promoting smoking as glamorous and cool anymore. Since the introduction of the 1992 TAP Act, most forms of tobacco advertising have been banned. This bill will tighten up the gaps that threaten public health by limiting the broadcasting and publication of messages and images that promote the use of tobacco products via electronic channels. This bill will clarify the grey areas that currently exist in the act by bringing the advertising of tobacco products on the internet and other electronic media into line with restrictions already in place on other media. It is currently not clear if the advertising of tobacco products on the internet is permitted. The intended effect of the draft bill is to clarify the TAP Act by making it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic more media and future technologies unless compliant with state or territory legislation or Commonwealth regulations. It will also enable the making of regulations on internet tobacco advertising prescribing the size, content, format and location of tobacco advertisements as well as the inclusion of health warnings, warnings about age restrictions on the sale of tobacco products, information about any fees, taxes and charges payable in relation to tobacco products and agerestricted access systems for access to tobacco advertisements. It is important to note that this bill brings penalties into line with other forms of advertising and promotion. The penalties for offences contravening tobacco advertising regulations will be set at a maximum of 120 penalty units, which currently equates to $13,200. This bill is a comprehensive plan to regulate tobacco advertising, and I call on the opposition to support The Labor Party does not accept political donations from tobacco companies anymore. The Labor Party made the ethical decision to walk away from tobacco company donations. This is why the big tobacco companies are placing all their bets on the Liberal Party's preventing these changes to laws affecting the promotion of tobacco products; unfortunately, the Liberal Party does not see any difficulty in accepting money from the tobacco industry. We saw during the last election campaign the massive $5 million advertising blitz from big tobacco targeting the Labor Party. Why did tobacco run this campaign? Simple-the bill will contribute to a reduction in the uptake of smoking. That is why Labor seeks to introduce this legislation, and I hope the opposition will support it as well. The Gillard government wants to encourage smokers to choose a healthy and long life over sickness, disease and premature death. Last year the Labor government increased the tobacco excise duty by 25 per cent. This measure alone is expected to reduce the number of Australians smoking by approximately 87,000. Increasing the price of tobacco products is an effective incentive to help smokers quit. From July 2012, when a smoker walks into a store to buy a packet of cigarettes, they will see a range of plain coloured packets with no logos or colours except the confronting and very real health warnings. All these measures make it harder for tobacco companies to sell their products and remind every Australian that each cigarette brings you closer to a premature death. When we consider the cost to our economy, estimated at over $31 billion every year, we are of course motivated not only by consolidating a uniform range of regulatory arrangements but also by the health costs relating to the consumption of tobacco. These costs not only are an incredibly expenit. sive drain on the health sector and taxpayers but also exact a terrible social cost on families afflicted by smoking related disease and what can be very long and painful periods of illness. This government is committed to reducing the debilitating effects of tobacco on Australians. The federal Labor government is committed to preventive health. It was this Labor government that sought to establish a preventive health agency to ensure a nationally coordinated approach to national health strategies and research. It was this Labor government that introduced the alcopops tax to reduce the amount of binge drinking amongst younger people, particularly young females. It is this Labor government that has invested more funds in preventive health over its first term in government than the previous government did in 11 years. In comparison, the opposition has blocked many health reform bills put before both the current parliament and the last parliament, including legislation to tackle preventive health such as the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010 will address a glaring ambiguity in the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. It has the support of all Australian governments. It will not place a financial burden on the Australian government above any current costs of the act and will in fact both reduce contributions from taxpayers to the economy and increase the quality of life of the of Australians through health benefits-and, let us not forget, it will save lives. Smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians, and we owe it to them to take the strongest action we can both to help support smokers make a decision to quit for good and to stop new smokers taking up the habit. I commend this bill to the house.",108
178,Ms ROXON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank the member for Petrie for her contribution. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010 is obviously very important for the government and I know that she has been really interested and involved in a lot of health initiatives, not only the clinic in her electorate but a whole range of others. This is one where we believe that the passage is a pretty important step towards reducing the national smoking rate, reaching our 10 per cent target for the population by 2018 and, hopefully, halving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rate, which, of course, is much higher than that of the general population. Since the passage of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, the use of the internet and other electronic means as advertising mediums has become increasingly widespread, as the member for Petrie noted. Unregulated internet advertising undermines the effectiveness of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. It can weaken tobacco controls by allowing sales to minors, promoting smoking and permitting the purchase of cigarettes without graphic health warnings. These amendments make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media and future technologies unless compliant with state and territory legislation or Commonwealth regulations. They will also enable the making of regulations in relation to internet tobacco advertising to be similar to those placed on over-the-counter sales, and online sales will no longer be different. I welcome the member for Boothby's comment: The coalition are supporting the passage of this legislation because we recognise there is more to be done in the area of preventative health and there is still more to be done in the area of tobacco control. The member for Boothby is correct in stating that there is still more to be done, and I might encourage him to start by looking in his own backyard. It would be a good start to get the Liberal Party to break its own expensive habit with big tobacco. We know that in super2009-10 the Liberal Party accepted over $290,000 from donations from big tobacco. In 2008-09 that figure was $300,000. This is a big chunk of money which is going to the Liberal Party and we are concerned this may have an impact. I am pleased that the Liberal Party have indicated they will support this piece of legislation. So far they have not indicated whether they will support our plainpackaging legislation, which will be introduced later this year. We do not want to be in a position where the allegation can be made that that is a case of opposition for hire. We make the very simple point that many thousands of Australians still die every year as a result of smoking and all of us can do more to make sure this number is reduced. Even members of their own political party find this situation embarrassing. I note that the Premier of Western Australia supports the Labor position of not accepting donations from big tobacco. Our very strong view is that the government must take action in this area. That is what this bill does. We believe the opposition's position on tobacco control lacks legitimacy and is an embarrassment to them. We remain determined and committed to implementing comprehensive strategies to further reduce smoking rates in Australia. This piece of legislation is part of our broader reforms that put Australia at the forefront of international action on tobacco control and builds on our commitment to introduce world-first legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products by 1 July 2012, our 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise from 29 April last year and our record investment of $85 million in anti-tobacco social marketing campaigns, including the national campaign which was launched at the end of January this year, showing that every cigarette you smoke brings you closer to cancer. We have made access to nicotine patches available through the PBS and invested $5 million of extra support into Quitline services. The choice here could not be starker. The choice could not be easier. This is an important additional piece of protection lians, at last bringing the internet and new technologies under the same remit as other forms of media.

181,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to speak to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. I do so in the knowledge that in 2006 the then government introduced amendments to ensure that a loophole that was identified as existing in the rules surrounding provisional voting was closed. We realised that the integrity of the electoral roll was at risk because the system was vulnerable to potential abuse by people who enrolled in marginal electorates, despite not living in them, and voted to influence a close result. Accordingly, we introduced legislation, which was passed, which required anyone wishing to make a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity, either at the time of voting or within seven days of the voting day, to show that the vote would be valid. There are four basic reasons why one would cast a provisional vote. The first is that you are found not to be on the roll, the second is that somebody has already voted in your name, the third is that the electoral officer does not like the look of you, and the fourth is that you are on the confidential or secret roll because you are a person who for personal security reasons does not wish to be on a published roll. On 21 February 2011 the Electoral Commission presented a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That submission contains a section dealing with the integrity of the electoral roll. It says: 3.7.1 Maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll is a key component of the AEC's work. The AEC defines roll integrity as consisting of the following elements: - Entitlement – the person meets all legislative qualifications for enrolment on the electoral roll, information provided by the individual is tested to detect and prevent enrolment fraud; Accuracy – the person is enrolled for the address at which they are entitled; - Completeness – all persons who are entitled to enrolment are enrolled; - Processing Correctness – information provided by persons and organisations is entered correctly and completely on the roll, addresses are correctly and completely described, classified and aligned; and - Security – the electoral roll is protected from unauthorised access and tampering. 3.7.2 As part of standard AEC processing procedures, all enrolment applications are checked to determine if they have been completed in accordance with legislative requirements and that information on the enrolment form is accurate. The number of people casting provisional votes has steadily grown over the years. In 1993, 112,344 provisional votes were taken, and virtually 60 per cent of those were rejected. In 2004, the year before the 2006 amendments were made, 180,878 provisional votes were taken, of which 50 per cent were rejected. In 2007, after the amendments were made to further protect the integrity of the roll, 167,682 provisional votes were taken and 85.56 per cent were rejected. In 2010, 203,488 provisional votes were taken, of which 81.65 per cent were rejected. The interesting things are as follows. In 2007, between 75 and 80 per cent of people who wanted to cast a provisional vote presented with evidence of identity. In 2010, this number rose, and 96 per cent of those people presented evidence of identity. In that year, of the 81 per cent of votes that were rejected, only 28,000 were rejected on the basis of evidence of identity not having been provided. The other reasons that votes are rejected are entirely different than not presenting evidence of identity. The Special Minister of State in his second reading speech said that the reason he wanted to get rid of the evidence of identity requirement was that the 2006 amendments treated provisional votes as different from other classes of declaration votes. They include postal votes, prepoll votes and absent votes as well as provisional votes. That argument does not hold water because the government itself, in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Pre-poll voting and other Measures) Bill 2010, treated prepoll declaration votes differently by saying that they no longer had to be placed in an envelope with a signature and be subject to preliminary scrutiny-they would be put straight into the count. So already the government has said that there is no need to have all classes of declaration votes treated in exactly the same manner. It was sensible to say that prepoll votes should be counted on the night and therefore not be subjected to preliminary scrutiny, as this class of vote previously was. We sometimes did not see that result for an inordinately long time, so this was sensible-just as our 2006 amendments to require people who wanted to make provisional votes to present with evidence of identity were sensible. The efficacy of these provisions resulted in the situation where, in 96 per cent of people who wanted to cast a provisional vote presented with evidence of identity-80 per cent on election day itself and a further 16 per cent in the allowable time after the casting of that vote. The argument put forward by the Special Minister of State indeed does not hold water. It is more likely that there is a perceived vantage for the Labor Party if the integrity the roll is not protected in the way we think it should be. I cite an article written by the member for Melbourne Ports where he asserts that all 166,000 votes that were rejected in the 2010 poll were rejected because they did not have evidence of identity and really all those people would have had a chance to vote Labor, which would have won four more seats. It is not an argument which can be supported. On this side of the House we are very concerned that the integrity of the roll is always protected. We are concerned to see that amendments or changes that are made to voting procedures are done to enhance the integrity of the roll. I am concerned, for instance, with the proposition that has been put forward that for future federal elections we might go the way of, say, the New South Wales Labor government, which have changed the enrolment provisions to encompass automatic enrolment whereby people's details will merely be taken from other agencies such as the Road Transport Authority, school rolls or whatever they decide can be dealt with. Those people in New South Wales being put on the roll for the election next Saturday will simply have been written to twice to say that they have now been put on the roll and if they have not written back and said ‘No, you can't put me on the roll' they are automatically on. How then can you check the validity of someone and their address against their signature when there is no signature because 2010, they have been put on automatically? The problem with going to the provisional voting situation is that we have the requirement, if a vote is in question, under these new provisions going back to the old system that the electoral office checks the most up-to-date signature, which is most likely the application for enrolment. There does seem to be adsupport for the government wanting to go of this route. Should that happen and these amendments are cast then there will simply be no application for enrolment, which the electoral commission holds and against which any signature on the declaration vote can be compared. Again, it opens up the difficulty that is encompassed in trying to protect the integrity of the roll. The submissions being put to the JSCEM are starting to come in. I know that there are submissions saying that the original dissenting report of the opposition to the JSCEM report of 2007 should be upheld. In that report it was said that: According to the Electoral Commission, approximately 75 per cent of provisional voters showed evidence of identity when voting. Of the 33,900 provisional voters who failed to provide such identification on polling day, only one in five subsequently provided proof of identity by the cut-off date-that is, the close of business the following Friday. That was the 2007 report and, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, in 2010 there was a 96 per cent compliance with providing evidence of identity. The rejection of the large number of provisional votes was for reasons other than failing to present evidence of identity. The case being made by the member for Melbourne Ports that this was somehow a rort imposed by the Liberal Party when we had control of the Senate simply is not borne out. In fact, it was introduced with the very best of motives-that is, to protect the integrity of the roll. It remains the position of the opposition that we wish to see the integrity of the roll protected in the very best possible way, and the best way in which that can be done is to maintain a system of having evidence of identity required to be presented by those seeking to make a provisional vote.",113
182,Ms SMYTH,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am very glad to participate in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 because essentially it is a question of the value we place on universal franchise in this country. It is about the value that we place on participation in our democracy of all individuals who are eligible to do so. It is ultimately about confidence in our electoral system. It is about ensuring that we do not seek to make it harder for any individual to participate in our democratic processes, to participate in our elections, and that we do not make it prohibitive or something which ultimately results in individuals being disenfranchised. As we have heard, a person can be asked to cast a provisional vote in circumstances where their name cannot be located readily on the roll, if the roll shows that the person has already voted, if polling officials have doubts about the identity of the voter, or if on the voter is registered as a silent elector and their address does not appear on the roll. The Electoral Act and the referendum act, as they currently stand, require that a person who casts a provisional vote provide evidence of his or her identity by the first Friday following polling day. Under those acts, as they stand, a failure to provide that evidence of identity by that time will mean that the vote of that person does not proceed to preliminary scrutiny and is not counted. This is a curious requirement which was put in place by the Howard government in 2006. It meant that provisional votes would be and have been dealt with in a way which is inconsistent with the way in which other types of declaration votes are handled. Voters who would otherwise be eligible to have an absentee vote, a postal vote or a prepoll vote are treated differently if they instead cast a provisional vote. If a voter who is otherwise eligible to vote does not provide evidence of their identity by the prescribed deadline, his or her vote will not be counted. This bill is about ensuring the franchise of voters and their confidence in the system of administration of voting in Australia. It will remove the requirement imposed by the Howard government for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity before their votes are admitted to preliminary scrutiny. If there is doubt about the entitlement of the voter to vote, the signature of that person on the provisional voting envelope will be compared to the signature of the elector on previously lodged enrolment records. There might be a number of reasons why an elector does not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. There might be certain reasons which relate to their availability lowing an election date or a referendum date. A further possible explanation may be that an elector might ultimately not be determined to provide evidence of their identity after polling day if the result of an election is perceived by then to be known, so it does not necessarily indicate an attempt by electors to fraudulently vote. That is the first point of distinction between the position of the government and the position put by the member for Mackellar earlier. We are concerned with ensuring franchise and doing our best to ensure universality of franchise, while those opposite are largely concerned with procedural technicalities and their perception of some sort of irregularity with voting processes. The AEC has indicated that some 200,000 provisional votes were cast at the 2010 general election. Of these, over 28,000 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day. Further examination by the AEC of those provisional voting envelopes found over 12,000 instances where the name of the voter was ultimately found on the certified list. That is rather an alarming figure in the context of those voters who obviously did not get to cast their vote at first instance. We also that the acceptance rate of provisional voting went from around 50 per cent in the 2004 election to around 14 per cent in the 2007 election. I take a different view from the member for Mackellar on these figures. I consider this to be particularly concerning in the context of disenfranchisement. One wonders why the coalition has maintained its opposition to the amendments proposed by this bill. The amendments give consistency to the treatment of provisional, absentee, postal and prepoll means of voting. They are aimed at better ensuring that all eligible Australian voters are able to cast a folvote and participate fully in our democracy. So why then is this, which is apparently fairly reasonable, opposed by the coalition? Let us look at the likely identity of many provisional voters. Many of these people will be younger Australians moving house between elections-and we know how attractive the coalition has shown itself to be to young people at the ballot box. The people who the Howard government requirement was most likely to disenfranchise were people who rent or move residence regularly, people who do not have a driver's licence and, in particular, young people. So one wonders whether it was in fact the intention of the Howard government in its amendments in 2006 to make it more difficult for those categories of person to cast a vote. Our changes mean that it will not be more difficult to cast a provisional vote than any other type of declaration vote. The Howard government's tinkering with the Electoral Act in 2006 meant that more people casting provisional votes were disenfranchised than ever before, and we have to question who the people were who were more likely to be disenfranchised. The amendments proposed to this bill address the particularly urgent matter of otherwise valid votes being excluded from further scrutiny. The bill will implement the know recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report into the conduct of the 2007 federal election, and we know that this measure was also one of this government's 2007 election commitments. We also know that the amendments proposed in this bill were supported by the AEC, which, in its submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election and related matters, recommended that the requirement for production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. In the context of that support, and bearing in mind the categories of people who are most likely to be and who have been detrimentally affected by the existing regime, I certainly commend the bill to the House and am pleased to be able to lend my voice to support on this significant issue.",115
183,Mr DANBY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"My interest in democracy and democratic practices in Australia long predated my role as a parliamentarian, which I have had since 1998. Unfortunately I am not involved with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters anymore, but no-one has argued longer, harder and in more detail on this issue than I have about these malevolent changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act made by the previous Liberal government in 2006. The 2006 legislation was brought in by the then Liberal government with the worse possible intentions, as the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe, suggested. At the time, the purported reasons for the change were that the legislation was designed to improve the integrity of the electoral roll. However, the actual reason for the 2006 changes was exactly the opposite. Simply put, the real intent of the 2006 changes that this legislation will partially invalidate was that they were expected to assist the Liberal Party in the 2007 and subsequent elections. The particular change that this legislation will repeal is the onerous requirement whereby one group of declaration votersthose casting a provisional vote-must provide some form of identification for their vote to count, usually photo identification. Provisional votes are sought when a voter arrives at a polling booth on election day and gives their name to the official but finds that they are not on the roll. The AEC provisionally issues a vote, the voter fills it out and is put in an envelope with their name and address on it. Under Liberal government changes brought in in 2006, the voter must provide valid ID, like a drivers licence, on the spot or present to an AEC office with a valid ID within a week. Later in the week the Australian Electoral Commission checks the voter's details and agrees that they should, indeed, be on the roll. Their ballot paper is then counted if their vote is considered valid under this existing system. Previously, what was the system under which the Liberal Party won the 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections? It was the quite logical system of matching signatures. If an Australian voter turned up at a polling booth and signed the outside of his envelope to say that he was that person, then the highly responsible officials of the Electoral Commission took this back to the AEC, matched it with the voter's existing signature and they were then included on the roll. The ethos of the Australian Electoral Commission and Australian democracy ought to be to include as many valid votes as possible-not to find excuses to exclude them because they belong to inconvenient categories of people who might vote for a different political party. Of course, this whole issue of provisional voting and the so-called integrity of the roll is completely the wrong issue. The real issue for Australian democracy ought to be the fact that there are 2.5 million Australians who did not cast a vote at the last election. That is the scandal of the electoral system at the moment, not the fact that the so-called integrity of the roll is invalid in any way. At the 2007 election 27,544 citizens voted provisionally but had their votes rejected because of the new requirements. Similarly, at the extremely closely fought election of 2010, 28,011 citizens voted but were later disqualified because of the Liberal changes. Further, the AEC has noted that the admission rate for it Senate provisional votes fell from 62.23 per cent in 2004 to 25 per cent in 2007, concluding that if the 2004 admission rate had prevailed in 2007 an additional 62,000 Australians would have been counted in the Senate voting. Sixty-two thousand of our fellow citizens were excluded from voting by these bodgie changes, which we promised to get rid of at both elections. I am very proud to associated with this legislation, to reenfranchise my fellow Australians. Why do people not present photo ID when they vote, you might ask. Mostly, because they do not have a drivers licence. ‘Okay,' you might ask, ‘but provisional voters still have the opportunity to provide the AEC with their ID within a week after the election. Why don't they do that?' Just think of how people think-ordinary Australian citizens who are not as involved in politics as we are in this House, on both sides. The election result is already decided. Who would take time off from work, go and find an AEC office and fill out a form to cast a vote that no-one would pay any attention to? People are busy working, and how many know where their Australian Electoral Commission office is? I bet you the Deputy Speaker's Electoral Commission office is miles and miles from many of his voters. My inner city electorate is forced to share an office with the electorate of Melbourne, and it takes you an hour to drive around Casselden Place to find an existing parking space. This is another attempt to make things difficult for people that should be made easier. In some regional electorates the AEC and the post office are many hours away, as I said. Not only do they have to prove their identity with a drivers licence or other prescribed document, there are other requirements for ID, including proving the validity of their signatures. Basically, it is a lot of paperwork people are not willing to bother with after an election. These Liberal changes to the provisional voting method resulted in many voters being disqualified who were admitted in the past. You might say that votes being disqualified would reflect the wider voting pattern across the nation, so that in the big scheme of things the disqualification of 30,000 votes or so really would not affect the overall result. be This is not so. The types of people who make provisional votes fit into a particular demographic type, very capably outlined by the member for La Trobe in her speech. Of course, this is why the legislation was introduced, against all of the advice from the Australian Electoral Commission and the psephological experts, including Professor Colin Hughes and Malcolm Mackerras-a person who the Liberal Party often quotes as a great electoral expert. All of these people testified and argued against this; it was quite clear that this was being done for political purposes. The average number of provisional votes in the 10 most Indigenous seats in this country is 1.76 per cent of the total vote, and the national average is 1.23; in other words, it is half a per cent higher in areas with large Indigenous populations. Without a licence, provisional voters need to provide a passport or a birth certificate in order to vote. No-one expects to have to present their birth certificate when they vote. For most Australians there is no need to prove ID at a polling booth at all. It will not surprise anyone with passing knowledge of Australian politics if I point out that the particular demographics described vote largely for Labor, Greens or left-of-centre parties. I argue that this is the reason that the previous government made these terrible changes to provisional voting. In my view, if the number of provisional votes in the 2004 election were compared to that the number in the 2007 election, enough Labor voters were disenfranchised to allow the coalition to win at least four seatsBowman, Dickson, MCEwen and Swanthat otherwise would have been won by the previous Labor government in 2007. It did not affect the election result, fortunately, cause Labor won by a sufficiently large margin for those four seats not to be germane to the result. But that was not the plan of the people who put this nefarious legislation into practice. Professor Brian Costar of Swinburne University of Technology, one of Australia's most respected political scientists, told the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters: I think a case can be made that it changed the result … We know that provisional voters, because of their choice, are not a mirror image the electorate as a whole. They tend to be more Labor and Green than they are Liberal, National, or anything else. I expect that the rejection of the 28,000 voters in the 2010 election may have affected the results in a number of electorates as well. In light of the result of the 2010 election, every Australian now knows that the fate of one electorate can decide the fate of a government. So, if the 2007 result of changing the result because of these provisional voting changes had been effected at the 2010 election, these malevolent, nefarious, bodgie changes which are now being invalidated by this legislation would have won the Liberal National Party office on these antidemocratic manoeuvrings. Australia, despite being a young country, is in fact an old and strong democracy, especially when we look at it in a global context. Even before Federation Australia was known for its progressive electoral policies, including, as the member for Mackellar knows, giving women the right to vote before many other countries-in fact, leading the world in that-and introducing the secret ballot, which for many years was known throughout the world as the Australian ballot because it was not done in other countries. However, the Liberals' 2006 changes to the provisional voting procedures are an example of regresbesive rather than progressive electoral policy. This bill will restore the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to its pre-2006 statutes with the law, custom and practice established over almost a century. I would have thought that was the conservative practice with which the member for Mackellar would identify instead of regressive changes designed to affect the result at two elections. The voter's signature provided on the declaration envelope in which the provisional votes are contained would be compared with the signature of the elector which exists in its of original or subsequent enrolment forms which were held by the AEC. It was good enough for the Liberal Party in 1996. It was good enough for the Liberal Party in 1998. It was good enough for the Liberal Party in 2001. It was good enoughMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",117
184,Mr DANBY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Are you arguing, Member for Mackellar, that all of those elections were somehow fraudulent? Are you saying that they were not won on a proper basis? We, of course, conceded the fact that they were won by your side of politics. And the system of comparing signatures, which we had had for nearly a century, was the system at the time. Come on. We know why these changes were made in 2006. It is blindingly obvious to everyone now. Perhaps the most powerful endorsement of this legislation comes from the key institution responsible for safeguarding the integrity of our elections: the Australian Electoral Commission. In its submissions to the inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 and 2010 federal elections, the AEC-the neutral body responsible for our electoral legislationcommented that the requirement of evidence of identity for provisional voters should be repealed. A knife-edge federal election and the strong support of Australia's key election body-I cannot think of any better reasons for repealing this unjust and politically vated legislation brought in by the Liberals in 2006. There are many things that this government is doing in the areas of early closure of the rolls in this area of provisional voting. They are completely the wrong issues. They are the issues that were focused on by the conservatives in order to divert from the fact that in a compulsory voting system we have 2.5 million Australians who for a variety of reasons did not participate in the last Australian election. This is a pattern that has been obvious for a long period of time. The Australian Electoral Commission, working neutrally, will do as much as it can if it is given the powers by this parliament to enrol as many people as possible. Surely this is the ethos that should inform all democrats in this parliament. As many Australians should be empowered to vote as possible, and getting people off the roll is exactly the wrong attitude. Disenfranchising Australians is the wrong attitude, and this is what we are addressing with this legislation. I am very proud to be associated with this bill.",119
185,Mr FLETCHER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Bradfield) (9.27 pm)When you go into a bank to transact, you produce an identification document. When you check in for a flight, you produce an identification document. In so many other situations in modern life, you are asked-and you do so without complaint-to produce an identification document. When you go into a bar or a club, at least until vanced age which characterises most of us in this place, you are frequently asked for an identification document and you produce it. When you go into a video store, you are often required to produce an identification document. None of these requirements are considered to be unduly onerous. None of these are considered to be unreasonable. None of these are considered to be some kind of outrageous imposition on the civil moti- liberties on the persons from whom those identification documents are requested. Instead they are understood to be part of the normal, sensible, efficient operation of a modern society. Yet for some reason the Labor Party is remarkably squeamish about the requirement that, in certain circumstances, if you wish to cast a provisional vote you are required, under the law as it presently stands until such time as the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 is passed, to produce documents to verify your identity. I wish to make three brief points. We must take every necessary step to protect the integrity of our voting system in this country. That is the first point I wish to make. The second point is that the costs of requiring identification from those seeking to cast a provisional vote are modest. The benefits of the system are significant. Third, it is with some regret that I must also add that there are good reasons to doubt Labor's motives for proposing the changes inherent in the bill before the parliament this evening. Let me turn first to the proposition that we must take all reasonable steps to protect the integrity of our electoral system. All of us in this place are united by our prideDebate interrupted.

187,Mr FRYDENBERG,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak about the turmoil enveloping the greater area of North Africa and the Middle East and the fears I hold for the future of peace and stability in the region. It was former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who once said, ‘Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem.' It is an adage which could equally apply to the coalition's current bombing campaign over Libya. In accordance with UN resolution 1973, there was never any doubt that the numerical and technical superiority of the British, French and American military would quickly establish an effective no-fly zone, but with the resolution authorising member states to ‘take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas' but ruling out ‘a foreign occupation force of any form' the question remains: what happens next? What happens when Colonel Gaddafi, a tyrannical leader with more than 40 years experience in the dark arts of maintaining his brutal leadership, seeks to carry out his threats to cleanse of his enemies, house by house? The lessons of the no-fly zones over Bosnia and Iraq are instructive. The UN Security Council established a no-fly zone in October 1992 but it was not enough to stop the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995 and it was only when the mission significantly expanded, with NATO ground forces in Bosnia, that civilians were fully protected. The zone over Iraq, in place for 12 years from 1991 to 2003, did help protect the Kurds in the north but only because Saddam knew he would face heavy retribution if he sent his troops to attack the Kurds. The message is clear: should Gaddafi be allowed to remain in Libya his people will never be safe. Bellicose and brutal, his threats should be believed. His record as a terrorist and his wanton and indiscriminate attacks on civilians have few parallels. History would suggest a no-fly zone in itself may not be enough. With military action underway, America, its allies-the British and the French-and, importantly, the Arab League cannot afford to let a stalemate develop. To do so will not only abandon the Libyan people but undermine the credibility of those in the international community calling for action. What will the next dictator think when he is pushed into a corner-that, if he momentarily pulls back, he will be able to remain in office? Such an outcome would create a dangerous precedent that in time would embolden others. Minister for Foreign Affairs, your advocacy for a no-fly zone has been loud enough for all to hear, particularly by the Prime Minister, but please tell us what the next stage is of your very public campaign. Why have you dodged the question about regime change? Do you agree with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, who said Gaddafi's survival is certainly potentially one outcome? Or was British Defence Libya Secretary, Liam Fox, closer to the mark when he said the Libyan leader is a legitimate target? The Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot have it both ways. He cannot ring every foreign leader who will listen to modestly offer his expert advice but not provide a straight answer on the key question of whether the international community will accept an outno-fly come that sees Colonel Gaddafi stay in place. The truth is that, while Colonel Gaddafi remains in control, the civilians will not be safe. Indeed, it is this danger of mission creep that those on the Security Council who abstained from the vote-China, Russia, Germany, India and Brazil-all feared. Fragile support from the Arab League is also at stake. This is no fly-in, fly-out mission. Gaddafi has made it clear he is up for the fight. It is this reality that our foreign minister must now confront. He was bold enough to advocate for international military action on behalf of others; now it is time he told us how it ends.

188,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I rise to speak about the Liberal Party's backflip on using market mechanisms to deal with dangerous climate change. We have heard in parliament today quotes from the honours thesis of the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt-a work titled ‘A Tax to Make the Polluter Pay'. We have heard in the media from the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, who articulately argued that the most cost-effective way of reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions is through a market based mechanism. The Liberal Party in their 2007 election policy document informed us: Climate change means we must undergo a fundamental transformation to a low-carbon economic future. A re-elected coalition government will establish an emissions trading system, the most comprehensive in the world, to enable the market to determine the most efficient means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. These views were expressed by Liberal Party parliamentarians as recently as 16 months ago. Senator Alan Eggleston on 30 November 2009 said: One way of avoiding the volatility of an emissions trading scheme would be to have a carbon tax. A carbon tax provides a very steady and known price for carbon, if you like, which is only varied by varying the tax. That level that allows renewable energy systems to be competitive. Senator Sue Boyce said on 30 November 2009: My own background is as a manufacturer. In that sphere, I know the benefits of early adoption. I would just like to point out to the Senate that it was the Shergold task force, commissioned by the Howard government, who said, long before we got to this place, that Australia should not wait until a genuinely global agreement has been negotiated, because there are benefits which outweigh the costs in early adoption by Australia of an appropriate emissions constraint. Senator Judith Troeth said on 30 November 2009: By having a price on carbon, people can decide whether they really want to use these carbonintensive products. It is an effort to move people away from carbon towards other alternatives, and the most effective and efficient way to do this is through a price signal. The member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, claimed credit for the last market based mechanism, saying on 29 October 2009: It was actually the coalition that instigated work on the emissions trading scheme. In fact, I have in my hand a report that I helped author back in 1998 which talks about regulatory arrangements for trading in greenhouse gas emissions-1998! The member for Mayo, Jamie Briggs, said on 3 June 2009: I believe an emissions trading scheme is one of the policy levers that can be used to change the energy mix in Australia. An ETS will be, by definition, a price on carbon. The member for Cook, Scott Morrison, said on 3 June 2009: There are a suite of tools we need to embrace to reduce emissions. I believe an emissions trading scheme is one of those tools in one form or another. Placing a price on carbon, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, is inevitable. The member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, said tax can be set at a on 3 June 2009: I would like to make it clear: the coalition will support an emissions trading scheme … We know the Liberal Party used to stand up for the market. Former Prime Minister John Howard told Tony Jones on 5 February 2007: That doesn't sound very much to me like a market mechanism, when you compel somebody to apply a particular technology. It is far better, if you want to keep faith with the market approach, to develop a carbon pricing or carbon trading system … The member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 April 2010 as saying: There has been a distortion … There's an argument that over time we haven't paid a proper price for water. We haven't paid a proper price fossil fuels. We haven't paid a proper price for land, etc. You would hope you can remove the distortions. Climate change is real and it is happening not only in the environment but also in the Liberal Party room. A party that once had a proud tradition of supporting markets has now fallen victim of the populism of direct action. As the temperature goes up on the Leader of the Opposition, let us see whether the Liberal Party can again find its faith in markets. Wright Electorate: Queensland Floods",122
189,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to update the House and the nation on the progress of the Lockyer Valley and how my community is dealing with the aftereffects of one of Queensland's most horrific natural disasters. It will take many months and potentially years for families to recover from the lifechanging floods that inundated the Lockyer Valley on 10 January this year. We still have families, displaced from their homes, who are staying with relatives and friends, and that is starting to become a tough gig for them. We have many families who are waiting for insurance companies that are procrastinating on claims and we have insurance companies which have rejected claims and are squarely in the crosshairs of my fury and will feel the full wrath of my fury as time rolls on. Insurance companies that reject claims are in the forefront of my mind, constantly. Believe me, you have not got off lightly and I have not begun on you yet. I anticipate supporting evidence, in the coming weeks, to support my people with their insurance claims. With reference to our priorities in the region at the moment, we want to try to get the locals back into their normal routines. That for means getting our little service station up and running, getting our little corner store up and running and, most importantly, getting our little pub up and running. The pub is a place where community groups and members would have their meetings of an evening and where the men would come in from the paddocks and have a beer and share their stories of the day's activities. The winter crops throughout the district are all planted, which brings comfort to our landscape. The paddocks have been sown with cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and a variety of lettuces. On ANZAC Day we will start to plant onions and, of course, beetroot, which is a staple product throughout the area. The landscape is still scarred from the torrent of water that went through the area. However, it gives me great comfort to report that the wonderful acts of kindness and the overwhelming donations of gifts, household goods and cash are making a difference. Cash donations are many; however, there is considerable unrest in the community about the delays in the funds reaching the ground, where they are most needed, particularly those funds from the Premier's flood appeal. We are seeing a trend away from funds being donated to the Premier's flood appeal and a stronger concentration of funds being directed to two local funds. Those two funds are the Lockyer Valley Flood Relief fund and the Grantham Community Flood Fund. Whilst I am truly humbled by the generosity of Australians and the business sector, I would like to recognise a number of organisations which have shown considerable generosity and given not necessarily the biggest donations but donations that come with a story. The Heritage Building Society has given half a million dollars. The Reader's Digest, an international organisation, has given $10,000-they do not get a lot of return out of it but it was a great effort. The story which touches me is the Alpha Isolated Children's Parents Association. They have an annual fundraiser up in Alpha where 28 cricket teams come for one day of the year. That is their major fundraiser and they donated all the proceeds of that day, their gest fundraiser for the year, to the appeal. would like to acknowledge the donation that Tony Abbott made the other day at a fundraiser in Sydney-he auctioned his bike from the Pollie Pedal fundraiser and those funds were well received. There is also the ACT Wine Industry Network, which we will be making an announcement about tomorrow. To all of you and to all Australians who have donated, thank you, thank you, thank you on behalf of my people. However, we still have a long way to go. We have a lot of rebuilding to do and there is a short time to get there. I encourage any community groups conducting fundraisers who wish to assist with the clean-up to contact my office, so we can assist you with advice that will get funds to the people on the ground quicker and to those people on the ground who need them the most. On a lighter note, the spirits of the comgreat munity were lifted over the weekend by the anticipated visit of a very special visitor, a visitor who gave us short notice, which we overcame as a community, a visitor who was known to everyone in the district and who needed no introduction. Yes, you guessed it-all the way from overseas and having just landed in Australia the day before, it was none other than Kevin Rudd. I mentioned in my condolence speech the bipartisan support that the region experienced and I would like to thank Kevin for his compassion and the way he interacted with the local people. Braddon Electorate",123
190,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to discuss a potpourri of projects and events in my electorate of Braddon on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and there is none better than the Building the Education Revolution projects in my region. I would remind you, Mr Speaker, and colleagues that my region has benefited from investment of some $100 milbiglion through the Building the Education I Revolution for some 63 schools and 95 projects. These projects include new facilities which are available to the community and they have, importantly, enabled us to sustain employment during very, very difficult economic times. Indeed, times are tight and relatively difficult in my region today. We have experienced the closure of a number of paper mills, a carpet factory and a vegetable processing factory. But we had great news the other day when National Foods-and I am sorry if it has affected other parts of Australia-chose Burnie, in my region, for a major upgrade of something like $120 million. Apart from the skills and the fantastic supply of milk in my region, there is the iconic name that our region has for cheeses. They are also the owners of King Island cheese and an upgrade of $12 million is being provided as well. That is news for my region, particularly during these difficult times. More specifically in relation to the BER, last Friday I was honoured to join the VicarGeneral for Tasmania, Father Mark Freeman, at St Brendan-Shaw College, a Catholic college, for the opening of the science centre. I was able to reflect on the importance of science in our community and was able to share that with the students at St Brendan-Shaw College, who were also the beneficiaries of a trade training centre. I congratulate the Catholic system; they always seem to have projects on the shelf and they have greatly benefited from the BER and are very happy to say so throughout the whole country. I was also at Marist College recentlyagain towards Burnie-which is another Catholic college. They opened a language and learning centre. It is a fantastic centre dedicated to the name of St Peter Chanel. That college has also been a successful beneficiary of a trades training centre, which are going to benefit from very soon. I was also at the Cooee Primary SchoolCooee is a great name, along with Penguin, further along the coast. The Cooee Primary School has a new multipurpose hall. They are a fantastic little school with quality cation and quality people. Further up the coast at Wynyard, at Table Cape-which you might remember, Mr Speaker, when you have passed through there on a number of occasions-the Table Cape Primary School also got a fantastic new multipurpose hall and new classrooms as well. It has been an amalgamation of primary schools. There have been some fantastic results from the BER, and there are so many more BER projects that I am looking forward to openingand I know everyone in this parliament is pleased to see these projects in their electorlate ates, although some pretend otherwise. I have been referred to as many things, but sometimes I am referred to as the ‘lad from Brad'-just as the former member for Bass used to be the ‘lass from Bass'. There is an organisation in my electorate called BRAD, which stands for the Business Regional Analysis Database. It is an initiative by the Braddon Enterprise Centre, who have partnered with the Institute for Regional Development of the University of Tasmania. Essentially, they have set themselves up as a major database collector for small businesses and medium-size businesses for the region. Like many rural and regional areas, they know so little about each other in order to get together to be able to plan for the future. I congratulate that fantastic organisation from BRAD. Gippsland Electorate: Wild Dogs and Foxes",124
191,Mr CHESTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to highlight an issue of critical concern to farmers in my electorate, that being the they horrific social, economic and environmental costs of wild dogs and foxes. I recently attended a Victorian Farmers Federation function in Omeo, where local residents provided first-hand accounts of the damage being caused to stock. Their graphic accounts of edudogs emerging from areas of public land to prey on young lambs were disturbing. It was obvious that the stress of encountering the slaughter of stock was playing on the minds of our community. With lambs fetching in excess of $200 per head, the economic toll is also considerable. A recent report into the cost of wild dog attacks put the economic impact at $18 million per year in Victoria alone, but with the increased lamb prices there is no doubt the true cost will be much higher in subsequent years. It is also virtually impossible to calcuthe opportunity cost for landholders who have stopped stocking their properties with sheep and lambs because of the impact of the wild dogs. The tone of the VFF meeting in Omeo was one of barely concealed anger and frustration. This has been a long-running issue. Consider this report in the Bairnsdale Advertiser under the heading, ‘We've had a gutful'. VFF Omeo branch president and local farmer Simon Turner talked about the failure of the previous Labor government in Victoria. He said: There has been no action on wild dogs for the past 10 years and the dog population is exploding, and when the department does look as though it is taking action it is basically only to settle dia and the political situation. He goes on to say: … these dogs are eating people's livelihoods, and as the farms further out throw in the towel and give up because of dogs, the weeds take over and the dogs follow stock closer into communities. We have seen packs of 10 at one time. We need authorities to take a focus, use it alldog-proof fencing, baiting, trapping, shooting and more than anything else, get into educating new trappers. There are also these comments from Swifts Creek grazier and shearer Scott MCColl: If you have dogs killing sheep, the best way to be sure of getting rid of them is to trap them. It is labouor intensive, but if it is done properly it is really effective. He goes on to say: I have run out 4½ kilometres of electric fencing to try to stop the dogs. All these added costs and losing sheep is cutting our income in half. My community has had enough of the abject failure by the former state Labor government and wants action to reduce the impact of wild dog and fox predation on their stock. To its credit, the new coalition government has committed to the reintroduction of a fox and wild dog bounty, to encourage licensed shooters to help control this vermin. There is also a willingness to undertake aerial baiting, but I believe the biggest improvement is going to come through improved practices on the ground involving the Department of Primary Industry wild dog controllers and local residents. It will take a partnership approach and a willingness from the new state government to allow more flexible working arrangements and to allocate more resources to professional trapping and shooting. I agree with Simon Turner: we need to use all the tools at our disposal. As I have said the mebefore in this place, we need to adopt a national approach and get serious about reducing the impact of these feral species across state borders. I know from experience that the member for Eden-Monaro, across the border, well understands the impact of the predation of wild dogs on stock in his electorate. There is no question that the dogs do not respect state borders, and it is important that we have a national approach to controlling the enormous impact that these animals are having on both domestic stock and our native wildlife. In addition to the economic impact on our farming communities, wild dogs and foxes are feasting on native wildlife. It continues to disappoint me that the city based Greens and the Labor Party talk a lot about the environment but they really have been missing in action when the practical work has to be done to protect our native species. As part of integrated pest animal management, commercial harvesting can be part of the solution-and putting a price on the head of wild dogs and foxes is a form of commercial harvesting. So I congratulate the Victorian state government in that regard. I would urge the federal government to take a close look at the Victorian experience and make a financial contribution to a similar bounty in support of other states that may introduce a scheme as part of a more national approach to controlling these pest species. Farmers and the natural environment would benefit from a national commitment to practical and direct action-not more reports and empty promises. As I have said in this House previously, these economic costs can be measured-$18 million per year to Victoria-but the environmental impacts of wild dogs and foxes feasting on our small native species are very difficult to measure. But there is no question that they are having a dramatic impact on the native fauna. The big issue for us, I believe, is the cost to the human capital in communities like East Gippsland. The social impacts are the ones that concern me most in terms of East Gippsland and the north-east of Victoria. I am concerned about the impact on mental health and the stress that this is placing on our families. Our landholders have to go out to their paddocks in the morning and do not know what is going to confront them. That is a very real issue and one we all need to be concerned about in this place. It is really yond the capacity of our farmers to deal with this kind of stress on an almost daily basis when wild dogs are about. (Time expired) Automotive Industry",125
192,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about the future of the Tonsley Park site in my home state of South Australia following the decision by Mitsubishi Motors to cease operations there in 2008. The decision by Mitsubishi to close the engine plant at Lonsdale in 2004 and cease operations at its Tonsley Park site in 2008 was certainly disappointing for the people who worked there and many people in my electorate of Kingston. Following the decision, local workers affected by this decision benefited from an $80 million support package jointly funded by the Commonwealth and state governments. I am very pleased to say that the majority of Tonsley workers have now been retrained or have found new jobs. It is critical now to look at the long-term future of this site. Both the Southern Economic Development Plan and the labour studies commissioned by the University of Adelaide have identified the lack of available light industrial land as one of the most significant barriers to growth in sectors such as manufacturing in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. So it was fantastic to see the South Australian Labor government purchase this land at the Tonsley site in 2009 with the aim to redevelop it into a mixed-use sustainable technologies precinct. I commend the South Australian government for its commitment of $125 million for the construction of a sustainable industries education centre to be built on this site in collaboration with TAFE SA, the three universities and industry. This centre is expected to provide training to more than 8,000 students in trades such as building construction and plumbing, with a strong befocus on sustainable and clean technologies and renewable energy. We know that a price on carbon will transform our economy and drive new jobs in the clean energy and clean technology sector. As new global markets emerge pursuing ways of living and working which have a minimal effect on the environment and reduced carbon emissions, sustainable manufacturing will become the way of the future. So it is vital that we support sustainable manufacturers to successfully establish themselves in southern Adelaide. It will be good for industry and good for local jobs. The 61 hectares of light industrial land at this site presents us with a unique and valuable opportunity to create more jobs and expand the regional economy in southern Adelaide by encouraging a vibrant hub of sustainable manufacturing alongside the sustainable education centre. The close proximity between the education hub and the manufacturing hub will promote enormous synergy between the manufacturing sector and the highly skilled workforce being trained in the education centre. I believe that we all need to work together to support the development of a high-tech, clean and green manufacturing hub at the Tonsley Park site in southern Adelaide. The Tonsley Park site presents us with immense opportunities. We know that this is the direction that the world is going. Despite the opposition often not wanting to recognise this, the world is transforming to cleaner, greener energy sources. There is a lot of demand around the world for technologies that reduce our demand on carbon. Despite the opposition never acknowledging this and thinking that things just go along as they are, this is the way that our economy will transform into the future. It is very important that we have a skilled workforce ready to be part of this future and that we have manufacturers creating jobs in our local area of southern Adelaide. As we move forward, it will be critical to ensure that we all work together to make the hub at Tonsley Park a green, clean energy hub that will manufacture sustainable technologies and skill-up our workforce. Clean and sustainable manufacturing is going to be the way of the future. It is important that we recognise this and that we are part of it. The Tonsley site presents us with the perfect opportunity to support the advanced manufacturing sector to establish a presence in southern Adelaide so that we are at the forefront of sustainable manufacturing in a future where the use of clean technologies will be essential. With this land, now owned by the state government, there are real opportunities to not only establish a world-class training facility in clean technologies but also support the development of a hub of sustainable advanced manufacturing. A clean, green manufacturing hub at Tonsley Park will create new local jobs, bolster our regional economy and mean that we are able to expand into new markets. This is a huge opportunity and I look forward to working with all levels of government to make this a reality. (Time expired) Intercountry Adoption Forde Electorate: Waterford West State School",127
193,Mr VAN MANEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Forde) (10.00 pm)Before discussing the achievements of one of the Forde electorate's public schools, I wish to draw the attention of the House to an important issue. Australia currently recognises the importance of intercountry adoption to family creation and is a party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. However, there are countries not on the list of countries that our nation can adopt from. One such location is the small African country of Burundi. With an estimated population of almost 8.7 million, Burundi is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world. The children living in this country are privy to a poor legal system, an eight out of 10 chance of living below the poverty line and a lack of access to education. And they are at risk from the proliferation of HIV-AIDS. Nearly 57 per cent of children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition. The issue of intercountry adoption with Burundi was brought to my attention by constituents Carolyn Bird and her husband Ray Spiteri, a couple in my electorate who spent over five years attempting to adopt their now six-year-old son from Burundi. After fighting the Queensland and federal governments, they are now the only Australian couple to successfully adopt a child from Burundibecause there is no agreement between the countries. Ms Bird has handed me a petition with 438 signatures of people who call on the Attorney-General to initiate an intercountry adoption program with Burundi to allow Australian parents to adopt Burundian orphans. According to UNICEF, there are over 500,000 of these orphans. I present this petition. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives This petition of the Australian adoption community Draws to the attention of the House: The need for the Attorney-General to initiate intercountry adoption program with Burundi to allow Australian parents to adopt Burundian orphans. According to UNICEF, there are around 500,000 orphans in Burundi, while the National Council for the Fight Against AIDS recently cluded that there are more than 830,000 Burundese orphans living in extreme conditions. Burundi is a signatory to the Hague convention the protection of children and has been since 1993. Burundi orphans have been successfully adopted in Italy, France, the USA, Canada and Australia. We therefore ask the House to: Implement an adoption program with Burundi. from 438 citizens Petition received.",128
194,Mr VAN MANEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Along with determined and inspiring residents, the Forde electorate is fortunate to be home to many brilliant and innovative public and private schools. One of our primary schools, Waterford West State School, my old school, has come up with the clever idea of teaching pupils business skills. Year 5 teacher Cassandra Bruce decided to teach her students about business skills early in life, by instructing them to create, market and sell their own line of smoothie drinks. Mrs Bruce wanted to create a project that tied real-life experience with the students' English, maths and science studies. For the project, the students had to investigate the best way to create healthy yet tasty and cost-effective smoothies. Mrs Bruce is very proud of her students and has said that they have worked so much harder this term as it is a real-live project. This project has also introduced some friendly competition between two groups to see who can sell the most products and has provided the students with an insight into the realities of business and the importance of an effective marketing campaign. The students also learned the importance of giving to the community by donating a percentage of the an profits to the Queensland flood relief appeal. The year 7 students of teacher Mrs Stokes are learning to make cheese. These students hope their cheese will taste good enough to conenter the Brisbane exhibition show competition later this year. They are learning measurement, chemical reactions of different infor gredients, where raw products come from and how to be self-sufficient. They are developing confidence in their own abilities. It is truly inspiring to see children become so excited about business and health. As a small-business owner previously, I find it exceptional that schools would teach their students at such a young age the importance of understanding business skills. I would like to commend the principal, staff, teachers and students of Waterford West State School on their willingness to teach and learn important life skills in a fun and inviting way. La Trobe Electorate: Autism Spectrum Disorder Secondary School Action Group",129
195,Ms SMYTH,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (10.04 pm)Last Friday I had an opportunity to meet two very determined and dedicated women: Louise Anderson and Cathy Hammond. Each of them has a profoundly autistic son. They met several years ago after Cathy wrote a letter to the local newspaper seeking some assistance and emphasising the need for more appropriate schools for autistic children and young adults in eastern Melbourne. In 2008, they formed an action group to campaign to have an autism-specific secondary school in the outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The ASD Secondary School Action Group is an impressive group. Caring for one or more profoundly autistic children together with meeting work and other family commitments means that it is often a tremendous effort for parents of autistic children to take on the additional work of campaigning for a better education for their dren, but they certainly do it. Many people locally have got behind them and continue to support them as they continue in their campaign. Since 2008 they have lobbied and campaigned for an autism school in eastern Melbourne. Following a process of review, the Brumby Labor government committed to the construction of an autism specific primary to year 12 school on the site of the old Ferntree Gully High School on Dorset Road in my electorate. Planning and design was funded and commenced in June 2009. Stage 1 funding of $8 million was provided in the May 2010 budget. Stage 2 funding was committed and was included in Labor's costings. It was after this that local state Liberal MPs confirmed that they would match Labor's promise, and this seeming commitment was confirmed very readily in local newspapers. Ms Anderson and Ms Hammond have presented me with a folder of materials which chronicle in great detail the entirety their campaign. It includes an impressive collection of statements of support, letters and countless newspaper articles from those who are now holding the purse strings in the Victorian government. It makes very interesting and very telling reading. I gather that the materials which the action group have provided to me are merely a snapshot of their campaign and that there is much more documentation besides this which supports their case and which would reasonably have led them to expect that this was an initiative which had bipartisan support. The commitment is now very much in doubt following the election of the Baillieu government. Ms Anderson and Ms Hammond have been advised by the Victorian government that the stage 2 build will be part of an ongoing budgetary process. They now have no meaningful time line for the chilestablishment of a full, primary to year 12 autism school. It is particularly hard for Ms Anderson, whose son, Dean, is now reaching an age where he will require secondary education, and his future education is in limbo. The stage 2 building was to have seen the school's first year 7 enrolments for the 2012 school year, but it appears that now this will not proceed. Several weeks ago in this place, I called on the Baillieu government to honour the commitment made by Victorian Labor to the establishment of the school. Since then, I understand, the Victorian government has informed Ms Hammond and Ms Anderson that this stage 2 build will be subject to ongoing budgetary processes. Local Liberal MPs who had vocally supported the campaign said that they were committed to the project but could not confirm the extra money needed to complete it. Here is the thing: this government commits to education-it commits funding and it commits in of policy terms-and the Victorian Labor government committed similarly. But now we see the time honoured tradition of the Liberal Party tearing funding away when they snatch government. This is yet another example of ‘whateverit-takes' politics. You tell people that you are going to fund their project before the election, fail to include it in your costings-as has been reported in local newspapers-and then fudge responsibility when you get elected. It is the Liberals' standard operating procedure. I certainly saw an attempted campaign in my own electorate to do the same, where the Liberals conveniently put up funding commitments which were not included in their subsequent costings at five minutes to midnight before the end of the campaign. It is another example of the many and varied backflips of the Baillieu government in education, in health, in policing-the list goes on-since its very recent election to office. Mr Tudge interjecting Mr Ruddock interjecting",129
196,Ms SMYTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I gather from the interjections of the members opposite, including those of a local federal MP, that there is of interest in this issue. I suspect that they will make their own inquiries, and I really hope that they do. I simply ask those opposite to use whatever means are available to them to encourage the Victorian government to honour its commitment to the completion of stage 2 of the Eastern Autism School within the time frame in which was due for completion under Labor's proposals. Let us hear less about alpine grazing and more about what your real commitments are to education. I expect there will be more to say on this issue as the campaign continues. I will be supporting the campaign, as will other members on this side. (Time expired) Indigenous Education",131
197,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT,"How can we get education up to scratch in the schools which have the most disadvantaged students and where the teachers have a lessthan-average amount of experience? This is the challenge for many schools, especially those in remote Indigenous communities. Noel Pearson and his colleagues in the Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy have produced the most convincing analysis of this problem, and perhaps they are also coming up with the best solution. In broad terms, Cape York's analysis and policies are in alignment with the government's official Closing the Gap strategy, but in their details the education policies are unique in Australia and deserve close attention by this parliament. If they continue with their success, Cape York's policies should be replicated elsewhere. Their policies are in two parts. First, there are broad community reforms with the objective of ensuring that children turn up to school and are school ready. Measures such as alcohol management, conditional income management and student education trusts have been introduced to meet this end. Second, there are school reforms. I focus my comments this a bit evening on the latter-on school reformsbut acknowledge that both community reform and school reform are necessary to achieve progress in this area. To achieve uniform and comprehensive school reform, the Cape York Academy struck a unique agreement with the Queensland government. Under this agreement, the academy takes responsibility for policy leadership, for selection of the school principal and for the choice of the teaching method. Meanwhile, the Queensland education department continues to provide the teachers and the school facilities. There is a large group of Indigenous students who are so far behind that you cannot find students comparable to them in other developed countries. There are community schools where previous testing appears to have understated the problem and the entire cohort of students is clustered around the kindergarten to year 1 level. The academy therefore set out to identify and implement an instruction method that has been proven to be able to bring severely underperforming students to mainstream levels and beyond. They chose direct instruction, a method developed by Siegfried Engelmann, founder of the National Institute for Direct Instruction in the United States. Direct instruction is based on decades of scientific research into children's learning. The instruction is non-categorical. All disadvantaged students benefit from the same instruction no matter whether their initial difficulty is social, cultural, linguistic or an individual learning disability. Regular and frequent testcollected, ing is integral to the method. Students are grouped and taught at their current level, which is determined through weekly testing, and are only moved to a higher level when they master the content at their current level. Students from four or more different nominal year levels can be taught together if necessary. For the disadvantaged students to catch up, all details of direct instruction teaching are controlled ‘to minimise the chance of students misinterpreting the information being taught and to maximise the reinforcing effect of instruction'. Direct instruction sons are therefore highly scripted. Some elements of direct instruction lessonswhere students answer in uniform in response to a prompt from the teacher-would appear unfamiliar to some people, who would mistake it for rote memorisation. But the controlled nature of the instruction makes the outcome relatively independent of the teacher's aptitude. Almost any teacher, or indeed non-teacher, who is trained by the specialists to deliver the programs will achieve good results. This is particularly important in remote communities, where it is very difficult to attract and retain highquality, experienced teachers. In remote communities we need instruction that is constantly externally monitored, as the direct instruction programs are, and work well even with inexperienced, relatively transient teachers. Direct instruction programs have been running for a year in two communities in Cape York, and a third started this year at the community's request. So what are the results? One year into the program, there are signs of considerable improvement. Many students in years 4 to 7 who could not read or count a little more than a year ago have already reached year 2 or year 3 levels. These results are incredibly promising and, with the wealth of data being we will in this parliamentary term be able to categorically say whether this represents the breakthrough in Indigenous education that it promises. If it is indeed this kind of breakthrough, then the government should support in this term of parliament the rollout of direct instruction along with community reforms in other parts of Australia where there is entrenched educational disadvantage, be it in remote Indigenous communities or in mainstream communities.

198,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Banks) (10.14 pm)lesLast Saturday, 19 March 2011, I attended the opening of the Morris Iemma Indoor Sports Centre at Riverwood in my electorate. It will come as no surprise that the centre has been named after the former New South Wales Premier, who opened it officially on Saturday. The $9 million centre is located in Mr Iemma's former electorate of Lakemba. It was jointly funded by the New South Wales government and Canterbury City Council. The sports centre is an ultramodern resource with two indoor sports courts catering for a variety of sports including indoor soccer, basketball, netball and volleyball. This wonderful facility houses a cafe, internet facilities, physiotherapy and childcare services, and change rooms. There is also a modern gym with cardio, functional and strength training zones with fitness rooms, an indoor spin-cycling room and outdoor training zones. The centre will be operated on behalf of Canterbury council by the YMCA and will deliver programs focused on improving the health and fitness of all age groups. This new centre is located in Belmore Road opposite the Riverwood Community Centre. I have previously spoken in this place of the work done at that centre under the guidance of Pauline Gallagher. The community centre hosts many programs arising from the needs of the local community. These include family support, youth services, a neighbourhood aid program, a community care program, housing and community service programs, a Links to Learning program, employment assistance and skills development, a child sexual assault service and a tenants resource centre. The two centres will complement each other in the Riverwood community. Riverwood is a community that has done it hard over the years, but the community has a huge collective heart and fantastic spirit. I am thrilled that the new sports centre has now been opened to offer more to the community members. It will provide residents with a place to get fit and healthy and enable them to participate in another respect of community life in a safe environment. The fact that the sports centre has been named after the former New South Wales Premier speaks volumes about the esteem in which Morris is held by the community. He still lives in the community, in a nearby suburb-indeed, he grew up there. Pauline Gallagher was interviewed by Stateline on 29 July 2005 on Morris's promotion to Premier, and her very astute summing up of the reason for his popularity was: He listens. He listens to what people say. That's why everyone likes him. Many of Morris's friends from the local community were at the opening. His parents were present, as was his wife, Santina, and his children. It was a wonderful community celebration for a great bloke. My congratulations to Canterbury City Council, the YMCA and the people who made this happen. Most of all, my congratulations to Morris Iemma. He is very worthy of this honour. In politics you make very few true friends. I am very proud to call Morris Iemma a friend. I was elected to the federal seat of Banks on 24 March 1990. On Thursday, it is 21 years to the day since I was elected. Morris was elected to the local state seat at the state election of 1991. Until his resignation as Premier a couple of years ago, he basically represented a large part of my federal electorate. We got on well. He had a genuine commitment to the local community. It was a disadvantaged community with a high nonEnglish-speaking background, but he provided services for them and he continues to walk amongst them. He gets great pleasure in shopping at Roselands with his family. I thought the best part of his speech on Saturday was when he pointed out that he was born nearby the centre and intended to stay there. He is proud of what he is; the community is proud of him. It was a great honour and a worthy honour to have this centre named after him. Berowra Electorate: Multiculturalism",132
199,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Berowra) (10.20 pm)I commend the member for Banks on his very gracious speech about his colleague and, in the spirit of the occasion, I will add no further remarks. I take this opportunity to remind the House that, on 23 February 2009, I spoke about the nature of our multicultural society and commended particularly the Australian Chinese Charity Foundation on its work in raising over $343,000, given to the Australian Red Cross, to help those who had suffered as a result of the Victorian bushfires. As I reflected on that occasion, this, I thought, was an admirable demonstration of the commitment that people, regardless of their country of origin, having settled in Australia, would make. More recently, I had the opportunity to attend another function. This time, it was in the electorate of Mitchell but organised by a constituent of mine. The constituent, Mr Abbas Aly, is a significant businessman in the Norwest Business Park, running a firm called Triforce. He was the inspiration for holding this function, which, along with Hornsby Shire Council, which became the recipient of the funds, served to ensure that the victims of floods in Queensland would benefit. This function was supported by the community of the Imam Hasan Centre at Annangrove, who, having previously supported the Pakistan flood appeal, thought they should do more for those in our own community. One hundred per cent of the funds, over $52,000, went to the Queensland flood appeal via the Hornsby Mayor's Flood Appeal, which was a very significant occasion. The Imam Hasan Centre in Annangrove, a suburb in my electorate, was established only fairly recently, on 16 October 2004, coinciding with the first night of Ramadan. Even though it had a fairly rocky initial path, the comments I have received suggest that it has settled well into our community. It participates in the broader community and holds regular interfaith meetings with other religious organisations. The centre was named after the first grandson of the Holy Prophet, the Prophet Muhammad. Imam Hasan was an advocate for peace, and it is said that an example of his character can be seen in his saying: The most preferable adornment is graceful manners and height of intelligence is associating with people amicably. The community in my electorate represents the religious diversity of Australia, something of which one can be very proud. In our community there are people of many different religions, cultures and races, who come together and support each other in a very positive way. I commend Abbas Aly and the community of the Imam Hasan mosque for their support for the people of Queensland in the horrific floods that they experienced. I am sure that, as many more people see examples of this sort of commitment to our broader community, it will make it much easier for us to be a harmonious society. In the context of Harmony Day, which we celebrated this week, I am pleased to have been able to bring these matters to the attention of the House. Newcastle Electorate: Economy",133
200,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I rise to update the House on the path to prosperity followed by my electorate of Newcastle and the lessons to be drawn from that. The recent reinvention of Newcastle's image from industrial heartland to international tourist icon should be well known. For many years, the Steel City of Newcastle was synonymous with industry, pollution and coal. But, in recent years, this image has been turned on its head. Newcastle is now just as proudly known for its lifestyle, surf and creativity. This was most recently celebrated when Lonely Planet nominated Newcastle as one of the top nine destinations to visit in the world in 2011. There is another, parallel, story for which all Novocastrians should feel justly proud, and that is the economic transformation of Newcastle over the last 15 years-from a heavy industrial, one-company town to a leading centre for innovation, productivity and prosperity. This shift was recently chronicled by the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. The foundation's director of research, Andrew Searles, noted that in the 1970s Newcastle's economy was dominated by large-scale manufacturing industries employing generally low-skilled workers, but the reforms of the Hawke-Keating government in the eighties and nineties had a profound impact on the region. The most immediate impact was on jobs. The early days of these reforms caused some pain for the region. At the height of the recession in the mid-1990s, unemployment in the region peaked at just under 17 per cent, with around 41,200 people out of work. These were hard times indeed for Newcastle. But the Hawke-Keating agenda of investment in productivity, infrastructure and skills proved to be of long-lasting benefit to our city. Amidst the economic gloom of those times, the seeds of renewal were sown, with new investment in high-technology areas such as medicine, education and engineering. In the decade to follow, this translated into more diverse, higher skilled jobs for Newcastle workers. According to the foundation, in the mid-1990s the proportion of people in the region employed in the knowledge based sector was roughly equal to the number employed in the goods-producing sector. But, by the end of 2010, knowledge based employment had increased, and the number employed in that sector was around 66 per cent higher than in the goods-producing sector. This path to prosperity, as I said, was not always smooth. As in the rest of the world, the 2008 GFC threatened to derail confidence in our economic future. With vivid memories of the entrenched unemployment of the 1990s, a return to recession would have been devastating for the working people of Newcastle. Fortunately, the decisive action of the federal Labor government averted this threat and saved countless workers from the despair of unemployment. As the foundation has noted, Labor's rapidly deployed stimulus program mitigated the impact of the GFC and helped lay the groundwork for a quick recovery. Consequently, Newcastle is now blessed with envious rates of economic growth and near full employment. To paraphrase the foundation again, in the last decade around 88,000 new jobs were created in the Hunter region and the number of people out of work fell by 11,000. Last Wednesday, I visited the latest example of Newcastle's economic boom, the site of the new WesTrac facility in Tomago. Once complete, this facility will serve as WesTrac's New South Wales-ACT operational headquarters and will cater for approximately 400 staff and apprentices. The project is another sign of confidence in Newcastle's future. I congratulate WesTrac and its supporting consortium for their tireless work in bringing this project to fruition. The lessons from Newcastle's experience are clear. They are the importance of federal leadership in driving economic reform and delivering prosperity to ordinary Australians, of investing in skills and research to improve productivity and encourage innovation and of continued reform to unlock infrastructure bottlenecks and promote diversification. Fortunately, federal Labor continues to lead the way in advancing national prosperity. The National Ports Strategy, the National Land Freight Strategy and the aviation white paper will help to frame the infrastructure upon which Newcastle's future prosperity depends. Minister Albanese's high-speed rail feasibility study is taking us one step closer to a high-speed rail network for the east coast. The ARTC's coal chain upgrade and the $1.5 billion invested in the Hunter Expressway will make a tangible difference to vital transport links. The NBN's system of fibre to every door will encourage the continued diversification of Newcastle's economy. Importantly, our commitment to place a price on carbon will encourage Newcastle's smart transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. A vocal minority in my electorate would argue that Labor seats like Newcastle would receive a better deal if they were to become marginal or Independent seats. That is just not true. Since the election of the federal Labor government in 2007, over $1.656 billion has been spent in my electorate. For me it is clear that only federal Labor governments, past and present, have demonstrated the capacity to deliver the national economic agenda upon which our prosperity in Newcastle will always depend.",134
