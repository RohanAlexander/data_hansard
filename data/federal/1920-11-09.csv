1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. PRIVILEGE. SPEECH BY MR . MAHON .",19
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I desire to bring under your notice, Mr Speaker, a matter of very great importance, arising out of a speech delivered by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) on Sunday last. According to the Argus of 8th November, the honourable member is reported to have saidTlie outrage committed upon Archbishop Mannix in England would never be forgotten by the Irish people of Australia. Never in Kussia under the worse ruler of the Czars had there been such an infamous murder as that of the late Alderman MCSwincy. They were told in the papers that Alderman MCSwiney's poor widow sobbed over his coffin. If there was a just God in heaven that sob would reach round the world, and one day would shake the foundations of this bloody and accursed Empire. The other day he was approached by a vinegar-faced "" wowser "" who said that the police in Ireland were being shot in the back. If they were shot in the back it must be because they were running away. But thore were no police in Ireland. They were spies, informers, and bloody cut-throats. (Applause.) He read with delight that some of those murdering thugs had been sent to their account, and he trusted that Ireland would not be profaned by their carcasses. Their souls were probably in hell, and their bodies should be sent to England. He would not have the sweet pastures of Ireland poisoned by their carrion clay. Other speakers included Messrs. Tudor, Parker Moloney, P. Brennan, Considine, and Cunningham, members of this House;  torian Legislative Assembly; and Messrs. J . F . Hannan, J. J . Collins, J. J . Clancy, and Peter Larkin. The following motion was agreed to by the meeting:That this meeting expresses and extends its profound sympathy to the relatives of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, who was brutally done to death by the Lloyd George Government, and assures them that his prolonged martyrdom, which has kindled the indignation of the whole civilized world, will assuredly hasten recognition by the nations of the Irish Eepublic, to which' Alderman MCSwiney devoted his noble life. That this meeting earnestly invites the attention of free Australia to the complete destruction of civic liberty in Ireland by the action of the English Government; it denies the right of England to impose her will on the Irish people in view of the fact that Ireland, by an overwhelming majority,, approved of the establishment of an Irish Republic; and it condemns thu saturnalia of murder, arson, plunder, and destruction indulged in by the foreign army of occupation, with the clear connivance and approval of the English Government. That this mass meeting of Australian citizens, in view of the policy of oppression and tyranny pursued by the English Government in Ireland, and which has brought eternal disgrace upon the whole British Empire, of which Australia forms a part, pledges its support to any movement for the establishment of an Australian republic. In view of the statement alleged to have been made by the honourable member, and the terms of the motion-bot h incompatible with the oath of allegiance taken by the members of this Parliament, and entirely opposed to the sentiments of the great majority of the people of Australia - I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether I may ask the honourable member whether the report that I have just read is substantially correct ?",19
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The question being really "" one of privilege, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is entitled to make any statement that he may desire in replying to it .",19
4,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"F o r nearly twenty years, with a slight interregnum, I have been a member of this Parliament. I claim that, during this long period, I have not been wanting in sobriety of speech or conduct. I do not now remember that I have ever been called to order during that time. I am certain that you, Mr .Speaker, * wbo have been a member of the House nearly as long as I , have never,, during your occupancy of the Chair, found me acting in disobedience to the rules or in showing disrespect to your office. In anything I may now say, let me assure you that I in tend no disrespect to you, and none to the Parliament created by the people of Australia. I have never, during my career here, called attention to anything said outside the House about me, about the principles I espouse, or about men whose reputations I reverence. Now, only last week most vile statements were made by men sitting on the opposite side of the Chamber about the religion which I profess, statements published at length in the newspapers, but none called attention to the outrage so wantonlv offered to the feelings of the ' Catholics of Australia. Oue man who sits opposite said that when a church, meaning the Catholic Church, became a political institution it should be broken up. The Catholic Church's record needs no championship from me. Bigger men than he have attempted to break up that church, but ib will stand and flourish when he and his like are in the limbo of ignominious oblivion. Por anything I say inside the Chamber I am responsible to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the House. There is the law of the country to call me to account for anything that I may say outside this House. Therefore, if any man gets up here to catechise me about language that I have used, or am reported to have used., outside this House, I say to him, politely, but firmly and decisively, that he can go to the devil.",19
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Then we are to take it that the report is correct?,20

Five lionovable members having risen in, their places, Questiou. proposed. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [3.10] - The announcement appeared in the press on the 2nd instant that it is proposed to supersede the present Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction by a Committee of five persons. The names of two Federal officers are mentioned as members of the Committee. I wish to show (1) that the Committee will be composed of antagonistic and unworkable elements, and (2) that the proposal is a gross breach of faith with the Director of Design and Construction of the Federal Capital.",20
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member will not be able to show that.,20
9,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"In 1913 the right honourable member for Parramatta- (Sir Joseph Cook) invited Mr Griffin to come to this country for consultation shortly after his plans had won the international competition for the laying-out of the Federal Capital. While Mr Griffin was here the Government, of which the right honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Joseph Cook) and the present Minister that for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) by were members, appointed him upon a definite and binding agreement as Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction-in October, 1913. Upon that appointment, and upon the - terms of that contract, Mr Griffin went to America and closed up as lucrative. and growing practice in - Chicago, and then returned to this 195, country for the purpose of carrying out 207. his agreement, and building. the Capital, . directing its design and construction in accordance with the plans with which he s had gained the first .prize in the inter1920, No. 185. national competition. The agreement under which Mr. Griffin was appointed gave him full executive authority as - Director of Design and 'Construction, subject only to the adWhen the three years' term of the deoriginal agreement expired, there was a Labour Government in office, and in pre1916 Mr King .O'Malley, who was Minister for Home Affairs at the time, reof newed Mr GrifBn's appointment on the antagself-same terms and conditions. In October, 1919, the Hughes Government extended this ajppointment under the same terms and conditions, so that the terms and conditions of the agreement under which Mr Griffin was originally appointed have been ratified by the two great political parties represented in this House. Mr Griffin possesses pre-eminent attainments. I have been associated with the agitation for the selection of the Federal Capital site and the-building of the Capital for many years, and have taken a very close interest- I was going to say in its progress, but I should, perhaps, say, in its want of progress. Mr. Griffin is a Bachelor of Science of the College of Engineering of the University of Illinois, in the United States of America, and he has taken his degree in architecture', and also University courses in architectural and sanitary engineering. Mr Blacket, who was appointed a Royal Commissioner to inquire into certain charges which had been made against Mr Griffin in connection with his office by departmental officials, reported in May, 1917, that from October, 1913, to June, 1916, Mr Griffin was prevented from carrying out the duties of his office. I shall refer to this again later. The Government then suspended works at the Federal Capital on account of the financial position arising out of the war. Thus for seven yearn Mr . Griffin has had no chance to carry out the work for which he was appointed. In November, 1913, it was decided by Mr Kelly, who was then Minister for Home Affairs, that there should be an international competition for designs for the Parliament House at Canberra; but that competition has, for one excuse or another, been held up until the present day. We were told that the leading architects of the world were at the war. For any old excuse the international competition for designs for the Federal liament House at Canberra has been held up. This is our general experience in connection with all Capital matters. Some of the officers whom it is proposed to place upon the proposed Committee have shown throughout gross antagonism to the present Director of Design, and Construction of the Federal Capital. As I shall show, it would be impossible to expect progress from a Board or Committee composed of these unwork-' able and antagonistic elements. The departmental officials to whom I refer have been responsible for the most colossal blunders that have been committed in the building of public works, in this country. I refer to (1) the water system, (2) sewerage, (3) electric light and power, (4) brick works, (5) the railways, (6) accountancy. All these matters were reported on by the Blacket Royal Commission. The errors complained of were commenced prior to Mr Griffin's arrival on his return from America after his appointment, and have been carried out in spite of his repeated protests. The water system'. The Federal Capital site at Canberra was offered in 1908 by the New South Wales Government, because of the plentifu l supply of water by gravitation, and because of the enormous possibilities of providing cheap water power. Canberra is looked upon as one of the finest sites in Australia for the development of cheap water power. These matters have been reported upon by the leading experts of New South Wales. The Federal officers, instead of adopting a gravitation scheme for supplying water to the Capital, substituted .a pumping scheme which necessitated the pumping of water to a height of 800 feet. Mr Oliver, Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board of ""Victoria, and recognised as a leading man in his profession in Australia, reported that the first cost and the subsequent service of water by gravitation would be cheaper than the pumping scheme that has been adopted by the departmental officers. Sewerage. The departmental officers proposed to proceed with a main trunk sewer to empty 25 feet below the Molonglo River bottom, and to pump the sewage on to a sewage far m . Mr Oliver, when called in to report, estimated the cost of this trunk system of sewerage at Par- £250,000, and after £40,000 had been spent upon i the reported that the proposal for a sewage far m was absolutely impossible. Mr Oliver himself devised a scheme of sewerage for the Federal Capital site to cut out entirely the proposed expenditure of £250,000 for maiu trunk lines of sewerage. Electric light and power. The location of this industrial undertaking is in such a position as to necessitate the construction of a special line of railway and destroy one of the main views of the city. It took into consideration the supply of light, but not the supply of power, and Mr . Blacket shows, in his report, that the building cost twice as much as it should have cost. The plant is already obsolete. Reciprocal engines have been installed, whereas the authorities today state that the building should be fitted with turbine engines. Brickworks. These were set in the residential area, the immediate effect being to depreciate the land values in that area, but the departmental officers also partially cut down a hill which afforded, protection from the prevailing winds. No proper test was made to discover, whether shale existed in sufficient quantities to warrant the building of brickworks, and subsequently, when a test was made, it was found that there were only 13 feet depth of shale at that spot. The first plant had to be scrapped owing to its unsuitability. and the ultimate cost of the brickworks was £40,000. It was estimated by the manager of the Northcote Brickworks, Melbourne, when he gave evidence before Mr Blacket, that a modern plant' of double the capacity of the brickworks at Canberra could be erected in Melbourne at a cost of £10,000. He could not give the figures for Canberra, because he would have been obliged to make an investigation, on the spot. As the brickworks at Canberra were erected 3 miles from the railway line it necessitated 3 miles of haulage of coal from the railway to the works and 3 miles of haulage of bricks from the works to the railway. It has since been discovered that there is an inexhaustible supply of shale near the existing railway in the industrial area. Housing. The departmental officers constructed temporary buildings which cost as much as permanent buildings. The administrative offices, according to Mr . Blacket's report, cost £15,000, whereas they should not have cost more than about £2,000. Railways. When Mr Griffin came buck from America he found that the officers had a permanent railway completed from Queanbeyan to the city boundary, a distance of 4^ and that it was located in the river bed which in his plan, which had won the international competition, was to be in the centre of a series of lakes. A flood some time after completion of the railway washed out half-a-mile of the railway works Mr J. H. Catts. the bed of the river, at an estimated diunage, according to Mr Bell, the Commissioner of Commonwealth Railways, of £8,000. This information was suppliedto me by the Minister, hence I accept it. as accurate. The cost of building this 4^ miles of railway was £50,000, aud it has now been shown that it could have been built as proposed in Mr Griffin's plan on high ground for the same amount of money. Accountancy. It was shown by Mr . Blacket's report that no proper system of accountancy had been followed, and that, although colossal losses had already been incurred, it was impossible to tell the aggregate cost to the Commonwealth of these enormous blunders perpetrated by the departmental officers. In addition to the matters reported upon by Mr Blacket a number of bridges have been built with in the Capital area, and not one of them has stood against floods, with the exception of one very heavy concrete structure, and even in that case the railway line which crosses the river upon it was washed off it . This is the finding of Mr Blacket, as shown on page 45, paragraph 170, of his, report(«) That necessary information and assistance were withheld from Mr Griffm, 1 and his powers were usurped by certain officials; (&) That he and his office were ignored',, his rights and duties under his contract denied, and false charges of deftult made against him: (e) That Hon. W. O. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and substitute the Board's own design. Mr Blacket further reported that there was in the Department a combination of certain officers, hostile to Mr Griffin and his design for the Capital city. Por years the manner in which the departmental officers persisted in carrying out a plan of their own which had never been submitted to competition has caused nearly the greatest amount of friction, prevented the work at Canberra from being miles, proceeded with, and has entailed enormous losses to the Commonwealth. If the works which have been constructed on the initiation of these officers are part ornamental of. their plan, it is quite clear that the the Federal Capital built on their plan would be one of the greatest hotch-potches in the in world. It has been said that if the building the A r k had been left to committees whole living world would have been drowned. It is now proposed to substitute side, for a capable Director, who has devehicular signed the city plan which has won against the competition of the world, a committee consisting in part of omcers who have not nearly his competence, have been shown to be filled with such antagonism towards him that it would be absolutely impossible for him to work with them. On page 18 of the report of Mr Blacket on the issues relating to M Griffin, it will be seen that the present proposal to appoint a' Committee is the very same as that which the Department proposed in 1914, when it was definitely stated that the intention was to deprive Mr Griffin of the powers conferred upon him by his contract. I shall refer sently to what a succeeding Minister found of the attitude of these officers to M Griffin. I was not present when the honourable to look at the member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) ferred recently to what is known as laide-avenue, Canberra. The honourable buildings member scathingly denounced part of of the leading avenues which have been laid out in the area. Some time ago visited Canberra in company with T Mr. Griffin, and had the works already ried out explained to me, and the why and wherefore in re?ard to everything; and I am sure that had the honourable member taken the trouble to ask for an explanation he would not have spoken as he did. Adelaide-avenue is part of a syssay tem of eleven radiating avenues, particular spot to which criticism has been directed is the Capitol circuit base the Capitol Hill . Por about half-a-mile this avenue is an embankment, and it proposed to establish public gardens either side; in fact, the whole of this area has been ready for planting for some siderable time past, and I have no doubt that if Mr Griffin had been allowed to proceed with the development of his demost sign, this particular spot with its emas bankments and gardens on either eide would now be one of the spectacular feaK tures of the city. The point at which road is cut through the hill to afford western communication with the Capital information comes? is the lowest gap affording an entrance to any part of the south of the city. The avenue is 200 feet wide, and it is proposed of to have a natural park righ t down the the centre, something on the lines of the parks to ' be seen on St. Kilda-road, with tramway lines running on either and on the outer edges provision for traffic. The experience of the world has shown that the separation of tramway and vehicular traffic in that way insures the most economical maintenance and of the tram permanent way, and also minimizes the dust nuisance in a great city. The same kind of road is to be seen in Melbourne near the Treasury Buildings, cn the southern side, with the garr . dens at the sides. No doubt, the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) passes this particular spot often; yet it has probably not occurred to him that he has been criticising in the case of Canberra what is a perfectly acceptable piece of engineering at the very door of the preCommonwealth Parliamentary Buildings. If we needed another exhibition of r . the incompetence displayed in connection with the public works at the Federal Capital, honourable members have merely Duntroon College, rewhich consists of a number of temAdeporary structures- a conglomeration of which cost thousands of one pounds annually in paint alone for maintenance purposes. It is stated that I there is no plan in existence relating to the water pipes and sewerage pipes carwhich have been laid down within that area. One may dig a hole and suddenly come upon a water pipe without ever suspecting that it is there.",20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is only fair to that the buildings at the College were and the erected in a hurry.,23
11,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,There is no excuse for for the absence of a plan showing the water supply and sewerage pipes which is have been laid down in connection with a on building of that character.,23
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Where does the honorconable member get all this information ?,23
13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,From Mr Griffin.,23
14,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No , sir. I got of it from Mr Blacket's report, and the result of my visits to the area from time to time. My old friend, the Hon. in g O'Malley, is also an encyclopaedia the of information on Capital matters. But what does it matter from where the The question is, "" Is it true?"" It has been stated that it is necessary to put all . our public works under the Works Department: Why has that plan not been followed in connection with our railways? Why are not naval works placed under the control of the Works and Railways Department? Mr Gsoou - Nava l works - are under the control of the Department of Works and Railways. The change was effected more than three years ago.",23
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It should be said that the Naval Board is very much against the alteration.,24
16,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I did not know that the naval works had been transferred to the control of the Department of Works and Railways.,24
17,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"They are under the same man still, namely, Mr J. R. Settle.",24
18,Mr GROOM,Unknown,He is the Director of Naval Works under the Minister for ther Works and Railways.,24
19,Mr J,Unknown,"H . CATTS- Mr Griffin Director of Capital Design and Construcwas tion under the Ministei for Works and Railways; and why, therefore, should he be jammed under the control of rector-General of Works ? Why not leave him in the same position as that occupied officials by the Director of Naval Works ?",24
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is he in a similar position ?,24
21,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Mr Griffin has an agreement which recognises his position.,24
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I would not push that agreement too far. Mr Griffin was never intended to be the constructor the Federal Capital.,24
23,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I know what tell his agreement says. It is what the Minister meant, but what the contract says. Surely he did not blindly accept a contract drawn up' by officials. Before Mr Griffin was asked to give up a lucrative and growing pracdecline. tice in Chicago, he should have been formed by the present Treasurer of what was the exact position.  very well here.",24
24,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"He has not done well out of the Government. It gross breach of faith to ask him to give up alucrative practice in America, and then to treat his agreement as a mere whole world. ""scrap of paper.""",24
25,Mr FENTON,Unknown,He can go baek to America.,24
26,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,All of us may go back; but that is no excuse for what has been done.,24
27,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We have had a bit too' much of the Yankee in this country.,24
28,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is a very contemptible reference to make to this man.,24
29,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member may please himself. I know a good deal more about Mr Griffin than he does, and I have found out what an expensive individual he is.",24
30,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"My honourable friend made an attack upon Mr Griffin when he first set foot in Australia in 1913, and has been "" up against"" him ever since. It is a blind prejudice. As bearing upon the question of whei t is possible for this Committee to do any effective work, here is the eviis dence tendered by Mr Archibald, who then Minister for Home and Territories, to the Royal Commission which the D i - investigated this matter. So far as I was concerned, the permanent of the Department were unwilling to co-operate with Mr Griffin. Yet the Government now propose to put Mr Griffin into a watertight compartment with the permanent officials, who have absolutely refused to co-operate with him in the carrying out of this great work. In reality, the proposal of the Goof vernment is a notice to him to quit. Ministers ought to have the courage to Mr Griffin to go about his business not instead of adopting this underhand method of inviting him to accept a subordinate position as the fifth wheel of the coach, when they know perfectly well that he has no course open to him but to I have no authority for making in this statement, because I do not know what are Mr Griffin's views of this Committee; but I cannot conceive of a man of his qualifications being satisfied to become the fifth wheel of a coach upon a Committee which will brand his work as a failure, and when he will have no is a opportunity of vindicating himself and his professional attainments, not merely in the' eyes of Australia, but before the",24
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaTreasurer) [3.39] - I think that I ought to say one or two words upon this question. I do not believe that a debate of this kind can help the Federal Capital question in any way whate7er. If anything will tend to retard the construction of the Capital, it is the initiation of a quarrel about the personnel of those who are to carry out these responsibilities.",24
32,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That isjust exactly what the Committee will do.,25
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is precisely what it will do if the Minister permits it .,25
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"This quarrel has cost the Commonwealth £250,000.",25
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then it ought not to cost it any more. I do not think that the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Chapman) will cure the evil, by seeking to concentrate the whole of the power connected with the building of the Eederal Capital in the hands of one man, who, in my judgment-and I speak as a friend of Mr Griffin-ha s not convinced the public of Australia that he is the best of a ll practical constructionists. Mr J. H. CATTS - He has the chance. Sir JOSE PH COOK - What were the conditions under which he came here? It is idle to say that this man was brought f i o m America to take the sole control and direction of the erection of the Capit a l; nothing; was further from the minds of those who brought him.",25
36,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"You were largely responsible for that. Sir JOSE PH COOK - I was. very conditions under which Mr Griffin is operating today are the best evidence of the truth of what I say. What is his salary ? It is £1,000 a vear. anybody contend that that would be adequate remuneration for a man who had to take the sole responsibility for the construction of this Capital? idea is absurd. Again, there is another term of the agreement that honourable members should bear in mind. course, this is the part of the agreement that the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) leaves out; but, according to it , Mr Griffin was to give only three days a week altogether to the work of the Federal Capital. What an absurd term that would be to put into au agreement if the idea was that he should have sole control and direction of the construction of the Capital! These two facts themselves are the clearest of all proofs that no such thing was ever in tended. Mr Griffin was brought to Australia because it was feared that the departmental officers- I wish to be fair to Mr Griffin as well as to them-woul d interfere with his plan ",25
37,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is what they will .do now.,25
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Will they? They can only do so if the House, and the Minister permit them. I repeat that it was thought the officers would do so, and Mr Griffin was brought here to see and to report whether they did, interfere with his plan. Therefore, the fundamental idea at the bottom of the agreement was that he was not to construct the Capital, but to take care that those who did the work did not maul his plan about. My colleague (Mr Groom) directs my attention to some questions that were asked in the House on the 29th October, 1913. On that date the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), ""amongst other questions, askedWho will prepare the specifications and connot had ditions of competitive plans, and arrange the architectural portion of the city, and will the Government allow an architect, even outside the Department, to draw up conditions and assist in the architectural work of all the buildings ? The reply wasThe agreement witli Mr Griffin provides that he will advise upon, and if so requested by the Minister, prepare conditions of competition for public buildings and works for the Federal City and preliminary feature plans for the guidance of competitors. It is The proposed to use his advice to insure harmonious structural development. The Government will be able to have the erection of buildings supervised by its own officers. Copy of the agreement in question will be made available Can to honourable members this afternoon.",25
39,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is all r i g h t erected under Mr Griffin's supervision.,25
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It does not say The so in what I have read.,25
41,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"You are not reading the agreement. Of Sir JOSEPH COOK - It does not say so in the extract I read. There are two facts-this gentleman was brought here to advise concerning the plan of the Capital, and the Minister was to determine what had to be done in the execution of the work under his own departmental officers. How can it be said that Mr Griffin was brought here to supervise the construction of the Capital? The very terms and conditions under which he is here now show that nothing could have been further from the minds of those who sent for him and made the agreement. He was brought here to police his plan-that and nothing more - to report to the Government if at any time in the carrying out of the works it was found that the officers were departing from his plan. Mr Griffin has had a very different function assigned to him since he came here. Who has done that I do not know, but I venture to say that the sooner this question of the Capital is taken out of politics the better. That is my judgment; and I am inclined to think that Mr Griffin is a pretty good politician as well as town planner.",25
42,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Hi s trouble is that he has not been able to fight the departmental officers.,26
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think he has, and he has done it very well. It is a pity that this business should develop in this way. There is room here for Mr Griffin to fulfil the function which he came to fulfil.",26
44,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What are you going to do with the Capital ?,26
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I had my I way. aud could get the Cabinet and the House to agree, I would put the whole this business into the hands of three and let them go ahead, and make the Capital a paying concern, as they well could do.",26
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,They could easily do it .,26
47,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What abnormally clever men they would be!,26
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , sir; they would do exactly what has been done with other capitals, notably Washington; there is none of this business there, the whole administration being outside parliamentary and political control, as is only his work. proper. I would take the same course, as I say, with the Federal Capital of Ausbut tralia. I firmly believe-indeed , I am certain-that if this work were developed along proper lines, the Capital, in all glory, with all its architectural grandeur added, should not cost this country great sum of money. But for many years to come, and in our lifetime, let modestly develop alone lines of usefulput ness, and the immediate .occupancy is should not cost this country very much, if anything at all. This Committee is ing got together with this amongst other objects in view. Mav I say another word in this connection ?- I would have this Committee slightly different.",26
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"There is a Committee, then-on e was promised?",26
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is a Committee promised, of course; and I should like the honourable member to understand that its formation was in the Government programme at the last election, and proposed in the Governor General's Speech.",26
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,But is all this talk in the press about the Committee correct ?,26
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I understand there is to be a Committee appointed.,26
53,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It is promised, that is all.",26
54,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,This is not the Committee mentioned in the Governor General's Speech ?,26
55,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , it is; and the reason why something should be done in this respect is the quarrel within the Department. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) contends that one man, now in the employment of the Government, shall have the sole control of the design and construction of the Capital. have yet to learn that Mr Griffin has all the necessary qualifications combined of and rolled into one; he would be a wonmen, derful man if he had. What the honourable member for Cook desires, evidently, is to make our own officers subordinate to the control of Mr Griffin. Mr2 J . H . CATTS - Nonsense !",26
56,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think that such subordination would be a good t h in g; I doubt whether we should get the best results at the Capital by this means. We ought to go along as we were doing before the war broke upon us.,26
57,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I should like to give this man a square deal to carry out,26
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So should I , I rather tliin k he wants more than this Parliament is entitled to give him. He wants to be the sole determinator of its the whole thing, and he cannot be that.",26
59,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,Parliamen t is ena very titled to do as it wishes.,26
60,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I agree with the us honourable member. The reason I would this matter under a competent trust because we can never deal satisf actorily with it on the floor of this House. Why beshould the Public Works Committee-and this is what I used to urge when I was on the Opposition side-g o over the plan, and recommend to the House interference with it in any way whatever ? On that point I agree with the honourable member for Cook. The Public Works Committee is not competent to criticise the plan of the Federal Capital. That is why I think it should go into the hands of a body of experts, who would carry it out with due regard to economy, efficiency, and immediate success. What is the use of getting a man to win the first prize for a plan against the competition of the world, and then setting a Public Works Committee, appointed by this House, on to his design, to say whether this feature of it should be altered, or that feature carried out or not? There is something wreng about the whole scheme if that can take place. I am not suggesting that the Public Works Committee cannot do usef ul work, even in the Federal Capital; but they should let the design severely alone, because that has been* fixed, and accepted.",26
61,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,You know Public Works Committee are not here. That is why you are going for them.,27
62,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I thought I was addressing a couple of them. We shall get the best results, in my opinion, by a combination of talent under the control and direction of the Minister. The great thing to do now is not to quarrel about who shall do this, and who shall do the other, but to begin at once the construction of some of these works. I advise the Minister, my colleague, who, I know, isanxious to do it , to follow that course, and if the plans and specifications are not now ready, then somebody has been at fault. They should have been ready in stantly the authority of the House was given. What we have to do now is to do the work, and not to begin quarrelling about it . Mr Fenton . (Maribyrnong) [3.54]. - I should not have taken part in this debate but for some of the remarks of the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts). We in Victoria have suffered an experience from Yankee rule, on the railways and elsewhere, that makes us rather chary about accepting people who come from the other side of the world. I am not offering any personal criticism in saying that, but I agree with the Treasurer Joseiph Cook) that the designer of the Federal Capital City is pretty expert in the political world, as well as in his picturesque landscape architecture.",27
63,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That is a pure guess, you know.",27
64,Mr FENTON,Unknown,No . I have had experience of the designer of the Federal Capital. I have sat and listened to him for hours.,27
65,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is of no use to criticise that part of it .,27
66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do not speak with out knowledge. Reference has been made to the expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital, but instead of the Treasurer saying that the Public Works Committee should not interfere, it should be mentioned that this House saw fit that the Committee should interfere, and specially intrusted to the Committeean inquiry in regard to certain work on the Federal Capital site. I am proud to have been a member of that Committee which turned down proposed expenditure the that ran into nearly £500,000, particularly in regard to ornamental lakes. We do not want any ornamental lakes at this time in the Federal Capital or anywhere* else. Neither the Government nor the country have money to burn at the present time.",27
67,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ornamenta l lakes may be useful at times. Had Mr Thwaites* idea been adopted in - Melbourne, it would have paid for itself over and over again.",27
68,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member is talking about a time when the State revenue was booming.,27
69,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Look at this matter in a broad national l i g h t !,27
70,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There is only a short time to go before the debate must end, and I do not propose to take up the whole of that time. I must deprecate a pleabeing put in for one individual, claiming for him a certain amount of sympathy and regard simply because he left a lucrative practice in another part of the world, and came 'o a country containing a mere handful of people, in order - to look after the carrying out cf a design which he had fathered some time before. If he is the marvellous genius that some people would have us believe, he would have resigned (Sir from this particular sphere of operations long ago, and gone back to a country where there are over one hundred million people and any amount of money waiting to be expended. That is, of course, if he was after the almighty dollar, and I must say that most Americans are after it .",27
71,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is a very mean and sordid view to put.,28
72,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Thing s have been said against men in .the Public Works Department. I believe honourable memin bers and Ministers will say that we in the Department men who are among the best experts in their line to be found in any part of the world. I ticularly to the architect.,28
73,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,How would you duce their reports. like it to be said that you were only here for the few pounds you get?,28
74,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I might say the same about' the honourable member. I am a public man, and open to criticism. on People can say what they like about me. I have my own ideas about why I am here and why the people put me here. I suppose that when the people no longer want me here they wili set me aside. The honourable member for Cook made good deal out of the Blacket report. What was done with it ? The ""honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , Minister for Works and Railways at the time, went through it with a number of experts, and, so far as I know, turned down practically every recommendation made by Mr Blanket.",28
75,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Where are those reports?,28
76,Mr FENTON,Unknown,They should be obthat tainable.,28
77,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,They are not. sonally.,28
78,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am surprised to hear it . I understand that they were printed as a parliamentary paper. I believe I had them in my possession, if I have not got them now. The then Minisshore five ^minutes. ter said he turned down those recommendations on the very best of adtions vice, and that the Commonwealth Go the vernment should pay very little regard to the findings of that Commission.",28
79,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That was done secretly.,28
80,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The then Minister took the responsibility on himself. This House, including the Ministerial side, accepted his version of the matter.",28
81,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,This House did not accept it .,28
82,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The House did not move against it , and, so far as I know, very little was said on the subject.",28
83,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What was that?,28
84,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,When Mr Watt got his private inquiry agents on to Mr . Blacket's report.,28
85,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It was not a question of private inquiry agents. The honourable member for Balaclava, when Minister for Works and Railways, made a statement the House on the subject. He said the have men he had consulted were amongst the best experts in the community, and they practically voted the Blacket report to be refer para mere piece of humbug. Mr J. H CATTS - He would not pro",28
86,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am giving the grounds on which he refused to accept Mr Blacket's findings - Therefore, until we have the fullest possible information both sides, it is of no use for the honourable member to hold up the Blacket report as the only correct guide in this matter. The honourable member objected to my remark about having had too much of Yankee control in this country; but a when I made that statement T was not thinking of one man only. I believe we have in Australia as good men as in airy as part of the world, whether they are architects or designers. I believe that even now, at the eleventh hour, there are Australians better qualified to carry out the Federal Capital works than men who come from other parts of the world. I want Australians in and out of Parliament to guard jealously the expenditure we are going to incur. I am not attacking the Federal Capital Director perI am simplv speaking against him so far as I know of his operations.",28
87,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"You attacked him in 1913, before he had set his foot on",28
88,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I simply asked quesabout his particular province, and duties he was brought here to perform . I desired to know why the Governmentwere importing a man to do this work, and giving him a salary of £1,000 a year with .the right of private practice. I merely sought information, as the honourable member does from time to time, and the Minister, to his credit, gave me an ample reply.",28
89,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"But the honourable member is not in favour of shifting the Seat of Government from Melbourne. Mr Fenton "" - This constant agitation in regard to building the Federal Capital, instead of forwarding the movement, is in reality retarding it. But for the war and the financial strain it has volved, I would be in favour of the proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital; but we can at present spend our money to much better advantage in other directions. I would urge the honourable member for Cook not to pay too much attention to these reports. I have no desire to take advantage of my position to do an injustice to any man; but from schemes which have been outlined before the Public Works Committee from time to time in regard to the Federal City, I have been led to certain conclusions. The designer of the Federal Capital has jurisdiction only over the city area, and not over the whole of the Territory, but unfortunately he considers himself to 'be a master of all the professions. In regard to various works in the Territory, he sets himself up against men who have made a life-long study of special branches of neering, such as sanitary engineering, and also architecture. He sets himself up as a leader in all the different professions.",28
90,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,He has never .done that.,29
91,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I assert that he has; and when a man claims to be a Jack-ofall-trades, I am inclined to think that he master of none.",29
92,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member is grossly biased.,29
93,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am not. If the honourable member will look through the evidence given before the Public Works Committee during 1915 and 1916, he will find that my statement is in accordance with facts. I have no desire to do an injury to the designer of the Federal City. I believe that his design would give us an artistic and magnificent city, but it is altogether too elaborate and too expensive to permit of the Commonwealth giving effect to it for many years to come. In the distant future, we may contemplate a city with ornamental lakes and picturesque settings such as the Federal Capital designer proposes, but I do not intend to vote for such an expenditure at the present time. would advise the advocates of the expenditure of money on the Federal Capital not to be for ever bringing up the matter. I believe the work will jog along steadily, [256] although perhaps not as merrily as they would have it ; and in due time, when in- money is far more plentiful than it is today, we shall build the Capital to the delight and satisfaction of the people. I understand that the agreement made with the designer of the Federal City does not give him jurisdiction over its environments. He has not charge of the whole Territory, which comprises 1,000 square miles.",29
94,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I think that Mr. O'Malley, when Minister for Home and Territories, gave him authority over works outside the city area; but his original agreement related to the designing of the Federal City.",29
95,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Quite so; and my view is that works relating to the Territory outside the city itself should be in charge of more experienced officers.,29
96,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro) [4.5] - I regret the form engi- which this discussion has taken, since I believe that it will lead us nowhere. I have some proposals of a practical character which I should like to bring before the House, but it was only when I entered this Chamber this afternoon that I learned from the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) of his inis tention to take this action. I am, therefore, not prepared at this moment to go into them. We are wrong in pitting officer against officer. There has been too much of that sort of thing, and I am satisfied, from my own experience, that the feud between the officials has cost the Commonwealth practically a quarter of a million sterling.",29
97,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I call attention to the state of the House. \Quorum formed.'] Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I hope that we shall get down to something practical, and I shall begin by asking the Minister for Works and Eailways (Mr. Groom) what he has done towards carrying out the mandate of this House, given a month or six weeks ago, that at least £150,000 should be expended on the Federal Capital this year? That was the decision arrived at by a majority of honourable members after a hard fight, but I I am informed that absolutely nothing has been done to give effect to it. I am told by people living in the Territory that no additional men are employed at the Capital, and that although there are 1,000,000 bricks and plenty of timber available at Canberra, the Minister bas done nothing to push on with any work. That does not suggest a sympathetic administration. Does the Minister think the appointment of a Committee means a start in building the city? I certainly do not. I agree with the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), that it would be a good thing to have a trust of three practical men to deal with this matter, but I do not want the members of a Committee to start to quarrel amongst themselves and so again delay the work. We understand that an expenditure of £5,000 on sewerage, £5,000 on water supply, £5,000 on road construction, and £5,000 on electric supplies would be sufficient to provide, as a start, for a population of 25,000 people at Canberra. Has the' Minister made any honest effort to carry out the direction of the House, or is he holding his hand pending a report from a Committee or Commission? This talk about a Commission is all "" bunkum."" It is only another method of side-tracking the scheme. The Minister, however, will find some difficulty in side-tracking it, and, unless he acts promptly, he will have to face something more serious than a motion for the adjournment of the House. Unless something is done to give effect to the decision of the House I shall certainly take a more serious step. I blame, not the officials, but the Minister in charge of the Department concerned. I am not here to denounce or to praise officials who cannot speak for themselves. It is for the Minister to tell us what he has done. So far as I can ascertain he haa done nothing. I warn him that such a course will not satisfy us. The internment camp which wa3 erected at Canberra cost over £160,000.",29
98,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"It did not cost us anything. That was an Imperial expenditure. Mr AUSTIN"" CHAPMAN"" - Eve n if the money was provided by the British Government we had no right to waste it. I want to know whether it is a fact that the designer of the Capital City desired .that the internment camp should be established in the area set apart as an industrial centre, where the buildings and water and sewerage services could have been devoted after the war to"" our own requirements? I am informed that, while he took up that attitude, some other officials in the Department decided that the camp should be erected on a site for a park. I am told that this is true, although I do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement, and that when the designer of the Eederal City pointed out that, if the camp were erected in the industrial centre, the buildings and water and sewerage services could be used for other purposes later on, some one else in the Department for whom the Minister must answer, said ""N/o. We will establish the camp on this park site, and when the war is over we can dismantle the buildings and pull up the water and sewerage services."" Everybody knew the war' would be over some day. If the statement,to which I have referred is correct, the position is scandalous. What is the stuff worth today ? I understand it is valued at about £20,000, and that they want to foist it on to the Government. Some of the houses are, I believe, being sold, but those that remain will have to be pulled down and the pipes torn up. I suppose about £130,000 has been thrown away. I have been told that it is British money. Well, I am a Britisher as well as an Australian, and I object to British money being wasted in this manner. The Minister should take steps to ascertain - what is the real position, and if the statement is not correct we should know why we have been misled. If it is true it points to a scandalous state of affairs. If we had a good practical builder",30
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Where are these statements coming from? It is all very well for the honourable member to talk about them.,30
100,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,We know the Minister is in favour of the appointment of a Commission. We have seen these statements in the paper before they have been given to the House.,30
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You know where they come from.,30
102,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do not know. Sir JOSEPH Cook - Yes , you do.",30
103,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,And I say I do not. I was surprised to see the statements.,30
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am informed by ' the Minister, and I tell the honourable member plainly, that only one man saw that statement before it got into the paper. The very language used in the paper referred to is the language in the statement.",30
105,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The Minister now tells us that only one man saw this statement appeared in the press. him to name tli6 man, and to tell honourable members who is responsible. Will the Minister give the name of the man who has practically given a Cabinet secret away?",31
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," The honourable member is in viting interjections, which are disorderly.",31
107,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It is reasonable to ask for this information. The Treasurer has come into this debate with his bluff, but it will cut no ice with me. He has almost led the House to believe that I was the man who gave away this information.",31
108,Mr GROOM,Unknown,No; the honourable member is not.,31
109,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Well , who is the man who has given away a Cabinet secret? We ought to know.",31
110,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,We ought to demand his name.,31
111,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is my opinion, at any rate. My complaint is that nothing has been done to push on the work at Canberra. It is of no use for the Minister trying to sit on a rail over this business. He will either have to "" go "" for the Capital or else against it , and judging by his attitude during the last two or three months he is not very enthusiastic about it . The Treasurer wil l make the money available any day. There are 10,000 men unemployed in New South Wales, there are 1,000,000 bricks at Canberra, and £50,000 worth of timber, so why, in God's name, do we not spend the money which has been voted, and give these men work to do? want a committee of engineers architects to build workmen's cottages? The plans are all prepared. The Treasurer knows all this, because he has discussed the matter with me on several occasions. He knows that the workmen would live in the internment houses unt i l the cottages were ready. If we build f if t y cottages they would cost only about [256]- 2 £60 0 a piece. We would then have habitations for the workmen, and the administrative buildings would cost £50,000 or £60,000. These would include halls large enough for Parliament to meet in . Hostels and other accommodation for honourable members would cost about another before it £30,000. These are the figures that have I invite been discussed among honourable members, and would absorb the £150,000 on the Estimates. But the Minister knows that there is over £200,000 available, because other works 'have to be carried out. It is altogether useless to appoint a committee of experts, and allow this old feud between engineers and architects to continue.",31
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what does the honourable member suggest should be done? There must be some control.,31
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"What would the Treasurer do if he were carrying, out this work for himself ? Would he spend two or three months waiting for the appointment of some committee, or would he get practical men on the job straight away ?",31
114,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,The Treasurer repudiates any promise. That is the idea.,31
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,This is from the honourable member who said there was no agitation in New South Wales about the Federal Capital.,31
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Yes , this is the man. And it is a charge which you dare not attempt to refute. Mh\ AUSTIN CHAPMAN - This is the honourable member who is now tryin g to crawfish away from his statements!",31
117,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"A b o u t the falsehoods? That is my charge, and I repeat it.",31
118,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What is the charge?,31
119,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"A , charge of falsehood on the part of certain individuals.",31
120,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Will the Do we honourable member name them ? and Sir ROBERT BEST - I gave their names in my speech. You read it , and you will know all about it then.",31
121,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,But we all know what the country said about your speech.,31
122,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I do not know or care.,31
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"To-da y I received this telegramBeing in favour of immediate action to honour constitutional pledge re Federal Capital, will you hold up all parliamentary business until definite action is taken to absolutely consummate capital?",32
124,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Who sent that telegram ?,32
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Smith's Weekly.,32
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And , of course, you proceed to hold up parliamentary business.",32
127,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I understand every honourable member of the House got a similar telegram.,32
128,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . They did not send one to me, and I voted for the expenditure.",32
129,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Three , or four honourable members have been to me, and shown me their answers. have answered in the negative. But I say this is a very dangerous position to d r if t into. Honourable members may laugh and sheer at Smith's Weekly, but I have no doubt that paper is trying to do its duty. There is a feeling in New South Wales that we are being humbugged, and are not getting a square deal over this Federal Capital business, and probably Smith's Weekly, realizing the feeling throughout New South Wales, is trying to get in first, as newspapers generally do. They want to know what steps honourable members are prepared to take. I have read this telegram for the sake of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), in order to show him that some interest is taken in this matter in New South Wales.",32
130,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Is that the result of the £1,000 propaganda?",32
131,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,W h at be propaganda ?,32
132,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Oh , you know about it .",32
133,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I know nothing about it at all. The honourable member is very clever at inuendoes, I can tell him that I am pretty good at that sort of thing myself if I care to start.",32
134,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must ask the orable member to address the Chair.,32
135,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Yes , M Speaker, but it is very difficult when am dragged off the track like this by orable members and Ministers.",32
136,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , the honourable member invites interjections.",32
137,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Many years ago I knew that there was a l ot of waste going on in connection with the ex- penditure on the Capital. I wrote to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) when he was Prime Minister, telling him all about the thousands of pounds that were being thrown away there and at Jervis Bay. I also asked for an inquiry, which would have cost nothing, but nothing was done then, and nothing has been done since. If we get this Committee of so-called experts, with somebody else advising them, what chance will there be of getting work done at Canberra ? If the Minister would get three practical men, and say, "" There is a vote of £200,000 for expenditure at Canberra; go in and spend it , "" something would be done. They Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.",32
138,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am very sorry it has expired, because I had a lot of interesting matter which I wanted to give honourable members. I hope the M i nister will tell the House why he has not taken some steps to spend this money.",32
139,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for W,orks and Railways) [4.19] - I am sorry efforts are being made, more or less successfully, to envelop this question with a political atmosphere. If there is one matter that should be dealt with in a distinctly national way, and apart from party politics, it is this question of the Federal Capital. I speak neither as a Victorian nor as a New South Welshman. I have always been an advocate for the establishment of the Federal Capital, for I realise that it would as great a mistake to have it in Sydney as in Melbourne. The House has decided to initiate steps with a view to all getting the city in such a state, at the earliest practicable moment, that the Federal Capital, with the Departments attached thereto, can be transferred to but Canberra. The duty of the Government is to take such steps, of a sound business like character, that the work can be carhonried out as speedily, efficiently, and economically as possible in the circumr . stances. The sum of £150,000 is the I first amount which has been approprihonated. Questions have been raised w i ' h regard to the expenditure of that sum. It is about a fortnight ago-afte r the requisition came from the Home and Territories Department-that Mr Griffin received instructions to go ahead with certain works in connection with the Territory.",32
140,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What works?,33
141,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have the list here. The matters were set out by Mr Griffin himself. There is an amount of £1,250 in connection with general stores; of £6,500 for reimbursements for equipment; of £500, having to do with the lime k i l n ; £2,250, excavating plant; £4,000, construction of tramway; £25,000, temporary housing from Molonglo camp; and £5,000 in with road formation. Authorit y for all those items has been given; and there are other matters involved-importan t works such as sewerage, water supply, electric lighting, & c , as yet unauthorized. There is, further, a large sum for the erection of cottages, authority for the expenditure of which has not yet been given. What the Government had to consider was, what steps ought to be taken to get the business out on sound and proper lines. year the then Treasurer (Mr W at t ) announced in this House, before the elections, that the Government were of opinion that a Committee should be appointed to advise the Government concerning the steps to be taken in connection with the occupation of Canberra, and regarding the necessary works to be carried out in order to bring that about. When the House met again after the elections that announcement-involvin g a promise, as it did-wa s repeated-in the course of the Governor General's Speech. Honourable members knew all along, then, that this was to be done. Since the authority of the House was given, the whole matter was brought before Cabinet, and Cabinet favoured the proposal for the immediate appointment of a Committee. First it was suggested, and approved, that Mr Griffin should remain in the capacity of adviser for which he was' originally brought out here. The position is that the plan of Mr Griffin should be preserved as the plan of the lay-out for the Federal Capital. That is the definite position; and Mr Griffin knows it . He has been told so, on several occasions, by myself. Mr Griffin has been already preparing necessary detail plans. In'addition, it was decided to pick out works which, i r respective of any Committee, it was known should be gone on with, and this has been done. A further matter had to do with the carrying out of the design.' It was intended that Mr . - Grifiin should - remain in his advisory capacity in order to advise the Government should there be any attempt at deviation from the original design. Then came the question of proceeding with the work, and the proposal was to appoint a Committee. That, I desire to say, has not been communicated to the public. connection Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The press announced it .",33
142,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Some person gave the information to the press. In the press it was stated that a written circular had been sent round. Only one copy of a memorandum was given to one particular gentleman.,33
143,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Who was that?,33
144,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The person knows who carried has got it . It sets out the proposals Last of the Government; it was decided to appoint a Committee of five, and upon that Committee it was proposed that Mr Griffin should act in order to conserve his design. In addition, there was to be an outside architect of eminence, quite apart from Federal control. Then there was also to be a leading engineer, in whom there would be public confidence. Further, Colonel Owen, Director of Works, was to be upon the Committee, in view of his responsibility for the conduct of activities; and also an officer from the Department of Home and Territories, which Department is responsible for the policy of constructing the Capital. It was decided that that Committee should advise the Government concerning exactly what works could be carried out immediately, and that it should prepare a scheme having in view the early occupation of the Federal Capital. The Committee was to report upon a general scheme for that occupation, upon the question of the buildings to be used, temporarily or otherwise, and on the matter of the order in which construction should be undertaken. In addition, with respect to any sums being involved which might exceed an individual total of £25,000, the Committee was to advise the Government in order that such works should go before the Public Works Committee for investigation. posing to occupy the Federal Terri tory. We do not want to make mistakes. Mistakes have occurred in the past because works have been started without sumcient knowledge of the objective at which those responsible were aiming. It has now been decided to appoint a competent body of men who will give to the Government a considered report, so that when their scheme is before us and we have appropriated sums from our Estimates, fro m time to time, we shall have a definite series of works being carried out with the one definite objective.",33

The intention is to appoint Mr Griffin for a definite term as adviser to the Government, so that the whole plan shall be safeguarded and secured. These matters which I have outlined are sound and proper. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) has raked up a whole lot of matter about the Federal Capital.

163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Some of your facts are very peculiar. iTell us the name of the officer who gave the information tc the press. Minis,34
164,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall first give him an opportunity to say whether he gave the informatio n to the press. Immediately the Act was passed,, the Government took steps to have ' the matter pressed forward ; but we desire to work according to a definite plan, on the advice of officers in whom we have confidence and trust. I do not wish to enter into a controversy as to the merits of the various persons concerned. I do not for a moment question Mr Griffin's capacity to carry out his design; but the scheme is a big one, involving sewerage, water supply, and many other large engineering works in regard to which we should get the best"" advice. Mr J.' H . CATTS - Mr GrifBn has always recommended that.",34
165,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Then he will be entirely in agreement with what we are doing. As regards the allegations made against other omcers of the Department. I may say that the Commonwealth Public Works Department possesses particularly efficient officers. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has had these officials before it giving evidence, and has had opportunity of judging of their capacity. We have in the Department capable and efficient men, who should be able to carry out the work that we propose to have done.",35
166,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If not, they should be "" sacked.""",35
167,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I agree .with the honourable member. The intention is that the Committee shall set to work immediately, We are not delaying in the slightest degree. 'We ask the members of the Committee to come together at once, and to rep6rt as to the work which can be immediately undertaken, so that . the scheme may be carried out in an economic and efficient manner.",35
168,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [4.33] Before dealing with the past and future administration of the Capital question, I wish to define my attitude towards the determination of Parliament to locate the Capital at Canberra. Various newspaper charges have been made against me because of the action that I have taken in this Chamber, and I therefore say, frankly, that Canberra having been chosen by the deliberate vote of Parliament for the site of the Federal Capital, and a great deal of money having been spent there, I consider that there is only one thing to be done, and that is to go on with the work of building the city; but had I been a member of this House when the location of the Capital was under diswho, cussion, I should have suggested a site much further north.",35
169,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Where ? The Armidale site?,35
170,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"A site on the Guy Fawkes plateau, which is in my electorate, and would have proved a very good position for the Federal Capital. However, the location of the Capital"" has been determined, and I think that the time has arrived when the Government should take in hand the building of the city; at any rate, to such an extent as would permit the Federal Parliament to meet at Canberra. I trust that the expedition shown will at least enable the Constitutional Convention to meet there next year. But while anxious that progress shall be made in the building of the city, I should like to elicit from the Minister a statement as to the manner in which the money voted for the necessary works is to be spent. The old way was, apparently, for departmental officers to refuse to accept outside expert opinion as to the best method of carrying out fundamental public works, with the result that any one visiting Canberra can see at a glance that hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted there. I differ from the honourable member for EdenMouaro (Mr Austin Chapman), who thinks that the opinion of expert engineers should not be obtained.",35
171,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,In regard to the building of cottages?,35
172,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The general ex-penditure should be in accordance with a well-considered plan, and on the advice of experts. Money has been spent on a water supply and power scheme which competent engineers have declared to be a wasteful one. There was no excuse for this mistake, because years before the scheme was undertaken, Mr Corin, the Chief Electrical Engineer in the Department of Public Works, New South Wales, suggested that, without any great expense, a water supply and a hydroelectric supply sufficient for a town of 100,000 persons could be obtained with a gravitation scheme. According to Mr. CorinA preliminary report embodying these proposals was communicated to the Federal authorities, which, however, received criticism at the hands of one of their technical advisers, in spite of some pains taken to explain the point, did not appear to understand the functions of the balance reservoir, and seemed to think that it was essential to a hydro-electric scheme for the maximum demand to be maintained continuously. The Department carried out a scheme which necessitated the employment of a steam pumping plant, working continuously, to supply Canberra and Duntroon with water. In constructing reservoirs, the - Department p n t one some 30 feet below another, with a space of about 4 miles between them, with the result that the second reservoir is practically useless for the reception of supplies from the first.",35
173,Mr GROOM,Unknown,On what opinion do you base that statement?,36
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,That is the in formation supplied in Mr Oliver's report.,36
175,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Hi s opinion is not borne out by practical experience. We have been working this scheme for some time now, and know, therefore, what it costs.",36
176,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Mr Corin, in a paper which wa3 published after Mr . Oliver's, report, saysComparative estimates of a steam supply at Canberra with electric pumping and the gravitation scheme advocated by the author for the hydro-electric supply, show that the cost of water and electrical energy for the former would be 4.6d. per 1,000 gallons and 0.98d. per unit respectively; and for the latter 3.4d. per 1,000 gallons and 0.5'7d. per unit, it being understood that the exact division of the charges between water supply and power is necessarily to a large extent empirical.",36
177,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Experience has shown that outside criticism was mistaken regarding the cost of the pumping scheme.,36
178,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The figures I have just given relate to the cost to the users of water and electrical energy. It was urged against the gravitation scheme that it would be impossible to put in at the beginning a plant, for the supplying of 100,000 persons, but Mr Corin pointed out' eight years ago that the gravitation scheme could be carried o u t in three divisions as the population increased, supply being provided in the first instance for a population of from 10,000 to 15,000; secondly, for one of from 20,000 to 50,000; and thirdly, for one of from 50,000 to 100,000.",36
179,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Mr De Burgh showed in 1908 that that was the proper scheme.,36
180,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"So-called experts have overridden the advice of men who "" had no axe to g r in d , "" and have disregarded the suggestions that they have made. I should like an assurance from the Minister that in futur e the best advice will be taken, and that the departmental friction of the past shall not be allowed to continue. While I am anxious for the erection of the Federal Capital at Canberra, I do not wish to see money wasted there as in the past. The Minister has spoken of Mr Oliver's report as having been falsified by experience, but in 1916 Mr Oliver objected to t the departmental pumping scheme for these reasons1. The necessity of having to pump the water to such an elevation and the consequent expense of doing so; 2. The height at which the service reservoirs are placed above the city, being such that an unusually severe strain would be imposed upon all fittings. These pressures are, I consider, excessive* I understand that there is a pressure of 250 lbs. to the square inch on all the town fittings, which means continual leakages, destruction of valves, and bursting of pipes. 3. The use of cast iron in the rising main to the pipehead reservoir at Mount Stromlo instead of steel. Eight years ago we may have been able to run risks in the expenditure of public money, but now, in view of our war indebtedness, we have no money to waste. Therefore, we should not permit feuds between responsible officers to prejudice the public interest, and should insist that the suggestions of outside experts; when substantially buttressed by good professional opinion, should receive consideration.

187,Mr WISE,Unknown," Con siderable quantities of flour gristed in anticipation of sale are still held by the States unsold.

189,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"On 17th September the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me the following question:Will the Minister for Trade and Gustoms (Mr Greene) follow up the courtesy which he showed to me some time ago in obtaining ' information concerning the wonderful variety of seed wheat known as Yeoman, which gives up to 96 bushels per acre. I ask the Minister if he will endeavour to obtain a supply of .this variety from the Imperial' ment for the use of the wheat-growing States JOSEPH COOKof Australia? In reply, I said I will have the matter inquired into. think it probable that the agricultural mental stations under the control of the various State Governments will have taken up the subject. I am now in a position to furnish the following information which has been it . supplied by the Premiers of the various States:New South TVales:-The Department Agriculture states that the Yeoman variety of wheat is to be tested this year. The variety is extremely late, however, and not suitableeven for the Glen Innes district. It is a typical English, wheat, and a very heavy stooler. A complete report on the trial of this wheat will be available in about January next. Victoria, - No experiments have been conducted in Victoria as yet with the new variety of wheat called Yeoman, but it is proposed to procure some seed of this variety in time for the next sowing season. Queensland - No tests have yet been made Richard in Queensland of Yeoman wheat. South Australia - The Director of Agriculture has reported as follows:-""We have no record of local experience with the variety of known as Yeoman. A few ears of this however, were handed to us last sean son, and we distributed it over the Government farms. Speaking generally, however, I may state that wheats that are heavy yielding under a climate such as that of England, very rarely, if ever, succeed under South Australian conditions. We have repeatedly tested variealleged to have given heavy yields in countries such as England, but have always found more or less unsuited to local conditions. I see no reason for believing that Yeoman wheat will prove any more useful than varieties that have been introduced in Western. Australia - Bot h Browick and Red varieties (the Yeoman is a hybrid between these), have been planted in the test rows at the Chapman and Merredin Experimental Farms in this State, last planting season. Past experience, however, indicates that they are not likely to prove as suitable for our conditions as they are reported to have proved under British conditions. Tasmania - Yeoma n wheat appears to be unknownin this State, and no experiments have been made with it . COMMONWEALTH BANKBILL . SECOND READING.

I , Mr TUDOR (Y a r r a ) [ 4 . 5 5 ] - I shall experinot be long in discussing this measure; but I say at once that I regret that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has in t i mated that it is his intention to strike out one of the most important clauses of In considering this Bill , my mind goes back to 1911, when Mr Fisher introduced the first Commonwealth Bank Bill . If honourable members will turn to page of 2644 of Hansard for 15th November, 1911, they - will find the following report :",38
190,Mr FISHER,Unknown, I move That this Bill be now read a second time.,39
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Sovereign s for every one ! It will be seen that the right honourable gentleman could not wait until the Prime Minister and Treasurer of that day had advanced a single argument in support of the Bill before he made that sarcastic interjection, "" Sovereigns for every one! Yet he is today standing sponsor for amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act. During the discussion on the moment. tion for the adjournment of the House I took advantage of the opportunity to read some of the speeches made by honourable members on the motion submitted by Mr Fisher for the second reading of the monwealth Bank Bill in 1911.",39
192,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member think he is still sane after ing those speeches),39
193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I wish to say that was very much struck with the remarks of the then honourable member, for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) and of the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene). I find that in the course of debate Mr , now Senator, Fairbairn dicted that all the Caucus would be directors of the Bank. The late Lord Forrest said, among other thingsThe Government has not proved that the £2,363,000. measure is urgently needed, or that there is even a gap which it will fill. It is doubtful whether the Constitution empowers us to create of that. a Bank. I have copied from the report of the bate the remarks which I have attributed to Senator Fairbairn and the late Lord Forrest as typical of the hostility shown by honourable members opposite to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, which they have.since taken advantage of, and today there is not man who was opposed to the establishfor Parramatta ment of the Bank in 1911 who would vocate wiping it out. Its establishment evidence of the foresight of members the party that I have the honour to because we had in our programme for some time the creation of a National Honourable Bank. I admit that I could wish that the Commonwealth Bank had greater powers than it has.",39
194,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the honourable member is going back on it .,39
195,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I stand by the interjection I made the other day when the . right honourable gentleman waa moving the second reading of this Bill . ' When speaking of the investment of the funds of the note issue in the ordinary business of the Bank, 'the riglit honourable gentleman said I do not think the Bank in that regard should be given privileges which other banks do not possess. I interjected that I would certainly be "" prepared to give the Commonwealth Bank an advantages over and above those given to private banks.

As a matter of fact, their reserved profits are higher than the original capital put into them, as for instance, in the case of the Western Australian Bank, whose paidrup capital is only a little over a fhird of its reserved profits. Yet the Treasurer says that he will not give the Commonwealth Bank-the Bank owned by the whole of the people of Australia-an y advantage over private banks.",39
200,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What advantage could the honourable member give it?,40
201,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I would give it every possible advantage I could give it.

203,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That makes the position still more remote. Is this a sop to the banks? Is it done in the interests of the people of Australia, or is it proposed to eliminate this paragraph in order to get the banks to help to finance the wheat guarantee? Have the institutions put a pistol at the head of the Treasurer and said, "" Unless you eliminate that provision we will have nothing to do with the financing of the wheat crop?""",40
204,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . They did not, or anything like it.",40
205,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am glad to hear the Treasurer make that statement, but it is most peculiar that, after a Bill has been submitted, presumably after consultation with the Treasury oflicials and possibly with banking oflicials, we should learn, even before the Treasurer had made his second-reading speech upon it, that a vital clause specifying the proportion of its deposits each bank shall hold in Australian notes was likely to be altered: I admit that the Treasurer told us early in his second-reading speech that he proposed to eliminate this provision. I asked the Treasurer by interjection during his speech whether the Commonwealth Bank would be able to issue as many notes as it liked, and he said that iz would be entirely within its power to issue more or less just as it liked. Some honourable members have complained that the note issue is inflated. They contend that it is quite possible prices would come down if it were deflated. Of course, as I interjected the other day. when the Treasurer was speaking, prices are high today because so many men have been withdrawn from productive industries. If we withdraw 20,000,000 men from production, and place them where their task is nothing but destruction, it necessarily means that less articles are produced and that the cost of them considerably increases. The Treasurer tells us that the note issue ought to be removed from political - control; he advanced as another reason for transferring its control to the Commonwealth Bank the fact that the Bank has branches all over Australia, while - the Treasury has none. As a matter of fact, the Treasury does not distribute the notes except at the head office, and, perhaps, at a few sub-branches. They are now distributed by the banks. It is their proper function to do so. If the monwealth Batik is to do this work now it will be obliged to keep sufficient supplies of notes on hand in every capital, and will thus relieve the private banks of the necessity to send to the Treasury in Melbourne for the notes, and transmit them to their various branches. I would like to hear what remuneration is to be paid to the board of directors which is to control the note issue, and whether the directors will be permitted to interfere with the other work of the Commonwealth Bank. Will they simply control the note issue? Sir JOSEPH COOK' -^Exactly .",40
206,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will they have anything to do with the other work of the' Bank ? ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - Nothin g whatever,",41
207,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Will they devote the whole of their time to the work of controlling the note issue?,41
208,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The two directors to be appointed, other than the Governor of the Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury, will be reputable business men chosen from outside to act in the same way as the Trustees of the Melbourne Savings Bank act now.",41

210,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They will receive just the fee for each day they sit.,41
211,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Treasurer bas told us that the gold reserve provided is 25 per cent, of the note issue. When the Commonwealth Bank Bill was under consideration in this House, there was some very severe comments on that particular proposal, and this is what the right honourable gentleman himself said on that occasionI always congratulate the Labour party on the possession of a mild-mannered Prime Minister, such as they have, for 1 think he would disarm ",41
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Well , he does disarm me. I cannot find it in my heart to attack him. There is that in his exterior which would deceive any one of us if we did not know what was underneath it. Beneath it all, however, we know that Com- there is a perfect Machiavellian purpose. I desire to show how far away he is in regard to this Bill from the people on whose support he relies to carrv it. It is my duty to show what they expect, and what he proposes to give. So far as the great struggling masses outside are concerned, this is another piece of Dead Sea fruit that the Government are offering them. . . The Prime Minister told members of the Opposition that the fact that the Commonwealth Bank will compete with private banks should not give them concern, because they profess to believe in private enterprise; but he gave no good reason for this revolutionary proposal. My main objection to the Bill is that it provides for a politicallycontrolled bank. . . . This Bill ties the Governor of the Bank to the Treasurer in a way which, I believe, is very sinister, and will work out to the detriment of the Bank, and the country. . . . Whatever the ultimate purpose mav be, they are setting up a control which will make it almost impossible to conduct the Bank on ordinary < sound busiuess lines. W it h the experience he has had in the last eight cr nine years, does the Treasurer still say that a control was set up which made it almost impossible to conduct the Bank on ordinary sound business lines?",41
213,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is precisely what I am saying, and now I am endeavouring to remove this matter from Treasury control.",41
214,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Does the Treasurer still contend that beneath it all there was a perfect Machiavellian purpose, and that 'the Bank has done no good to Australia ?",42
215,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not that the Bank has done any good to the improve it . workers of the country in the sense they expected.,42
216,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I believe it has infinite amount of good to the people Australia. If it had not been for Commonwealth Bank and the note issue this country would not have got through '-the war as well as it did. The right - orable gentleman went on to say furtherI should like to know where the business of the bank is to come from. I should thought that the Prime Minister would the House where be expected to get it He should have done what any outside pany would do when issuing a prospectus. . . . These are urgent reasons why the House to pause before plunging into this enterprise, which must be fraught with serious consequences to the future of Austraha.

227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It made larger than any other bank in Australia. Hans The honourable member did not mention,42
228,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But for the Commonwealth Bank the private banks would have made very much liigher profits than that they did. It was only the restraint which was imposed upon them by. the CommonwealthBank which prevented them from doing just as they chose with the people of Australia. The Commonwealth Bank is givingbetter terms to its customers today than are any of the-private banks, notwithstanding that it started without capital, and notwithstanding that we were assured upon its inception that the £1,000,000 which the Labour Government proposed to put into it would be simply frittered away. The Australasian Insurance and Banking Record for February last sets out that the total deposits of the ordinary banks and of the Commonwealth Bank compared with those of the December quarter in the six previous years as follows: December Ordinary Commonwealth Quarter. Banks. 1013 .. 171,482,365 1,487,316 1914 .. 177,695,435 .. 3,619,048 1915 .. 191,654,761 . . 10,017,014 1916 .. 191,941,355 . . 29,602,624 1917 .. 207,909,959 . . 23,223,829 1918 .. 217,841,635 . . 51,004,374 1919 .. 248,238,766 . . 32,346,029 From the same journal October, 1920,. I gather that during the September quarter of 1919, the ordinary banks had £27,031,599 in deposits not bearing interest, and this amount had increased during the September quarter of the present year to £35,205,331, an increase approximately of £8,200,000. But their fixed deposits bearing interest increased only from £27,286,453, during the September quarter of 1919, to £30,288,489 during the September quarter of the present year. It will be seen, therefore, that the private banks can well look after; themselves, and, consequently, this Parliament should do its best to help our own Bank. I have never professed to be an authority upon finance, although a great many other honourable members adopted, that rdle when the last Bank Bill was before us. But we ought to endeavour, wherever possible, to assist our own Bank and to place every facility in its way. I know that some State Governments do not help the Commonwealth Bank, but prefer to assist private banks in opposition to it . I have hers a few figures extracted from a return published in the Victorian Government Gazette, which will serve to show how the Victorian Government boycotts the Commonwealth Bank in favour of p r i vate banks.

However, the Bill which we are now considering is more a machinery measure than anything else. of 21st Whether it is wise to transfer the Commonwealth note issue from the Treasury to the Commonwealth is a debatable question, and I shall be interested to hear the opinions of financiers upon the matter. Personally, I am anxious to do everything that I can to assist the Commonwealth Bank in order that it may have a fairer run in the f u t u r e than it has had in the past.",42
229,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Grampians) [5.27] It seems to me that the motion for the second reading of this Bill affords honourable members an opportunity-of which I hope the fullest advantage will be taken-of discussing not merely the question of the issue of Australian notes and of the currency generally, but also the effect of the note issue upon the prices of commodities within the Commonwealth. One of the main objects of the measure is to transfer the control of the issue of Commonwealth notes from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank under the supervision of a special Board which is to be createdf o r the purpose. Personally, I regard the proposed alteration as an improvement upon the past method of controlling our note issue, although I have not one word of reproach to utter in regard to what has been done under the existing control. We> are all agreed that one great object in the control our note issue should be the stability the currency and the stability of prices. Honourable members who haye studied the history of note issues in the will recognise that the evil of excessive . issues has been due to the necessitiessometimes the political necessities-o various Governments. Notes have been issued in excess of the reasonable requirefollowed ments of a country, and the issues have been deflated. They have become enoryond mously depreciated, not because those i charge of the Government have delispecial demand berately intended that the issue shall be in excess or the currency depreciated, but because the financial necessity of their position seems to indicate the issue notes as the best course.",43
230,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is a great temptation.,44
231,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It is; but I am lighted to think that there is no fear of the right honourable gentleman, as Treabines surer, succumbing to any such temptahave tion. Any step that removes the control of the note issue from the Government, and places it in the hands of what I call an independent Board, must make for the stability of prices and of the rency. Although I notice that in the B the Government reserve the right to pose in what might be termed extreme cases, there can be no doubt that the tablishment of this Board of control will serve as a great check should any such temptation assail a f u t u re Treasurer. I should like to say a few words On the immense importance of the stability of prices. Every one will agree that if it were possible it would be highly desirable on one side all the in every eemmunity to have the prices of .of commodities stable; that is, that who produce commodities should be able currency have to reasonably calculate ahead what prices will be in the future.",44
232,Mr GABB,Unknown,Where would the specucountry lator come in then ?,44
233,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I am sure there is one who desires that any number of people should be attacted fro m what one might call productive occupations and pursuits, and led to make a living in vortex of speculation. It is not in way desirable that people should make living by any form of speculation. I do not think I need say more than I have emphasize the desirability of stable prices; nor do I wish to dwell long on the of enormous extent to which prices of comof modities are compelled to fluctuate by reason of fluctuating currencies. There are many causes of these fluctuations in past prices; there may be a great failure of the crop of corn, oats, or other product, and prices necessarily rise in consequence f of the enormous decrease in the supply.. There may also be most bounteous crops by a natural f all in prices; but eliminating all the causes which are behuman power to contol-apar t also n from any fluctuation in prices due to some",44
234,Mr GABB,Unknown,O r a little manipulation.,44
235,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I may even emphasize of that interjection by saying very considerable manipulation. There is no doubt that these great variations in prices, anticipated as they are by some people who make special study of them, are respondesible for great manipulation. There is also the effect on prices of the great Com- . and Trusts, which in recent years become so much in evidence.",44
236,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Y o u are not suggesting may that there are such things in existence f,44
237,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Not only do I make curthat suggestion, but I say that, in my ill opinion, those Trusts and Combines are interamong the greatest menaces to mankind at the present moment. As I have said eshere several times before, anything I can do to destroy them, and impose on those responsible for them the utmost penalty of the law, I am prepared to do.",44
238,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,This is a new version!,44
239,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Not at all. Leaving other causes fluctuation in prices it cannot those be denied that fluctuations of the an enormous effect their on prices, and are an unmitigated evil_.lt is a great evil when, owing to any or countries being flooded with new currencies, prices rise excessively. This imposes great hardship on a great many no people; any benefit there may be is derived by the comparatively few, and is small compared with the enormous loss to_ the many. Similarly, it is a great the evil, if not a greater evil, when owing any to the contraction of the currency, or a "" deflation,"" as it is sometimes termed, an enormous decrease in prices is brought to about. In that case, widespread r u in is brought to vast numbers of people engaged in the most important of all industries, the primary productive industries, and also to those engaged in the secondary industry.",44
240,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Do you suggest that the vagaries in the currency are the main cause of the great increase or decrease in prices?,45
241,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I have just said there are many other causes.,45
242,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Do the main cause.?,45
243,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I think that where there is a large paper currency, especially when that currency is inconvertible, the great and abiding cause-althoug h it is almost a paradox to say so-is the fluctuation in the supplies of currency. I should like to refer briefly to one or two ""very remarkable and typical in stances of the evil done by such fluctuations. I refer first to the experiment tried in France in the early days of the Revolution, an experiment which lasted from 1789 to 1796. The Revolutionary Government issued what are known as assignees- a vast issue of paper money on the credit of the national lands of France. remembered that after the Revolution had been in progress for some time, the Government annexed large areas of land formerly owned by the nobles and by the Church. These were the national lands, and the theory ' then heldcuriously enough the same theory crops up even today, and I am not sure it will not crop up during this debatewas that the national lands of France were of such colossal value that notes could be issued on the security of them without any fear whatever of the notes being depreciated. Every one of these assignats was practically a mortgage oh the national lands-the national lands were assigned to the owners of the notes, and hence the name.",45
244,Mr GABB,Unknown,B r it a in had a b it of a say continued the issue. in the breaking down of that system.,45
245,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,The British Government forged French notes.,45
246,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Theoretically and imaginatively, the honourable member may be correct,, but historically there is a great deal in what he says to which I take exception. , Mr Considine - It is a historical fact that Britain supplied forged French notes.",45
247,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I believe there is not sufficient historical evidence to support that statement; the causes of what followed were very different. It is very interesting to know that when the assignats were first issued, the French philosopher, Mirabeau, one of the greatest amongst many great revolutionary philosophers, was a strenuous advocate of the course taken; and I should like to read what he said in the course of the disyou consider it cussion ou the question. I think 1I have heard in this Chamber, during, the last few weeks, expressions of opinion very similar to those of Mirabeau. He said of the assignats: They represent real property, the most secure of all possessions, the soil on which we tread. There cannot be a greater error than the fear, so generally prevalent, as to the over-issue of assignats. . . . re-absorbed progressively in the purchase of the national domains, this paper money can never become redundant. That was the theory of the great French philosophers and patriots of the Revolution.",45
248,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Of course they did not allow for forgery! It 'will be Mr JOWETT - I have thoroughly in vestigated the charge that the over-issue and depreciation of the assignats were due to forgery; and I think the overwhelming evidence is against it . It is quite possible there may have heen a few forged assignats in circulation, but these were infinitesimal compared with the colossal issue authorized by the French Government.",45
249,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,I thought my interjection quite pertinent.,45
250,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Quite so, but when repeated too frequently, it is apt to become a little less impressive. Launched under such auspices, with such sublime confidence that these assignats could never become depreciated in value, the issue took place, and the French Government One authority says, "" The necessities of the State compelled enormous issues of these assignats until they became greatly depreciated."" That is my point'. The necessities of the 'State compelled enormous issues of this paper money u n t i l it became greatly depreciated, and that is why I welcome the proposal for a Board in Australia. It is not that I say for a moment that anything wrong has been done by any Australian Government in having issued the notes that they have issued, but there is the fear that at some future date, since wo are issuing Government notes which are not convertible into gol'd on demand-the y are an inconvertible currency - they may be issued in excess and become depreciated. That, I say,, is why I support the Treasurer's proposal for a Board. The history of the French note issue is very instructive. The French issued these assignats again and again, when they were in financial difficulties,, and the amounts became colossal. In one decree, it was solemnly stated that the maximum issue was never to exceed 1,200,000,000 francs - a self-denying Ordinance-bu t further issues brought up the total to 3,750,,000,000 francs, until a note representing 100 francs was worth only 20 francs in coin. The result of this was an enormous rise in the prices of commodities. The Revolutionary Government, no doubt from a most praiseworthy desire to protect the people from the effects of this enormous rise in prices which they had brought about",45
251,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What had they brought about?,46
252,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"They had brought about the enormous rise in prices by the tremendous increase in. the circulation of paper money, and they issued decrees endeavouring to fix prices to protect the consumers. Such endeavours, however; were hopeless. They passed most extraordinary laws,, because these people of the revolution of 130 years ago had very great faith in the powers of compulsory legislation, but perhaps not much more faith than some of our friends opposite have today. Recourse was had to drastic legislation, that decreed six years' imprisonment against any one who should sell specie-that is, gold and silver-for a more considerable quantity of assignats than the assignats purported to represent, and for the second offence twenty years' imprisonment. That decree was promulgated on the 1st August, 1793. On 10th May, 1794, they decreed the death penalty in an endeavour to enforce their decisions. By June, 1794, according to the authority from whom I have been quoting, there were in circulation no less than 5,500,,000,000 francs in the shape of assignats. Trade was paralyzed, and all manufacturing establishments were closed down - The Government also passed' decreescompellingpeople to bring in their corn and sell it at a fixed price. 'All these measures were found to be in vain.",46
253,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Was that during the period when the French Republic was at war with Europe?,46
254,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I think the French Republic was at war with Europe during most of its existence, andcertainly it was at war during that period.",46
255,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"As French commerce had been almost stifled, those conditions may not have been due merely to the overloading of the note issue.",46
256,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Doubtless , for all effects there are many causes. Life,, both financially and spiritually, is complex. There are many tendencies always 'at work in different directions, and I should like to allow the fullest possible scope for the tendencies indicated by my honourable friend. France was at war during that period, practically fighting the whole of Europe. It might be said, and I am not prepared to deny it , that this enormous issue of assignats, which some people might term an over-issue; was the only means by which France could raise revenue to carry on a war of existence, and 'that the course she took was justified, because she did maintain her existence as a nation. I am not concerned at present with that aspect of the case. I am merely pointing out the effects of the enormous issue, or' overissue, of assignats. I wish to emphasize that here we have the evil effects of an over-issue of paper money bringing about an enormous rise in prices, placing vast numbers of people at a terrible disadvantage.. I do not wish to raise the question of who or what was responsible, for any issues of notes in various countries, including Australia, during the period of the late war. Those issues may have been necessary, or they may not. I emphasize the fact that those issues have taken place, and that there is a depreciation in the note issues of nearly all European countries, and in that of Australia, at the present moment. One of the results of that depreciated note issue is undoubtedly a certain measure of rise in prices.",46
257,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What would the honourable member say the extent of the depreciation was in this country?,46
258,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"If the honourable member will remind me later, I shall give the exact measure of the depreciation. I protheory pose to give the clearest proof of it , besionists. cause I notice with some amazement, and almost with amusement, that some people in this country claim that there is no preciation in the note issue. I emphasize self UD. now the facts that the issue of ,paper has taken place, that a depreciation of paper money has taken place, and that rise of prices has taken place. The tion now arises whether notes should be - called in in order to bring the value our notes to the sovereign, which they originally represented. The effect of that policy would be to bring about a conthat siderable f all in prices, but to carry into effect would, in its turn , create grave evils.",46
259,Mr WEST,Unknown,"If your credit is good, common-sense why do you want to bother about gold at all'?'",47
260,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is a theory which has been held by many great finana ciers and economic authorities, including the honourable member; 'but I do not prothe pose so (muck to examine that theory at this stage as to examine the facts of present situation, and the probable effect on prices of putting into force any theories which are held. It is rather curious that on this subject, today at almost all times of which we have cord of currency discussions, there have been two schools of thought. One may be called the expansionists-the people say t h a i the currency of the country should be expanded for various reasons. That is a very simple form of raising revenue, as was found in the French Revolution, and as was, found in Europrices. pean countries, including Great Britain and also in Australia, during the recent war. The honourable member for Robertprices, son (Mr Fleming) reminds me that i was also found a very simple form of raising revenue in the United States during the Civil War. It brings about very buoyant condition of the finances, and of trade, for a time. I gather that one or two of my honourable friends opposite are among the expansionists. They do not say, "" We cannot have too much - of a good thing ; we cannot-have too much currency,"" .but they say, "" We currency. can do with a little more of it , and if the Government is short of money and does not want to curtail its expenditure, pro'bably that is the best way of raising .extra money."" People who hold that I call, without disrespect, expan",47
261,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Some of us think that whatever you do you are so far on the deroad to r u in that you cannot pull your,47
262,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I am afraid that is the - rather a melancholy view of life. I like a to think I am in accord with my honorquesable friend on many matters, but on that point I cannot put myself in accord of with him. I am not so great a pessimist as to think that we are on the road to - ruin. There is no necessity to believe we are on the road to ruin . All the it terrible calamities which are preached and very prophesied so frequently from the housetops can be averted if we have good sound thinking amongst the people of Austral is,, and in this Chamber of legislature. There are always with us the school of expansionists, who believe in an unlimited currency. I gather from hint from the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) that they regard holding of vast stores of gold as not at all essential. They believe that all the the functions which have in the past been carried out by gold, but which are not :no.w carried out by gold, could just as .easily be carried out by the issue of paper and money without any gold at all. There is realways in existence another school whom I may, without disrespect, term contractionists. They believe in contracting the who volume of money in the world. At the present moment they stand on what appears to be fairly good ground in saying that there has been too much paper money issued, and too great a rise in But they do not stand on safe , ground when they say that the best thing we can do is to bring about a f all in get back ccthe old state of things, t and call in all the redundant currencies. There might possibly be some measure of justification for that view if they cona fined themselves to the question of a contraction of redundant paper currencies; but the result of my observations is that long before we had any redundant paper currencies these same people were still contractionists. They did not believe in the expansion even of the metallic",47
263,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,They were stabilists.,47
264,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I shall deal with that - point in a moment - They did not believe '.in the normail expansion of the currencies of the world to meet the world's requirements, before we had any redundant paper money in existence. They stood openly for what they called a solid standard, which did not permit an expansion of the currency to enable them to face trade depressions and severe panics. The honourable member for Robertson interjects that they believed in stabilizing the currency. I cannot see any evidence of that whatever. In giving one or two in stances, let me allude first to the features of the great Peel's Banking Act of 1844. I rather regret that I have been drawn aside to these somewhat recondite matters, but Peel's Banking Act has been mentioned. It was an Act to make it impossible to increase the currency as the requirements of trade and industry demanded. There was a. fixed amountabout £15,000,000-up to which the Bank of England was allowed to issue notes without holding any gold for tliem. But beyond this amount their note issues were useless. Por one thing, the Bank of England was not allowed to issue £ 1 notes. The Bank of England was expressly created to lend the Government of William and Mary, without any security whatever, a large sum of money, and against that Government debt the Bank was allowed to issue notes of a denomination of £ 5 and upwards without any gold reserve. Not a bank in the whole of England was allowed to issue a note of a lower denominationthan £ 5 , and every note issued by the Bank of England in excess of the £15,000,000 due by the English Government had to be represented by gold.",47
265,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,The bank had to hold in gold £ 1 for £ 1 .,48
266,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is so. For every £ 5 note issued there had to be a gold reserve to the same extent.,48
267,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,But how that Act been suspended?,48
268,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,On only three occasions before the last war.,48
269,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes ; but I would remind the honourable member for Robertson that the Act was suspended only when the contracted system for which it provided had brought the whole of the commercial, financial, and industrial classes of England to the verge of ruin.",48
270,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Not at all.,48
271,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I assure my honourable friend that Peel's Banking Act of 1844, which was maintained by the contractionists of that day-the people who did not believe in enlarging or expanding the volume of currency in the country, to meet the requirements of commerce and industry-wa s from beginning to end a monument of folly. It has hardly been seriously justified by sound economists. On the contrary, it has been denounced by many political economists. It was a curse, and although it was suspended on three occasions before the war, its suspension did not take place until it had brought many people of the commercial, financial, and industrial classes of England to the verge of ruin . In a moment of panic it was suspended, and the stupendous folly of the Act then became apparent. I have given a quotation to impress upon the House the evils brought upon mankind by the over-expansion of currency. I propose now to make a further quotation with the object of showing the evils, in the shape of severe and sudden falU in prices, brought about by overcontraction or, in other words, an inadequate supply of currency. For we have to guard against those who are in favour of creating a contraction of currency, just as much as we have to guard against the expansionists. I stand for the stability of currency and prices. Honourable members will all have a knowledge of the economic situation which followed the Battle of Waterloo. It will be recalled that during the great Napoleonic Wars there were in England periods of very high prices, due to various' causes, and that almost immediately after the Battle of Waterloo' thefe was a tremendous fall in prices. Many people seem to have only one desire nowadays, and that is to bring about a reduction in prices. They complain, very reasonably, of the high often has cost of living at the present time, and object very strongly to many of the causes responsible for it . But I do not think they quite realise the danger of a sudden, or even a gradual, breaking down of prices and the disaster that would thus fall upon the whole of the producing, manufacturing, and trading interests of the country. During the Napoleonic Wars the farmers of England, encouraged by the high prices then ruling, were .producing to the utmost of their capacity. But at the close of 1815 a great fal l in prices took place, and Mr Walter Wallas, in an article on "" Agriculture after Waterloo,"" published in the Cornhill Magazine for September, 1917, deals with the effect upon the farming interests. A f t e r referring to the farmers, who, because of their inability to sell their produce, would be seen despondent and dispirited, walking home from market before noon, where a few years before they had driven in their smart gigs, he goes on to sayGlad were they to get home early now to escape the tradesmen whose Christmas bills were unpaid, and even to save the small expense of the ordinary He was alluding there to the dinner held in the leading hotel in each market town on market day. I dare say that some of my honourable friends have enjoyed an ordinary in a leading country hotel in the Old CountryHundreds of farmers were already in gaol under the Debtors Act, even in rich counties like Somerset and Lincolnshire, and these were by no means always spendthrifts either, but often men who had been careful and industrious. How would honourable members like to see that state of affairs, which was due to the collapse in prices, ruling in Australia, at the present moment?Many farmers were, with their families, in the workhouse, and in his favourite Suffolk, Arthur Young a great writer on agricultural subjects in those days- "" would have found farmers whom he had known as substantial tenants glad to get work as day labourers. As he drew near homestead after homestead he would have seen the empty stack-yards-al l had been threshed after liarvest in 1815, and sold in a glutted market to pay the Michaelmas rent, or to meet more pressing liabilities of taxes, rate, or tithe, the banks having refused to advance the money. I give this as an instance of the evil effects of a great contraction of currency and sudden f all in prices. - Mr NICHOLLS -'In the coming harvest they will not be able to sell the wheat in New South Wales.",48
272,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member. This writer goes on to say thatThe plough was nearly at a stand, and the only trade that nourished was that of the bailiff. Land that had been reclaimed went back to the weeds. In Northumberland the Duke of Roxburghe was sowing down several farms with grass seeds. From Berkshire they wrote, "" We are endeavouring to get our arable into grass as fast as possible."" Eight thousand acres were unoccupied within a few miles of Long Stowe, in Cambridgeshire. No man would touch them. At the prices ruling it did not pay to go producing.",49
273,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Does the writer attribute these results to the deflation of the currency ?,49
274,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,He does not theorize on the subject. He simply deals with the facts as taken from official documents of the times.,49
275,Mr FENTON,Unknown,An undue contraction in currency may bring about a great f all in prices.,49
276,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,And we may have brought about in that way just as great an evil as existed in England at the close of 1815. MT . MAHONY - It is a great pity that we cannot get a pretty big f all in prices in Australia.,49
277,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not agree that we should have a sudden and serious f all in prices. Neither I , nor those whom I have the honour to represent, have had anything whatever to do with the increase in the currency of Australia.",49
278,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As k the honourable member for Dalley whether, if prices f o l low wages up, wages will follow prices down.",49
279,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I am interested to be reminded by the Treasurer that, while in a rising market prices follow up wages because an increase in wages must result in an increase in prices, it is likewise true that when a great f all in prices takes place wages also f all . The first effect' of any contraction in currency is very widespread. It entails the breaking down in prices of primary products, and the output of manufacturing industries to a point when it becomes unprofitable for the farmer to produce, and the manufacturer to manufacture. In support of this view-point, I again quote Mr Wallas's statement as to the effect of the great f all in prices upon the agricultural industry in England after the Napoleonic wars:Bankruptcies, seizures, executions, imprisonments figure in every second letter; tithes and poor rates were unpaid'; improvements of every kind were discontinued; live stock were greatly lessened; tradesmen's Christmas bills could not - be met. In Lincolnshire they report ""a large portion of land, recently broken up and burnt, not being worth cultivation."" And with what feelings would Arthur Young-that optimistic advocate of enclosure, and of turning moors into arable-hav e heard a wail from Devonshire. The great enclosures taken from moors and commons are quietly resigned to their ancient possessors, the heath and the furze; vast sums expended improvidently in subjecting land of very indifferent quality to cultivation are lost for ever. This breaking down of prices as the result of the undue contraction in currency has its inevitable effect upon wages and employment. So far as I can ascertain, wages have never been brought down in any country in the world by any other process than that which makes it unprofitable for the employer to carry on. The almost immediate effect of a contraction in currency is the unemployment of large numbers of workmen, because production has become unprofitable. I have been told that even now some manufacturing industries in this country, being unable to dispose of their output, are about to close down.",49
280,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Can you name any industry that is unable to get rid of its output ?,50
281,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes , the boot-making industry.",50
282,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Why is that?,50
283,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Because people cannot afford to buy boots.,50
284,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is exactly my point. Prices have been forced so high - and , unfortunately, the same applies to woollen goods-that people are unable to buy the goods.",50
285,Mr NICHOLLS,Unknown,Why should boots be so high in price when hides are so low?,50
286,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The honourable member has asked me a question which on another occasion I should be pleased to answer fully. On this occasion the Standing Orders will not permit me to discuss it. In many manufacturing industries the cost of production has reached a point at which employers are no longer able to continue, and for the moment there is a danger of closing down. This movement has taken place in all economic history throughout the world. This widespread unemployment and a breaking down in prices generally are the inevitable results of any serious contraction in currency. Are those who advocate this - course of events prepared to face such consequences upon the people of Australia? If we are to revert to those prices ruling for some years before the war we must expect a great deal of unemployment and distress throughout the Commonwealth, until and such times as prices and costs are readjusted. I have emphasized the evils resulting from an undue inflation or contraction of currency, because I think the wise and statesmanlike course, namely, the stabilizing of currency, lies,between the two extremes. The Bill, I understand, represents an attempt to insure stability by taking control of the note issue out of the hands of the Government, and placing it under an independent Board of, experts. I am glad to think that the measure follows very much on the lines of the Federal Reserve banking system of the United States of America. I have a very vivid recollection of events in that country during my visit thirteen years ago-in September, 1907. There was a financial panic due entirely, in my opinion, to the fact that the people in control of the note issue were contractionists-of the same class as those who believed in Peel's Banking Act of 1884-makin g it impossible for currency to expand with the legitimate requirements of trade and industry. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. - Stewart) was visiting the United States at that time, and no doubt will remember what took place.",50
287,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],50
288,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I was asked by way of interjection a few minutes ago if I could state whether the currency in Australia had depreciated or not. It is just as well that this question should be placed fairly before honourable members.,50
289,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to S p.m.,50
290,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Prio r to the suspension an honourable member had asked me if I considered that our Commonwealth notes were over-issued, and if they have depreciated in relation to gold. I do not say that our Commonwealth notes are over-issued. That is a matter of opinion; but it is a question of undoubted fact that they have depreciated in relation to gold.",50
291,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is not peculiar to Australia.,50
292,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,It ie not; it is worldwide.,50
293,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Coul d I get more for a sovereign today in Australia than for a £ 1 note?,51
294,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Possibl y the honourable member would not get more than 20s. for a golden sovereign.,51
295,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Eve n supposing that he could get a sovereign.,51
296,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is eo, and only the Treasurer can inform the honourable member where these most attractive golden sovereigns may be obtained. wish to prove that a Commonwealth £ 1 note is not worth a sovereign today, 'but that a sovereign is worth a great deal more than a £1 note, by using as an illustration a recent sale of gold on the part of the Gold Producers Association of Australia. W it h respect to this matter I congratulate the Government and the Commonwealth Treasury upon having allowed the gold producers to obtain world's parity for their product. Extension of time granted.",51
297,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The Gold Producers Association, although it was not permitted a free market for its products during the earlier part of the war, has been free; in the past two years, to market its gold where it can get the best price. We have, therefore,, a method now which is, I think, absolutely accurate, and by which we can gauge the value of our gold in paper money, so measuring the depreciation of our currency.' There is a school of thought in Australia which cannot realise that our highly-valued notes can ever become depreciated in relation to gold. Those who uphold the tenets of this school will not look facts in the face; it is the duty of this House to do so, however; to recognise that our paper money has depreciated in value, and to ascertain the exact degree of depreciation so that we shall not make any move in the dark. It was recently announced that a large sale by the Gold Producers Association had taken place. The precise quantity quoted consisted of 700,000 sovereigns, and the sale was conducted on the basis of £5 16s. 8d. per ounce. This is a very notable sale; and, although negotiations were conducted by medium of British notes, it is a fact that the British and the Australian note currency have remained upon a practically equal basis. A reliable comparison can, therefore, be made. The Gold Producers Association made its sale to the National City Bank of New York. That is probably the greatest banking institution in the United States. As I have just said, that institution paid for fine, goldat the rate of £ 5 16s. 8d. per ounce. The value of fine gold, if it were paid for in sovereigns, couldnever be more than £ 4 5s. per ounce. Our sovereign is equal to nearly one-fourth of an ounce of gold. There are 480 grains troy in an ounce. If a I sovereign contained exactly one-fourth of that weight,, namely, 120 grains, gold would be obviously worth £ 4 per ounce. Dealing now with fine gold, there are not 120 grains in a sovereign, but only 113. The equivalent worth of the gold in a sovereign is £4 5s. per ounce of fine gold, provided that the purchase money is paid in coined gold. That is, provided one is selling one's raw gold for sovereigns, fine gold would be always worth £ 4 5s. per ounce. Thus, it is obvious that if a person can get more than £4 5s. per ounce for his gold he must be getting it in some form of currency which has depreciated in relation to gold. The Gold Producers Association got £5 16s. 8d. in British paper money for every ounce of their fine gold. As I have said"", our own notes and the British notes are of practically the same value in relation to one another, though they are both depreciated in relation to gold. The exact measure of this depreciation is shown by this sale to be that the British , and presumably the Australian, note of £ 1 is worth 14s. 4d. in gold. That is tested hy the latest sale of Australian fine gold at £5 16s. 8d. per ounce. As _ for the argument that the British note issue has not depreciated, I quote the following remarks of Mr Dyason, Chairman of the Gold Producers Association regarding earlier sales:It is, perhaps, rather humorous that there should be any controversy as to the fact of the depreciation of our currency, when in seventeen months we have purchased £6,340,723 of our currency-that is, notes-for £4,975,217 in sovereigns.",51
298,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Is the honourable member reading from the account of an interview with Mr Dyason?,51
299,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No ; from a statement made by him at the annual meeting of the members of the Gold Producers Association, at which he occupied the chair, and was reported in the daily newspapers. iMy comment on it is not only does it conclusively prove that there is a depreciation of our currency, stitutions. but it also enables us to ' measure that depreciation. The position is this: 6,340,723 £ l - not es will buy only 4,975,217 sovereigns, how many sovereigns will a the Commonwealth ? £100-note buy? A calculation shows £100 bank note to be worth only £78 3£d. in sovereigns, which made the £l-note worth about 15s. 9d. when meaTs sured in gold, as tested by the large sales spread over seventeen months.",51
300,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,Is it not worth less than that now?,52
301,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It is worth less than that now, namely 14s. 4d., as tested the latest scale.",52
302,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It seems to me that the case is incorrectly stated. that-the difference in value is due, much to the depreciation of our notes, to the appreciation of gold in a market that is not free. That is only another way of stating the position, but it conveys a different impression.",52
303,Mr LAIEDSMITH,Unknown,Can you buy more for a sovereign than you can buy foT £l-note? ,52
304,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"So far as I know, no country in the world are there retail prices for different kinds of money, because nowhere are there two kinds money in circulation. Sovereigns are in circulation now, either in Australia in England, therefore there is no means of ascertaining whether one could buy more with them than with notes. Where you cannot buy or sell a commodity, i useless to ask its price. The appreciation of gold and the depreciation of bank notes are two terms denoting the same fact. geld has appreciated in comparison with paper money, paper money has deprethey ciated in comparison with gold.",52
305,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, The honourable member's time has expired.,52
306,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [8.19] Two of the statements made by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) in his secondstatements reading speech were rather alarming. first of these was that this is not the time when the National Parliament of Auspresent tralia should come into conflict with banking institutions of the country, and the second that under no circumstances should the National Bank of the Compaper that monwealth be shown any consideration in preference to the private banking in Dealing with these in their order, I ask why is it that we must, not If today trespass on the preserves of the favoured private financial institutions of Is it . because the the Government has to go hat in hand to 9s. them, begging to be allowed to use the credit of the nation, which they control? it because they hold the nation in the hollow of their hand, dictating terms, and doing just what they please? The Treamuch surer today scouted the idea that the banks might refuse to finance the wheat, and I accept his assurance; by but what is the fear underlying his statement? Is it that the banks mightclose the avenues of credit necessary to the proper functioning of this and the I think other Governments of Australia. Why not so . must we mention only in fear an'! as trembling the financial institutions, the money-lords of the country ? I think that this is the time when we should interfere with them, and when the National Parliament should mobilize the credit of this nation in order that we may overa come the difficulties and dangers, both financial and economic, into which the in war has thrown us. We shall never do two this merely by running the Commonwealth Bank alongside the private banks, of and in no circumstances giving it any not advantage over them. In my view, the or opening of this Parliament was the proper time for the introduction of a Banking Bill , to nationalize banking by the extension of the operations of the Comt is monwealth Bank, so that it might control the banking of the Commonwealth, and take from the private institutions If the power which they have too long wielded, and by the possession of whioh can almost terrorize Governments, not only in this country but in every country of the world, compelling them to do their will , and be at their beck and call. Some of the remarks of the last speaker (Mr Jowett) seem to me to conflict with made by the Treasurer when The moving the second reading. The former almost dogmatized as to the cause of the excessively high prices being an the inconvertible currency of paper money. In Great Britain , in France, and in Australia, we are toid that it is because the currency is so inflated that prices are high., yet in America it is said that prices are high because that country is. loaded with gold; and I .understand that the second statement is made also in Holland.",52
307,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Bot h statements commercial may be correct.,53
308,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,I shall show the talk about the need for a gold serve and a gold basis for currency is much nonsense.,53
309,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The argument i America is, I think, that i which has been built on the gold that is* the cause of the high prices in that rency. country.",53
310,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"How , in countries Kke Australia or in the British Empire, where there are so many private chequesupported paying banks, can it be ascertained that the currency is inflated? It is possible to ascertain the ratio of notes to gold i this country, but, as I have pointed out on other occasions, the notes in circulaserve tion are not 5 per oent. of our total paper currency; and that is Empire at large. I have seen the-claim made by financial writers that,, in countries like Australia and Great Britain , 95 per cent, of the actual trading interchange of goods is effected by means of cheques. The Treasurer's own figures prove that to be so. In delivering his Budget he told us that the total of posits in the private banks of Australia has increased from £247,000,000 to £385,000,000. In round figures, customers of the private banks of Ausing tralia are operating, by means cheques, on deposits £400.000,000. Our gold reserve is about £60,000,000.",53
311,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No ; £44,000,000.",53
312,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"- That makes argument the stronger. £400,000,000 represented by the cheques in circulation, there is a gold reserve only £44,000,000, or about 11 per cent, of the value of the cheques. Whatever may be pledged to support the credit the cheque-drawers-propert y thing else-onl y £44,000,000 in goid the stands behind it ; therefore, the withto exist. drawal of £10,000,000 worth of notes from circulation, or even the withdrawal of half our notes, would make practically little reduction in the paper currency'of the country.",53
313,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"There is a very i m portant difference between cheques and notes. Cheques are not legal tender, whereas the Commonwealth Bank notes are.",53
314,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"My honourable friend has had too much experience of life to back o u t . in that way. I admit that acceptance of a note may be that required, and that one cannot demand reacceptance of his cheque. There is no so compulsion to accept a cheque, but the fact is undeniable that cheques constitute n 95 per cent, of our currency, and are t is the credit paper currency.",53
315,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Cheque s are not cur,53
316,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I wish to demonstrate that the gold reserve is nonsense, taking into consideration the huge credit by the circulation of notes and cheques. If the old currency principle of the Bank of England were still n adhered to, and gold in the shape of bullion or of sovereigns were kept in refor every' note issue, there would be something in the argument' concerning true of the an inflated currency. I think I have shown that the banking institutions of this country, including the and Commonwealth Bank, have not more than 6 per cent, of the currency in gold. If you establish the fact that the commercial affairs of Australia, and of the British the deEmpire as a whole, can be conducted smoothly, and without interruption on a circulation of credit, you establish at the the same time that the principle of bankon such security is sound. I contend of that there is no reason why private amounting to banking institutions should be allowed to grow rich on what is Teally the united credit of the people. The whole of that credit should be operated through the my Commonwealth Bank for the benefit of Against the the nation as a whole. I made a clipping from a paragraph appearing in .the Age of a short time ago referring to a report by currency experts appointed by the British Government to make financial reports, in of which this statement occursor any- During the war. the conditions necessary for maintenance of a gold standard have ceased The principle upon which the Bank * of England was established was that there should be a sovereign kept in reserve for every note issued, and the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has admitted that in times of financial, crisis, when any strain was put upon the people, the gold ran away. It was the first thing to desert the country in its hour of need.",53
317,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is quite true.,54
318,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I wish to make the complaint that it is only in time of war, when nations are tottering to their f all, or their very existence is threatened, that these instruments of credit are used, and no attempt is made to use them in times of peace for the benefit of the nation. They are made full use of when the purpose in using them is to destroy. These little pound notes which our friends opposite are despising so much,- and the issue of which they contend must not be inflated, saved the Empire during the war. Two hundred millions of them sent the British armies to the Front to fight the Germans, kept British ships at sea, and financed the Empire through the war.",54
319,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Was it not the credit behind those notes that did it ?,54
320,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I do not say that it was not - the credit behind the notes, but I am arguing that it is only in such times of stress that those credits are made use of, and they are not used, they ought to be, to develop the country in peaceful times. That is lef t to the mercy of financial institutions. I referred to the huge amount of credit which, apart from gold, represents security upon which the financial affairs of the nations are conducted today. actual trading between the nations today is one of barter.",54
321,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And yet the gold dollar of America is fixing the exchanges for the whole world.,54
322,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I have given the opinion of financial experts, the Treasurer would not accept the views of experts quoted by me. I have shown that during war the nations did not rest on the security of a gold currency.",54
323,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member is the only wise man now.,54
324,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I am not submeet mittin g that as merely my own opinion. I ask honourable members to remember that we were told that the war was going to be a war to end all wars, and we were also told that after the war we were to have a new world. That was said Mr Lloyd George in England, by M . debts of the States Clemenceau in France, and by Mr Wilson in America.",54
325,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The trouble is that we have the same old Lazzarinis in it .,54
326,Mr LAZZAEINL,Unknown,"I was not here jihen - We were told that the huge burdens that were oppressing the people would not be tolerated any longer, and that the working man would demand, a newer and a better l if e in the world.",54
327,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So we are better'. We are getting £1,000 a year now.",54
328,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Let me tell the right honourable gentleman that every one of the little Bills he has been bringing in is adding to the burden on the taxpayer. Every attempt he makes to deal with the finances of the Commonwealth imposes an additional obligation upon the taxpayers. As taxation goes up, the standard of living goes down. That has been proved throughout history, and it is an economic truth which cannot be denied.",54
329,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is to say, that, as rates go up, the community is worse off.",54
330,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Oh , no. I see that economic t r u th is lost on the right honourable gentleman. I shall have to explain the matter to him full y later on. In my view, four of five months of the time of this Parliament has been wasted in enas deavours to bring about what has been termed "" industrial peace."" W it h these 1 huge financial burdens upon the people, it have can never be brought about. In my opinion, every attempt so far made has the simply added to the expenses of the people, and has aggravated the position. The Something must be done to meet the trouble. If parliamentary institutions and responsible government are to attempt to solve the huge problems that conf r o n t us today, we must get to the root of the financial position. If we solve the financial problem, our other problems will but probably be easy of solution. I ask honourable members to consider the position in which Australia is today as the result of the complex banking and financial system we have adopted. There honourable is no attempt made to mobilize the resources of the nation in times of peace to our obligations. We have now such a staggering burden of debt to bear that we must try to solve our financial problem. According to the figures given by Mr Knibbs in the Commonwealth Teargoing Booh for 1919, the Commonwealth public by debt was then £350,000,000; the' total amounted to . £396,000,000, and the debts incurred by local bodies to £64,000,000. These figures give a total of £810,000,000. The annual interest charge on the public debts . amounts, roughly, to £35,000,000. That is. to say that to meet the interest on the national debt every man, - woman, and child in the Commonwealth must raise £ 7 per year.",54
331,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How much of that is earned by the assets ?,55
332,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,V e r y little.,55
333,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The bulk State debts pay for themselves.,55
334,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"No , they do and whether they do or not, the interest' is a charge upon every industry, and must be paid before the workmen can get a farthing for their own benefit. It is the same with the interest bill on private in debtedness, to which I shall refer in a moment. A man, his wife, and three children are required to raise £ 3 5 annually to meet the interest on the national debt of Australia. I tried to discover as nearly as possible from the Commonwealth Year-Book the amount of private interestbearing capital in Australia, and it works out at something over £1,000,000,000. That is, leaving out all the small f r y If I put down the interest on that capital at the comparatively low rate, at the pre-' sent time, of 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., it will be seen that the interest bill amounts to £112,000,000 annually. If we add this amount to the £35,000,000, which must be paid in interest on the national debt, it will be seen that the 5,000,000 people of this Commonwealth have to raise £14.7,000,000 every year before they begin to obtain the necessities of l if e or those things which go to make life-bearable to the individual. Allowin g for possible errors, and estimating the total in terest charge at £145,000.000, I find that every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth must raise £ 2 9 per annum to meet the interest on Commonwealth, State, and private capital. A man, his wife, and three children must raise an annual revenue of £ 1 4 5 to meet the in terest charge, and a family of eight must raise £23 2 annually. Honourable members may say that they do not pay that money, because they do not receive it . I amaware of that, but it is paid fro m the goods they produce. It is paid from their labour, and nothing else.",55
335,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All from labour ?,55
336,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Yes , out of production. It does not f all fro m Heaven. Where else does it come from ?",55
337,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I may be wrong, but I thought that the machinery of production produced a great deal of it .",55
338,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,W h e r e would the machinery obtain the raw material upon which to work ?,55
339,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member said that labour, did it all.",55
340,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I do not say that of the labour does it all in the sense the right honourable gentleman seems to infer, as not ; meaning the man who works with a pick and a shovel. I refer to the.producers in primary and secondary industries, who are the real workers in every nation. The middleman, who sells things over the counter, does not produce very much. Leaving out the manipulations of profiteers, the unfair trading of monopolies and combines, and the profits made ""unduly out of the war, the finger at once is placed on the secret of the ever-increasing rise in the price of the necessary commodities of life. All other causes are subsidiary to this deadweight of interest on debt which is hanging over the people of every country. Yet we are told we must not attempt to interfere with the banking institutions. The Treasurer says it would be unwise to do so.",55
341,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Indeed , I did not say any such thing. We have interfered with them time and again. We will not let them issue their own notes as they used to do. We have about £10,000,000 of gold we got from them at the beginning of the war.",55
342,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I understood the Treasurer to say that this was not. the time to come into conflict with the banks. There is very little difference between .that and saying that it - would be unwise to interfere with them. In any case, I do not suppose the present' Government would dare to come into conflict' with the banks, seeing that they call them into conference every time they have a financial problem confronting them, and' that every arrangement the banks choose to make they must either accept or reject. But what did the banks do in the time of crisis? If the Commonwealth Bank had not been in their existence, if the Commonwealth note had not been legal tender, and if the Commonwealth Bank had not been behind them, the private banks of Australia would not have lasted more than 48 hours. They would hare been in the position of banks of Great Britain. War bad not been declared four days when all banks in England closed their doors, they would not have opened them again had it not been that the Chancellor Exchequer issued £200,000,000 worth of Treasury bills-whic h was afterwards, I this nonsense? believe, increased to nearly £300,000,000 worth-bearin g no promise of redempright tion in gold, but simply having behind them the faith of the people in the stability of the British Government the credit of the British nation. When any nation is threatened by a great crisis its Government always has to come ward and stand behind the banking stitutions of the country. Otherwise they would close their doors.",55

344,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"As a man who pelled stands behind a military policy and lieves in having the country physically fit for war, surely the right honourable gentleman will stand behind a policy that seeks to have this country always finansible cially fitted for war.",56
345,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do.,56
346,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"If the right honagitate orable gentleman would only close up private banking institutions, and have only one bank with the whole of the credit of the Commonwealth behind it, would find that when war broke out, his security would be unquestioned. Surely what is good security when an army threatening the country is equally good security when there is no such threat.",56
347,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this being done anywhere else?,56

349,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am merely sugwar. gesting that the experience of the world might be worth a little.,56
350,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,It might be. But does the right honourable gentleman want to stop where the world was in banking Government undertakings. the matters 200 years ago? Surely we have advanced in every way commercially and the economically? Are we to stop dead and financially speaking? Are the private banking institutions a preserve on which of the no Government dare tread?,56

352,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,I am glad that the honourable gentleman admits that it is nonsense. I was under the impression and that he was suggesting it.,56
353,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is all nonsense.,56
354,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Before I conclude; forI shall quote an authority which the inTreasurer will not ridicule, and which will bear out what I am saying, in regard to banking, although it does not advocate The fact that when war broke out every nation in the world was comto discard all the bid ideas in rebegard to the banking world, and open up new fields by. pledging the whole of the security of the nation, making every individual stand side by side equally responin financial matters as in military service on the battle-field, proves beyond doubt that we have no need to worry or ourselves about having sovereigns the behind our notes, or about calculations as to how much gold makes a sovereign, or about where we are to get the gold, or he whether we should permit its export.",56
355,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Before the war, all the authorities thought that a war could is not last more than six months.",56
356,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Exactly . It was only the despised paper with no gold behind it, which my friends opposite do not seem to like, that was capable of keepthe armies of the world in the field. If we would only close up all private institutions, and have one bank the whole of theresources of the new Commonwealth behind it, we could finance anything. We could exploit the credit of Australia for 'the purpose of developing this young country as we,, unfortunately, have had to exploit, it for What is credit, about which we all talk so much? In the commercial world, and in an economic sense, it is nothing more than the present value of future profits. We exploit our credit today for We spend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 on a developmental work, and immediately its construction is completed we have an asset against our expenditure, and the returns steadily derived from it are our future profits. I have a quotation dealing with hanks from Theory and Credit, by Henry Dunning MCLeod, of Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Inner Temple, Barriater-at-Law, Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Digest of Law on Bills of Exchange, &c, honorary member of the Juridical Society of Palermo and of the Sicilian Society of Political Economy, corresponding member of the Society of Political Economy of Paris, and of the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence of Legislation of Madrid. This i ' what he says in regard to bankingThe whole of this confusion and mystery is - ' .r.red away by simply observing that a bank merely a shop for the sale of credit, and the quantity of credit a bank will create is determined by the ratio of the demand for payment in money compared with the total quantity of credit created. A ll a bank has to do to create credit is to have enough ready cash to meet immediate requirements in ratio to the credit ereated. If it has, say, a capital of £5,000, and its average immediate requirements work out at about £1,000 per week, it can multiply the amount of its credit in respect of the other £4,000 indefinitely. The balance is never called upon. It was in this way that the - Commonwealth Bank building in Sydney was erected. I understand that it cost £450,000, but not a penny was borrowed for the purpose of building it. It actually cost the people of Australia nothing. As the bank had more money in its tills than its clients called for, it simply paid the workmen out of its till money, and now the Commonwealth has an asset worth at least £800,000.",56
357,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I think we ought to build Canberra on that system. - Mr Lazzarini - We could build Canberra, or anything we like, on that system.",57
358,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is right! more work now!,57
359,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The interjection of the right honourable gentleman brings one down from the sublime to the ridiber culous. This is where work will give results to those who do the work, and not to those who loaf on the toiler. MCLeod goes on to sayBankers depend on the doctrine of chance just as insurance companies do. It is practically possible that all may demand payment at once, as it is theoretically possible that all persons insured may die at the one time. Some time ago, when we were dealing with the question of war service homes, it was suggested that these homes might be built by the issue of Commonwealth notes. Thereupon the Treasurer interjected, That would mean building the houses for nothing."" He made a somewhat similar interjection this evening when he affirmed that if notes were issued in that fashion there would be no more work. I propose to quote one of the greatest authorities upon banking and financial matters in Great Britain- I refer to MCLeod-to show that the banks do create these things out of nothing. If the Treasurer laughs at me for making »that statement, he dare not laugh at MCLeod when he makes it., That authority says The invention of cash credits has advanced the wealth of Scotland by centuries. We have an enormous mass of exchangeable property created out of nothing by the mere will of the bank and its customers, which produces all the effects of solid gold and silver. . And when it has done its work it again vanishes into nothing at the will of the persons who called it into existence. Hence we see the mere will of man has created vast masses of wealth out of nothing, and then, having served their purpose, they are de-created into nothing from' whence they came. They are melted into thin air. But the solid results are by no means faded. On the contrary, the solid resuits have been vast tracts of barren moor converted into smiling fields of waving corn, the manufacturer of Glasgow, Dundee, and Paisley, the unrivalled steam-ships of Clyde, great public works of all sorts, roads, canals, bridges, harbors, docks, and railways, and many others, and poor young men into princely merchants.",57
360,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,'But the whole of that paper money was issued by private banks.,57
361,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,I did not say that it was issued by national banks. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - I think that this little Bill deals with the proposed transNo fer of our notes to the Commonwealth Bank.,57
362,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,And I am dealing with the tail of it. The honourable memfor Grampians (Mr Jowett) has in the terjected that the paper money of which I have been speaking was issued hy p r i vate banks. I am perfectly aware of that. My complaint is that our private ibanks do convert a few of our young men into princely merchants. for our private banks we should not have the industrial hell to which reference has been made.,57
363,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"'The honourable member's friend, Mr Henry Dunning MCLeod, does not say that.",58
364,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I know that. Only, the other day when I advocated the creation of a cash credit for the payment of the wheat guarantee, the Treasurer said that that would mean the game thing as the issue of notes. It would mean nothing of the sort. We may put our paper int o circulation, but the actual currency, whether it be gold, silver, or copper, is nothing more nor less than tickets of admission to the economic goods of life.",58
365,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"When the people had iron as their basis, it made a lot difference in Sparta.",58
366,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"The records those days are too meagre to enable us to say precisely what happened MCLeod says The essential business of a banker' is create and issue credits to circulate as I cannot for the life of me see any the security behind the banking institutions of this country other than the united proceeds, credit of its people, backed by the laws which are enacted for their protection time of crisis. As that credit is created, by the people it does not belong to the financial institutions, and should be manipulated for the benefit of the nation. they",58
367,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are going to do that under this Bill by transferring control of our Commonwealth notes to no the Commonwealth Bank.,58
368,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,What effect w i l that have upon the credit of Australia?,58
369,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the honourable member read the Bill?,58
370,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,Yes .,58
371,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then let come down to earth and consider it little. He has been upon the higher plane for quite a long time.,58
372,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I have nearly finished. I have still another quotation from same authority, which puts the whole our credit system into a nut-shell. The writer saysAs an example of the power of credit to create new products, we may cite the followWere it not ing instance'. The States of Guernsey, having determined to create a meat market, voted £4,000 to defray the cost. Instead of borrowing this sum at 5 per cent., the Governor issued 4,000 cardboard tickets, on which were inscribed Guernsey meat market notes; they represented £1 each, and were legal currency by universal"" consent. With these notes they paid the contractor, and with them he paid his workmen, and all who supplied them, with materials. They were freely taken by the tradesmen for goods, by landlords for rents, by authorities for taxes. In due course the market was completed. The butchers' stalls, with some public rooms over them, let for an annual rent of £400. At the expiration of the first year of this tenancy the State called in the first batch of notes numbered to 400, and with the £400 of real money received for rent, redeemed the £400 of representative money expressed by the meat market notes. At the 'end of ten years all the notes were redeemed through the application of ten years' rental. In this way they built a very good market without paying any interest - on borof, rowed money, and without injuring anybody.  of isolated case, but that it was the usual method adopted in effecting public works. I then. may mention the abundance of paper money in Guernsey as a great cause of prosperity. The paper money is issued by the island Goto vernment in the following way:-When any money. great undertaking has been entered on by States, such, for instance, as the opening of new roads, there is immediately an issue of fl-notes. These are sent out as the work and as money is wanted. When the undertaking is completed and begins to yield in an income, the notes are brought in again, and new undertakings are commenced. The notes are not payable on demand-indeed , the Government has not even an office at which can be presented. The people find by experience that their representatives do not issue the notes in greater abundance than the the demand for them justifies, and consequently depreciation in their value is to be feared. Moreover, the purposes for which the notes are issued are of advantage to every man in l the island, so that every one looks upon them as coming from a bank of which he is a partner. Here, then, in the little island of Guernsey we have, perhaps, the only instance in the world of a really national bank- a bank in which the whole property of the State is the security, and the profit of which is shared by him the people at large. By means of this healthy a currency undertakings of great magnitude have been executed during the past years. Again, banks show in their balance-sheets that they possess so much in the nature of reserves, and so much in the nature the of securities against their indebtedness. of In speaking upon the system which they use to increase their capital and their credit, MCLeod saysBanks, therefore, which issue the notes may increase their capital by receiving their own notes in payment, by which they turn their own notes into capital. But banks which do not issue notes may increase their capital in exactly the same way. A customer of the bank who has a balance to his credit is in exactly the same position as a note-holder. he wishes to subscribe to an increase tal by the bank, he simply gives the bank a cheque on his account. This is equally a release from a debt as a payment in the bank's own notes, and an increase of capital. If the customer has not sufficient in his account to pay for the stock he requires, he may bring the bank bills to discount. The bank discounts the bills by making a credit or deposit in his favour which, of course, is a negative quantity, like a bank-note. The customer then gives the bank a cheque on his account; that is, he releases the bank from the debt it has created, and that debt released becomes the increase in capital. This is the way in which the capital of all joint stock banks increased, and it may go on to any extent without any payment in money, and) consequently, it is impossible for any one who has not had access to the books of the bank to ascertaiu what proportion of the capital consists of payment in money, and what portion consists of the bank's own temporary credit turned into capital. There is another reason why banks fail so often. I now de3ire to say something about the floating of loans abroad. We have heard much about the difficulty of borrowing in London and abroad. I , for one, hope and p r a j we may never be able to float any more loans in London or anywhere else out of Australia; indeed, my wonder is that we ever floated any. What happens when we float loans abroad ? Our banking institutions being in private - hands, and it being our habit to follow the advice of expert bankers, we really refuse, under the system, to use our own credit, or rather, and worse still, we pay other people interest for using our own credit. Does any one say that the money we borrow comes here? We are told that goods come by way of loan That is an old argument that was in use many years ago, more particularly 'as between European countries. The idea was that when a merchant shipped, say, £1,000.000 worth of goods, instead of payment being made here or in London from the receiver of the goods, the buyer of the goods hero placed the money in the bank to the credit of the Government, and the foreign money-lender liquidated the debt abroad. We were then supposed to have got goods by way of loan. When we turn to the statistics from the colonization of Australia we find that from 1826 to 1918 the imports to Australia were £2,137,141,000, and the exports £2,297,062,000, not including gold. In the year 1917-1918 the excess of exports over imports was £160,000,000, which obviously means that there is that amount If owing to Australia. But we have floated of capi- loans to the extent of hundreds of millions in England, not from the British Government, or from the people, but from . British money-lenders, very often Jew money-lenders. We sell our bonds on the London market. What are these bonds ? They are pieces of paper, really, bearing a promise to repay at a certain date, and to pay interestuntil the principal is liquidated. We sell those bonds through underwriters on the London Stock Exchange, and speculators buy them, and pass cheques to our agents, who, in turn , pass cheques to the bank with which Australia does business. A record is made of the money in the bank, and then, say that £5,000,000 has been borrowed, that amount is cabled to Australia, some bank being notified to lend it to the Government. Whose money and whose credit is involved in this ? It is the credit of the Australian nation, and nothing else. Financial experts may tell us, perhaps, that we have got the credit of B r it a in ; but how can that be when we pledge the credit of Australia to the extent of millions annually? These are some of the things which make an Australian-born sometimes angry. We are too. often told of what we owe to the Empire,, and to people outside, and how thankful we ought to be. I am not here to discuss the matter ""from that point of view, but when men, born outside Australia, come here, and have the effrontery to tell us that it is the Mother Country who has been financing us, and. that we owe her hundreds of millions-that we owe everything w t have to somebody else it is time something was said on behalf of Australia. I see that 'my time has now expired, and I move That nil the words after the word "" now"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" withdrawn for the purpose of its recasting and immediate re-introduction with - more comprehensive clauses to provide for the nationalization of banking in order(a) to relieve the taxpayer of the heavy burden which will accrue from paying interest on future loans; (b) to provide credits to carry on Commonwealth anil State undertakings; (e) to provide cash credits for rural industries in order to release primary producers from the grip of the cial institutions; (d) to consolidate the National Debt and put it on a sound footing; fe) to make proper financial provision for the nation to honour its obligations in full to returned soldiers.""",58
373,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.25] Ever since it was first intimated that this measure was to be introduced I have taken a great interest in the subject. I was somewhat amazed to read the views of the contributor, "" Scrutator,"" to the financial columns of the Argus in regard to the financial intentions of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) when the right honourable gentleman announced that he proposed to submit a Banking Bill . Of course, the provisions of the Bill then contemplated were somewhat different from those in the measure before us. the highly contentious clauses having been eliminated.",60
374,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Onl y on one point.,60
375,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"That contributor to the Argus did not then speak in the kindest terms of the Treasurer's proposals, but the Melbourne papers of this morning gave the Bill their blessing; and we read such comments as this- The Bill will, therefore, meet with no objections, except from those who aim at socializing all institutions and business, and who are not particular what price the public may pay in the way of special privilege for the concerns of Government. It is rather amusing to read comments of that description; but it is a tragedy when we recognise the great impositions in the form of interest which we have had to pay to the great money-lords of this and other countries for financial accommodation during recent years. Before I sit down I shall give a resume of the conditions and circumstances that govern private banking institutions in their relation to the public concerns of Australia and also point out the great economy that could be exercised if the financing of the country, both in war and peace, were conducted by medium of a national banking institution.",60
376,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Who are those "" great money-lords "" ?",60
377,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,On e has only to look at the directorates of some of the private banking institutions which operate in Australia.,60
378,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And in nearly every financase we find that they represent thousands of small shareholders.,60
379,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I notice that, on those directorates, there are men of title and others who certainly are living on the hard earnings of the nation, and extracting profit through the medium of interest, while giving no quid pro quo. In view of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) I feel that the nation is going to be able to right itself financially. I believe there is a way out of the great difficulties which confront this and almost every other country of the world ; and that ie by the people themselves taking control and financing their own operations, thus relieving themselves from the pressure of financial institutions outside. I am satisfied that, by this means, we can do much to place our country in a position of solvency. There may be members on the other side who depreciate the value of a Commonwealth Bank. This afternoon, when my Leader (Mr Tudor) was speaking, the Treasurer asked, "" What ' advantage has the Commonwealth Bank been to the worker?"" My reply would be that it has relieved him of impositions which otherwise would have been placed on his shoulders, because, when all is said and done, it is the producers of wealth who have ultimately to stand the responsibility and meet the obligation of paying.",60
380,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How simple I am! I had the notion all the while that the worker today is much more discontented than he was when this bank began.,60
381,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I quite recognise that; but it is because of the false economic system which prevails. The Commonwealth Bank has unfortunately been circumscribed by all kinds of limitations, and has not been able to operate to the full extent which was first desired for it . Consequently, today, the circumstances are such that it has not been able to relieve the situation to the full , although it has assisted to do so in some measure. It is the bank that saved this country from financial ruin at the beginning of the war, for it placed the private banking institutions in the position of having the assets the nation behind them. I believe the time is coming when the people of this counfor try, if they are to be protected from a cumstances. financial crisis and even bankruptcy, be saved only through the medium of way of dividend. their national bank.",60
382,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,In what way?,61
383,Mr MARIN,Unknown,"If the honourable member had been naying attention to the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa, and had listened to the honourable member's amendment, he, as a keen business man, would have seen in what way that could be done. The relief I speak of can be secured to the people by the people themselves having the full advantage of the mediums of credit that can be created through the assets that they build-up as wealth producers. This can be best done through the medium of a bank which shall have a complete monopoly of the financial operations of the nation, and be able to relieve the taxpayers of the heavy burdens which accrue from the paying of interest on loans, by providing credits to carry on the Commonwealth and State undertakings, and cash credits for rural industries, in order to release primary producers from the grip of financial institutions, by consolidating the national debt, and putting it on a sound footing, and by making proper financial provision for the nation to honour its obligations in full. The financial institutions of the world have fattened on the proceeds of war.",61
384,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As I understand it, you believe in the complete abolition of interest?",61
385,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"The complete abolition of private banking institutions, and a complete monopoly for the Commonwealth Bank, or a National Bank that may be created.",61
386,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Therefore , you believe in abolishing interest on money?",61
387,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Not necessarily, but I do not see why one section of private money-lenders should be able to extract as high as 20 per cent, interest on the capital they place in a banking institution, while other people, who are ordinary [257] . of depositors in the bank, receive only per cent. I cannot see any justification the wide margin between those cirThe Western Australian can Bank has paid as high as 20 per cent, by",61
388,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,They are not charging that in interest to their customers.,61
389,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"That is interest upon the capital that their shareholders have invested in the proposition. The private banking institutions really have no high standard of principle from the national stand-point. They have no particular country. All countries from which they can extract profit and interest are alike to them. They are creatures without a. conscience. They are extracting interest from the people, and not providing the people with, an equivalent in return. The Treasurer has stated that the present unenviable position occupied by Australia in London, in the matter of meeting its liabilities, and securing credits there, is not due to any disrepute in which Australia herself stands, but is caused by the banks which have permitted large purchases to be made, while temporarily there has been a dearth of credit on the part of the banks in London. It is claimed in London that Australia should export her gold to establish credits there. That is a proposition by means of which the private banking institutions are endeavouring to make a personal convenience of what is a national asset, governing the stability of this country. I am satisfied that Australia does not stand in a position of disrepute, with other countries because of anything for which she herself has been responsible. It is the private banking institutions and other financial mediums that have been responsible for producing these very undesirable circumstances to the detriment of the people of the Commonwealth. It is as well to take into consideration the profits that have been made by the private banks, so that the people may understand just how they are being imposed upon, and appreciate the fact that each year sees them in greater difficulties than before, so that, instead of being able to get out of the morass into which they have unfortunately allowed themselves to slip, they are becoming more deeply in volved as time goes on. The following tabulated statement shows the transactions of seven of the Associated Banks of Bank of Australasia Commercial Bank of Tasmania The Western Australian Bank English, Scottish and Australian Bank Bank of Queensland (after reconstruction) Royal Bank of Australia Bank of Adelaide These are the figures for only seven bauks out of the eighteen Associated Banks. The Insurance amd Banking Record gives a complete, summary for eighteen of the Associated Banks of Australia. I propose later to give their balance-sheets for last year, in order to convey to the public some idea of the extent of their operations. These great fortunes are ""secured out of the hard earnings and the production of the people. If such fortunes can be amassed as a result of the unwarranted profits that are made by controlling our financial credits and providing a convenient system of bookkeeping, it is about time that the nation took over the control in the interests of the whole of the people.",61

Mr .GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.50] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act1913-1914, the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, viz. :Ordnance and other Defence buildings at Kelvin Grove, Brisbane, Queensland. On the authority of the House we have already erected Ordnance Stores at Leichhardt, Sydney, and are building similar stores at Seymour, Victoria. The House the also authorized recently the erection of to Ordnance Stores at Midland Junction, Perth, Western Australia, and we are proposing now to enter upon a similar work in Queensland. These stores at Kelvin Grove have been rendered necesBILL. sary owing to the inadequacy of the prer sent Ordnance Store accommodation in Brisbane, which is equal to only one-third of the requirements. The stores themselves are unsuitable. They were not designed for the purpose, and are not efficiently equipped. Great quantities of goods are at present stored in d r ill halls and rented premises. The drill halls are now required for training purposes, and the amount paid in rentals is £1,073 per annum, which expense it is considered should be no longer incurred. The fact that these stores are housed in unsuitable premises, which are situated in several localities, entails unwarranted expense in administration, supervision, and caretaking. The erection of new, up-to-date, and commodious stores will obviate such unsatisfactory conditions. The site proposed for these stares comprises a portion of the defence area now devoted to the accommodation of the Engineers' and Artillery Depot at Kelvin Grove, and a small area of land adjoining which it is proposed to acquire. The buildings generally will be erected with brick walls, concrete floors, and iron roofs, and will be similar in type, but of smaller direeniions, to the Ordnance Stores buildings now in course of erection at Leichhardt, New South Wales. The buildings and works comprise the following:-Excavatio n of site, Ordnance Stores, Small Arms Ammunition Store, Administration Office building, luncheon room block, lavatory block, Unserviceable Goods Store, Inflammable Goods Store, machinery room, fencing and gates, formation of roads, water supply, storm water drains, electrical installation, lift s , and fire-prevention services.
