2,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (12.31 p.m.)-by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Notice No. 1, private Members' business, given by Mrs Crosio and accorded priority for Monday, 3 March 2003, being presented in her absence by Mr MCClelland. Question agreed to. NA (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS GUARANTEE) BILL 2003 First Reading Bill presented by Mr MCClelland, for Mrs Crosio.",19
3,Mr MCCLELLAND,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"The guarantee of 100 per cent of workers' entitlements in the event of company insolvency is one of the most important reforms yet to be undertaken by an Australian government. Few things are more important to workers who have lost their employment than ensuring they receive the full amount of their pay and legally accrued entitlements. These are often lost when they lose their jobs through the insolvency of their employer. The Employee Protection (Employee Entitlements Guarantee) Bill 2003, which I present to the House today on behalf of the member for Prospect, will secure the full payment of employee entitlementssuch as unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave and redundancy pay-in the case of corporate insolvency. The bill proposes that workers' entitlements be secured through a 0.1 per cent levy on payroll. Once again, as in the similar bill that was presented previously, small businesses will not have to meet this expense. Small businesses will have their entitlement costs covered directly by the federal government under this proposal so they will not be affected by the 0.1 per cent levy. It will not at all be a burden to small businesses. Since the member for Prospect last introduced this bill, the need for an alternative scheme to the Howard government's taxpayer funded GEERS has become even more apparent. Indeed, when former Minister Reith introduced the predecessor to GEERS, he promised it would only be an interim administrative measure while a better solution was found. Three years later, it is clear that orthe Howard government has given up and no such better solution has been found. It was promised almost 18 months ago that the government would rerank employee entitlements ahead of the debts to secured creditorsprimarily, financial institutions-but, again, this has not occurred. Meanwhile, the Howard government's scheme will this year see a bill for $85 million being handed to taxpayers for lost entitlements to employees. Lost entitlements have often been the result of corporate mismanagement or, in certain circumstances, wrongdoing. This will provide comfort to those employers who continue to avoid securing the entitlements of their employees in the appropriate way, only to have those entitlements picked up by the taxpayers of Australia. Earlier this year, Australian taxpayers witnessed Air New Zealand using the Howard government's scheme to justify its refusal to secure its Australian employees' entitlements. That is a common phenomenon, I might add, where corporations and liquidators of corporations dig into the public purse before they pursue a guarantee, for instance. Australian workers and their families are increasingly frustrated at having to go cap in hand to the Howard government under GEERS for their lost entitlements. A recent report by the Auditor-General into the Howard government's scheme painted a sorry picture of incompetence and delay. Despite the Howard government's promise that 80 per cent of entitlements would be resolved within four months, it was found that barely half of the employees obtained their entitlements in that time, with one in five employees being forced to wait more than six months. To add insult to injury, the Howard government will not cover superannuation, will not cover redundancy above eight weeks and will not cover any redundancy pay for the four in 10 Tasmanian workers covered by state awards. While the Howard government appears determined to defend the sacred right of corporate executives and only mouths any interest in reining in exorbitant executive salaries and severance payments, it is leaving Australian workers and their families in desperate situations with the loss of these important entitlements. There is no question that the Howard government's inadequate scheme is not meeting its task and is leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Labor's bill is a positive alternative solution to protecting employee entitlements. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",19
4,The SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Veterans: Gold Card Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (12.37 p.m.)-I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges that medical practices and individual general practitioners are advising veteran patients that they will no longer be able to recognise the gold card when charging them for medical services; (2) acknowledges that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care in view of their service to this country; (3) notes that many practices and practitioners, in particular those with a high percentage of veteran patients, are struggling to provide acceptable levels of medical care and service, given the rebates and fees currently available to them; and (4) calls upon the Government immediately to negotiate with medical practitioners to ensure that an appropriate agreement is in place to enable doctors to provide adequate levels of care to gold card recipients.",20
5,The SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Sidebottom-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. Ms O'BYRNE-Those who have volunteered or have been required to serve our country in armed conflict are very special Australians. They have been prepared to risk their lives and the livelihoods of their own families to defend our land and to protect the rest of us. They have ensured that we have been able to enjoy the democratic and independent lives that Australia provides us with today, and we owe each and every veteran a very special debt. Whilst it is appropriate that we honour them and remember those who have gone before on occasions such as ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, we must recognise that they should also have other rights and other privileges-and these are not tokens. They are practical acknowledgments on a day-today basis that our war veterans and those they have left behind are entitled to some benefits in recognition of their sacrifice and, in the case of many of them, because they have special needs arising from that very sacrifice. Over the last six months, veterans all over Australia have begun to receive notification from their general practitioners and medical practices that they are no longer able to recognise the gold card, that preciously regarded symbol that shows Australians do care about those who have served us in times of conflict. The gold card is more than just an entitlement to be bulk-billed for medical care. To veterans, it is their contract with the rest of the Australian people, the material recognition that we do acknowledge what they have done for us. In some cases, the doctor's advice has been that the change will be effected immediately, whilst, in the majority of cases, it has taken the form of advance notice of future implementation a few weeks or perhaps a few months later. The practical effect of this is that veterans now have to make a contribution to the cost of their basic medical care. They may also be faced with additional cash flow problems by having to pay the full account prior to receiving reimbursement and/or additional paperwork, postage costs et cetera. This is the result of laziness, indifference and a lack of understanding by a miserly government hellbent on looking after the top end of town at the expense of our servicemen and our servicewomen. The question that we are bound to ask now is: how has this come about? The answer is twofold. Firstly, it is clear that this government does not care about the veteran community. It has allowed the worth of the gold card to diminish. It has also taken hours of home care away from veterans and war widows, forcing them to reconsider their independent lifestyles and look at joining already bursting queues for aged care places. I know my colleague the member for Braddon has been approached by many people who have really suffered through this miserly cut. Secondly, this government has not acted fairly or responsibly in dealing with the medical profession on this issue. Three years ago, the government entered into a memorandum of understanding with the medical profession for the provision of medical services to our veterans. Under the arrangement, the doctors agreed to incorporate health care plans, health assessments and medication re-evaluations in return for an increase in the basic fee. They did so in anticipation of a further improvement in fees when the memorandum was renegotiated. The deal meant that doctors would get $29.45 for a standard consultation with a veteran patient. This is $8.60 less than what they get for seeing a pensioner or a health care card holder. Apart from the fact that doctors receive less when seeing a veteran patient, they are also expected to do more. There is more often than not additional paperwork, completion of D904 forms to get access services, authorities et cetera. Under the old arrangement, the Department of Veterans' Affairs used to pay doctors within 12 days or pay interest. Now doctors say that their payment is via a Medicare type reimbursement, usually taking a minimum of six weeks. Doctors say that they remain prepared to subsidise the treatment of veterans to a reasonable degree. They say they have done so willingly for many years. This is done, in effect, by cross subsidy from income from fee paying patients. Three years on from the signing of the memorandum, where do we find ourselves? What has happened is that, after the agreement's expiry date and with no new deal in sight, doctors were given an ultimatum to sign up for an extension of the old deal with no increase in fees. If they did not sign, they receive even less-a fee of just $25.65, almost exactly half the fee which they receive for a normal consultation. The medical profession says that it needs a substantially better deal not only because it has not had an indexed increase over the past three years but because it has also faced greater pressures and costs through medical indemnity, accreditation documentation and the requirements of the Privacy Act. Most importantly, where does this leave our ex-service men and women? First and foremost, it leaves them angry. Rightly or wrongly, they believe that they were promised that they would be looked after. Whether they were or not, I-and I am sure that most other Australians would join with me-feel that they are entitled to have this expectation. Veteran patients tend to attend doctors more often for a variety of reasons, most of them obvious. If the average number of attendances at the doctor per annum is seven, then for a veteran it is 10. For many individuals, of course, it is even more than that. The reality is that many veterans, in anticipation of continuing to receive a fair deal from the government, dropped out of private health cover. They have budgeted for their future lives and retirements accordingly. The majority of veterans are happy with their general practitioners. They feel comfortable that they are seeing a doctor or a practice who knows their personal medical history and their circumstances well. They do not want to change to another doctor. It may be hard for them to even travel to get to another practice. And this is where our next problem arises. The answer given to those veterans who contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs about the advice they have received from their doctor is that they should simply change to a practitioner who will recognise the gold card. A veterans advocate from my electorate has been told on several occasions by the department that it has a list of those practitioners who are continuing to recognise the gold card, yet it refuses to provide him with access to that list. What is the point of having a list if we cannot actually see it? Apart from that, the reality is that most doctors-certainly those where I come from-simply cannot take on any more patients. Whether they be veterans, pensioners or fully privately covered fee payers, the are closed. It is a nonsense to say that the solution is simply to shop around until you can find a doctor who will accept a gold card. What happens six months later when that doctor faces the same pressures already faced by his or her colleagues? It should not be necessary for our servicemen and servicewomen to look further than their preferred doctor of choice. I have been made aware of cases where local practices are so overloaded that veterans have to travel to the next town for their treatment and then they are denied travelling allowance because they apparently could have seen a doctor in their own town. Some practices and practitioners have substantial numbers and percentages of veterans as patients. The impact for them of a government indifferent to their situation and the entitlements of veterans can be extremely significant. I am advised that some 2,500 doctors out of 14,000 have not signed the government's unilateral contract extension. The real question is whether this 2,500 includes many of those who are currently shouldering the heaviest load. I suspect, particularly in regional communities, that that is the case. I am becoming convinced that this government has no concept of how great the discontent amongst veterans and their families is, and how big these problems are becoming for our community. I want to acknowledge, in particular, those medical practitioners who are continuing to recognise the gold card in return for the measly reimbursement they get from this stingy government. They are doing the right and proper thing. It is costing them a bit of money, but they are decent community people who are trying to do the best for the people who they care for and for the people they represent. This government, however, is not. Unless it changes soon, this government's attitude to this issue will devalue the gold card to a level where it is meaningless or worthless. That is the message we are sending to our veteran community-that the services we provide you can be diminished at any time. This ought to be unacceptable to any Australian. I have no doubt that the government's relists sponse is probably going to come out something along the lines of: ‘Oh, well, we cannot afford it.' But, I believe-and, once again, I am sure that this is a feeling held by the majority of Australians, except perhaps the minister responsible-that we cannot afford not to do it. We cannot afford to walk away from these people. For me, some things that are the responsibility of the Commonwealth government are simply non-negotiables. The provision of basic support services to our returned servicemen and servicewomen is one of those things. I ask that the House note these sad developments and implore the government to act to redress the situation without delay. Without action one of the fundamental pillars on which citizenship and the national spirit of this country have been built will be seriously undermined.",20
6,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"I rise to speak on the private members' business today. I do so with the background of having been the minister responsible for veterans for some six years up until the last election. Firstly, I want to say that I take issue with the member who has just spoken when she said that this government does not care about veterans. It is a very cheap political shot and she should know better than to say that this government does not care. I have always taken the position that both sides of the parliament care about the way we look after our veterans. We have always sought to bring a bipartisan debate into this parliament and I have always taken the point that, if anyone wants to use the veteran community as a political football, they stand condemned-not only by this parliament but also by the wider population. I want to acknowledge those doctors out there who do a wonderful job and recognise the service of this very special group of Australians. I have spoken to many of them during my time in this place who see veterans and war widows as very special people. These doctors know that in so many instances they themselves would not be practising in Australia today, in this lucky country in which we all live, had it not been for the service and the sacrifice of our veterans. They are also aware of all of those who have been left behind because of death in war, and those who subsequently returned to Australia with disabilities. I, and so many people, acknowledge the work that doctors do in caring for our veteran community. I think it is important to outline in this bate what the gold card does bring, because it does bring many benefits to our veteran community. It brings the choice of doctor; private patient hospital care in public hospitals and contracted private hospitals; and pharmaceuticals at a concessional rate. To the veterans with this eligibility, it brings optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry care and products, as well as chiropractic services. In 1999, when I was minister, we extended the gold card automatically to our Second World War veterans who were over the age of 70 years who had qualifying service. We did that in recognition that as veterans grow older there is going to be an increasing demand for health services from them. We believed it was important that the Second World War veterans with qualifying service should receive this gold card eligibility. Prior to the last federal election, we announced that we would be making a further automatic extension of the gold card to veterans who have qualifying service from any theatre of conflict to those over the age of 70 years. I am very pleased to see that we have been able to achieve that core commitment that we gave in this parliament to the veteran community. I want to point out that the gold card is not available only through the automatic extension which is granted by government. There are many veterans out there who have received the gold card on the basis of their disabilities or their service and war widows who have received an automatic entitlement. I went looking through the Labor Party's policy prior to the last election to see what they said about the gold card. It is important that we contrast what members from the other side of the House are saying now with what they said prior to the last federal election. We need to look at the scrutiny they get from the electorate and make sure that they remain under scrutiny for what they said in terms of commitments prior to the last federal election. A moment ago I mentioned war widows. Prior to the last federal election, we announced that the government would be extending the gold card to war widows who dehad remarried prior to 1983-in other words, to war widows who remarried and lost their war widow status and therefore their gold card. We acknowledged that as another one of those anomalies we had to address when we came into government. I am pleased to see that those war widows, who had done no more than remarry prior to 1983, are again able to receive the gold card and all the benefits that go with it. I then pursued the matter by looking at what Labor said prior to the last federal election about the automatic extension of the gold card to war widows. I did not find a single mention of war widows in the policy they took to the last federal election-in other words, they did not acknowledge the existence of some 108,000 war widows who were eligible for veterans' entitlements. The members on the other side of the House should acknowledge that not only have we extended the gold card to veterans with qualifying service and those with levels of disability but we have also extended it to those who remarried prior to 1983. When the members on the other side of the House come into this place they should check their own policy prior to the last federal election, rather than try to create a political debate and put at the centre of that debate a vast number of very special people in our community: the veterans and war widows of our nation. I mentioned a moment ago that there are other ways to get a gold card-other than having eligibility extended automatically by legislation. For instance, gold card eligibility is available to those veterans who served in East Timor or Afghanistan. As part of the deployments on those operations, service men and women know that they will be eligible for the gold card upon their return to Australia. I know that the gold card is valued not only by veterans over the age of 70 but also by those deployed into hostile environments, such as the two I mentioned. Not only the service men and women themselves but also their families acknowledge the value of the gold card, which underpins the health care of veterans by covering them for any condition they may suffer as a result of their service, including to East Timor and Afghanistan. I want to touch on some of the initiatives of the federal government since it was elected in 1996. Those initiatives include not only the extension of the gold card but also payments to the service personnel and civilians who were held prisoner by the Japanese during World War II, and to their surviving widows. The veterans who were interned by the Japanese, or their surviving widows, receive from this government a one-off ex gratia payment of $25,000. Once again, this was long overdue but it was achieved by this federal government. Even that very point should demonstrate to the other side of the House that this government does care about veterans, and it will continue to care about how it looks after our veterans. This government will also continue to make sure that it always errs on the side of generosity. I ask the members on the other side of the House to acknowledge what this government has done and to make sure that they do not use the veteran community as a political football in debates in this place. I thank the parliament.",22
7,Ms HALL,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Before starting my speech, I would like to address a couple of points the member for Maranoa made in his speech. Firstly and most importantly, the Labor Party's policy prior to the last election was to ensure that the gold card remained valuable to every veteran in our community. We appreciate how important the gold card is to all veterans through- 60c. out Australia and we know that its strength comes from its acceptance by GPs and specialists. Our policy prior to the last election was to ensure that that continued. The previous speaker also took offence at the criticism by the member for Bass of the Howard government's treatment of veterans. I say to the honourable member that the proof is in the pudding. In this case, the fact that many veterans' doctors have stopped accepting the gold card is proof that the government has failed veterans. The government promised to support veterans and to deliver the care and services that veterans deserve and have earned through their contributions to Australia's safety. Instead of fulfilling this promise to veterans, the Howard government has let a situation develop where many GPs and specialists are no longer accepting the gold card and are charging veterans for basic health care. We on this side of the House say that is not good enough. We say to the Howard government that it should act now and fix this because that is what the Australian community expects and it is what the veterans in our community expect. All Australians know that veterans have higher health care needs. That is one of the effects of war. That is the legacy that protecting Australia has left them. As a country, we should make sure that veterans are taken care of. We now have a situation where the government has failed to negotiate an agreement with doctors-and that is unacceptable. Out of 14,000 GPs, 2,500 are no longer accepting the gold card. That is unacceptable, as is the fact that the agreement ran out on 13 December last year and the government has failed to renegotiate it-and will not even consider renegotiating it until the end of June. The current agreement runs until 31 June and, although a number of doctors have agreed to extend it, a number have also refused to enter into any agreement with the government to extend it, simply because they do not trust the government. Out of those who have not agreed to extend the agreement, quite a few are still accepting the gold card, but they are doing so at a greatly reduced rate-a fee reduced to 85 per cent plus This is not a government that is committed to caring for veterans. If it were, it would have seen that its highest priority was getting a new agreement in place. I attended a forum in the electorate of the member for Bass, and this was the No. 1 issue for veterans there. They were very unhappy with the government. They had been told by the department that there was a list-a list that none of them could manage to get their hands on-that could tell them which doctors were or were not accepting the gold card. Doctors and veterans alike are very unhappy with the government in this area. Veterans do not need inquiries like the one that produced the Clarke report, which actually recommended that the gold card be means tested, something I acknowledge the government has rejected. Veterans do not need inquiries and reports like that, and they do not need procrastination; what they do need is a government that ensures they have the medical support and services they need. They need a government that will immediately negotiate a new agreement with the doctors, thereby ensuring that the value of the gold card is eroded, as it has been, and that our veterans get the medical treatment that Australia expects for them. (Time expired)",24
8,Dr WASHER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"I am delighted that the member for Bass wishes this House to acknowledge that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care, in view of their services to this country. It is a happy occasion when both sides of the House agree. It is precisely because the government does believe firmly that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care that significant improvements have been made to veterans' entitlements since the coalition took office 1996. In the last seven years, this coalition ernment has increased the Veterans' Affairs budget from $6.2 billion to $9.2 billion. The government has introduced a range of initiatives and benefits to compensate veterans for their sacrifices and to commemorate their dedication and bravery. The veteran community in Australia deserves our recognition and support. It deserves a properly funded system that offers appropriate care and compensation, and the coalition government has provided these. By increasing the Veterans' Affairs budget by $3 billion over the past seven years, the coalition government has quite publicly made clear its support for, and commitment to, our veteran community. The gold card remains the mainstay of the repatriation health system. More than a quarter of a million ex-service men and women are gold card holders. These men and women have given selflessly to their country in wars and conflicts, and the gold card represents an assurance that they will have access to medical treatment for all conditions, whether they are related to war service or not. For some time the gold card has been an automatic entitlement for our former prisoners of war, as well as for recipients of totally and permanently incapacitated pensions and for war widows, in recognition of their greater health needs. Since 1996 the federal government has recognised the growing health needs of other veterans as they grow older. In 1999 the government extended the not gold card to Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II. In July last year, the government extended the gold card even further to cover all Australian veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from any conflict. So, as I said earlier, the gold card is the mainstay of the repatriation health system. That is still most definitely the case. The vast majority of doctors throughout Australia are continuing to treat gold card holders. The publicity suggesting that this is not so is at best misleading and at worse alarmist. This misinformation is causing a great deal of unnecessary distress and conin cern among members of the veteran community, who are being misled into believing that govtheir health care is being compromised. This is not the case. Statistics can prove anything. It depends entirely on how you interpret them and what background information you have. The comedian Dave Allen once pointed out that one in 10 motor accidents was caused by drink-driving. He observed that that meant that nine out of 10 motor accidents were caused by sober drivers and asked who, therefore, posed the greater risk. Of course, common sense prevails, and we know that drink-driving on our roads is far more lethal than driving sober. You can turn statistics on their head and make them prove almost anything. It is the same with the publicity surrounding the gold card and the supposed refusal of certain doctors to recognise it. The claim that 2,000 letters that were not responded to represented 2,000 doctors withdrawing from the gold card system is quite untrue. The following are the facts. The structure of fees paid to local medical officers-LMOs-was made under a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the AMA. With the memorandum of understanding due to run out in December last year, the process to negotiate a new agreement began. When it became clear that a new agreement would not be in place by the expiry date of the old agreement, the department sent out 15,000 letters to individual doctors and to practices where doctors had billed the department during the previous 12 months. The letter offered doctors the opportunity to extend their current contracts to 30 June 2003. Doctors were not asked to respond, other than to take up the offer and extend their contracts. The mailing list was not completely up to date. How many mailing lists are? How many members have received an electoral roll update or done a mail-out within the electorate, only to find dozens of letters returned, although the information is allegedly current? So it is with the doctors. Many of these letters would have gone to practices that were no longer open, as some doctors would have died, retired or moved overseas. (Time expired)",25
9,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Contrary to the member for Maranoa's comments earlier that raising issues on veterans' affairs is making a political football out of a very special group of people, I believe that in actual fact it is our responsibility to raise issues related to veterans' affairs. If we believe that the system is not doing the right thing by veterans, then we will raise that issue. It is not a matter of this being a political football; it is a matter of our responsibilities. Unlike my friend the member for Moore, for whom I have the highest regard, I think that there is an ongoing crisis in veterans health concerning the use of the gold card, despite the minister's assurances. It cannot be denied. It is affecting veterans across Australia-particularly in my electorate of Braddon and also, as I know from my colleague at the table, in the electorate of Bass. The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 enables the provision of full health care benefits-which are administered through the Local Medical Officer Scheme-to certain veterans, widows and orphaned children who may qualify under the VEA. The Department of Veterans' Affairs treatment population of gold card holders is currently 334,442 persons. The gold card crisis continues to worsen, as was clearly and publicly played out on our TV screens recently, with 2,000 GPs-no matter how the member for Moore wants to explain the statistics-refusing to respond to the DVA's proposed extension to their agreements to provide services to gold card holders until 30 June 2003. The DVA, along with the government, continues to reassure the Australian public that there is good coverage of GPs who extend services to veterans who hold a gold card; however, if you looked at the latest bulk-billing data, you would find this very difficult to believe. Since the Howard government came to office, bulk-billing has fallen 11 per cent, with a 5.6 per cent fall in the past year alone. As a result of this, many veterans and widows have been forced to travel further, at additional cost, to find a new doctor-particularly rural veterans and widows, who must travel greater distances for specialist services, such as orthopedics. Currently, only 69.6 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed. While the rate of bulkbilling has declined by 11 per cent, the average copayment for someone seeing a GP has increased from $8.32 in 1996 to $12.57 today-an increase of more than 50 per cent. It is a fact that a number of GPs have refused to offer services to veterans who hold a gold card. Increasingly, more GPs state that, unless an acceptable offer is made to them by 30 June 2003, they will also cease to extend services to gold card holders. The reason is simple: they will go broke. Other GPs who have elected not to re-sign their agreements have extended their services to veteran patients at a reduced fee of 85 per cent plus 60c. For the first time it appears that veterans may have to start paying out of their own pockets for their medical care. We now know that about 15 per cent of GPs who have been involved in this scheme to look after veterans free of charge have pulled out of the scheme. The fee has now been set at an unrealistically low level; it has literally not kept up pace of providing medical services. More and more doctors are finding that they are not able to give veterans the care that they need for this unrealistically low fee. Unless this government renegotiates a realistic agreement with doctors, I have concerns that this scheme will fall over. Despite constant denials by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Veterans' Home Care Scheme has been cut. In my electorate of Braddon more than 300 veterans have been affected, with funding cut by one-third. In many cases the services have been reduced by half. I first highlighted these cuts to the home care scheme back in October last year, when my office was inundated with calls from veterans disappointed and angry that they had been notified that their services had been cut. In more recent times, veterans living in the electorate of Bass were sent similar notification. I noticed in today's Examiner that the minister tried to defend the situation of veterans home care services being cut. It did nothing more than act as a red herring. Veterans are having their services cut by stealth, and it is a crisis in terms of the gold card the provision of GP services. To raise this is not political meandering; it is our responsibility as an opposition. I hope that the government responds effectively to this very important and valued group of individuals in our community.",26
10,Mr JOHNSON,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"I am delighted to speak on the motion today, and I compliment the member for Bass for raising an issue that is important in the community. Of course, I very strongly disagree with the opposition that this government is not one that cares strongly about a very important group in our community. In the electorate of Ryan, where I have the great privilege to be the federal member, we have a veteran community of some 3,000 people. I consider it a great privilege to be able to engage and consult with them and discuss issues like this. Before I go on to more substantive matters, I will mention that in my electorate of Ryan the RSL sub-branches-in particular the Sherwood-Indooroopilly RSL subbranch, the Centenary RSL sub-branch, the with the Toowong RSL sub-branch, the KenmoreMoggill RSL sub-branch and The Gap RSL sub-branch-have members with a particular interest in this topic. Indeed, I had the great pleasure of talking with them just in the last week about this very important issue. I am delighted to say to the government and to this House that they are very pleased with the government's position and the department's support of them. The Howard government believes very strongly, of course, that the veteran community of this country deserves the nation's applause and the government's full and generous support. The gold card remains very strongly the mainstay of our care for them, and it remains the mainstay of the repatriation health system. The gold card is held by some 300,000 men and women who make up a very special group of our community, as all of us in this chamber would agree. For some time the gold card has been an automatic entitlement for our former prisoners of war, for our totally and permanently incapacitated pension recipients and for our war widows in recognition of their greater health needs. I mentioned war widows, and it is interesting to and note that, in the former opposition leader's plans for the veterans in our community, there was no reference whatsoever to war widows. That is an astonishing point and, indeed, a glaring error on the opposition's part. Since 1996 the Howard government has recognised very strongly the growing health care needs of our veterans. In 1999 the government extended the gold card to Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II. In July 2002 the Howard government extended the gold card further, to cover all Australian veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from any conflict. The gold card represents an assurance that Australian veterans and war widows will have access to treatment for all conditions, whether or not they are related to war service. Nothing has changed, contrary to the provocative language of the opposition. The overwhelming majority of doctors are continuing to treat gold card holders, and I encourage that small group of doctors who are not doing so to engage in care for our veterans-to respect and salute their contribution to our nation. There is a handful who have declined to do this, but this is a small minority. The overwhelming majority of doctors do this, and they do this in my electorate as well. They are very strongly supportive of the veterans in our community. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has received some complaints from a relatively small number of veterans that doctors have refused to accept the gold card. It is important to put this in perspective; it is important to get the context right. It is only a small group. In those cases, the department is ensuring that the veterans are getting the care they need and that I know all members of this parliament acknowledge they need. The publicity that has been generated around this issue is highly irresponsible and highly provocative. It is not the way to address this issue. There are better ways of doing it, and I think it is important not to cause unnecessary alarm or stress to an important part of our community. I want to reassure the veterans of our community and the veterans in my electorate of Ryan that this government has the utmost respect and compassion for them. That goes particularly to war widows, an area that has been ignored by the opposition. It is very important that they are fully aware that this government has them at the top of the list in terms of their care in this community. Gold card holders have access to a range of health care, including community nursing, allied health, dental, podiatry and other services. The area of services they have access to is not restricted, and this government's support for them is very strong indeed.",27
11,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Hancock, Mr Lang",28
12,Mr SCHULTZ,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"I move: That, this year being the 50th anniversary of an historic event which led to the early development of the giant Pilbara iron ore discovery in Western Australia, this House: (1) calls on the Government to recognise the memorable flight on 22 November 1952, when Lang Hancock observed vast iron ore deposits in The Pilbara whilst flying in adverse weather accompanied by his wife Hope; (2) acknowledges the significant personal contribution Lang Hancock made in difficult circumstances in developing the mineral potential of this incredibly rich province-The Pilbara; and (3) pays tribute to this great Australian pioneer, who against all odds proved that if you have the vision you can achieve the impossible against seemingly insurmountable odds. Today I rise to call on the government to recognise the contribution of an Australian pioneer, Lang Hancock, who on a memorable flight on 22 November 1952-accompanied by his wife Hope-observed vast iron ore deposits in the Pilbara. This great country of Australia owes Lang Hancock's memory so much. Western Australian geologist W.P. Woodward first noted the potential of the Pilbara iron ore reserves in a report in 1890. This report said: This is essentially an iron ore country. There is enough iron ore to supply the whole world, should the present sources be worked out. This report was ignored. In the 1930s there were doubts raised that Australia's resources were adequate for future iron and steel making. To conserve available known resources for Australian domestic consumption, the Commonwealth embargoed all exports in 1938. This ban remained in place until 1961. On 22 November 1952 Lang Hancock and his wife, Hope, were in a small aircraft-an Auster-over the Hamersley Ranges when they were caught in a storm. As Lang watched the storm clouds closing in behind him and realised that he could not fly out of the building squall, he decided to duck below it and was forced to follow the gorges to get out of this life-threatening situation. Lang Hancock knew his country, but the metalliferous bands that were layered in the gorge and highlighted by the wet from the storm intrigued him. The memory of those deposits stayed in his mind until he returned some months later to seek samples. Lang Hancock returned to sample the iron ore deposits, landing his small plane in the spinifex and taking samples in the hot sun over 50 to 60 miles. Those samples were tested and found to be of a high grade. In fact, the analysis showed that they were two per cent higher in iron than the ore being used in the blast furnaces in the USA. It was obvious to Lang Hancock that the area of the deposits was extensive. For this tough boy from the bush, this self-educated Australian, this was the beginning of a 10-year battle with governments to convince them that their iron ore embargo was based on a false premise. Lang Hancock persisted with endless discussions and presented his belief in the vastness of his iron ore discovery in a straight, no frills way to governments for more than eight years. Many a gloomy predication said that Australia had minimal iron ore reserves, but Lang Hancock hung onto his belief that Australia could supply the rest of the world. While Lang Hancock battled bureaucracy, other discoveries were made, including the Mount Whaleback deposit in 1957, which is estimated to have current reserves of nearly 1.5 million tonnes of high-grade iron ore. Lang Hancock said: Well people knowing this throughout the world, people interested in iron ore, knew that there was no iron ore in Australia, and here was I, a boy from the bush, no experience, no education, no letters after my name or anything, to tell them. I'd found by far the world's largest iron ore deposits, a whole field actually, and you know, 30 or 40 firms throughout the world said, ‘Run away, it's a lot of rubbish.' Lang continued: Unbeknown to me, they rang up what was then known as the Bureau of Mineral Resources in Canberra and Dr Argot, the head of it, said, ‘Hancock's talking through his hat, we've done a magnetometer survey of all that area and there is nothing there.' So then they came back to me and I said, ‘Well look if there is nothing there me a royalty-if there is nothing there it doesn't cost you anything.' Over and over again it was the same old story for Lang-the endless myth about Australian iron ore-and for almost a decade there was no progress, despite Lang's dedication and determination. Finally, Lang won his day with the lifting of the iron ore ban and this coincided with the phenomenal growth of the Japanese steel industry, which provided the catalyst for a massive growth in the development of the Pilbara's resources. Lang Hancock never stopped selling the idea that the Pilbara had massive amounts of quality iron ore. Rio Tinto, in Lang's words, ‘kept dithering so I found out that the power lay with a chap named Duncan in England and I set out to persuade him'. An agreement was reached and this agreement became the foundation for what is now Hamersley Iron and had much to do with the subsequent merger of Rio Tinto and Consolidated Zinc into what is now CRA of Australia. James R. Barber of Kaiser Steel USA, in a letter dated 22 December 1996, said: Lang Hancock personally discovered large quantities of iron ore in the Hamersleys as early as 1952, prior to the lifting of the embargo. He collected samples and had them analyzed. He knew he had made major finds, which could alter the world's pattern of iron ore supply. From the start he had the vision, the comprehension and the faith that was required to set the stage for the development of these resources on a scale commensurate with their value. He thought in world terms, rather than just national. It is this early comprehension of the order of magnitude of the scene yet to unfold that set him apart. Lang Hancock encouraged participation by that overseas firms such as Kaiser Steel. Lang took Tom Price in hand when Tom Price went to examine ore deposits. Lang flew him about showing him the ore and always talking-talking about the potential of the Pilbara. Without the strength and enthusiasm of Lang Hancock there would be no Hamersley Iron. Lang's logbook records that he spent over 7,000 hours-the best part of a year-airborne, at the controls of a single-engine or you pay twin-engine aeroplane. He developed the technique of finding minerals from the air and became Australia's first aerial prospector and its most successful. There were no aircraft maintenance mechanics or facilities in the remote Pilbara so Lang built his own workshops and obtained the qualifications to service and maintain the aircraft he purchased. This gives you an indication of the personal resource and commitment of Lang Hancock, a fine Australian. Without the personal inner steel that made up the character of this hands-on practical individual, Australia's reputation as the world's largest producer of high-grade iron ore would not exist. The out of touch bureaucrats who had complete control of the inept political decision makers of the fifties era would have set back the development of the Pilbara iron ore deposits for decades had it not been for the no-nonsense common sense commitment of this magnificent Australian, Lang Hancock. I want to reiterate the terms of the motion that I moved-and would have liked to have talked on-last year, which was the 50th anniversary of this great development. I said this: That, this year being the 50th anniversary of an historic event which led to the early development of the giant Pilbara iron ore discovery in Western Australia, this House: (1) calls on the Government to recognise the memorable flight on 22 November 1952, when Lang Hancock observed vast iron ore deposits in The Pilbara whilst flying in adverse weather accompanied by his wife Hope; (2) acknowledges the significant personal contribution Lang Hancock made in difficult circumstances in developing the mineral potential of this incredibly rich province-the Pilbara; and (3) pays tribute to this great Australian neer, who against all odds proved that if the vision you can achieve the impossible against seemingly insurmountable odds. I think that adequately sums up the character, the strength and the vision of Lang Hancock, one of Australia's great pioneers. As I said from the outset, this government and this House should recognise the significant contribution Lang Hancock made to this nation's wealth and the significant contribution he made to the iron ore industry.",28
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,Is the motion seconded? Mr Haase-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
14,Mr FITZGIBBON,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Australia is blessed with extensive mineral deposits. The minerals industry makes an enormous contribution to the Australian economy and is a key economic driver in rural and regional Australia. Accounting for around 8.6 per cent of GDP, the minerals industry is responsible for around $42 billion in export revenues for this country. In Australia we enjoy an enormous comparative advantage in the minerals sector. In this country we have an abundance of relatively easily won deposits, a skilled and efficient work force and a significant absence of sovereign risk issues. It is ironic that I come to the House for this debate straight from a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources. That committee is currently holding an inquiry into the declining investment in the minerals and resources exploration sector in this country. In the beginning at least, raising capital for exploration was not an issue for Lang Hancock. It is well recorded-and I heard the member for Hume make reference to itthat at the age of 43 Lang Hancock visually discovered iron ore deposits which brought him so much of the wealth which has been recorded next to his name. At that timeagain, I think the member for Hume indicated this-he was forced to fly low into the Turner River valley where he visually discovered what he thought were deposits of iron ore. The year was 1952 and the iron ore he discovered was not only abundant but, at pio- the time, the world's best quality. In other you have words, Lang Hancock had hit a jackpot. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Hume where he outlined some of the difficulties Lang Hancock had in bringing his dream to fruition. I note that in a letter written on behalf of the American based company, Kaiser Steel, James Barber acknowledged Lang Hancock's contribution to Australia's mining industry. I also note that Mr Barber described Lang as ‘a most unusual and forceful man'. I see that the member for Hume is acknowledging my point. No-one would disagree that Lang Hancock made a significant contribution to the growth of the mineral sector in this country, and no-one would disagree that he made a significant contribution, albeit sometimes controversially, to the development of the Pilbara region. I began by talking about some of the benefits mining brings to Australia. But, of course, it also brings challenges, as Lang Hancock discovered all those years ago. In my own electorate, consolidation and rationalisation in the coal mining industry are bringing about many mine closures and job losses. The two most recent closures in the Upper Hunter were the Nardell mine and the Cumnock mine. The Cumnock mine closure was basically a result of the rationalisation spoke about, but a much greater question mark hangs over the explanation for the closure of the Nardell mine. What I do know is that a mine that was hailed as having a great future only a few years ago-something like 40 years of production-is now closed, causing extensive job losses. I think about 40 people at the mine were working on a contract basis and many more were working full time. The big issues relating to this closure are not only the job losses but the significant number of people who have been caught out as unsecured creditors as a result of the decithe sion to bring the receivers into that mine. I understand, for example, that Bulga Civic Constructions proprietor, Gerry Feeney, had a $55,000 cheque in his hand on Thursday morning for work his company had completed at the Nardell mine only to have that cheque dishonoured by the bank.",30
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,I expect the member for Hunter is going to tie this back to the motion before the House.,31
16,Mr FITZGIBBON,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"I am calling upon Macquarie Bank, the major shareholder in the company that runs the mine, to give some explanation to not only those who worked at the mine but those who have been affected by the mine closure as to what went wrong at Nardell and what plans it has to make good its commitments both to the employees and to those who did work for it. (Time expired)",31
17,Mr HAASE,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"It gives me a great deal of personal satisfaction to rise today to speak to this motion. Many in this House may raise their eyebrows as to why this particular private member's motion was brought on by my colleague the member for Hume. It is, of course, because he has an association through family with the Hancock family. Mine was a different association. Apart from the fact that I am today the federal member for Kalgoorlie, some many years ago-in the early 1970s-I had occasion to be called on to deliver a speech in relation to famous Australians. As a Western Australian, in my mind there were many outstanding Western Australians but, as a person who had a great love for the Pilbara, there were few in my estimation who had made a I greater contribution than the rogue bull Lang Hancock. I have had an association over a number of years with his daughter. She was an administration officer and public relations officer for her father in those early years of the development of the iron ore industry. Lang Hancock was famous for many things, but amongst them was his leadership of the Western Australian secessionist movement. It was in that role that I had an association with his daughter, Gina. She was very active in promoting that organisation. I reflect on fact that that outstanding black and yellow sign on the Stirling Highway that proclaimed the headquarters of the Western Australian secessionist movement was routinely destroyed, and I used to think to myself as I drove past it: how tenacious would you have to be to keep replacing that sign month after month? But ‘tenacious' is a word that ideally described the life of Lang Hancock. From his earliest beginnings he was a tenacious character-you needed to be to survive in that country-but, having those 50 years ago discovered solid evidence of the existence of huge deposits of high-quality iron ore, the tenacity that he had to display to bring that resource into a marketable condition was absolutely enormous. He overcame state resistance, he overcame Commonwealth resistance and he overcame international resistance. Today, the Pilbara is famous for its iron ore exports. The competition between iron ore and gold in Western Australia is ongoing as to which has the highest export value per annum. All Australians know of the fame of Western Australia and, specifically, of the Golden Mine and the value and volume of gold it produces. Iron ore in the Pilbara predominantly comes from the area around Tom Price and Paraburdoo, and now Pannawonica and Mount Newman in area C. Earlier, it came from Goldsworthy. We have huge volumes of iron ore, and it would be foolish for suggest to you that the discovery of iron ore there meant that they were recent acquisitions. Iron ore has been there for millions and millions of years. But what has transpired in the last 50 years with the conversion of that huge historic resource is that has created a level of wealth in Western Australia that in the past was undreamed of. personally put that creation of wealth and the transformation of Western Australia squarely at the feet of one Lang Hancock. Because of that, I believe Lang needs our undying respect. Regardless of some of the glitches in his career and some of the outcomes of the development of various mineral resources in the Wittenoom region of Western Australia, he is still, in my opinion, an outstanding Australian and an absolutely superb model of what ought to happen in the resource industry today in Western Australia. I applaud what he has done. (Time expired)",31
18,Mr EDWARDS,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Cowan) (1.37 p.m.)Lang Hancock was an original and unique Australian with an unusual and complex character. He had the view that the development of the Pilbara and its resources would develop the wealth of the great state of Westand ern Australia-a wealth that would benefit all Australians. It interesting to note that Lang Hancock had the view that all Australians should share the wealth he wanted to create. Many would say that it is unfortunate that, in recent times, lawyers have come to share a disproportionate amount of that wealth. I think that is a bit sad. Lang Hancock became convinced that there were plentiful reserves of high-grade iron ore at a time when state and federal governments and their advisers believed that the reserves were limited. It was not an easy task for Lang Hancock to convince them otherwise. He was a very energetic person, and he tried energetically to convince governments and their advisers of the extent of the reserves. As that happened, he extended his targets of persuasion to what were, without doubt, the biggest mining companies in the world and to the Japanese, who were then an incredibly important market for Australia. Lang Hancock was responsible for the expedited timetable by which the reserves were me to developed. He developed those reserves much more quickly than they would ever have been developed otherwise. The other interesting thing about Lang Hancock is that, after the iron ore industry was established, he set out to create more it markets for Australia. He travelled to eastern Europe when the immediate aftermath of the I Cold War made such an approach unusual, to say the least, but he was prepared to do that because, as I said, he was an unusual character. I know, from some of the stuff I have read and some of the people I have spoken to, that Lang Hancock wanted to develop a mine himself but never did so. Some would argue that he did not have the discipline or the capacity to do that, but I think he was like a lot of other prospectors who were content to find the resource and then let others develop it. That is certainly what happened in relation to Lang Hancock. Coming from a small state like Western Australia and from a small city, Lang Hancock had legions of detractors, and not just in bureaucracies and governments in state and federal circles. A man cannot have the sorts of extreme views that he often expressed, he cannot have the sort of push that often upsets the bureaucracy, without creating some detractors. He had plenty. I think one of the greatest detractors he had was Sir Charles Court, who was once Premier of Western Australia. Lang Hancock had the view that Sir Charles Court resented the things he had achieved as an uneducated boy from the bush. He certainly had the view that Sir Charles Court was jealous of all that he had achieved. But, in the end, I think Lang Hancock is best remembered as a small reflection of the difference that makes the Australian character so interesting and achieving.",32
19,Mr RANDALL,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Canning) (1.41 p.m.)It is my privilege today to speak on this motion, which celebrates 50 years of the development of the Pilbara and, more particularly, the contribution made by Lang Hancock through his discovery of that magnificent iron ore deposit. We have heard ad infinitum that Lang, on that fateful day in November 1952, in order to get away from an oncoming storm sent his plane through a gorge and saw the-largely rusting-iron walls of that gorge. I have a particular interest in because I am a Western Australian and not just because I am an admirer of Lang Hancock's achievements. I began my teaching life in the Pilbara, in the small town of Wickham, which is associated with the production and ongoing refinement of iron ore from the area. I say at the outset that the bara would probably not have been the Pilbara we know today without Lang Hancock. The growth of the Pilbara has largely been because of Lang Hancock's vision and foresight to pursue his challenge and demonstrate the perspicacity needed to see a discovery through to production. It is that sort of person who makes a great Australian. It is Lang Hancock, a great Australian, whom we celebrate today. I must correct something the member for Cowan unfortunately dragged into this debate. If it had not been for then mines minister Sir Charles Court, who actually helped cut through the bureaucracy to bring forward the productionMr Edwards-That is Lang Hancock's own view!",33
20,The SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,The member for Cowan knows the standing orders.,33
21,Mr RANDALL,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"a mines minister with foresight-then the production of the Hamersley iron deposit would not be what it is today. It was not just one person who was responsible for the Pilbara iron ore discovery and production; we know that Peter Wright, Lang Hancock's partner, was also integral to the production of iron ore in the Pilbara. It is important to note that the vision of people like Lang Hancock has benefited many people. In this case, not only has his vision provided jobs in the Pilbara and royalties to Western Australia-royalties that have flowed through to the federal governmentbut also he has contributed to the general health and well-being of this country. His family is very proud of him. His daughter, Gina, and his grandchildren are very proud of him. I would, like the member for Hume, also like to acknowledge his first wife, Hope Hancock, who, as a station owner in pretty austere conditions in the outback of Western Australia, helped develop this resource in this not just conjunction with Lang.",33
22,The SPEAKER,EMPLOYEE PROTECTION,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 106A. The debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Canning will have Pil- leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Veterans: Entitlements",33
23,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak about the Clarke review into veterans' entitlements and in particular about chapter 16 and recommendation No. 45. It was extremely pleasing to read the following: The committee recommends that: participation by Australian Defence Force personnel in the British atomic tests be declared non-warlike hazardous and that the legislation be amended to ensure that this declaration can have effect in extending VEA coverage. This is the eighth time. I have raised in this place the issue of the victims of atomic tests and their search for just treatment. Finally it seems that somebody has listened. At present, each new illness suffered by an atomic test victim has to be linked to the tests with a new round of doctors visits, specialists visits, paperwork and stress and drama. If this recommendation is adopted, these victims will be entitled to a gold card and will get the medical treatment they need when they need it without the anguish and stress induced by the former procedures. These soldiers, sailors and airmen were used as human guineapigs. Everybody knows that, just as everybody knows that the reason these men and women have medical problems is that they were needlessly exposed to radiation from the atomic blasts. The Clarke review has recommended that we acknowledge their service and treat them with dignity and justice. It is now imperative that the government act quickly on this recommendation. I call on the minister to provide the victims of this terrible chapter history the justice they deserve. (Time expired) Queensland Government: Budget",33
24,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Petrie) (1.47 p.m.)Last week the Queensland Labor government released their mid-year fiscal and economic review. The prediction was for a budget deficit of $741 million-the third consecutive deficit despite record increases in stamp duty, employment and economic growth. In the area of finance, the Beattie government make a mockery of their ‘smart state' agenda. Funding is cut to a range of services. In my electorate, the state Labor member for Stafford, Terry Sullivan, is promoting a residential development that is estimated to raise in excess of $5 million for the state government coffers, despite strong public opposition. This bushland site is pivotal to the going preservation of the Mountains to Mangroves corridor, an environmental link across Brisbane that received Federation funding from my electorate and from the electorate of Lilley. But the Queensland government see its value in dollar signs to offset their own financial failure. They have cut funding to public housing by over $600,000. Hospital waiting lists keep growing and even the Queensland Teachers Union is publicly berating Mr Beattie for his failure to invest in education. We have increased funding for public housing, hospitals and education; they build footbridges and a stadium that cost millions. But there are families without homes, the sick are on ever-increasing waiting lists and Queensland kids are in crowded classrooms. Vocational Education and Training",34
25,Mr SAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"For too long, vocational education has been undervalued by too many in this country. That has certainly been the case since comprehensive high schools became the norm over two decades ago. However, it is worrying indeed that some influential parts of the VET sector believe in a framework of integration, synthesis and resources rather than one of diversity, analysis and purpose. Perhaps that goes some way to explaining why there continues to be a negative percepin Australia's tion of the VET sector. Integration appears to be a favoured theme amongst some VET bureaucrats. However, it is worth noting that, when you integrate, you look back to the past and to what was; by contrast, if the theme is diversification, you examine what is and look forward to what can be. Certainly that is a subtle but important distinction. Observations of VET in Australian schools do appear to reflect the theme of integration, but they also lack an identifiable structure. That is probably inevitable if you follow a framework headed by integration and a process of synthesis rather than analysis, and if you place emphasis on resources over rationale. Why be so pedantic? If the VET framework is wrong, so will be the delivery. The result of that is diminishment and on- waste of available resources in the VET sector, which must inevitably lead to an inferior return for the taxpayers' dollar, which I would have thought was not in the national interest and particularly not in the interest of the VET sector itself. New South Wales: Emergency Services",34
26,Mr BAIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to make the House aware of a disturbing incident concerning the New South Wales emergency services and the way they treat those who report serious incidents. Mr Gareth Redshaw, a constituent of mine from Caringbah, was a passenger on the ill-fated train that derailed in Waterfall on the morning of Friday, 31 January. Mr Redshaw survived the carnage, from which he managed to free himself and call 000 emergency from his mobile phone. The record shows that he was put through to the ambulance services. The result was as follows. The first phone call simply dropped out when he was midway through the reporting. When he got through the second time, he was accused of making a hoax call. They said, ‘We know who you are. You're the guy who rings from Queanbeyan.' They did not believe him. Call No. 3 was to his parents. He asked them to make a call to the emergency services to advise them that this major drama had occurred. Call No. 4 also went through, and he again was accused of making a hoax call. The first call, which had been put through to the ambulance services, went through to Wollongong. The fourth call went through to the Sydney bureau of the ambulance services. Discussions have been held since that time to try to sort out what problem was and why they simply accused Mr Redshaw of making a hoax call. (Time expired)",34
27,Ms GRIERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to inform the House that the citizens of Newcastle and the Hunter have used the democratic processes available to them to speak out against Australia's involvement in a war in Iraq. Twenty-thousand citizens demonstrated their feelings at a peaceful but intense rally in Newcastle on 15 February. I will be presenting on their behalf 1,000 postcards they have sent to me expressing their opposition to war and their demand for peaceful solutions to the current crisis. Today I have lodged a petition, on behalf of other citizens of Newcastle and the region, with over 2,000 signatures also opposing war. Citizens of Newcastle and the Hunter do expect that their voices will be listened to and heeded by the Prime Minister on this important issue, which is vital to our international reputation and our national security. Corriedale Sheep: Book Launch",35
28,Mr SECKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I had the pleasure yesterday of launching a book about the Corriedale breed. The book was called A sheep for all seasons. Interestingly enough, the launch was at Coola Station, just out of Mount Gambier in my electorate. I was very pleased to launch this book by Andrew Nicholson, who is a long-term breeder of Corriedales in Australia. In fact, my family has been breeding Corriedales for 70 years. The pleasing part about it is that the Corriedale breed is still going 130 years after it began and is now the second largest breed worldwide. It has obviously been a very good breed of sheep that has suited many conditions over the world. It was with great pleasure that yesterday I launched this book about the Corriedale breed, its history and many of the characters involved in it. About 120 people connected with the Corriedale breed were mentioned in this book. It certainly has been a great pleasure for me and my family to be involved in the history of a the great sheep breed that originated here in Australia. Williams, Mrs Margaret Evelyn",35

30,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I spoke about a great Australian earlier this afternoon, and I now wish to speak about another great Australian in a different way. Don Fraser, a gentleman from Lathlain in Western Australia, passed away on Saturday after suffering a long illness, lymphoma cancer. Don fought this ferocious cancer for a number of years. He tried every treatment possible. A few weeks ago he was offered a radical new cancer treatment. He declined it because, as he told his wife, ‘I knew in the end it was going to get me, but I didn't think it would get me this quickly.' I pay tribute to Don. I first met Don while I was involved in the racing industry as a horse trainer. Don belonged to the trainers association of Western Australia. Don did everything meticulously and in a dedicated fashion. I know that the racing industry, in particular, will be saddened by his passing, as will his family. I pay tribute to his wife, Shirley, and the rest of family. Don was an integral member and supporter of the Liberal Party, the Swan division. His assiduous help was also appreciated by the division, and I celebrate his life. (Time expired) Plea for Peace",35
31,Ms CORCORAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Isaacs) (1.56 p.m.)Late last year I received a phone call from the young ladies of year 10B at Mentone Girls Secondary College. They were concerned about the talk of war. They wanted to send a message to the Prime Minister and wanted to know if I would be prepared to deliver it. Of course, I was very happy to do so, although I did not then quite understand the logistical challenge it would be. The message was very clear, very colourful and very serious. The girls had made 1,000 paper cranes and hung them from a large circular hoop. The cranes were all different colours and the whole thing was spectacular. The point, though, was to send a very important message. The message was that these cranes represented a hope and a plea for peace. I delivered this message to the Prime Minister on the last sitting day of parliament last year. The idea for the 1,000 cranes came from the story of Sadako. Sadako was a young girl living in Hiroshima in 1945 when the atom bomb was dropped. She and her family survived but, some years later, at the age of 12, Sadako developed the ‘atom bomb disease', known as leukaemia. Sadako's friends reminded her of the old Japanese legend that, if she folded 1,000 paper cranes, the gods might grant Sadako her wish. Her wish was to live. The 1,000 cranes were folded, but unfortunately Sadako did not get her wish. However, her story lives on. The students at Mentone told me that folding a crane is like making peace-some of the steps are awkward, at first it might seem impossible, and there is definitely more than one route. I pay tribute to these young women for their thoughtfulness and for their creativity. I hope the Prime Minister has heard their message. (Time expired) Frankston North: MCDonald's MCCafe",36
32,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Dunkley) (1.57 p.m.)his Like all things truly worthwhile, you cannot just hope for them to happen-you have to do something. In keeping with that spirit, I would like to congratulate MCDonald's on promoting the growth of its Frankston North store. I had the great pleasure of opening the MCCafe there last week. The MCCafe is a Melbourne invention-Swanson Street, Melbourne was the first one in 1993. They have since spread out and there are now 95 venues across Australia. The MCCafe at Frankston North is particularly close to my heart. It will employ 16 additional staff members who will be specially trained in service skills and commitment to excellence-a great start for their working life, and MCDonald's will be investing in them. There is also an extended product range, and foccacias are to be introduced in March. This investment of about $650,000 provides a new meeting place for local businesses, particularly those north of Frankston and for the Frankston North community in general. To make the best use of this as a meeting place for businesses, we need to get the Scoresby Freeway going. The MCCafea place where people can come and transact business-is another thing that underlines the need for the Scoresby Freeway. Just as we have exported the MCCafe idea around Australia and beyond, I would like to see the vacant industrial land north of Frankston able to send goods and services around Australia. The MCCafe is a great initiative by MCDonald's in Frankston North. Let us get on with the Scoresby Freeway and let us get the Rutherford ramps constructed, and we will have a full house at MCDonald's Frankston North. (Time expired) Iraq",36
33,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Friday, I received an email from a constituent and it read: Dear Mr Murphy, Could you please convey my strongest objections to war with Iraq. I do not support it even with a UN sanction. This is not our war; it is a war for US and Israeli interests. am extremely alarmed of the legacy this government will leave my young son. I would be grateful if you could convey this message in parliament when you have an opportunity. Yours sincerely … The constituent did not want to be named. Like many people who marched in Sydney a couple of weeks ago against the potential war in Iraq, this constituent reflects the way my electorate feels about this issue. I believe that it was closer to 500,000 people who marched in Sydney, not 250,000 as was reported widely in the media.",36

36,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Indulgence is granted.,37
37,Mr HOWARD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As many honourable members will know, Ian Henderson, a very well liked and respected member of the gallery-and, from recollection, a former Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party-was taken very seriously ill on Friday. I wanted to say on behalf of government members-and I know on everybody's behalf-that our thoughts are particularly with his parents and his girlfriend, Fiona Hamilton. He is very ill. We wish him well and hope for a recovery.",37
38,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I presume the Leader of the Opposition would like to respond, and I grant him indulgence to do so.",37
39,Mr CREAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I join with the Prime Minister under indulgence in expressing our wishes for a speedy recovery to Ian. Ian not only served in the gallery-both for the Australian and the ABC; originally when he left the Labor Party I think he went to the Canberra Times as well-but also was Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party as well as being on the staff of the former leader of the Labor Party Bill Hayden in the I period 1980 to 1983. Our thoughts go to his family-his parents in particular-and his partner, Fiona Hamilton. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and them in this very difficult time. We wish him well-a colleague and a friend. NA Economy: Current Account Deficit",37
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I ask him if he recalls promising just before he became Prime Minister seven years ago that ‘we will follow policies which will ... bring down the foreign debt ... Our first priority ... will be to tackle the current account deficit'. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that today's figures prove that the foreign debt, at $354 billion, and the current account deficit, at $11.5 billion, are both at the highest levels ever recorded? Why isn't seven years enough for you to fulfil your promise to bring down foreign debt or to achieve your first priority of tackling the current account deficit?",37
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for reminding me and reminding the House that today is the seventh anniversary of the election of the government. It gives me an opportunity to say something of what this government have achieved. I will take advantage of the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition has afforded to me. I would have said something to that effect about the current account. I have not looked at the exact words, but of course I would have. I would have also said something about reducing unemployment. I am proud to say to the House that in the time that we have been in government we have generated 1.3 million more jobs in the Australian economy. I think also I would have said something about interest rates. You do not hear a lot about interest rates from the Australian Labor Party. I am very proud to say that in the time that we have been in government we have reduced the average monthly repayment on a housing loan in this country by a figure of between $300 and $400 a month-a remarkable achievement. Whereas when Labor were in office, including the Leader of the Opposition, the then government used to boast about how they had reduced the real wages of Australian workers, I am very proud to say that in the seven years that we have been in government we have presided over a significant increase in the real wages and the disposable income of Australian workers. The workers' party opposite boasted about cutting the wages of workers. I am proud to report that we have boosted the wages of workers in the time that I have been in office. The Leader of the Opposition also invites me to say something about debt. I am very proud to remind the Australian Labor Party, to remind the House and, particularly, to remind the Leader of the Opposition that by the end of this financial year the net federal government debt to GDP will be three per cent. That compares with an average of about 49 per cent for all the countries of OECD, 47 per cent for the United States and 79 per cent for Japan. The strength of the Australian economy now is more evident, more real, more broadly based, more widespread and more internationally recognised than at any time since the late 1960s. Also take into account symbolically that we have recovered our AAA credit rating. When did we lose that? We lost that at the time of the then described banana republic, in the words of the former Treasurer and fellow Prime Minister Mr Keating. I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for reminding me of some of the things that I said before I came Prime Minister. National Security: Terrorism",37
42,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of the significance of the recent arrest in Pakistan of senior al-Qaeda figure Khalid Shaikh Mohammed?,38
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Boothby for his question. The arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is a major breakthrough in the war against terrorism. He is regarded as having been the real mastermind behind the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001. He is the No. 3 man in al-Qaeda. It is a major victory in the global campaign, and it does strike at the heart of al-Qaeda's global network, including in our own region. Khalid is a killer and a dispatcher of killers who spent his life planning the murder of innocents throughout the world. Not only is he regarded as the technical mastermind of the attacks on America on 11 September 2001 but he is also under US indictment for a conspiracy plot based in the Philippines to bomb airliners in South-East Asia in 1995. He is also reported to be involved in the brutal murder of the Wall St Journal's Daniel Pearl, the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa and the attack on the US Cole. He is known to have many links in South-East Asia terrorist networks, including that of Jemaah Islamiah. He is said to be linked to two al-Qaeda operatives, one currently in the United States and the other in the Philippines' detention, who were behind a 2001 JI plot to bomb Australian and other the Western embassies in Singapore. His detention is a major advance in our goal of unravelling terrorist networks and, potentially, preventing further operations. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the agencies of the United States and the agencies of Pakistan for their very effective work in bringing about the arrest of this person. Particularly may I pay tribute to the stoic, determined and courageous fight of Pakistan and its leader, General Musharraf, against international terrorism. I do not think there is a world leader who has put more on the line in the fight against world terrorism, bein many respects, than General Musharraf. I regard his personal courage and leadership on this issue as having been quite outstanding. He and the people of Pakistan deserve the respect and the admiration of the world not only for what they have done in relation to this recent arrest but also for the great determination and leadership they have displayed against considerable odds and in the face of considerable domestic opposition and difficulty in the war against terrorism. Economy: Current Account Deficit",38
44,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm that, just before he became Treasurer seven years ago, he said ‘the government has ... produced the highest current account deficit ever, which is a total failure of economic policy. That's my analysis'?Treasurer, now that the current account deficit is at the highest level everMr Bartlett-What per cent of GDP?",38
45,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Six per cent, just like the banana republic.",39
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fraser is not assisting the chair.,39
47,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Treasurer, now that the current account deficit is at the highest level ever and you have just achieved the biggest quarterly increase on record in the current account deficit, why shouldn't the Australian people conclude that, by your own analysis, you are responsible for a total failure of economic policy?",39
48,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,39
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before I recognise the Treasurer, I would point out to the member for Fraser that the use of the word ‘you' was of course inappropriate, as indeed it was in the Leader of the Opposition's earlier question.",39
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do want to say something about today's balance of payments figures. Before the December quarter, imports were seven per cent higher, led principally by a strong increase in capital goods-in particular, a large rise in civil aircraft imports, which is the re-equipping of the Qantas fleet. Because it is a capital investment, one would expect over time that it will work out in additional profits for the company concerned. In the same quarter, export volumes were flat but were led down by rural exports falling by 3.3 per cent, as one would expect in the worse drought in 100 years in Australia. As I previously said, with the drought being the worse in 100 years, not only would the rural exports be down in the December quarter but I would expect that the drought will flow into rural exports in the March and June quarters. We may see some recovery by December if the drought is breaking-and we certainly hope that it is breaking. As you would expect in the worse drought in 100 years, obviously rural exports are down but, because the Australian economy runs stronger than the other economies of the developed world, capital imports are up and that will reflect itself in business tivities. In passing, I might also indicate that company profits, which were released today, were very strong indeed. Take Qantas, for example. It is one of the few profitable airlines in the world and that is why it is restocking its capital fleet. Can I indicate that the banana republic was not in fact the worse current account deficit, unlike what was said by the questioner. The current account was 6.4 per cent during the banana republic, but it was 6.6 per cent in 1989-90 when Labor gave us the recession we had to have as a result of the current account deficit, and it was 6.5 per cent in 1994-95. The allegation, of course, that this is the worse is completely wrong. Can I also indicate a critical difference between, as the Prime Minister did, the Labor current account deficits in excess of six per cent, because I think the House will be interested in this. Not only did we have high current account deficits but we had the Labor way of managing current account deficits, which was interest rate rises. In 1985-86, when the current account was at 6.4 per cent, there was of course no drought, let alone a drought of 100 years severity. In 1985-86, the standard variable mortgage interest rate stood at 13.5 per cent. Opposition member-What was it in 1982?",39
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Somebody says, ‘What was it in 1989-90?' We had no drought in 1989-90, nor one of 100 years severity. But, as the current account went to 6.6 per cent of GDP, the standard variable mortgage interest rate paid by the battlers of Australia rose under the Hawke-KeatingCrean-Beazley governments to 17 per cent. In 1994-95, when there was no drought, let alone one of 100 years severity, and the current account stood at 6.5 per cent, the standard mortgage variable interest rate stood at 10.5 per cent compared to 6.5 per cent today. As the Prime Minister said, over the last seven years what have we seen in the Australian economy? Firstly, low interest ratesand that is good for young families who want to buy houses. Secondly, we have seen 1.2 million new jobs in this country. What have we seen in relation to the people in work? acHigher disposable income. What have we seen in relation to government debt? We have seen $80 billion of Labor's debt paid off. Can you imagine what the situation would be had we not paid off Labor's debt? There would be another $80 billion in relation to the public and private debt in Australia. But most of all, in relation to all of that economic management, this has been done without the cooperation of an opposition that was interested in good policy. It has been done across the opportunism of this opposition, which has sought to frustrate and delay at every turn. The only thing we can say to the people of Australia is: thank heavens you were not successful in doing it.",39
52,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for eign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of what importance the government places on Iraq's destruction of al-Samoud II missiles? Does this represent real progress in the inspection process? In light of this, is there still a need for a new Security Council resolution?",40
53,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, the interest he shows in this issue and the way he represents his constituents. Iraq has, I understand, destroyed a total of 10 al-Samoud II missiles out of a stockpile believed to be of over 100. This latest effort by Saddam Hussein is a continuation of a game he has played for the last 12 years whenever he finds himself with a serious deadline. We should not forget that Iraq should not have developed missiles in the first place with a range of over 150 kilometres. Those missiles contravene United Nations Security Council resolutions. So Iraq should not be given credit for minimal and late displays of so-called good behaviour. Iraq has simply corrected an earlier transgression. Iraq has clearly not taken a fundamental decision to cooperate fully with the United Nations. Its cooperation remains grudging and minimalist despite the obligation in Security Council resolution 1441. These are words that many members of the House may not recall from that resolution: ‘that Iraq cooperate immediately, unconditionally and actively'. Several months have now passed since the passage of that resolution and by no stretch of any imagination could anyone claim that Iraq has cooperated immediately, unconditionally and actively. It is very obvious that they have not. Steps taken by Iraq recently are no more than a cynical attempt to deploy a smokescreen over its intention not to disarm. After all, I note the other day that Iraq miraculously, and without the presence of UNMOVIC inspectors, excavated two biological bombs. Honourable members might remember that Iraq put in a declaration on 7 December saying they had no chemical and biological weapons whatsoever. But miraculously, recently, they uncovered two Iraq biological bombs with no United Nations inspectors present. Iraq is said to have For- around 500 of these bombs and two have turned up. That is a remarkable thing. The simple fact is that Iraq has failed to explain the whereabouts of 6,500 chemical munitions with a potential chemical agent content of 1,000 tonnes; 8,500 litres of anthrax; 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media, which could be used to make 5,000 litres of anthrax; and 1½ tonnes of VX. Where is all that material? Why is it that one or two things are dug up here and there, and there are one or two concessions made here or there, but we never know what happens to the substance of Iraq's stockpiles? Saddam Hussein has done this for 12 years. He plays a game of trying to divide the international community-and, in the main, in the last 12 years he has been quite successful. To keep the international community divided-to keep, in particular, the United Nations Security Council divided-is a key objective of Saddam Hussein. That is why we get these grudging concessions here and there when deadlines approach. But, of course, they are minimalist concessions. They are not full cooperation as is demanded by the United Nations Security Council with the United Nations inspectors. That is why, in his 1 March report, Dr Blix made it clear that Iraq still has not addressed key disarmament questions and that it could have used the period up until 1 March to answer questions and produce credible evidence, but it did not. The fact is that Dr Blix described Iraq's efforts so far as ‘very limited'. It is because Iraq is clearly not cooperating and has clearly not fulfilled its obligations under Security Council resolution 1441 that this government holds the view that a new resolution should be passed through the Security Council-the resolution which is cosponsored by the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain. That resolution confirms that Iraq has not taken, as it was obliged to take, the final opportunity offered to it to comply with Security Council resolution 1441. We obviously hope that before too long it will be possible for that new Security Council resolution to be passed by the Security Council. We are optimistic that that can be achieved, but it is going to take a good deal of diplomacy in order to achieve it. The important thing is that for 12 years Saddam has successfully divided the international community and the Security Council. If the international community wants Saddam Hussein disarmed, the only way to do that is to show a unity of purpose and unity in the Security Council. As long as the international community is divided, Saddam Hussein will be able to continue to get away with his cat-and-mouse game and retain his chemical and biological weapons-a man who is the world's most brutal dictator. Economy: Foreign Debt",40
54,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall telling parliament just before he came into office seven years ago: I do not walk proud and tall in the world when I know that my country's foreign debt has gone to $180,000 million ... Does the Prime Minister also recall accusing Labor, when the debt was $180 billion, of denuding the country of real sovereignty and of having handed the country over to the foreign bankers of the world? Mr Ross Cameron-This is a speech!",41
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin will come to his question.,41
56,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, now that the debt has almost doubled to $354,000 million under your government, do you walk tall and proud for having handed this country over to the foreign bankers of the world?",41
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The latter part of the member for Rankin's question should have been ‘does the Prime Minister', not ‘do you'.",41
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member for Rankin is that I certainly would have said something about foreign debt, and I may have said something to that effect. The record is there and I do not walk away from it. But he invites me to say whether, as Prime Minister and in terms of the performance of this country, I feel proud when I go around the world. The answer is: yes, I do. The reason that I feel very proud as I go around the world is that I know I have the incredible privilege of being the Prime Minister of a country that is now held in higher esteem and in greater regard, and which is seen as a stronger nation than it was seven years ago. It is very interesting that, on the basis of one figure, the Labor Party should choose to focus the debate on the economy. I thank the Australian Labor Party very much. They are obviously not taking the advice of the former chief of staff of the former Leader of the Opposition, who counselled them against focusing on the government's strengths. But I thank them very warmly for enabling us in this question time to talk about the strengths of the Australian economy. The Australian economy is now seen, justifiably, as having outperformed every other developed economy over the last five years. If you go right across the gamut of economic comparisons you cannot escape the conclusion that, over the time this government has been in office, we have experienced the most sustained period of economic growth since at least the late 1960s. If you look at the character of the Australian economy in the 1960s and compare it with the character of the Australian economy now, you will see that in the 1960s the Australian economy was heavily protected, highly regulated and, as a consequence, was insulated-not very successfully, as time was to demonstrate-in the 1970s from the ravages of a harsher and more difficult world. If you come forward in time, particularly to the last seven years, you see the Australian economy living in a more open, competitive environment. Despite that, the Australian economy has been able to outperform the other developed economies of the world. I would like to pick up the point so ably made by the Treasurer about the attitude of this opposition and compare it with the attitude of the coalition when we were in opposition. Whenever the former government put up a decent idea-and it did on one or two occasions-we backed it. Can you imagine where the cause of lower tariffs would have ended if we had run the sort of populist campaign amongst working people in Australia about tariff reform that the Labor Party is endeavouring to run on things like Telstra? Can you imagine where the debate on financial deregulation would have gone if we had run a fear campaign about the entry of foreign banks and the progressive deregulation of interest rates? Time and time again, when we had the opportunity in opposition to stand up for Australia instead of taking the opportunistic course, we stood up for Australia. By contrast, every single reform and every single measure to strengthen the Australian economy that we have undertaken over the last seven years has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. It opposed labour market deregulation and taxation reform. It is opposing measures right at the moment to preserve the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, one of the great egalitarian welfare measures that this country has devised. I say to those opportunistic men and women who currently occupy the opposition benches that, unless we as a nation are prepared to take steps to preserve the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it will no longer serve the interests of the average Australian. It will become unaffordable. New drugs will become unaffordable. It will no longer be the boast nation that we have a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that puts life-saving drugs within the reach of all Australians and not just wealthy Australians. That is what the opportunistic bunch who sit opposite us at present stand for: you stand for opportunistic opposition. You do not believe in anything. You do not articulate anything. You do not stand for anything. All you believe in is opposing the government, and I think the Australian people think very poorly of you as a consequence.",41
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Prime Minister, as I reminded the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Rankin, about the use of the word ‘you'. Economy: Fiscal Policy",42
60,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House of the results and significance of Standard and Poor's recent review of Australia's sovereign credit rating? What has been the reaction to this review?,42
61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I can inform the House that over the last 17 years-or really over the last 20 years, I suppose I could say, since the election of the Hawke-Keating government in 1983-there have been four movements in Australia's international credit rating. Australia was first downgraded in 1986, by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. That was the first downgrading of our credit rating. The second movement of our credit rating came in 1989, under the Hawke-Keating government, when we were downgraded again. The third movement came in 2002 where, after five years of sustained economic effort, Moody's upgraded Australia two places and restored our AAA rating. The fourth movement came during the period that the House was up, when Standard and Poor's, in the fourth movement in 20 years, restored Australia's AAA credit rating on foreign currency bonds and made Australia part of that pack of nations which is in the first row of the world again. That is something we lost under Hawke and Keating and something we reof this covered under a coalition government. Standard and Poor's said this when it upgraded Australia: Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions, including ‘AAA' rated sovereigns ... net general government debt to GDP is projected to fall to 3% at year-end 2003 from 20% seven years before. With respect to the private sector, Standard and Poor's says that Australia's reliance on foreign savings is: ... mitigated in Standard & Poor's view by the high credit standing of Australia's major banks, by the depth of the foreign exchange and derivatives markets ... by substantial claims on dents by the Australian private sector ... which are not captured in ... [the] International Investment Position presentation. So one of the things I have been intrigued by in all these questions about foreign debt is the fact that we have not had any mention of Australia's credit upgrading by Standard and Poor's. It may well be that the Leader of the Opposition is right and Standard and Poor's is wrong. But those of us who know the economic credentials of the Leader of the Opposition and compare them to Standard and Poor's will not think it is a close-run thing. Standard and Poor's is an independent agency that rates the governments of the world. It is not controlled by this government, and the fact that it upgraded Australia as a result of the strong fiscal position, thoroughly reversing the downgrading of Australia under the Hawke and Keating governments, is an independent indicator of what the Prime Minister said-that under Hawke and Keating Australia fell in the league tables and under this government we have recovered. That is why Australians can hold their heads high again-because, along with France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia now has its AAA rating back. I should say, in explanation to the House, that Australia never lost its AAA rating on domestic bonds; it was on foreign currency bonds-that is, bonds which are issued in foreign currency or fall due in foreign currency. That was because of balance of payments concerns, which began with the banana republic and were worsened under Labor in 1989. It has been a long road back, but after those downgradings in 1986 and 1989 Australia stands tall again, and a coalition government was pleased to undo the last damage of the Hawke-Keating years. The Prime Minister has also made the valid point, I think, that there were good things that Hawke and Keating did. They did do some good things, and I have always said that: they floated the dollar; they let foreign banks in-and that led to this new banking system, which some of the troglodytes of the Australian Labor Party now attack; and they began the reduction of tariffs, which this nonresi- government has continued. They did some good things. We have always given credit where credit was due. But let me tell you what they did not do. They ran up $80 billion of government debt in their last five years and they could not get it down. Let us see what else they could not do: they could not get an interest rate below 10½ per cent; they could not get 1.2 million jobs; they could not reform the taxation system because, although the then Treasurer believed it had to be done in the interests of Australia, they could not get it through the union veto. Mr Crean-Rubbish!",42
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘Rubbish,' he says. They could get it through the union veto, could they? They were just going to do GST in the 14th or 15th year? He is rewriting history now, saying that it is rubbish that Labor refused to introduce a GST because of a union veto-that is rubbish! This brings me to the Leader of the Opposition because, in all those changes where Labor did good things supported by the coalition, not all the members of the Labor Party supported them. I have told the House before about this, and I cannot get over it. I have been reading a portrait of Paul Keating by Don Watson. Let me remind the House of where everybody was during those reforms. Don Watson said: Mickey Mouse was a name to be feared by all advisers ... To be touched by those two words was poison. Bleeding heart, froth, fairy floss and Creanites were others. A Creanite was someone who sympathised with industry policy of the kind advocated by Simon Crean. These names were dreaded in the way that Trotskyist, revisionists and tendencies were dreaded in another time and another place. You knew your economic credibility was shot. If we go back to what was actually happening there, the opposition was cooperating. Who was in opposition to the few good things that the Labor Party did? That group of Creanites, now rapidly dwindling; they are the few people that can take no credit for the changes of those days. When the Creanites got control of the Labor Party, it was the end of economic policy as we now know it. What is the evidence? Objections to PBS increases, which the Keating government put in place and demanded be increased. Objections to welfare reform, when we used to have the member for Werriwa demanding it, claiming it, wanting it to be done and saying we were using it to hide the unemployment rate. This is a Creanite opposition that has decided, in the week when Australia's credit upgrading was finally regranted and when we put to bed the bad things of the Keating government, to come out and remind us that they are still here, for better or for worse-and much more for worse. Economy: Fiscal Policy",43
63,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and it follows on from his answer to the previous question. Does the Treasurer recall responding to this question, about a current account deficit of $2 billion, from a journalist: ‘Will you cede, though, it is an improvement on the previous figure?' The Treasurer said, ‘Look, if you forecast a disaster, there are no gratulations for reaching it.

There is one standing order for answers, and that is that the ‘answer shall be relevant to the question'. I listen closely to con- the answer and I always write down the questions to ensure that there is relevance. There is a separation between questions and con- answers.

73,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House what steps the government has taken in recent days to address the current situation on the Korean peninsula?,44
74,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question, and I note that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs interjects with a question. For the record, he has not asked a single question in the House of Representatives on the issue of North Korea since he has been in that position.",44

76,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And nor have you, for that matter, either.",45
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will come to the question.,45
78,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government does remain deeply concerned about the provocative behaviour of the North Korean administration and, in particular, its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. I visited Seoul last week to attend the inauguration of President Roh and to meet key figures in his new administration. I had lunch, for example, with the incoming foreign minister, Mr Yoon. South Korea is an important regional partner for Australia. It is our fourth largest trading partner and our third largest export market. It is important that members of the House understand that. It was also a very good opportunity for me to hold discussions on North Korea with leaders from countries with key interests in the peninsula-that is, with not just the South Korean leaders, whom I have already mentioned, but also Secretary of State Powell, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov, who members of the House may recall was at one stage the Russian ambassador here in Canberra and who had very recently been in North Korea. In those discussions, I reaffirmed the fundamental importance of a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the problems of North Korea and pressed the need for a multilateral setting in which the United States and North Korea might, amongst other things, be able to have some bilateral contact and even quite broad-ranging discussions. We had hoped that the proposal for a so called five-plus-five meeting might take place. The North Koreans have so far rejected that but we continue to pursue it, others. I also flagged a proposal for a meeting of key countries in the region to address the question of whether it would be possible to have some kind of multilateral security guarantee for North Korea, and that group of countries would of course include the United States. Finally, I urged China to use its unique and overriding influence to persuade North Korea to not just participate in a fiveplus-five meeting but also more generally pull back from its nuclear ambitions and return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I think my visit reinforced the energy that Australia has put into trying to find a solution to the problem of North Korea. As the Prime Minister said the other day, I do not think there is any country that has made a more enthusiastic effort to try to address this problem. Nevertheless, we recognise that this is an extremely fraught and difficult issue and one that the international community needs to continue to focus on very significantly. That is not to say it should ignore a persistent violator of Security Council resolutions like Saddam Hussein. We should be able to focus on both issues at once; indeed, we must do that. But there is no doubt that we, for our part, will have to continue to be actively engaged in trying to find a resolution to the problems of the Korean peninsula. Family Payments: Ombudsman's Report",45
79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister and it refers to his family payment debt trap. Mr Rudd interjecting Mr Downer interjecting,45
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley will start his question again. He is not being assisted by either the member for Griffith or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.,45
81,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it refers to his family payment debt trap, which yesterday he said was fundamentally sound. Prime Minister, is it the case that, after seven years, 10 times as many families are hit by family debt? That is 650,000 families with debts now totalling nearly $600 million. Prime Minister, did the as do Ombudsman's investigation into the family tax benefit conclude that finetuning would not fix the debt trap inherent in the system? The report says: ... the analysis suggests that, even if ... recommendations are adopted in full, the scheme is likely to continue to result in significant numbers of unavoidable debts for families. Prime Minister, why are you ignoring the Ombudsman's advice and doing nothing to relieve the crippling debt trap you have set for Australian families?",45
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The short answer to the question is no. The slightly longer answer that I know the member for Lilley would be very disappointed if I did not provide to the House is as follows. In the seven years that we have been in government, we have done three very important things in relation to family payments. The first of those is that we have massively boosted them by about $13 billion, a not inconsiderable sum. We have boosted family payments by $13 billion. The second very important thing that we have done is greatly enhance the choices available to Australian families, particularly but not only to Australian women. Mr Swan-You gave them debt!",46
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Member for Lilley!,46
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The third thing we have done is recognise the growing importance in the Australian community of the desire of Australian families to have an appropriate balance between their work and family responsibilities. It is very interesting, when you look at the figures, to see over the last 40 years a very major change in the participation patterns of Australian women. But, when you look at those changes, you find that there has been very little change-and this is borne out by some research recently conducted by Professor Bob Gregory of the Australian National University-in the participation rates in full-time work of Australian women over that 40-year period and a major change in the patterns of part-time work. In Australian society now we have a situation where you need to devise family policies that fit the interests, aspirations and desires of different categories of families and provide them with new choices. That is what the government's policies have done. We have boosted the value of the benefits. Along the way, we have eliminated the bias that used to exist against single income families with a child under the age of five years, and that was an important policy goal that the government set ourselves. We have expanded by some 400,000 or 500,000-subject to correction on the precise number-the number of child-care places. We have maintained the affordability of child care. In fact, the cost of child care immediately fell after the introduction of the new taxation system, and we have greatly expanded the opportunities for the women of Australia to participate in part-time work. I am particularly proud of the achievements of this government over the last seven years in providing choice to Australian parents in two very important areas. Mr Swan-No choice in the debt!",46
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley defies the chair!,46
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of those areas is the caring arrangements for their children, whether by a parent remaining at home full time or full time for a while and then part time or whether in paid child care. The other thing I am very proud of is the way in which we have expanded the choices available to Australian parents in the area of the education of their children. Despite the furious attempts of the Australian Labor Party at the time of the last election to generate an envy mentality in the Australian community, to revive the old class warfare about independent schoolsMr Swan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question was about family payment debt. The Prime Minister is not talking about family payment debt. I asked him to tell us when he was going to do something about it.",46
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister was asked a question about family payments, family payment debt and finetuning of the family assistance package.",46
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was expanding on the concept of choice, something the Labor Party has a lot of trouble grappling with. I remind the Australian Labor Party that the Labor Party has witnessed not only the expansion of choice for Australian parents via the family payment system-which has boosted the value of family benefits by about $13 billion-but, on top of that, this government preside over the massive expansion of choice available to Australian families in relation to the education of their children. The symbol of the failure of the class prejudice driven campaign of the Labor Party on this was the defeat of the former member for Dobell at the last election. He was the major spokesman for the envy brigade in this parliament before the last election, and he suffered the ignominy of losing his seat. Mr Swan- Mr Speaker, I rise on another point of order based on relevance. The question was about the family debt system bashing battlers.",46
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has concluded his answer. Health: Tough on Drugs Strategy,47
90,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of any proposals that may threaten the government's Tough on Drugs strategy, which is aimed at curbing the illicit drug trade and reducing the use of illicit drugs in the community? What is the government's response to these proposals?",47
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mitchell for his questions. I am aware of a proposal from the New South Wales Greens to support a trial of controlled availability of heroin and other drugs of addiction from specifically licensed clinics to registered dicts. On behalf of the government, I denounce that policy. It is irresponsible. It is not in the interests of Australia, it is not in the interest of drug addicts and it runs completely counter to the experience of the Tough on Drugs campaign which has been carried out over the last four or five years. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales for his spirited opposition to this policy and his principled disavowal of any preference deal between the coalition parties and the Greens. I call on the Premier of New South Wales to take the same principled approach to the allocation of preferences. I can remember, in another environment, plenty of sermons coming from the other side about the allocation of preferences. I condemn these proposals from the New South Wales Greens. They amount to the legalisation of illicit drugs and if they were ever introduced they would destroy efforts to rehabilitate people-young people in particular-who were using drugs and would send exactly the wrong message to young people. Mr Tanner interjecting",47
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned! The member for Melbourne will withdraw that statement. Mr Tanner-I withdraw.,47
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take the opportunity, in answering the question asked by the member for Mitchell, to record the government's gratitude for the recent advice from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, which showed that fatal heroin overdoses in the 15to 44-year-old age range fell by 58 per cent in 2001, following a fall of 24 per cent in 2000. I would be the first to acknowledge that you cannot assume from that that the problem has been solved. I do not make lavish claims, but I do claim that the whole basis of the more permissive policy advocated by the Greens-and, a couple of years ago, a somewhat more permissive policy advocated by sections of the Labor Party in New South Wales and elsewhere-was based on the proposition",47
94,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,47
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"People interjected at ad- that. The opening of heroin injecting rooms represents, in my view and in the view of many people concerned with the drug issue, a more liberal, more permissive approach to the drug issue. That is exactly what I have in mind. The advocacy by some in the Labor Party around Australia of heroin trials represents another example of that. The whole basis of the argument that you should adopt a more permissive approach is that the current policy is not working. The evidence, such as it is, is that the current policy is beginning to work. The current policy should be given an opportunity of working more effectively and over a longer period of time before people start suggesting that it has been a failure. These figures-a drop of 58 per cent in the number of deaths in 2001-are a clear indication that the Tough on Drugs policy is working. Since 1997 this government has committed $840 million to a Tough on Drugs strategy which balances law enforcement, drug treatment and education programs. Over the last three years there has been a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people reporting the use of illicit drugs. Over seven tonnes of illicit drugs have been seized, and these seizures and associated arrests have contributed to the disruption of major heroin importation and distribution networks. In the year from July 2000 to June 2001 there were 30,000 treatments provided to drug users by Tough on Drugs funded treatment services, and that was an increase from about 19,000 in the previous year. A further success was the 2001 National Illicit Drugs campaign. The evaluation of that campaign showed that 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children as a result of that campaign about the drug problem. Over the period that Tough on Drugs has been in operation, it has been variously sneered at and criticised by the members of the opposition. We have maintained our strong commitment to the Tough on Drugs campaign. It is tough on the drug peddlers, it is designed to educate young people against the dangers of starting illicit drug use and it is also designed to fill the gap that existed the past in providing more rehabilitation services. I am pleased to say that, in the main, we have had the cooperation of state governments in the implementation of this program. I want to say emphatically on behalf of the government that there will be no relaxation of our support for the Tough on Drugs campaign. We believe the signs, tentative though they are, are that this campaign is working. That ought to be a source of hope and encouragement and not of political derision from all people involved in politics and concerned about the future of young people. I think the policy of the New South Wales Greens is a disgrace. I congratulate John Brogden for disavowing a preference deal with the New South Wales Greens, and I call upon Mr Carr to exhibit similar courage and leadership. Education: HECS Contributions",47
96,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Isn't it the case that, after seven years of the Howard government, university students are paying an average of 85 per cent more for their education, causing HECS debts to more than double from $4 billion to $9 billion? Minister, isn't it a fact that, under the Howard government, Australian students pay more and get more debt?",48
97,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and for drawing attention to a very important issue. The fact is that the Higher Education Contributions Scheme was introduced by the then Labor government in 1988-89, a very good initiative supported by the coalition then in opposition. It was introduced because the then Labor government realised that the only way that you could even hope to offer a university education to all Australians who wanted to get one was to introduce some form of userpays, income-contingent payback system upon graduation. The facts are that today there are 1,800,433 Australians who owe the Commonwealth money in relation to HECS, the average HECS debt is $8,000, 91 per cent owe less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owe less than $12,000. I might also add that the university graduate leaves university with an average HECS debt of $15,000, and in within 18 months every university graduate has earned more than all the money that they owe for their contribution to their education. They pay for one-quarter of it. So, overall, the total debt is $8,000. Pretend for a minute that I am Eddie MCGuire on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Of course I am a St Kilda supporter and I support the Swans in Sydney, but pretend I am on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Mr Melham interjecting",48

102,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a very serious point that needs to be made about university graduates-those Australians who have the privilege to have a university education and to have three-quarters of it paid for by Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university. The important point to be made is that their average lifetime earnings are, for men, $622,000 more and, for women, $413,000 more than the earnings of those who have not been to university; their lifetime unemployment rate is one-quarter that of those who have not been to universityMs Macklin-Give us another fact.",49

104,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and I might also add that graduates' starting salaries are 83½ per cent of average weekly earnings. The point is that, if you want Australian higher education to be affordable, to be accessible and, most importantly, to be of a world-class standard, it is critically important that we recognise that HECS is a program to be supported. It has expanded for the simple reason that there are more students in Australian universities. We have extended loans to postgraduate students, and we are now requiring students to meet some costs commensurate with their lifetime earning income. NA",49

106,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of reports of proposed new immigration initiatives to produce better regional outcomes? he What support is the government receiving from other authorities? How would these proposals benefit our economy?,49
107,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I know that he is vitally interested in regional migration, representing as he does a very important regional area in New South Wales. He is very much aware, as I am sure most members are, that this government has had a record second to none in relation to obtaining a better dispersal of the migration outcome. In fact, over the last four years or so about 17,000 people have been influenced by the range of programs and initiatives that have been put in place to obtain that outcome. From 1 March this year the government introduced new business migration criteria to enable greater regional dispersal of business migrants. This initiative has as its key state sponsorship. It provides an opportunity to link prospective business migrants to statespecific economic and development objectives. It improves linkages with state and territory business services to help them successfully establish business ventures. In essence, this measure gives the states greater influence over the number and nature of business migrants who settle within their jurisdictions. Mr Speaker and colleagues, I want to assure you that this innovative approach is one which we will continue to implement, particularly with the assistance of state governments. Mr Zahra interjecting",49
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the provisions of standing order 304A, the member for MCMillan will excuse himself from the The member for MCMillan then left the chamber.",49
109,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A good deal of interest has been expressed by state governments in working with us on these initiatives. One state that has particularly expressed a degree of interest in these matters is a state that argued that the immigration program is much larger than it ought to be. In New South Wales the Premier has argued over a long period that Sydney is overburdened by migration and that, as a result, he wants to see smaller program in New South Wales. He has gone out and argued for that. I met with him last year and I said to him, ‘I want to work with you on these issues. If there are too many people coming to Sydney, you ought to be working with these initiatives that will get a better dispersal of the migration program and you ought to be encouraging me in looking for as many-and as innovative-ways of achieving that as possible.' What have I heard since that time? There have been a number of meetings, but as I put items for discussion on the agenda he knocks them off. One of the things that has particularly surprised me is that the New South Wales government wants to be schizophrenic about development. On the one hand it argues that it wants Sydney to be a financial hub and on the other hand it argues that it should be a centre for regional headquarters. But you can do that without people. You can have it as a financial hub and you can have it as a regional headquarters, but you can do it without people. In fact, the only area of the migration program in which Premier Carr has expressed any interest in cutting back is skilled migration. The reality of that is that, even if people have established businesses in Sydney, they are not going to stop bringing in people to do the work that is necessary; they are still going to bring them in, even if they have to bring them from interstate. It will not stop the impact of people in Sydney. The one area in which the state could have an influence is in relation to other areas of migration. It could, if it wished, focus on, say, enhanced sponsorship arrangements for family migrants if they were prepared to settle regionally as against in New South Wales or Sydney. That measure would have an impact, but I suspect he thinks it would have an impact upon the intentions of voters in the New South Wales election-because sponsors have votes. It really means that Premier Carr is out there arguing, day after day, that has you could have some impact on the inability of New South Wales to deal with planning issues and the needs and aspirations of the people of Sydney by reducing migration overall; but, when he is asked to put up in a relation to initiatives that could produce an effective dispersal of migration in Sydney, he runs away from them. Medicare: Bulk-Billing",50
110,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that, after seven years of the Howard government, the rate of bulk-billing by general practitioners has fallen by 11 per cent, from 80.6 per cent in 1996 to 69.6 per cent today, the worse rate since 1989? The average cost of seeing a doctor who does not bulk-bill has increased by 54 per cent, from $8.32 in 1996 to $12.78 today, the highest amount since Medicare started in 1984. Last year, 2002, there were 10 million fewer GP bulk-billed visits than in 1996.",50
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth will come to his question.,50
112,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, after seven years, why has the government done nothing to prevent it from becoming harder to see a bulk-billing doctor and more expensive to see a doctor who does not bulkbill?",50
113,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Perth for his very helpful question on this very important issue. The issues raised by bulk-billing are important, and I think the first thing we should do is understand the original design of bulk-billing. Then we can come to the question of comparisons betweenDr Emerson interjecting",50
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin is warned!,50
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the bulk-billing rates under the former government and those under this government. Then we can come, in conclusion, to a comparison between the future policy of this government and that of the alternative government of this country. I think it is worthwhile to go back to the introduction of the Medicare system, which followed the election of the Hawke government in 1983. This is what the policy that was taken to the 1983 election had to say that is relevant to this issue: Doctors will be free to choose their method of billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85% of the scheduled fee directly from the public funds. It is expected that doctors will use this bulk billing procedure for pensioners, low income patients, the chronically ill and those in need. I will come to another quote about bulkbilling, from 1987, that is also relevant. This is a very important public policy issue, and I would have thought that the Labor Party would want to be sensibly engaged on it. It was never intended by Labor, when it introduced the Medicare scheme, to guarantee the universal availability-or even the high availability-of bulk-billing for people who were not pensioners, low-income patients, chronically ill or in need. In 1987, Dr Blewett had this to say: What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk-billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk-billing facility to treat sioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention. According to my advice, the average rate of bulk-billing for GP services when Labor was in office was slightly below 68 per centtherefore, it was less than its current level. In the 1991 budget, when the bulk-billing rate was around its present level, Labor could not have cared less about bulk-billing. In fact, in 1991 the then minister for health wanted to introduce a copayment of $5. Brian Howe, who in many respects was responsible for some good social policy, said: I am aware of reports which say that this charge will discourage bulk-billing and encourage doctors to lift their fees. I must stress that the ernment does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient. In other words, he said that was not a matter for the government to control. He was endorsing the long-held view that the purpose of bulk-billing was to protect the less welloff. It was never the intention of the Labor Party then-and it was not the view of the opposition then, nor is it the view of the coalition in government now-that it should be an aim of policy to universally guarantee bulk-billing to everybody in the community, including people on very generous incomes. I am advised that bulk-billing rates remain very high for disadvantaged groups. Bulkbilling rates in the most disadvantaged 10 per cent of areas throughout Australia have averaged above 90 per cent since 1996-97, and bulk-billing rates for patients aged 65 years and older have averaged above 80 per centthat includes not only disadvantaged people over 65 but all people over 65 since 1996-97. As I indicated yesterday, there are some deficiencies, particularly in rural and outer metropolitan areas, largely because of the shortage of doctors in those areas. This issue has been brought to my attention by members sitting behind me, because most of the rural and outer metropolitan areas are represented by coalition members on this side of the House. The government are currently turning our mind to a number of policy responses to address that issue. I want to make penit very clear that it was never the policy of the former government, and it has not been the policy of this government, that we can in all circumstances guarantee bulk-billing for everybody. That is simply not possible. What we can do is commit ourselves to the maintenance of a high availability of bulk-billing for the less fortunate and for concession cardholders in our community. That has been very much not only the policy but also the practice of this government in the time that we have been in office. That brings me to policy alternatives. Policy alternatives are fascinating. We saw policy alternatives on display yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition. Not only did he get his gym shoes and his CD-ROMs Gov- wrong-ignoring the fact that that issue had been addressed several weeks ago-but this morning he attacked the private health insurance rebate. The Leader of the Opposition said that there was something radically wrong with the private health insurance rebate. I think most people in Australia are getting suspicious that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, he would abolish the private health insurance rebate. His colleague from Perth not only wants to abolish the private health tax break but also wants to increase the Medicare levy. That is what the member for Perth wants to do. Over the past few days, the Leader of the Opposition has earned himself the reputation of being a serial mistake-maker. He had a few problems with the strategic missile defence system when he talked about it being based on nuclear weapons. He made a few mistakes about its alleged nonavailability to countries other than the United States. On top of that, this is what he had to say at a doorstop this morningMs Gillard-Is this about bulk-billing?",50
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is about the private health insurance rebate. This is what he had to say: Yes, there are other areas in terms of the private health rebate. If you look at the $2.3 billion, Mr Schneiderwho is the Director of the Australian Health Insurance Associationadmits that only $700 million out of $2.3 billion goes into hospitals. Wrong! The amount that goes to hospitals is $1.537 billion, or 71 per cent of the total amount. I made some inquiries and I am informed that Mr Schneider denies having made that claim. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to get rid of the private health insurance rebate, and the member for Perth wants to increase the Medicare levy. Gradually, bit by bit, the alternative health policy of the Australian Labor Party is coming on-stream. It is not a very impressive health policy, and it is no wonder. The Leader of the Opposition does not even understand the fundamentals of the existing health policy, so how on earth has he got any hope of constructing a logical alternative? Workplace Relations: Small Business  is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Can the minister inform the House why the government is committed to exempting small business from the unfair dismissal laws? Are there any alternative policies?",52
117,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the member for Aston, and other members of the House, that this coalition has been determined to reform the unfair dismissal laws ever since they first entered the federal jurisdiction in 1993. This government received a mandate at three elections to reform the unfair dismissal laws. Three times it received a mandate for reform, but that mandate has been frustrated 27 times-at the last count-by blocking votes from members of the Australian Labor Party. I should inform members opposite that the respected Melbourne Institute for Applied Social and Economic Research produced late last year some new evidence about the economic consequences of the unfair dismissal laws. According to this research, the unfair dismissal laws as they stand mean that 12 per cent of businesses even make greater use of fixed-term employment contracts; 21 per cent of businesses are more likely to employ casual staff rather than permanent staff; and 40 per cent of businesses say that the unfair dismissal laws make it less likely that they will employ unemployed people. These are the unfair outcomes of the unfair dismissal laws. The Melbourne institute concluded that the unfair dismissal laws have cost business $1.3 billion and have played a role in the loss of 77,000 jobs. It also concluded that the unfair dismissal laws have reduced employment by nearly one half of a per cent, resulting in a cut in jobs of nearly 50,000. I know this kind of economic modelling is an inexact science, but plainly it shows that, if you are serious about getting unemployment down, you have to be serious about reforming the unfair dismissal laws. Members opposite who have studied this situation know that we have to change the unfair dismissal laws. For instance, the well-known and wellinformed member on this matter-the member for Hunter-has said: Well my wife consistently tells methis is the lady who can't join the Labor Party because she is not a member of a unionshe could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of lation. All those perceptions are out there, all of them are well founded ... Good on the member for Hunter! He is not always right but he is dead right about this. I would respectfully suggest to the 64 per cent of Labor senators who are former union officials that they ought to listen to the member for Hunter, they ought to put the workers' interest ahead of the union interest and they ought to pass the government's fair dismissal laws in the Senate today. Business: Executive Remuneration",52
118,Mr COX,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Does the minister recall his response on 13 February to the issue of excessive executive payouts when he said: Shareholders have every capacity to control these things and they should control them, and I think for too long shareholders have been too passive in the face of high-handed executive action ... In light of these comments, why did the minister and the government oppose Labor's proposed laws this year to provide shareholders a right to a vote on executive payouts?",53
119,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make it very clear to the shadow minister that in the 13 years under a Labor government executive pay was not controlled. Not only was executive pay not controlled but basic award earnings, thanks to the Leader of the Opposition's accord policy, fell by",53

That compares with a five per cent real decrease when members opposite were in power. Mr Bevis interjecting",53

124,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As for executive payouts, like the Treasurer and like the Prime Minister, I believe that many of these executive payouts are a cause for grave concern. I think it is very important that directors and shareholders pay greater attention to executive payouts. For that reason, I am very pleased that the Australian Stock Exchange is going to make it compulsory for these things to be disclosed. Small Business",53
125,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Would the minister advise the House how important the small business sector is to Australia's continued economic growth? Is the minister aware of any recent threats to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses? What steps has the federal government taken to protect this important sector?,53
126,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moore for his question. He knows what small business is about-he worked in small business. He would certainly be a rare find if he were a member of the Labor Party. Strike action and industrial thuggery by militant trade unions causes untold grief to the wider community and of course particularly to small business. On the weekend we heard of the union movement's threats to disrupt Australia's ports. This is a direct threat to the exporters of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. Victorian Trades Hall Secretary Leigh Hubbard was quoted talking about blocking essential supplies for any Australian troops in Iraq. He said that the union movement has to look at the issue. A spokeswoman for the ACTU claimed that it was all a bit of a beat-up. It is not a beat-up for the CFMEU National Secretary John Maitland to call for national stoppages over military involvement in Iraq. It is not a beat-up for the MUA's Western Australian Secretary Wally Pritchard to refuse to rule out disrupting troop supplies in the event of conflict with Iraq. It is not a beat-up for the Newcastle Trades Hall Council Secretary Gary Kennedy, in a direct threat, to call for civil disobedience and breaking the law if necessary in the event of a possible war with Iraq. And it is not a beat-up for the head of UnionsWA Dave Robinson to refuse to guarantee supplying the troops in the event of a conflict with Iraq. It is a clear campaign from the Labor Party and a clear campaign from the union movement. It did not happen during Gulf War I-why is it happening now? This is union militancy cutting directly to the core of Australian activity. It does have an impact on the wider community and it does have an impact on small business. The Leader of the Opposition is fond of running with the hares and hunting with the hounds. He would say one thing about stamping down on the trade unions in the event of these sorts of threats. We are providing the Leader of the Opposition with a real and tangible way of standing up to the unions. Before the Senate we have the small business protection bill. That bill has been to the Senate on two or three previous occasions, and the Labor Party continues to oppose it with the support of the Democrats. That bill is about giving ACCC protection to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses should they become the innocent victims of a sympathy strike. That bill is going back to the Senate for a vote in the next week. It is truth or tell time for the Leader of the Opposition; it is time to tell the truth or to tell a lie. The Leader of the Opposition has a choice: he can stand up for the workers of Australia, small business and the wider community or, as he has shown, he can stand up for his mates in the union movement.",53

134,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I also have a question to you, Mr Speaker. It relates to the administration of the Register of Members' Interests. I refer you to the declarations by the Prime Minister in particular and, in a similar vein, by the minister for communications with respect to the loans of the plasma TVs by Telstra. Where the Prime Minister's declaration referred to a period of three months for the loan and the minister's declaration referred to the loan being short term, of course they were not returned until after seven months and then only after public exposure of these loans. I would like to ask: are there any arrangements or processes in place whereby, when members make conditional declarations of interest, some mechanism ensures that such conditions are in fact followed through and that the declaration is ultimately complied with or fulfilled in accordance with the conditions that have been specified by the member?",54
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have to indicate to the member for Melbourne that I have-I mean this in the most charitable way and I hope you will take it in this way-no interest in the declaration of members' interests in that it is not something which I have immediate control over, seek immediate control over or have ever sought access to. That is how it ought to stay. The declaration of members' interests is vested in the Clerk's office. Any questions about the way in which it is exercised can be directed through me to the Clerk or Deputy Clerk-and I will do just that.",55

140,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my question is to you. Is there a proposal before the presiding officers to close the Nurses Centre in this building? What is the reason behind this retrograde proposal? Will you give an undertaking to the House to consult widely with all members prior to any decision being taken on this matter?",55
141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Watson for the question. This is a matter that has caused all members a great deal of concern. I would first indicate to the member for Watson that I will give an undertaking to at least consult with the Joint House committee before any decision is made. The first I had heard of this proposal was in fact last week. I did not read the recommendations until the weekend, when I arrived in Canberra. The President and I have not discussed the recommendations and, as I indicated to him earlier, at this stage there is nothing more than a proposal on my desk that I intend to consult with at least the Joint House committee on before taking any action at all.",55
142,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"While it would be advisable, no doubt, to consult with the Joint House committee, obviously this is a matter which would be of great concern to all members. Considering the proposal was that, if the nurses station was closed, the security attendants would give first aid, I think all members and all people who work in the building would be rather concerned if the level of service that is given by the Nurses Centre was taken away. It might be something that not just the Joint House committee should have a say on but that all members and other people who work in the building could be consulted on. There have been a for number of people here who have had very serious health problems and have been assisted by the nurses. There are probably some people who worked in this building in the past who are still alive because of their smart service. To put that sort of responsibilof ity onto security attendants would be something they would not be able to do. I think it is a matter that we all should be consulted on, probably as well as the Joint House committee. It should not be just something that goes only that far.",55
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have already responded to the question from the member for Watson and indicated that I had not even read this report until yesterday evening, that I have not spoken to the President about it and that I do intend to consult with the Joint House committee, which would seem to me to be the responsible way to deal with all members, given that that is the role of the Joint House committee.

147,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the people of Australia have not been consulted on a commitment made that Australia will support an impending war against Iraq. We are concerned that such a war will: - Result in the deaths of many Iraqi civilians, as well as Australian US and Iraqi troops. - Goad Saddam Hussein to use any weapons he has at his disposal in a bid to retain power. - Cause a civil war in Iraq, enlarge the refugee problem and further destabilise the Middle East. - Enhance the perception that The West is at war with the Islamic World, thus consolidating the recruitment power of anti-Western extremists. Your petitioners request that the House shall refuse to commit Australia to join the United States of America in this impending war, and further, that Australia uses what influence it has over the US. to convince it to use non-violent strategies such as seeking a Zone Free of Weapons of Mass Destruction over the entire Middle East. by Mr Edwards (from 81 citizens) and Dr Lawrence (from 2,075 citizens). Fuel: Prices To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the growing desire for action to control large oil companies' exploitation of petrol prices. Your petitioners therefore call on the House to implement Labor's Five Point Plan for petrol, which includes: - Specific penalties and sanctions for price exploitation during holiday periods; - Increased powers for the ACCC; - Establishing an effective test for anticompetitive behaviour under the Trade Practices Act; the current onus of proof under the Trade Practices Act; and - Allowing service stations to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol. by Mr Bevis (from eight citizens). Social Welfare: Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of Iraq the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain general pension, superannuant/part government pension, citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House that in view of the difficult circumstances that such citizens are experiencing with their reducing quality of life due to a burgeoning cost of living created by the GST, there exists an urgent need to upgrade the pension. Notwithstanding periodic increases to the pension and other once only, much qualified gratuities, we strongly contend that the basic formula for the pension is a source of hardship in that it has been set too low even for normal circumstances, and in comparison to many European pension, let alone in the current climate of increased prices, fees and premiums in Australia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House act to increase the Base Formula of the Pension to equal 35% of the Adult Male Average Weekly Earnings (AMAWE). by Mr Billson (from 12 citizens). Health: MRI Machines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition calls upon the Commonwealth government to grant an MRI Medicare licence to Western Australia's only specialist children hospital, Princess Margaret. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine is an essential diagnostic tool for a range of paediatric medical conditions - use Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that the Commonwealth provide children in Western Australia with access to Medicare MRI scans at Princess Margaret Hospital by Mr Edwards (from 38 citizens). Australian Defence Force: Military Compensation Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia calls on the Parliament to recognise: 1. That defence and war service are unique and due to the nature of this service that private insurance for defence personnel is often difficult to obtain; 2. That Government has an obligation to adequately support members of the Defence Forces who are injured or wounded in the course of duty; 3. That Government has an obligation to adequately support families of defence force personnel killed on duty; 4. That current Defence compensation is inadequate and fails to provide financial security and certainty to Defence personnel and their families in the event of injury or death; and 5. That members of the Defence Forces are entitled to the certainty that they and their families will be adequately compensated in the event of injury or death. And further calls on the Parliament to ensure that the proposed new Military Compensation Scheme rectifies the current inequities and anomalies which severely disadvantage members of the Australian Defence Forces and their families in real and financial terms. by Mr Edwards (from 144 citizens). Iraq To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread concern and disquiet held by many Australians with the possibility of a US led attack on Iraq and Australia's involvement in such an action. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: its influence to dissuade the US Government from the threat of precipitate military action in Iraq; - refrain from all support of such threats; continue with diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution of the problems of the region; and - work through the United Nations, as the duly constituted international body, for building a secure basis for world peace. by Mr Georgiou (from 4,703 citizens). Health: Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We the undersigned call on the Federal Government to extend its plan to encourage doctors to outer metropolitan areas including the Central Coast. There is a chronic shortage of doctors in the area and people told are waiting between 7 and 14 days to get an appointment with their doctor. Doctors are over worked and people's lives are being put at risk by the chronic shortage of doctors in the area. The average doctor patient ratio through out Australia is 1 doctor to 1000 people in the Northern part of Wyong Shire the ratio is 1 doctor to 2500 people. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House encourage doctors to outer metropolitan areas including the Central Coast. by Ms Hall (from nine citizens). Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: - That increases to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the 2002 budget will hit those that can least afford it, families and pensioners. - That this Government should remember the commitments made before the 2001 election in regard to the cost of prescription drugs. We therefore pray that the House oppose the Howard-Costello plan to increase the cost of prescription drugs for Australians. by Ms Hall (from 20 citizens). Medicare: Bulk-Billing To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We the undersigned request that the Government take action to preserve bulkbilling and to strengthen the Medicare system. The cessation of bulkbilling by many General Practitioners as a direct result of Government policy has caused great hardship to many local residents on low incomes particularly the elderly and those with young children. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House introduce legislation to ensure that bulkbilling is preserved and that our Medicare system is strengthened. by Ms Hall (from 16 citizens). Telstra: Privatisation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the following issues to the attention of the House: - The Howard Government is determined to sell Telstra even though submissions to its own inquiry, the Estens Inquiry, overwhelmingly show that services are still inadequate. - These submissions also reflect widespread concern that services will decline further if the rest of Telstra is sold. - The Greens, Democrats and Independents may make deals with the Liberal government to allow the sale to go ahead, despite increasing community opposition to the sale. - A fully privatised Telstra will focus on profits not people; shareholders will be more important than customers. - Services will suffer under a fully privatised Telstra, particularly in outer metropolitan, ral and regional Australia. We therefore pray that the House oppose the Liberal/National plan to sell Telstra and that all Greens, Democrats and Independents join Labor in opposing the sale of Telstra. by Ms Hall (from 49 citizens). Shipping: Nuclear Armed and Powered Vessels To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We, the undersigned residents of Australia ask that the House of Representatives consider the health and welfare of the present and future residents of this country and the environmental impacts of possible negative impacts relating to the visits of nuclear powered and/armed vessels into Australian ports. Nuclear navies are not welcome here whatever the colour of their flags. The recent spate of accidents involving nuclearpowered submarines should be enough to convince all governments that the risk to the environment of these floating Chernobyls is a risk we don't have to take. Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Parliament legislate to prevent all visits of nuclear armed/powered vessels to Australian ports and waters. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever humbly pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 220 citizens). Military Detention: Australian Citizens To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the fact that US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld has stated his goal is to have as few prisoners “as humanly possible” remaining in US hands, once they had been interrogated. “When we have got out of them the information that we feel has been appropriate we will very likely let as many countries as possible have any of their nationals they would like. They can handle the prosecution. I have no desire to fill up our jails and spend time and money holding people”, he said. In view of this statement and the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, ruexpressing concern for those taken prisoner by US forces during the military campaign in Afghanistan and her statement that her organisation agreed with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that the captured Taleban and al-Qaeda fighters being held at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should be declared prisoners of war and be protected under the Geneva Conventions, together with her statement that the UN was particularly concerned about the future of the civilian population in Afghanistan and in “embedding a culture of human rights” in the country. Your Petitioners therefore: pray that the House, forthwith undertake all steps necessary to have David Hicks returned to Australia immediately and treated in accord with the regular laws of our country. by Dr Lawrence (from 182 citizens). Science: Animal Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Federal Government has approved a grant of $5 mil to fund a facility in Churchill, Victoria, for the breeding of laboratory monkeys to be used in research. The billions of dollars invested annually in animal research would be put to much more efficient, effective and humane use if redirected to clinical and epidemiological research and public health programs. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: 1. Rescind the grant to fund the building of a facility for the breeding of monkeys which will be harmed or killed in the course of research; and 2. Instead provide funding for the development and utilisation of research techniques which do not use animals at any stage. by Mr MCClelland (from 107 citizens). Health: MRI Machines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the refusal by the Federal Government to license a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) facility at the Concord Repatriation and General Hospital denies equitable access to vital health services for cancer, heart, orthopaedic, burns and MS patients. Despite a commitment by the NSW Government to purchase a MRI machine, Concord Hospital remains the only teaching hospital in Sydney not approved to provide MRI diagnostic services via the Medicare system. This means Concord's frailest patients are unable to locally access vital diagnostic services. Your petitioners request the House to protect the public's interest and provide equitable access to the Medicare system for inner western Sydney residents by licensing MRI diagnostic services at the Concord Repatriation and General Hospital. by Mr Murphy (from 1,354 citizens). Petitions received. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Obese Children",56
148,Ms PLIBERSEK,PETITIONS,"Sydney) (3.44 p.m.)I move: That this House: (1) notes that the percentage of Australian children who are overweight or obese is increasing; and (2) commits itself to promoting measures to increase fitness and encourage healthy lifestyles. Obesity is increasing in Australian children. Almost one in four children is overweight or obese. The numbers of overweight and obese children have increased substantially in recent years, and the health effects for those children as they grow into adulthood are very serious indeed. Of course, we do not want to cause a panic and we do not want to stigmatise overweight children, or overweight people generally, nor contribute to societal pressures which lead other young people to eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, but somewhere there has to be a healthy middle ground. As a community, we have to encourage healthier exercise and eating habits and teach our children good habits for the future. Recent studies looking at adults estimate that 67 per cent of Australian men and 52 per cent of Australian women aged 25 years and over are overweight or obese. It is no wonder then that between 19 and 23 per cent of children, depending on age, are overweight or obese. In the 10-year period from 1985 to 1995, the level of combined overweight and obese children in Australia has more than doubled, whilst the level of obesity tripled in all age groups for both sexes. Obesity costs the whole community due to the increased health costs of associated illnesses and of course the lost productivity also associated with that ill health. Estimates for 1995-96, which are the most recent ones I could lay my hands on, suggest that the cost of obesity to the Australian community is between $680 million and $1.239 billion per annumvery substantial costs indeed. This is a phenomenon that is not limited to Australia and is evident in most developed countries, where the availability of high-calorie foods combined with decreased activity has led to similar outcomes as those here. We are second only to the US, though, in those levels of the overweight and obese. I think that this needs looking at, because countries such as the Netherlands that have similar levels of societal wealth have not seen obesity increase to the same extent. Children themselves identify the greatest immediate problem associated with obesity as the teasing and social isolation that they face. We have to stop that teasing, but the other effects are equally serious and not as readily identified by the children themselves. The sorts of effects I am talking about are gastrointestinal illnesses, endocrine illnesses or certain orthopaedic problems that children of normal weight are not as likely to develop. Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called late onset diabetes, is becoming evident in adolescence earlier and earlier. Overweight children and obese children are more likely to grow into overweight or obese adults, and there are any number of associated ill health effects that I am sure most of us are aware of. The New South Wales government took this issue very seriously and instituted a New South Wales Childhood Obesity Summit in September last year. I believe the Victorian government also had a similar summit. The communique from the New South Wales government summit is very well worth reading. It lays out any number of very sensible suggestions for dealing with this problem. It is very important that governments of all levels work with parents and schools to help children develop healthy eating and exercise habits. The best way to do that is for whole families to gradually change the way they eat and the sorts of recreational activities they pursue. To make changes that benefit whole families, firstly we need to help parents better balance work and family. The growth in overtime, particularly unpaid overtime, means that parents have much less time to take kids to sport, to sport practice and to sporting events on the weekend. On the weekends parents are catching up with grocery shopping and cleaning, which means that they are also not able to participate in active recreation with their children. So a cut back in unpaid overtime and making sure that families actually have reasonable time for recreation is probably the first and most important thing that we as governments can do to support families in changing the way they recreate. We should also consider making it easier for families to afford to have their kids in sporting activities. A lot of families cannot afford the registration and the gear that goes along with joining the local soccer club. We should examine ways of making those sports more affordable, including perhaps looking at exemption from the GST as something to consider. Secondly, governments need to participate in making neighbourhoods safer. Obviously parents who are worried about their children walking to school or playing unsupervised after school are much more likely to drive kids to school or discourage them from riding bikes. This is the way that most people used to get their regular exercise-just walking to school. It is something that a lot of young children are missing out on today. Governments can help with this by improving urban design and by supporting safety house programs, neighbourhood centres and youth services which provide supervised play. Local councils can help support setting up groups for children to walk to school together. Thirdly, as parents we can turn off the electronic babysitter. There is no question that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to develop weight problems. Data from the New South Wales Child Health Survey 2001 found that 40 per cent of children aged five to 12 years watched about two hours or more of television or videos a day on average, and 15 per cent reported playing computer games for an hour or more a day on average. A lot of those kids are also snacking in front of the TV. When they are doing that they are more likely to eat more and to eat less healthy foods, especially because of the barrage of advertising that is aimed at kids. The Australian Divisions of General Practice issued a study at the end of February that showed that 99 per cent of food advertisements on TV are for foods with little nutritional value. The study also showed that during the summer holidays children would have watched an average of three hours and 22 minutes of junk food advertising alone. With those sorts of messages it is pretty easy to understand why kids are reaching for unhealthy snacks rather than healthier alternatives. As governments, we can encourage children to be active while they are at school and provide support for in school programs, after school programs and out of school hours care programs that encourage physical activity. We need to make it clear to kids that you do not have to be perfect at a sport to go out and get some exercise, that just moving is important. If you do not like netball and you do not like soccer, go bushwalking or go ballroom dancing. It does not really matter as long as there is some physical activity involved. We need to take account of gender and ethnic differences to make sure that groups of kids are not missing out because of a lack of availability of culturally appropriate facilities for them. As parents, we need to teach children healthy eating habits. That starts with supporting breastfeeding, and governments have a very important role to play there. It also means that where parents are not able to provide healthy food for their children-or are not interested in doing sogovernments need to support schools that provide breakfast or after-school snack programs and make sure that those programs actually provide healthy food for kids. Those kids are bound to see a dramatic increase in their school performance if they do simple things like have breakfast. There is a great deal of evidence to show that the changes such programs make to children's diets and educational outcomes are quite striking. I know that most parents are striving to do the best they can for their kids, and my comments today are not designed to increase the guilt and worry that many parents have already-at the end of the day, no-one benefits from guilt and stress. But if we work together to raise healthier children, the potential benefits are enormous.",59
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded? Ms King-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,61
150,Mr BILSON,PETITIONS,"I rise to support the motion put before the House by the member for Sydney. The motion calls upon us to do two things: note the increase in the percentage of children who are overweight and obese, and promote measures to increase fitness and encourage healthy lifestyles amongst young people. The most recent estimates of the levels of excess weight in the adult population in Australia come from the 1999-2000 Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study. According to that study, about seven million people-or 60 per cent of the adult population-were either overweight or obese and this rate has almost doubled since 1980. Sadly, the situation is similar for children and adolescents. Through a comparison of two national surveys conducted in 1985 and 1995, it was revealed that 20 to 25 per cent of children aged between five and 18 years were considered either overweight or obese. The figure has doubled in that 10-year period. The main issue from that is that the research suggests young people who are obese or overweight carry that condition into their adult life. We know of the huge health risks associated with persistent obesity in adult life and the significant long-term consequences for the individual and for the nation through additional health costs and the like. Obesity in childhood is also associated with high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels and high insulin levels. Type 2 diabetes, once thought of as an adult disease, is now appearing in children. Thankfully, by recognising the positive initiatives that the member for Sydney referred to, there are a number of things that can be done. An excellent article on nutrition by Rosemary Stanton appeared in the 11 October 2002 edition of Australian Doctor. I am encouraged by some of the steps that have already been taken by the Howard government, including an integrated range of measures and initiatives to address the problem in a cross-sector way. There is no one silver bullet for this. There are many elements to a responsible strategy to address childhood obesity, a number of which are already being pursued by the government. The national clinical guidelines for the management of excess weight and obesity in adults and children is an Australian first that provides doctors and health care professionals with some basic information and an evidence based guide on how best to manage and treat overweight people and obesity. There is also funding through the NHMRC to update the current dietary guidelines for adults, children and adolescents. The National Child Nutrition Program provides $15 million in community grants to improve the nutrition and long-term eating patterns of children aged between one and 12 years. That project addresses some of the concerns the member for Sydney alluded to about the kinds of food and healthy lifestyle messages that are going out to children-not only in their own homes but also in places where others have a responsibility and an input into their care, management and well-being. Programs for before and after school hours have been mentioned. Rosemary Stanton points to an audit of the type of food available through school canteens to children from kindergarten through to year 12. Quite rightly, she also tackles the issue of advertising. Frankly, I find it curious that the food industry does not accept that its advertising influences what children eat and drink and that those choices contribute to the rising incidence of obesity. If it is having no influence on the eating patterns of children, why is the industry advertising? It seems to be a given that something needs to be done. In my view, the General Practitioners Association has put forward some very interesting data. There is a lot more I could say but, in the time available, let me point to a few things we could do. Two very forward-looking individuals in my electorate, Powell Cooper and Mark Luca, are trying to make healthy food spunky and cool in the eyes of young people. They are trying to counter some of those messages you see in the media that encourage children to eat junk food. My son knows that one junk food day a week is plenty. Maybe giving out the message that junk food or fun food is okay in moderation is an appropriate thing to do, but there is a lot of fun to be had eating healthy food. There are also some issues around encouraging access to drinking water-even making sure that our publicly funded facilities in schools and military installations are available for broader community use. We should provide resources and invest in those things. At the end of the day we need to get one big message out: a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating equals a better life and should be embraced by all. (Time expired)",61
151,Ms KING,PETITIONS,"Childhood obesity is a growing health crisis in this country and it is one that we cannot ignore. Obesity amongst children is increasing not only in prevalence but at a faster rate than ever before. I would like to echo the comments of the member for Sydney when she said that we do not want to stigmatise children who experience obesity or who are overweight. Nor do we want to promote unhealthy body images through some of the programs we implement. But we need to do something. We need to create circumstances where parents are supported to help their children to not only lose weight but also participate in sport and physical activity. Childhood obesity will have serious implications for our health system both now and in the future with increased rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. It has been estimated that direct health costs of childhood obesity alone are around $830 million per year. A study published in the January edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows the rate of obesity and being overweight in Australian children aged between seven and 15 years of age has doubled since 1995. Childhood obesity is estimated to be rising at about one per cent per year-a trend which, if continued, will see half of all young Australians overweight by 2025. A number of causes are cited for the growing epidemic: a more sedentary lifestyle, proliferation of fast foods, decreased outdoor play and leisure opportunities, rising costs of participation in sport, lack of balance in the level of advertising to which children are exposed regarding fast foods and decreased time available to parents to help kids eat well. As with many areas of public health, we have a pretty good idea of what the causes are and we also have a pretty good idea of what the solutions are. Some of them raised recently include encouraging and supporting breastfeeding more actively and promoting maternal nutrition; creating more conducive environments within schools to encourage participation rather than competition in sport and physical activity-this requires us to focus a great deal more of our sport funding on local and community sporting organisations rather than focusing exclusively, as the government does, on elite athletes; creating more conducive environments in schools for healthy eating, including looking at how food is sold in school canteens; supporting food industry efforts that adopt socially responsible methods of advertising to children; and introducing incentives to families to enrol their children local sporting clubs and other physical activities. Put simply, we need to direct more money towards creating an environment where people find it easier to eat well and move more. Public health funding in this country, despite the rhetoric, continues at low levels. We spend around two per cent of our total health budget on programs to do with preventing disease-two per cent of the budget is spent on preventing communicable diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease and injury. In rough terms, this sees the remaining bulk of the health budget being spent on treatment of all diseases, with a smaller proportion being spent on trying to cure people of preventable diseases. It seems a ludicrous situation in 21st century, where we have the means at our disposal to prevent many diseases and injuries, that we only spend two per cent of our health budget doing so. We have the means at our disposal to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity and subsequent health problems. Each year we talk about it and say that we have to do something; each year we shake our heads and continue to spend proportionally the same small amount on public health as we have for the last 20 years. In tackling childhood obesity we should not expect any miracle cures, but there are some examples of where our concerted efforts have worked in the past. As a nation we have led the world in reducing communicable diseases and, whilst we have a long way to go, we have led the world in reducing our road toll. Childhood obesity is no less of a challenge, and we should support parents in creating a better environment where children can eat well and move more.",62
152,Mrs DRAPER,PETITIONS,"The motion moved by the member for Sydney asks this House to note the increasing problem of childhood obesity and to commit itself to encouraging healthy lifestyles. I commend the member for Sydney for her efforts in this area. However, we can all be encouraged by the fact that, as far back as 1997, the report Acting on Australia's weight: a strategic plan for the prevention of overweight and obesity recognised for the in first time at a national level the seriousness of the problem. As a result, the government established the National Obesity Prevention Group, chaired by Professor Ian Caterson of the University of Sydney. Two working groups were established, one dealing specifically with obesity in children and adolescents. In August 1999 a symposium entitled ‘Acting on Australia's weight: children and families' was held. The symposium brought together people from a variety of backgrounds to discuss and exchange ideas about how to encourage healthier lifestyle choices among Australians, particularly our young people. To build on the information from these two sources, the government commissioned the experts in the field to research and recommend intervention and prevention strategies that would specifically address childhood obesity. Professor Caterson's National Obesity Prevention Group highlighted the problem of the lack of a standard definition of overweight and obesity for children, which made it difficult to properly assess the extent of the problem in this country. As a result, the government commissioned a group of experts to develop an Australian standard. The National Health and Medical Research Council is also developing national clinical guidelines for weight control and obesity management for use by general practitioners. In this place on 2 December 2002, I reported on the forum on childhood obesity, which I had the honour of attending and opening on 29 November. Organised by Senator Guy Barnett and held in Launceston, the forum highlighted the work that was already being undertaken and canvassed further ideas and suggestions for dealing with this health problem. It was a very productive and worthwhile exercise which, as I again reported in this place on 5 December, led to discussions between the advertising industry, representatives of food and beverage companies and the government's health and ageing policy committee, which I chair, about the possibility of establishing a national advertising campaign to inform and educate the community on the dangers of childhood obesity and to encourage healthy lifestyles with exercise and a balanced diet. On 22 September 2002, the Hon. Larry Anthony, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, announced that the first steps had been taken towards establishing a national agenda for early childhood. At that time he provided statistical reasons for establishing an agenda on such matters as child abuse and neglect, child literacy and numeracy, childhood obesity, mental illness and suicide and Indigenous children, among others. A consultation paper has been developed and was released for public comment as recently as 20 February this year. Recognition is given in the introduction to the already considerable investment in services for family and children nationally and by state and local governments. But what is needed is a better understanding of what all of the government and, indeed, non-government sector agencies are doing. I was pleased to read of support for this agenda by Professor Fiona Stanley, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth. Professor Stanley has said: I support the coalition government's decision to work towards a national agenda for early childhood wholeheartedly and, with others, have been advocating for just such an approach to be government priority for a number of years. The government made it clear right from the beginning that the welfare of children would be a major priority. It was the first government ever to provide a ministry specifically focusing on children and young people. The development of the National Agenda for Early Childhood is, in no small part, due to this initiative and the hard work and dedication of the minister. I add that, as previous speakers have stated, we do need to be careful about stigmatising children who do have weight problems. We need to support our families and children in achieving a better lifestyle.",63
153,Ms ROXON,PETITIONS,"I too would like to support the comments made by previous speakers on this important issue of childhood obesity and to make the comment that I think underlies all of the previous speakers' concerns that childhood obesity is an issue for people not just when they are young children but also as they turn into young adults and older people and they carry further into their lives the health issues that arise from having suffered from childhood obesity at a young age. The importance given to, and concern about, the issues raised by other speakers, particularly the member for Sydney, are legitimate. We want to deal with this issue very early on rather than see it turn into an ongoing health problem for a large section of our community. Indeed, the Institute of Health and Welfare has told us that one in five Australian children between the ages of five and 18 are overweight or obese and that that figure has doubled since 1986. So it is a pretty dramatic change and one that we need to be concerned about. We should also be aware of the other health issues that can affect young people if they become overly concerned with body image. I must say that, although some comments have been made and some positive steps are being taken by the government on this issue, we are not really seeing action at a level that we would expect to see if the one in five children suffering from childhood obesity were one in five businesses going to the wall or one in five executives having heart attacks-the government would be there in a stantly trying to provide a solution. Sadly for Australian children, there is not the sense of immediacy nor the immediate response that we would like to see from the government. This debate gives us an opportunity to put on the table some of the issues that we would like to see addressed. A number of other speakers have raised the concern that we do not want to blame parents and their children but that we do need to provide them active encouragement to participate in their children's and their own health and to look at the barriers that prevent many children from having a healthy and happy childhood. We do need to address this much more actively. Among a number of options that others have spoken about is the research and other work that has been done by the Australian Divisions of General Practice. Their audit of TV advertising looked at the level of exposure that Australian children have to fast food and junk food as each week. We have a lot of other levers and, particularly at the Commonwealth level, we do put a lot of money into other health programs, child-care programs and sporting programs. We need to build a component into those programs that looks at their capacity to encourage children to be active and to participate in a healthy lifestyle, whether it is by eating nutritiously or the activities that they are involved in. I would like to comment briefly on two reports. The government's own Youth Pathways report, which has largely been ignored, did undertake extensive consultations with young people across the country and, through that process, young people raised the issue of the lack of sporting and recreational opportunities available to them, particularly in many outer suburban and rural and regional areas, not to mention in the inner city, highly built-up areas. The message from young people was very clear: they want to be out there and be more active but they do not always have the money or the facilities to be able to do so. Our own youth survey, which was conducted during last year's National Youth Week, also indicated that sport was an issue which many young people were interested in. However, it made an important distinction by identifying, as the member for Sydney mentioned, that active participation in things like dance and music and not just in your traditional sporting areas was something that young people were seeking opportunities to do and they were not always getting the support or assistance to participate in them from government programs. I would also encourage the government to look at the success of existing breakfast programs-ideas such as the walking bus program run by some schools to encourage kids to walk to school in groups; the use of after school or vacation care programs as an opportunity to encourage and introduce kids to sport and dance and other active actions that would help them live a more mobile lifestyle; introducing them to some nutritious ways of eating different types of food; and to encourage parents to participate in looking after the healthy and active lives of their young children. There is something that all of us can do in this area, but governments also have a particular role to play in making sure that they build these ideas into the programs that they fund.",64
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Tourism Industry Debate resumed from 23 September, on motion by Mrs Gash: That this House: (1) recognises the positive contribution of this Government in encouraging the tourism industry in Australia; (2) notes the impact of external factors on the local industry; (3) recognises the contribution of local and regional tourism to the national economy; (4) acknowledges the important role of local and regional tourism in providing employment opportunities for young people; and (5) recognises the need for more equitable dismissal laws for small business to ensure greater employment opportunities are made available by employers in the tourism industry.",65
155,Mrs MAY,PETITIONS,"As the member for the electorate of MCPherson, which represents a large part of Australia's tourism capital-the Gold Coast-I am particularly pleased to support the member for Gilmore's motion on tourism. Tourism is vital to Queensland's economy, contributing over $6 billion and employing 150,000 people in 1999. It is Queensland's second largest export earner, generating $3.5 billion annually. The Gold Coast benefits directly from this successful industry. We have over 9,000 tourism related businesses on the Gold Coast and, in the year ending June 2002, we attracted more than 784,000 international visitors-and that was post September 11, when terrorism and the threat of terrorism were seeing people change their travel plans. Even though these figures sound good, they in fact indicate a downturn in overseas tourism to the Gold Coast, and further figures indicate that there has been no increase in overseas tourists to Australia for the six years. A recent report from AR Midwood Pty Ltd indicates that data collected on vals in Australia shows a 17 per cent rise in total visitors in the five years 1997 to 2001 but the holiday tourist category has seen a one per cent fall in the five years 1997 to 2001, with a possible fall of five per cent 2002. The importance of this for the Gold Coast is that overseas visitor numbers have fallen 20 per cent in five years, from 976,000 in 1996 to 784,000 in 2002. Overseas visitors now make up only 18 per cent of Gold Coast visitors compared with 28 per cent in 1996. But all is not gloom and doom. The domestic tourism market and drive market has been doing extremely well on the Gold Coast-in fact, the Gold Coast Tourism Bureau has reported a bumper Christmas period, with visitor nights increasing by 17 cent in the year ending September 2002. But we cannot be complacent and, with the events of September 11 and Bali, we must build a strong industry that continues to the support of the federal government. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the Hon. Joe Hockey, for the vision and continuing enthusiasm he has shown since he was appointed to the tourism portfolio. The minister, who describes the Gold Coast as ‘the engine room of Australian tourism', put a discussion paper on the table for the industry. The discussion paper was a tool to stimulate debate on plans for the dustry over the next 10 years. From that discussion paper the minister has developed a blueprint for the industry-a plan that will see the industry grow and prosper as Australia's fourth largest export dollar earner. The tourism industry is the second largest employer in Australia. On the Gold Coast, with over 9,000 tourism related businesses, it is our largest employer. But, of course, there would be even more opportunities in the industry, particularly for young people, if employers were not burdened by restrictive labour laws. This problem can be fixed with support from the opposition in the Senate for the fair dismissal law. The federal government has supported the tourism industry with some innovative and past exciting funding programs. My own electorate has benefited from a number of these arriregional programs, and this funding has helped stimulate the local tourism market on the Gold Coast. Late last year the federal government refunded the Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Tourism, loin cated at Griffith University on the Gold Coast, to the tune of $26.7 million. I believe this is a small price to pay to support research into an industry which contributes over $70 billion annually to the Australian economy. Despite tourism's contribution to the Australian economy in terms of export dollars and jobs for young people, particularly in regional and rural areas, there is more to be done. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the Hon. Joe Hockey, has laid per down a very comprehensive 10-year plan for the industry. This white paper has been subject to two periods of industry and stakeholder consultations. This has resulted have in what could be the most innovative, impressive and workable plan for the tourism industry in Australian history. This plan includes a focus on investment and infrastructure, domestic and international tourism, product development, sustainability and risk management. Tourism cannot be allowed to continue to develop in its present ad hoc manner. The onus is on the government to look ahead and develop a strategic plan to retain and capture a greater share of the inin- creasingly sophisticated tourism market. To not have a plan and to underestimate the demands of the global traveller would waste our competitive advantage and would prove to be very costly in the long term. We need to support the minister in his endeavours to ensure our market share in tourism does grow and that we have in place strategies to cushion any downturn that could result from unforeseen events in the future.",65
156,Ms HOARE,PETITIONS,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this discussion and thank the member for Gilmore for moving a motion on the important issue of regional tourism in this place. Labor stands as a strong advocate of Australian tourism. That is why Labor Friends of Tourism-Labor members of parliament and senators who will work to raise awareness in the community of the economic importance of the tourism industry-was established. I am a member of this group. The Howard government fails to take the industry seriously, leaving the minister with specific responsibility for tourism out of cabinet and not treating the industry on the same basis as manufacturing, mining, agriculture or any other sector with such importance to the Australian economy. Tourism is the great underrated performer of the Australian economy. The industry generated $17.1 billion in export earnings in 2001, making it our largest single export-worth more than wool and wheat combined. The tourism industry's value to Australia goes far beyond revenue figures. Tourism is a relatively labour intensive industry, employing over half a million people-six per cent of Australia's work force. Much of that employment is available to young people, including those outside the capital cities. Labor understands that Australia needs jobs with a future, sustainable economies in regional and rural Australia, and high export earnings. Tourism delivers on all counts. Since it was slugged with the GST, the industry has generated a massive share of government tax revenue-$5.5 billion in the 2000-01 financial year. Labor regards the tourism industry with the respect it deserves I have a strong commitment to and an ongoing interest in tourism and I recognise the enormous potential of tourism in my electorate of Charlton. The Charlton electorate covers approximately half the land area of the City of Lake Macquarie. The city is made up of 90 small towns and communities which surround the lake of the same name, the largest coastal saltwater lake in Australia. Lake Macquarie is four times the size of Sydney Harbour and has a perimeter of 174 kilometres. Lake Macquarie was declared a recreational fishing area after the cessation of commercial fishing on 1 May 2002. It includes the Watagan National Park to the west and is a short distance from the Hunter Valley vineyards and Port Stephens. I like to refer to Lake Macquarie as the ‘Gateway to the Hunter'. Established industries include mining services, transport, engineering and engineering products. There is steady growth in industrial and commercial industry. Tourism is also a major industry in the region, with enormous potential given its proximity to Sydney. The Lake Macquarie Tourism Board the was launched in March 2000. This association, together with Lake Macquarie City Council, was successful in its application for funding under the Regional Assistance Program for its project ‘Facilitating tourism growth in Lake Macquarie's small towns and communities' to develop tourism and employment opportunities in the Lake Macquarie area. I would like to pay tribute to the work being done by Kate Ramzan-Levy, the Product Manager Tourism with Lake Macquarie Tourism Board and Lake Macquarie City Council. Kate is currently working with 11 different small towns and communities in Lake Macquarie, nine of which are in the electorate of Charlton. The work being undertaken is organising, coordinating and participating in community workshops under the small towns and communities program. The participating towns and communities in Charlton are Bolton Point, Marmong Point, Warners Bay, Toronto, Teralba, Rathmines, Wangi Wangi, West Wallsend and Southlakes. The involvement by members of these communities is a reflection of their dedication to their town and a willingness on their part to develop this industry and promote their locality. I strongly support the work being done by the Lake Macquarie Tourism Board and members of the Lake Macquarie Tourism Association. One such member is Mr Keith Jansen, the owner and operator of Lake Macquarie Cruises. Keith is the largest tourism operator in Lake Macquarie and has been operating for 18 years. Keith informed me that Lake Macquarie is dear to his heart, and he works hard to promote it. Last year Lake Macquarie Cruises transported 26,000 tourists and visitors to Lake Macquarie. This figure was down on the previous year, 2001, when 30,000 visitors cruised the lake on his vessels. Keith says the figures were down last year due to the downturn in the number of inbound tourists because of international events-people were reluctant to travel. This year, Lake Macquarie Cruises have budgeted for an increase in inbound tourism. When speaking with Keith, he said to me: This is the first time in 18 years of trading from an official body has ever asked me for figures. He went on to say: It takes a lot of hard yakka to encourage inbound tourism and any government assistance would be appreciated. Tourism operators and employees deserve recognition and unstinting support from governments at all levels. They have not received nearly enough recognition and support from the Howard government, and I now call on the government to redress this situation.",67
157,Mr NAIRN,PETITIONS,"Eden-Monaro) (4.23 p.m.)Tourism is one of the major industries in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. The South Coast and the Snowy Mountains are renowned across the country and overseas as places for a great holiday experience. Both areas are particularly reliant on tourism. In 1998, there were almost 3,000 tourism related businesses in the South Coast region and almost 200 in the Snowy Mountains. In 1999, domestic visitors spent $861 million in the South Coast region and over $300 million in the Snowy Mountains. International visitors spent $30 million in the South Coast region in 1998 and $8 million in the Snowy Mountains and Capital Country. Domestic tourism in the South Coast region remained fairly flat over the year ending September 2002, although the number of day visitors increased by 10 per cent. Domestic visitor nights in the Snowy Mountains increased by 22 per cent in the year ending September 2002 and day visitors increased by 47 per cent. While these figures paint a generally healthy picture for tourism in Eden-Monaro, the recent bushfires in Kosciuszko National Park have led to a completely different outlook, in the short term at least. The forced evacuation of parts of the Snowy Mountains and the destruction of a large part of the national park have resulted in the usually high number of tourists in the summer months staying away. Sarah Young is the proprietor of Crackenback Farm and Cottages on the Alpine Way at Jindabyne. Before the fires came she employed 12 local people at the popular tourist anyone stop on the way to Thredbo. When I visited the business recently with the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Wilson Tuckey, the closed sign was up. Ms Young told us she had no choice but to let her workers go. That is an aspect of the way this has impacted on businesses. Fire came very close-more than close-to Ms Young's place. Parts of the grounds were burnt out, but the business was saved. The problem was that nobody could drive up the Alpine Way. The closed sign went up at the Alpine Way because nobody was allowed through to Thredbo because of the fires. Therefore, Ms Young had absolutely no passing traffic from that point on, and it just closed down the business-as it would have if the fire had actually gone right through her business. The really disappointing thing with what has occurred in the Snowy Mountains is that people in the Snowy Mountains area have worked so hard over a number of years to extend their tourist period. The Snowy Mountains is often thought of as a winter destination-people go up there to ski-but gradually over the years that tourism time has been extended. Summer, Easter, the October long weekend et cetera are all now favourite times for people to go up there, and there are great events happening. Over the last couple of years, Tourism Snowy Mountains, under chair, David Last, has certainly done a great job in that sense. The Chambers of Commerce in Thredbo and Jindabyne and the people at Perisher have been working extremely hard to extend the tourism period, but the fires through January and February have devastated the summer tourism period. What happened to Sarah Young was a fairly familiar situation for the whole of the Snowy Mountains. It was going to be a bumper summer, but it turned sour very quickly. The Thredbo Blues Festival is one of the biggest events on the area's calendar. It had to be cancelled with just hours notice because of the fire evacuations. Businesses rely on the festival as their major source of income for the summer. The flow-on effect of that has been felt by a number of the businesses there. The Howard government has been quick to act. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, went up there to see exactly what had occurred. He used the occasion to launch the 2003 round of the Regional Tourism Program. Importantly, this time around priority will be given to drought and bushfire affected areas and the scope extended to include funding for events. The Minister for Employment Services, Mal Brough, has been quick to act on representations from me about extending the Work for the Dole program, Drought Force, which was put in place for the drought affected areas, to bushfire affected areas as well. I have also written to all members of this parliament, inviting them to spend a weekend in the Snowy Mountains between a sitting period. Any extra business would be extremely welcomed at this time. Every effort is being made in the Snowy Mountains to get things back to normal as soon as possible. For these reasons I fully support the motion put forward in the House by the member for Gilmore.",68
158,Ms VAMVAKINOU,PETITIONS,"I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Gilmore with respect to the tourism industry. It is however regrettable that I have not been able to find too many examples of the government's positive contribution to the tourism industry. In fact, on the contrary, the government's track record in this area has been fairly mediocre, if not poor. Instead of instilling confidence in the nation's $71 billion tourist industry, this government has repeatedly engaged in decisions and actions that have created uncertainty, to say the least. Granted, you cannot talk about the current state of our tourism industry without referring to the events of 11 September 2001events that have had a significant impact right across the industry and, we all agree, have had a negative impact on what was once a very lucrative industry. But we cannot explain away the progressive decline in the tourism industry simply on the back of September 11. To do so would-as I dare say this motion seeks to do-give the government a convenient excuse to explain its own failure in this area as simply a case of events beyond its control. There are other significant factors that have contributed to the parlous state of our tourism industry-factors that were, and are, very much in the area of government control. Of course I refer to the collapse of Ansett Australia and the loss of 16,000 jobs that resulted from it, an event that is very close to the heart of my electorate and the lives of the many ex-Ansett workers who live in Calwell-real people whose real lives were changed utterly by the inaction of the federal government. The extent to which this government failed these workers is best illustrated by the total lack of compassion it showed, the then minister for tourism labelling the crisis merely a ‘blip'. And who can forget the Deputy Prime Minister's insensitive response to the plight of Ansett workers when he quickly referred to Ansett as a ‘carcass'? So much for acknowledging the contribution of local and regional communities in tourismMinister Hockey did not make himself available, for example, for a regional forum organised by me and the member for Burke when a deputation of regional community representatives came to Canberra in search of assistance from the federal government. We have a government whose vision for resolving problems in our tourism industry relies on first blaming the international climate and then making the bombastic claim that, if only the opposition would allow it to pass its unfair dismissal legislation, a miraculous occurrence would transpire: 40,000 jobs-this figure is often quoted-would suddenly be created, many of them in the tourism industry we are told, and this would inject a new lease of life; and on it goes. If only that were the case. On the contrary, such unfair dismissal laws would increase the uncertainty and fear already faced by those in tourist based employment-many of whom are young Australians, usually commencing their chosen career path for the first time. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in February 2003 show a second annual drop in the number of visitor arrivals and the first consecutive two-year drop in two decades. Following on from that, a report by the Tourism Forecasting Council indicated that export earning forecasts had been scaled back to $7.5 billion over the next 10 years. The report also showed that the domestic market was expected to lose momentum, that there would be no recovery in inbound tourism and that the recovery from September 11 would be slower than expected; yet Minister Macfarlane responds by warning the industry not to expect any additional funding and to prepare for the worse as the government tightens its belt in the face increased threats of war in Iraq. The long-awaited 10-year plan for tourism is yet to see the full light of day-I understand that we are still waiting for a cabinet response. This paper promised to tackle the big issues such as run-down and inadequate infrastructure, adequate research and statistics, delays in issuing visas, escalating and government charges, and a lack of suitable training opportunities in some regions. We have one original thought from Minister Hockey in a draft of a 10-year plan that focuses on targeting wealthy travellers and self-funded retirees to revive the tourist tor. Apparently the ‘shrimp on the barbie' tourist marketing campaign to mass inbound tourists-amongst the greatest marketing successes in our country's history-is in Minister Hockey's eyes the wrong way to go. Of course heads of Australia's tourism businesses do not all agree with the minister's prescription and argue that targeting the big tourist dollar spenders will not save us from the slump. A government that recognised the impact of external factors on the local industry would appreciate that, in this time of global and regional uncertainty, it needs to act. This government, however, continues to delay and takes a passive approach to the industry. The problem is compounded when the actions of our Prime Minister have begun to isolate us within our region-a region that we strongly rely on for tourist dollars. Our neighbours are watching developments in this country with apprehension and concern. There is an increasingly negative view of Australia as arrogant and belligerent. (Time expired)",69
159,Mr HARTSUYKER,PETITIONS,"I welcome the motion proposed by the member for Gilmore. The member for Gilmore and I share a common interest with respect to the value of the tourism industry to both regional Australia and the nation. As the federal member for an electorate which extends from South West Rocks to Yamba, I am fortunate to reside in a part of Australia that tourists love to visit. On the New South Wales North Coast we are blessed with some naturally beautiful areas. For example, the Nambucca River, the World Heritage listed of Dorrigo National Park and Split Solitary marine park all add to the tourism experience. Such drawcards are complemented by man made attractions such as Trial Bay Gaol, the Big Banana and its ski slope, white-water rafting and the Coffs Harbour pet porpoise pool. All of these attractions can be enjoyed while staying in any of a range of accommocosts dation choices which exist on the North Coast-everything from youth hostels for the adventure traveller right up to the resort experiences available to the visitor in the Cowper electorate. We all know how important tourism is to secour nation. In Australia, tourism directly contributes 4.7 per cent of our GDP and provides over half a million jobs directly and some 340,000 more jobs indirectly. It contributes over $17 billion in export income, or 11.2 per cent of our total exports. It contributes over $54 billion to the national economy through spending by domestic visitors. Such statistics correctly highlight tourism as one of Australia's largest industries and an important driver of economic activity in this country. However, recent circumstances have caused considerable difficulty for the Australian tourism industry. The terrorist attacks in the United States and Bali, the collapse of Ansett and economic instability in some of our key markets have resulted in a significant drop in the number of arrivals from our leading international markets. It was impossible for us as a nation to prepare for such events, but thankfully Australia has a federal government which has responded to the circumstances. The federal government has introduced a number of measures to help overcome the effects of these occurrences. For example, the Ansett Holiday Package Relief Scheme provided $15 million in relief funding to tourism businesses directly impacted by the collapse of Ansett. The federal government introduced the Holiday Incentive Program whereby a $150 rebate was offered to encourage Australians to take a domestic holiday. All of these measures sought to reduce the impact of the inevitable downturn in tourism as a result of Ansett's demise and September 11. Additionally, the Regional Tourism Program is assisting the development of tourism attractions and facilities and special interest, ual. cultural and heritage attractions. That will develop regional tourism. The last budget committed $8 million worth of funds to the See Australia partnership initiative. This tiative is designed to encourage Australians to take a domestic holiday and it has a particular focus on rural and regional Australia. The budget also provided $8 million in grant funding for the project. These initiatives will support the regions by encouraging international visitors to visit and stay longer periods in areas outside the major metropolitan capitals. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism announced on 17 February that he was encouraging regional tourism ventures which had been affected by the bushfires and drought to apply for help under the Regional Tourism Program. This will be welcomed by tourism operators in the Cowper electorate. Whilst we have had substantial rain in recent weeks, many businesses and communities will continue to feel the effects of the drought for some time to come, and this $8 million initiative and the encouragement from the minister is a good example of how the government can assist. For young people living in regional Australia, tourism can be the difference between securing employment and having to leave their home town. We should never underestimate the opportunities which exist for young people who are looking for a start in their working life either during or following the completion of their studies. In that sense, tourism is at the heart of the future for many individuals and families in my electorate. It is therefore essential that the economic settings and workplace conditions provide the incentive for businesses to employ more people. Economically, the coalition government has taken every step to ensure that tourism businesses have the opportunity to flourish. When the public liability industry was on the verge of collapse, the federal government led from the front by getting all of the state and territory governments together and implementing a coordinated reform package. That leadership has seen the federal parliament pass legislation which has instilled some balance in relation to negligence and the responsibility of the individUnfortunately, the Labor Party is yet to recognise that, by the refinement of the unfair dismissal laws in this country, businesses ini- involved in tourism would be able to employ more people. As I have noted in the parliament in the past, research figures indicate that some 77,000 people are missing out on jobs because of the current regime of unfair dismissal laws. Sixty thousand of these jobs are specifically not occurring in small business, and many of these jobs would be in tourism. I know all of my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House can see the current value of tourism to the regional economy of Australia, but the full potential value of this industry is yet to be realised.

160,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,PETITIONS,"I have mixed views about speaking today on this motion moved by the member for Gilmore. It is worthwhile for this House to note that there is a significant impact of external factors on the local tourist industry. Though we may disagree about what those factors are, it is fair to agree the mover of this motion that the contribution of local and regional tourism to the national economy should be recognised. It is also fair to say that this House should acknowledge the important role of local and regional tourism in providing employment opportunities, particularly for young people. In those areas of the motion, I concur with the mover and speakers in favour. However, there are some provisions of this motion that I cannot support. For example, I cannot support this government being in any way acknowledged as a contributor to this industry. The fact remains that, if you were to try to convince people of that, you would have to argue with 17,000 Ansett workers who do not have jobs any more, as well as with the thousands of other employees who were without a job after the Ansett collapse. Whilst I do not suggest that the government was solely responsible for the collapse of Ansett, it is fair to say-and most independent analysis that has been considered since the collapse would say-that the government failed to act proactively in any way to prevent Ansett's collapse. That is the case with respect to this government. They failed to look after one of the largest companies of this country-one of the largest domestic airlines. The consequences of that have affected not only those 17,000 former Ansett employees and those others who no longer have jobs but also the price structure of domestic travel in this country, which is another thing that will debilitate the tourist industry, because it is more expensive to travel, given the fact that Qantas has effectively a monopoly in the domestic market of the aviation industry. That can hardly be an elephant stamp for either this government or the minister for tourism. Their aviation policy was a complete and abject failure and has had consequential adverse effects upon the tourist industry. That is one thing we should note when we are considering this motion, and it is a reason why I have to disagree with some of the previous speakers. It is also fair to say that this government has not provided a fantastic image of this with country overseas in recent times. I do not think the image that Australia gained when politicians in a domestic election alleged that people threw their children into the seaallegations now shown to be untrue-is the sort of image that would make people say, ‘That's the sort of place I would like to go and visit. They have such noble and honest politicians.' That image was portrayed as recently as November 2001. It is an image which is a disgrace. It has certainly sullied the image of this country and, therefore, that is also a reason why our tourist industry suffers. It is also fair to say that it is hard to explain to tourists who may want to travel to this place why we incarcerate children behind barbed wire. That is not a particularly innovative way in which to attract people to this country in any way. It is inhumane, and it is that sort of approach which has had this government condemned by many governments and spokespeople around the world on behalf of those who are suffering as a result of the policies of the government. Whilst that may not be anything that is primarily associated with the tourist industry, there is no doubt in my mind that those images that we portray globally as a result of the decisions by this government have not in any way assisted us in attracting people to this place. Finally, it is important to note that the way in which this government, and the Prime Minister in particular, have acted in a hawkish manner towards war and have wanted to move way ahead of the rest of the internanow tional community on war is not going to attract people to this country. It certainly will not have people believing that we are a safe haven or a safe place. The foreign policy and defence decisions of this government have only ensured that many people around the world will see us as a place which is not safe to travel to. Those decisions certainly have not increased the sense of security that we have as citizens in this country, and Australia is hardly a place that is more attractive to travel to now than it was some years ago.

161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for private members' business has expired. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Trade: General Agreement on Trade in Services,73
162,Ms PLIBERSEK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sydney) (4.44 p.m.)My grievance is against the Minister for Trade and his refusal to tell the Australian people what he is negotiating away in relation to the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement. The General Agreement on Trade in Services is being reviewed at the moment by members of the World Trade Organisation. Like the Multilateral Agreement on Investment several years ago, there is a great deal of concern in the community about the secrecy under which these negotiations are proceeding. The 1998 draft of OECD Multilateral Agreement on Investment attempted to reduce the powers of governments to regulate transnational investment and gave corporations the power to sue governments. It was to give transnational investors the right to compete for government funding for public services. Part of the reason the MAI collapsed was public resentment at the secrecy with which these negotiations were being carried out. Now the privatisation provisions of the MAI seem to be re-emerging in the current WTO negotiations on trade in services. The Australian government is also negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US-virtually in secret. It is impossible to get any direct answers to direct questions about what is on the table to be bargained away in these negotiations. When it comes to the US-Australia free trade agreement, Minister Vaile has specifically said that nothing is off the table. Indeed, when Mr Downer was asked about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, local content rules and the Foreign Investment Review Board, he said that if the US requested this ‘... obviously, that would be part of the negotiating process'. I am in favour of effective international trade and I do hope that international trade continues to increase. But that trade has to take place in an environment that benefits poor nations as well as wealthy ones, in a way that protects workers' rights and enhances the environment and does not allow a limited number of huge corporations to accrue unlimited profits. Fifty-one of the 100 biggest economies are companies rather than nations today. If the Australian government believes that trade liberalisation will be fair and beneficial to workers and consumers, and that it will be good for the environment and poor countries, those negotiations should be able to take place in public, with public scrutiny. The government should be prepared to trust the Australian public with information about what is being negotiated. The General Agreement on Trade in Services establishes a framework of rules for international trade in services. GATS was signed by the Australian government and other member nations of the WTO in 1994 the and came into force in 1995. Australia has been a signatory since its inception. Under GATS, WTO members can negotiate commitments to open specific service sectors to foreign competition and to afford foreign suppliers the same treatment as domestic suppliers. Members can also make commitments about the operation of their domestic regulation of services. However, the nature and extent of these commitments are strictly a matter of choice for member governments. Member governments can choose not to make commitments in a particular sector and the structure of commitments can discriminate between foreign and domestic suppliers. The current agreement covers only those services which each government has agreed to list in the agreement. Australia, at the time of the initial negotiations, very sensibly did not list public services like health and education. Of course, with this renegotiation there is no guarantee that public health, education and other services will not be listed in the future. That is what the Australian public really wants to know: are these things up for negotiation? Unlike most UN resolutions, but like other WTO agreements, GATS rules are legally binding on governments and can be enforced, if other governments complain, through the WTO dispute system. Under GATS negotiations, 22 countries have lodged formal requests for Australia to open up particular service industries to foreign competition, but the Howard government refuses to release those requests to the public. We do not even know what is being asked of us, let alone what we are going to give away. The sorts of things covered might be education, health, postal services, local content rules film and television, energy, water and telecommunications. The requests may also threaten the public provision of affordable education, health, telephone and postal services, transport and local council services. If you look at the current dispute between US, a private American courier service, and Canada Post, you will see that US is suing Canada Post for $250 million worth of damages because it claims that Canada Post has anticompetitive provisions. That is just the sort of thing that I fear might happen in Australia if these negotiations go ahead. The Australian government will make an initial offer to the World Trade Organisation to open up Australia's services to foreign competition by 31 March 2003. That is not far off at all. With those initial offers going out in such a short period of time, we deserve to know what is going to be offered on our behalf. So far, the Australian public has been given no indication of what those offers might be. Labor are opposed to relinquishing control of the nation's public institutions, such as our health and education services, in GATS negotiations. We will not support changes that undermine affordable access to essential public services or the right of governments to regulate services. Nor will we support changes that require the privatisation or contracting out of federal, state or local government services. Decisions about essential services should be made at local and national levels after open, democratic debate, not negotiated away in secret. WTO agreements often reflect the interests of not only the big economies-the US, Europe and Japan obviously dominate the negotiations-but also big corporations. Business organisations are frequently represented on government delegations. Indeed, the Australian delegation to Seattle had eight business representatives but no community representatives. Governments are very easily pressured by large global service corporations such as Columbia/HCA, the world's largest private hospital corporation, and Vivendi Water, the global water company which now runs Adelaide's water system. for The big corporations organise themselves into regional lobbying groups as well, so that they have even more power. Those groups include the US Coalition of Service Industries and the European Services Forum. They essentially see public services such as health, education and water services as potential multitrillion dollar markets and are all for government deregulation and getting rid of barriers to trade in these services. I think it is important that we remember that some services are not just commodities to be traded in the market and that access must not be dependent on income when you are talking about services that are essential to human well-being, such as health, education and sanitation. Also, some services are essential to the development of an economy. I certainly think that a service such as telecommunications deserves to have very careful thought applied to it when we are making these decisions that will affect the long-term future of the telecommunications industry in Australia. Core WTO principles require governments to treat foreign firms at least as well as domestic ones and to treat all foreign suppliers equally. Yet GATS rules potentially extend beyond this, restricting governments' abilities to make rules even if they apply equally to both domestic and foreign firms. There has been little discussion on the effects that service liberalisation will have on developing and transitional economies as well. We know that there is a great deal of evidence that shows that there can be disastrous effects with service liberalisation. If you look at the effects of some of the policies enforced by the World Bank and the IMF on developing and transitional economies, you can see that for local consumers they have been harsh indeed. The promises to consumers of increased competition may not materialise. We might just see multinational companies doing much better business and picking up much greater profits rather than any real increase in consumer rights. I am certainly not against increased international trade, but trade has to be fair and trade negotiations have to take place in a way that is transparent and that takes account of not just the ever-increasing demand for profits but also the rights of workers and protection of the environment and in a way that makes sure that people across the planet benefit equally. Queensland Racing Industry",73
163,Mr ENTSCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Leichhardt-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (4.54 p.m.)-At a time when rural communities throughout Queensland are struggling to recover from the ravages of drought, you would have thought that the Beattie Labor government would be doing all it can to help in the recovery process. Instead, we have the Queensland state government idly sitting by while we watch the death of country racing. The Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board, in its allocation of racing dates for the 2003-04 season, has dramatically slashed the number of meetings that will occur. The victims are only country tracks, with preferential treatment being given to boost racing in Brisbane, in the south-east corner of the state and in Townsville. Under Queensland Racing rules, Cairns races have been slashed from 38 to just 12, and Cairns will lose the very few TAB meetings that they have. I think they have about three or four a year. Races have also been lost at Mount Surprise, Coen and Georgetown; this year, unfortunately, we have also lost Chillagoe. We are also looking at the prospect of losing races in Laura, Cooktown, Mount Garnet, Oak Park and Einasleigh. Less than 12 months ago, the Queensland racing minister, Merri Rose, was singing the praises of country racing-or, as she preferred to call it, provincial racing. In a statement to the Courier-Mail in June 2002, the minister said, ‘The provinces are integral to the success of metropolitan racing.' Yet in praising country racing, Minister Rose was also sounding its death knell, lauding the formation of the Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board and giving them free rein, as she said, ‘to make decisions in the best interests of the entire racing industry'. What about the best interests of the many regional and rural communities that are going to be hurt by this decision? The Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board came into being in the last couple of years to replace the disgraced Queensland principal club which administered racing throughout the state. Some changes have occurred at the board level, but, as one of the local papers in my electorate quite rightly observed, Queensland Racing's philosophy appears not to have changed, ‘seemingly embracing the same fundamental principles of sticking the knife into country racing to make room for the south-east corner of the state'. As a result of Queensland Racing's decision, an estimated $10 million will be lost by rural communities across the state, at a time when they have already been devastated by drought and falling commodity prices. Trainers, jockeys, feed merchants and other race workers will be immediately affected by the decision to cut race meets. Community groups who benefit from fundraising at race meetings will also suffer. One of the major beneficiaries of bush racing over the yearsand rightly so-has been the Royal Flying Doctor Service. This will certainly have a significant impact on its capacity to obtain donated funds. The losses will be all the more bitter with the knowledge that the Beattie Labor government continues to get a windfall from TAB proceeds to the tune of some $50 million a year. Let me go through some of the clubs. As I said, Cairns is down from 38 meetings to 12. Cairns is a feeder for many other clubs in Far North Queensland. The reduced meetings will mean that there is a one-month block between races in the region. There will be a race on 26 April in Cairns but there will not then be another one in the area until a meeting in Innisfail on 24 May. The reality is that a lot of racehorses just cannot go that long without racing. They are being forced to relocate to places like Townsville, where the TAB meetings occur, to keep fit. This is at a huge cost to our trainers. One of our local racing personalities is Paula D'Addona, who owned a stable of approximately 24 horses in Cairns. She has had to relocate her stable to Townsville. Local jockey Frank Edwards has had to move to Townsville. Rob Koch owns four horses and is a member of the Cairns Jockey Club. I was talking to Rob the other day. He estimates that more than 1,000 people have been affected, directly or indirectly. As I said, these include racetrack riders, stable hands, farriers, feed merchants, vets and racing club stewards. The list just goes on. What is even more tragic is that we see the end of some of our very old and established bush carnival events that meet only one weekend a year. The Coen races, for example, ran from 1897 until 1999-for 102 years. Local families such as the Gostelows and the Shephards bred, owned, trained and rode their racehorses. Fortunately, that sort of thing is going on in Laura and Cooktown, although we are not sure for how long. Morris Shephard and Archie Armbrust were founding members of the Coen Jockey Club and very much the mainstays of the Coen races. Those races were very much a local community and family event. Morris's niece Doreen Quartermain from Watson River Station was one of a number of female jockeys. Archie's stepdaughter, Irene Taylor, who is 86 years young, was the patron of the club until it folded in 1999. The reason it folded is that it had become too expensive for the Coen Jockey Club to build the infrastructure that Queensland Racing demanded-equipment like photo finish towers, stewards' rooms et cetera. For one day or one weekend a year, the club could not afford to build that infrastructure, and so they had to close. In their wisdom, they donated all their infrastructure and equipment to Laura, so that at least one club was able to survive, given that it was so important to the community. The Laura Club is 106 years old, having also been founded in 1897. Again, it is a club in which I have to declare a very strong interest, in that I have been actively involved in sponsoring and supporting races there since 1989. A lot of money-some $65,000-has been spent in recent times on building the infrastructure there. Again, you only have to look at the list of families that have been actively involved in supporting these races to realise the huge concern. This is not just about money; this is the whole social infrastructure of the area. Once a year, all the families in the Cape get together, meet at these clubs and are able to socialise et cetera. For businesses in these communities also it is almost a peak. They get a lot of outside money-it is not just local money-coming in when people go out and enjoy the bush atmosphere. All of this we risk losing. At Cooktown, the club is 108 years old. It is the second oldest club in Queensland and, again, it is under threat. It is criminal that Queensland Racing could consider, purely because of the dollar value, shutting these clubs down-because it wants to maximise its return out of the TABs. The impacts for still many families who have been involved for generation after generation are going to be severe. The whole thing is run by dedicated volunteers. Nobody gets paid to run those clubs. They know that it is about more than just the dollar value; it is about social interaction and the whole social fabric of the area. For many of the communities, these race meetings are equivalent to the Royal Easter Show or the Canberra Show, and they are gazetted public holidays. Can you imagine if we wanted to abolish the Royal Easter Show, the Brisbane Show or the Canberra Show? Such outrage would be felt. To these communities, these race meetings are exactly the same as those shows are to their communities. Merri Rose has effectively washed her hands of the responsibility for country racing in Queensland. As a result, country racing in Far North Queensland and right throughout the rest of the state is being pillaged to prop up the industry in Brisbane. As I said, this is not simply about money; the social and cultural impacts of the decision also need to be considered. Merri Rose is the Minister for Racing in Queensland and the racing board is a state government quango. It is not too late for the minister to wake up and see reason. Not only does she have the authority and the ability to step in and save country racing from being slashed and burned in Far North Queensland; she has a responsibility to do that. If she to take action, I suggest she should resign. If she is not prepared to do the right thing, I believe she should be sacked. It is interesting that the other state Labor members in Far North Queensland have been absolutely mute on this issue. We have four of them up there-Steve Bredhauer, Leslie Clark, Desley Boyle and Warren Pitt. If their minister is not prepared to stand up for country racing, I would ask them to get up on their feet and make a statement about it. (Time expired)",75
164,Mr DANBY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Something can be true, even if George Bush says it is true. That is a logical argument with which, I believe, critics of the war in Iraq should view the President's recent statements on the possibilities of democracy in the Arab world after this conflict. The opposition's policy, which I support, is that any military conflict with Iraq to enforce the disarmament provisions of the United Nations must be done with UN Security Council approval. That is still the position of the opposition and the position I still support. But I do not believe that, if there is to be a conflict with Iraq, the lack of respect shown for the Arab people by so many who believe that the vicious tyranny of Saddam Hussein should just be left in place is a state that we ought simply to accept. I do not believe that risking blood to liberate Iraq would be futile. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and their potential threats to people in the region should not be the sole concern. One has to balance those concerns, as most people do, against the prospect of invading a sovereign country like Iraq-even one led by a regime as repugnant as that of Saddam Hussein. The legitimate fear of many good people is that the civilian deaths entailed in such an invasion would be so numerous and terriblealthough I do not believe that is a view that is widely shared by people in Iraq-that they would not justify the human rights benefit that would be gained by the people of Iraq. An important delegation of the Kurdish minority, for instance, has just been here in fails Parliament House. The head of that delegation, Dr Mofak Sorani, gave a briefing to the opposition foreign affairs committee, and I believe that these people also believe that Iraq might, like other states in the Arab world, eventually become democratic. I also believe that the Arab people of Iraq, whether they are Shia, Sunni or Kurdish, do not like the current state of being brutalised, tortured and murdered by the fascist Ba'athist regime in Iraq. It is not the natural order of things, and those people in this world who argue that one should simply tolerate it are in denial. Iraq Some of the more interesting opponents of the war in Iraq include Senator Bob Brown of the Greens. He is a genuine supporter of human rights in many countries in the world, including Tibet. While I do not often single him out for praise, he has said of this conflict that there are understandable differences between genuine people and that the situation is not clear-cut. The situation is not clear-cut with weapons of mass destruction. The situation is not clear-cut about the civilian deaths that might be caused by a conflict versus the civilian deaths that take place there every day. My view is that the primary issue in all of this is the human rights of the people of Iraq. The Kurdish delegation was telling us about the conference that has just taken place in northern Iraq of all the Iraqi opposition groups. Whatever party we are from, as democrats in the Australian parliament we would hope-however idealistic it may seem-that the democratic views of those people would be able to take their tortured country of the last 30 years into a better future. The Kurds, the Sunni and the Shia seem to have worked out an arrangement that would lead to a federal Iraq where there would be power sharing between the various confessional groups, the rule of law and elections. All of these things may seem idealistic but they should be things that people on all sides of politics throughout the developed world identify with. If they support democracy in their own countries, it must be good enough for people in that part of the world too. It is very interesting that there is currently a major international argument, of which Australia should be part, saying that if there is to be a post-Saddam Iraq then it ought to be a democratic one and that the proposals of the Iraqi democratic opposition, the Kurdish minority et cetera ought to be seriously considered. It is very alarming that Mr Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, the umbrella group of the Iraqi opposition, had to recently write an article calling for ‘Iraq for the Iraqis'. He is very concerned that post-conflict there would be a Ba'athist regime set up with an American face. There is a proposal by some people in the US State Department and by other Western chanceries for military officers to be in charge of Iraqi ministries. The same murderers and torturers, who have been so well described by anyone who wants to examine the literature, would be left in control there. I think we should very much consider the comments of Professor Kanan Makiya, who is the main intellectual in Iraq's opposition. For Americans to go back on the democratic plan post-conflict, he says: ... would be an unmitigated disaster for the term relationship between the US and the Iraqi people. … … The Iraqi opposition is going to become antiAmerican the day after liberation. It is a great irony. He does not want the plan for Saddam's ruling Ba'ath party to remain largely intact with two officials in each Iraqi ministry replaced by US military officers. Professor Makiya is the well-known author of Republic of Fear, which is the definitive book about the state of terror in Iraq at the moment under Saddam Hussein. He is also Professor of International Relations at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. He said that this plan of some people in the various foreign ministries in the West is bizarre and that it is Ba'athism with an American face. This is certainly something that we in Australia should not support. It is very disappointing that our government has not done more to find out about the situation in northern Iraq. We have not had an official visit there since 1993, as I have established from questions that I have been asking of this government. We have not had any humanitarian assistance for the great British geneticist Dr Christine Godsen, who has attempted to define and work out what happened during the dreadful chemical weapons attacks on the people of Kurdistan-the infamous Al Anfal campaign where more than 100,000 Kurds were gassed to death by Saddam Hussein. This is a topic that I will come back to at another time in the parliament, particularly the dreadful use of dual-use weapons principally supplied from German firms. This is demonstrated in the Iraqi letter of compliance of 7 December to the United Nations. The German firmsof all firms in this world-provided more than 50 per cent of the chemical agents that were used in those campaigns, since the UNSCOM inspectors were in Iraq after the end of the Gulf War. I had intended to recall some of the people who I would describe as part of the Australian hall of shame who propagandised for the fascist regime in Baghdad. These include people like Dr Robert Springborg, the Secretary and Vice-President of the AustralialongIraq Friendship Society from 1979 to 1984, who claimed at one point during the Gulf War that the Iranian people had gassed them… selves in order to elicit international sympathy. He was used as a commentator on the ABC during the Gulf War until, quite rightly, former Prime Minister Hawke made a devastating attack on his credibility by pointing out these kinds of things. I notice the member for Casey recently was trying to make a great play and embarrass the opposition about its history in dealing with these matters. He does not remember that the people in the Labor Party who were involved in some relationship with the Iraqi Ba'athist party were disciplined by the national executive. Of course, Mr Bill Hartley, the gentleman from Victoria who led so many missions of naive and not so naive people to Iraq over the years, was ultimately expelled from the Labor Party in 1986. There is also the infamous pro-Iraqi journalism throughout the 1980s and 1990s of Claudia Wright, who described Saddam Hussein as ‘dashing' and ‘flexible'. I do not know on what possible rational grounds she based those judgments, but they were printed in journals as prestigious as the Journal of International Affairs, the Chatham House Papers and the Atlantic Monthly. They constitute the Australian hall of shame for what has happened over the last 30 years to the people of Iraq who have been abused by the fascist regime there. One day, whether via this UN Security Council resolution on not, Iraqi citizens will enjoy the same democratic and civil liberties as Australian citizens. (Time expired) Fuel: Bioethanol",77
165,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate to draw the House's attention to the campaign being waged against the use of bioethanol in fuel. This campaign has been waged by the major oil companies, motoring organisations, the Australian Labor Party and some sections of the media. It is an attempt to discredit the of this clean, green, renewable energy source and those who produce it. So far, it has had only one casualty: the trial of a 10 per cent ethanol blend being conducted through a Commonwealth grant by BP Australia has been abandoned. BP Australia is one of the few fuel companies that have been willing to embrace and organise a trial on ethanol. However, BP fell victim to the scare campaign of the motoring organisations and other oil companies, most notably Caltex. Let me share with the House some of the misleading information that has been supplied. A Caltex brochure, Fuel for thought, reads: Over the past few months, there has been controversy over addition of ethanol to petrol. Underarticle, standably, many motorists are concerned over quality of petrol they are buying. … … … Caltex Australia does not supply ethanol blends to any Caltex or Ampol branded sites ... It goes on in that vein. There is a freestanding sign outside a service station that reads, ‘Ethanol free-pure petrol.' Goodness me. The implication of all of this, despite the fact that Caltex promote themselves as proethanol, is that a concern has been raised in the mind of the motoring public that ethanol could damage vehicles. Let me continue with the media's part in this campaign. On 5 February 2003, Today Tonight presented an antiethanol story entitled ‘Pumping faulty fuel'. They dealt with a vehicle owned by a Mr Golby. It was filmed at the ABS Auto Brake Service at Ferntree Gully in Melbourne. The manager of ABS Auto Brake Service, Mark White, was present during the filming of the segment. The implication was plainly that ethanol was at fault. In the introduction to the program, the reporter said: Ethanol: many regard it as the poison in their petrol, corroding metal, damaging plastic and costing drivers hundreds of dollars ... Like many motorists Tim Golby had no idea he was buying ethanol-laced fuel-now he's paying the price. Of course Mr Golby had no idea he was buying ethanol, because he was not. Channel 7 were in error. When approached, Mr Golby use advised that he had purchased the fuel in his vehicle from the Safeway service station at Boronia. A check of the delivery records to the service station at Boronia showed that that service station had never received ethanol-blend fuel. So Mr Golby's problems, which are manifestly obvious, do not relate to ethanol. However, that did not stop other media outlets. Mike Seccombe from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote an article and quoted a Hurstville resident whose car had been repaired. The automotive company that did the repairs was Neil Streeting Automotive Repairs, South Hurstville. However, when an association contacted Mr Streeting about the he described it as an absolute untruth the and said he had been disgusted with the way what he had said had been misrepresented by the Sydney Morning Herald. He claimed that the vehicle that was damaged had never had contaminated fuel containing ethanol. Furthermore, this could be established only by testing the fuel. There had been no testing of the fuel in the particular motorist's vehicle. The mechanic at the service station claimed that he had never repaired another 10 cars damaged by ethanol and that the damage to another vehicle unrelated to the one the story revolved around had been done a year ago by petrol contaminated with kerosene. Furthermore, the claim in the article that the catalytic converter in the motorist's car had been replaced for the second time was false. I notice that the Sydney Morning Herald printed an apology and rebuttal, as they well should. The article was a fabrication. There has been an attempt by the major oil companies, media outlets and automobile associations to blacken the name of what in many other countries is a renewable, safe and competitive fuel. But not all responses to ethanol are subjective, and the Service Station Association of Australia, which is conducting an ethanol car trial, deserves note. date, it has looked at four vehicles: a Ford Fairmont sedan which has done 76,000 kilometres, a Ford XLS ute which has done 125,000 kilometres, a Toyota Hilux ute which has done 282,000 kilometres and a Holden S ute which has done 211,000 kilometres. They have all travelled on 20 per cent ethanol blend and none of them has had non-routine maintenance at this time. However-oddly enough-you do not seem to find the media outlets writing that story. There is a great need in the debate on renewable fuels for objective, scientific studies on a range of fuel blends: first of all, on dinary unleaded and then on 10 per cent, 20 per cent and perhaps even greater blends. This should have been done by now by a federal authority. I regret to say that Environment Australia have taken a somewhat timid approach to ethanol testing and to promoting the use of renewables. There have to date been tests carried out on a small board motor and a stationary motor in the form of a garden trimmer. The results are somewhat mixed and could be viewed as negative, but Environment Australia have missed the mark by looking at motors that are not widely used in Australia anyway, and the owners of those could easily be advised not to use blends. The last time. I looked, nobody I knew drove to work on a whipper snipper. I am sure you do not, Mr Deputy Speaker, and nor do I. As I said, there is some serious research being done on motor vehicles using ethanol blends-and not before time. The response to all of this from the Australian government should be clear. We must not allow a deceitful, misinformed and mischievous campaign by vested interests to destroy the opportunity for a new renewable industry, based on ethanol, in Australia. What is needed from the Commonwealth is a holistic and comprehensive policy-not a piecemeal approach just focusing on, for instance, labelling or setting a maximum blend. It needs to be a comprehensive approach, and the first things that are required are objective, scientific studies and an education program that properly informs the public of the results of these studies. The To next thing we need is a mandated 10 per cent blend across Australia-maybe not in every bowser in every service station-because the reality is that the oil companies will never do it. They are backed, of course, by the fossil thinking in the Australian Labor Party, which is opposed to ethanol. As well as a mandate of 10 per cent, there needs to be choice for motorists. They should have the option of buying unleaded, if that is what they wish, or a 10 per cent blend, a 20 per cent blend or even an E85, as is currently used a great deal in the United States and Brazil. This is a debate about a worthy renewable orfuel. I have no doubt that, like me, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would prefer to drive to work not on Middle Eastern oil but on the cane or grain crop down the road and know that you are contributing to greenhouse gas reduction by using a renewable fuel. We need to look at a comprehensive education program, a 10 per cent mandate and pursuing out- science-as we are with sugar research-to ensure that ethanol is fully competitive, even with a full excise equal to that of petroleum. Finally, we need to properly inform motorists so that they can make the sort of choice that all customers expect. But so far this debate has been driven by the politics of envy and vested interest. There has been fossilised thinking from those who have a vested interest in fossil fuels-and that includes the Australian Labor Party. (Time expired) National Commissioner for Children and Young People",79
166,Ms ROXON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to talk today about our proposal to establish a national commissioner for children and young people, and the proposal to introduce a national working with children check. Nearly a year ago, Labor committed itself to establishing such a commissioner and promoted, as a vital part of this proposal, a tional working with children check. We think that this is an integral step for the nation recognise the importance of childhood and valuing children as part of our society. We also believe it will be a key to giving children a forum for their voices to be better heard, especially by government. There are three clear goals we want to achieve by having a commissioner for children and young people. Firstly, it would make sure that children and young people have an independent voice at the national level and that their issues are given the prominence that they deserve. Secondly, it would ensure that the health and well-being of children is adequately monitored and that governments are held accountable for delivering on education and care services for children. Thirdly, it would provide parents and children with greater confidence that children will be better protected when in the care of other adults. As a nation, I believe we have been slow to feel comfortable with the idea of children's needs and interests, and particularly with the notion of children's rights. Our cence is quite peculiar, given the universal opposition in this country to things that countries experience as normal-issues such as bonded child labour, child prostitutes, child soldiers and regular childhood deaths through malnutrition and, increasingly, through HIV-AIDS. All of these issues are addressed by children's rights advocates elsewhere around the world. Too often, I believe, we have been caught up in the semantics of the debate about children's rights and been distracted from its substance-that of providing a happy and safe environment for our children to be healthy and develop into resilient young people interested in the world around them. Until we are prepared to listen to children, value their experience and, as a community, provide the support they need, too many of our children will be damaged by their childhood. One particular aspect of our proposal to establish a national commissioner for children and young people deals with that issue-what we can do nationally to help support and protect our children. We believe na- that the government does have a role to play in ensuring that adults working with, and to caring for, children have gone through rigorous and appropriate checking before they are left in an unsupervised position of authority or trust with other people's children. Child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, is an issue of extremely high concern to many parents and the community at large. Daily we have reports in the media of abuse and neglect in schools, churches, state homes and other community groups. Many of the allegations are quite awful-the level of abuse, the misuse of power and the breach of trust. We know from the Clemenger silent majority report last year that four out of the five top issues of concern in the community relate to protecting our children from abuse and harm. Key concerns, of course, are about the damage caused to those children and bringing the perpetrators to account. We must be more active in educating the community, and our children, about what is not acceptable and what constitutes criminal behaviour by adults. But across the community I believe there retiis another substantial concern-a growing fear from parents about the risks to their other children in the community and a sense of erosion of trust. There is a sense that community leaders are letting them down and that enjoyable activities for kids may now somehow pose a risk and therefore should be avoided. Just as worrying, adults who are genuinely interested in working with children can feel under attack in this environment-particularly men who are concerned that their motivations for working with children will be queried. Frankly, I do not believe we can afford to lose these things in our community. So we need to look at how we can better protect our children from the predators and at the same time look to restore faith in organisations that can be well placed to provide stimulating, interesting and caring environments for our kids. This is why Labor is calling for a national working with children check. We believe more can be done to ensure that unsuitable people do not work with, or care for, our kids. At the same time, parents can have increased confidence about those who do. We believe that having one national system would mean that predators could not easily shop around between states or as easily move onto another victim if they were caught out. Queensland and New South Wales both have checking systems that are overseen by their state commissioners for children and young people. Queensland has a broad system that applies to volunteers and those in paid employment and issues a suitability card to those who are approved. New South Wales has a system that requires employees to make declarations as to suitability and conducts risk assessments, depending on the type of work and the person's background. Victoria has made noises about introducing a similar system but has since gone quiet. Elsewhere, different things are checked for different types of jobs in different industries-with much waste, repetition and confusion resulting from the many different ers of regulation that can apply. Labor have continued, and are continuing, to seek feedback on its proposal via a pamphlet that we have produced and issued to many parents. We are asking them to give us feedback on what they believe should be covered in such a check-for example, should teachers and tutors, child carers, sports coaches, scoutmasters, youth leaders, priests and clergy, boarding staff, camp supervisors, anyone working with or volunteering with children in an unsupervised environment or any other people be covered by such a check? We are asking what it is that people believe should be checked for-for example, should we be checking for previous sexual or violent offences, should we be checking for family violence orders and does it matter who has taken out those orders, should we be looking at past employment records with children or should we be looking at any other types of offences? We are asking parents who tell us they believe there are other things that should be checked to let us know what they believe should be checked. Of course it is important to get feedback as well as to who would pay for such a check-for example, should it be paid for by employers or voluntary organisations, should the person being checked be required to pay for this, should it be paid for by government and, if so, in total or in part, and should parents contribute in some way? These are not easy issues, but we think it is vital that parents be involved in talking to us about how they would feel more confident about the care of their children and what would restore some confidence to those organisations that deal with children as a primary part of their work or voluntary activities. Others have already seen this as the way forward. Some churches, in particular, are realising that this issue will eat away at their support base if they do not grapple with it as a matter of urgency. There has been support for a national check from the Anglican Church-particularly from its Perth diocese, which is implementing it in some of its areas already-and from the National Council of Churches. The recently formed Australian lay- Council for Children and Youth Organisations is even helping to pilot better systems with community based organisations who have volunteered to help develop best practice policies and procedures to ensure that children are better protected when they are in contact with adults providing services within these organisations. And there are steps to develop a national sex offenders' register to be used as part of this regime. If we could have more confidence in the national employment and volunteer screening processes, we could restore some confidence in those institutions that have most come under attack-but only if they, too, wish to be part of this change. It is also true that our proposal does deal only with the risk of abuse from non-family members. I am fully aware that a sad truth about child abuse and neglect is that many children do suffer at the hands of their own parents-in fact, many times more than at the hands of strangers. This form of abuse and neglect is just as serious, often more serious, but cannot be regulated in the same way. The urgent and complex support that families need in these circumstances and the protection of children in this other complex area also need much debate. We believe this working with children check is a clear area where the Commonwealth can take a lead role and where it can have a big impact in helping keep our children safe. Just as importantly, it is one way of the Commonwealth participating in describing and dealing with what has become a very big social problem. The more education there is in the community, the more that will provide information for parents as well as for organisations dealing with children. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who is at the table, and the Prime Minister have already dismissed this idea out of hand, seeing it only as an extra cost. However, the Labor Party sees it as an opportunity, one which will give children and young peopleand their parents-greater confidence that their needs can be met and that the government can play a constructive role in dealing with this difficult issue. At the same time, promoting the interests of children as a whole through our proposal to establish a commissioner for children will help us value children more and perhaps ensure that children's lives and childhood are given the value and support they need. Perhaps at the same time we might even restore and rebuild some of our community groups that have been so good in the past in working with our children but that need to move forward for the 21st century. Bushfires",81
167,Mr NAIRN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Eden-Monaro) (5.34 p.m.)Earlier today in the House I spoke on a motion with respect to tourism, and I spoke about the impact on tourism of the bushfires in the Snowy Mountains area. I would now like to say a little more in the grievance debate about that. In particular, I would like raise some of the issues that have come up and some of the things that have occurred since those bushfires devastated the Snowy Mountains area, the Koscioszko National Park. One of the things that I did very soon after the bushfires was to take Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, up there to look at what had occurred. The reason I took Wilson Tuckey was that he is the federal minister responsible for natural disasters, and the federal government provides a substantial part of the assistance in the event of natural disasters. Once a particular figure is reached by the states, the Commonwealth puts in 50 per cent, and when it reaches another figure, the Commonwealth puts in 75 per cent. So, overall, the Commonwealth foots the bill to a greater extent than the states. One of the things available after a natural disaster like the bushfires is small business loans. The number of businesses affected by the bushfires in the Snowy Mountains area was quite large, and they will be affected for quite some time. Their business just disappeared overnight. Because nobody could go into the area-no tourists, no nothing-the businesses had nobody to sell things to. I know of at least one business that has made an application for one of those small business low interest rate loans to help them get through the next couple of months until, hopefully, the tourists start coming back into that region. I mentioned this business in my earlier speech: Crackenback Cottage on the way to Thredbo along the Alpine Way. When Sarah Young, the owner, rang the necessary bureaucracy about these loans-they are looked after by the New South Wales governmentshe was told by the person at the other end of the line that they might be able to look at it in three months. That is just not good enough. It is a different world in three months. The assistance of those loans-to which the Commonwealth is contributing substantially, to enable the states to provide this sort of relief-is needed now. For somebody to say, ‘We might get around to it in three months time,' is absolutely disgraceful. to That is one of the real problems we have up there. We always see Premier Carr out there on the television talking about all the wonderful amounts of money that he has available for disasters-droughts, bushfires et cetera. But, whenever you get into the detail, it is all about announcing these dollars, not about spending them-or, if you are going to spend them, you hold people up for as long as possible so that you do not have to spend the money for some time. In many cases, it is Commonwealth money he is spending. That has been a real issue up there. One other thing that happened as a result of these bushfires was that Bob Carr made a visit to the Snowy Mountains to announce a New South Wales government package for assistance. I heard on the Friday afternoon, through a source, that he would be arriving in the mountains the next morning to do this. I spoke with the local paper shortly thereafter, and they knew nothing about it. In fact, they were never notified. None of the local media were notified of this visit. You wonder what a member of parliament-the Premier, at that-would be doing going into an area, supposedly to make a great announcement, but not actually telling any of the media. He flew into Cooma in his Lear jet and was whisked up to Jindabyne, put on a boat and taken out to an island in the middle of Lake Jindabyne to make this big announcement. You wonder why he would not do it in the town-where the businesses are and where the people who are looking for this assistance would be-so that everybody could hear the great announcement being made by the Premier of New South Wales. But no: he went in his Lear jet up to Cooma, then in the car to Jindabyne, at Jindabyne into a boat and by boat out to an island in middle of Lake Jindabyne to make the announcement to a couple of Labor hacks who came along and also to the Sydney media who were in tow-the Sydney media, who get a lift in the Lear jet to take the pictures and then hear the announcement. He did exactly the same thing a couple of months ago down in Moruya. Virtually nobody knew, locally, that he was coming. He slipped into Moruya, was there for 25 minutes to make an announcement and hand over a cheque for $10,000, and then he disappeared. He does this because he is scared of confronting rural people. He was worried up in Jindabyne-I have this from a very good source-that the state member, Peter Webb, was going to show up and ask him hard questions about his land management practices in the national park, which have destroyed our icon, Kosciuszko National Park. Bob Carr did not like the fact that Peter Webb had, a few weeks before, asked him some hard questions at a press conference about that. So he said, ‘We don't want him to arrive at the press conference in Jindabyne and ask us hard questions, so we won't tell anybody. We'd better not tell the local media, because they'll tell him. We'll just take along some cameras from Sydney and some media people from Sydney.' He wants to have those pictures back in the city-that is all he is interested in-to make out that he is doing a wonderful job out in the bush. The city people would not know that he is not actually telling any people out there. Even the Chairman of Tourism Snowy Mountains was not told about these things. When you start to dissect the money, it is pretty interesting. There was $350,000 for immediate marketing of the area. You think, ‘That sounds all right.' But $100,000 of that is actually going to areas outside the Snowy Mountains that had suffered some effects of the bushfires as well, so it is actually only $250,000 to the Snowy Mountains area. When you ask some questions, you find that that money was already allocated for tourism promotion for the region, so there was nothing new at all; it is money that would have been spent anyway. He also announced a budget of $200,000 to establish a recovery the task force-these guys are pretty good at these sorts of titles. That is going to be in Queanbeyan. All the local people said, ‘What's the task force doing in Queanbeyan? We need it up here. We need local people up here who know what's going on.' Under that pressure they appointed Ken Prendergast from Angler's Reach as the part-time chairman, but that only came after a lot of pressure was put on. They could easily have established this thing in the Snowy Mountains. There are plenty of good people who could give them some advice. The other concern is that the money spent on advertising will all be organised out of Sydney. The local people can do this; they do a superb job. All the local events in the Snowy Mountains have advertising that the local people prepare themselves and they have a great track record. The money would have been better directed to the existing organisations up there-let them do the promotion rather than those from on high. Certainly, a few small businesses have made comments about that in particular. I noticed an email from the chap who took the Premier out to the island on the boat. He said, ‘I'd like to get paid, Premier. It'd be nice to get paid for taking you out on the boat.' So, obviously, his bill has not been paid yet. He is one of many small businesses that are suffering as a result of those bushfires. I mentioned how the Premier snuck into Moruya before. That was because he did not want to be confronted by the people who were opposed to the charcoal factory that the Labor Party of New South Wales was going to impose upon the people on the South Coast; he did not want that sort of protest. That is the way he works: with this sort of spin doctoring. He is not actually there with the people at all. I think the people of New South Wales need to understand that this is the type of premier they have in the current climate. (Time expired) National Missile Defence System",83
168,Ms HALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In a grievance debate I usually use the time allocated to me to discuss issues of specific importance to the Shortland electorate, but today I have decided to raise an issue that is important not only to every person in the Shortland electorate but also to every Australian and to people throughout the worldthe issue of peace, not war. Peace is the most important issue facing us today. It is about to slip through our fingers and, once it has gone, it will be very hard to regain. Peace is achieved not through war and conflict but through people sitting around the table and having dialogue. Unfortunately, I do not think we are going down that path at the moment. The important point I want to make about conflict is that it does not create a win-win situation; rather, it crePrime ates winners and losers, whereas sitting down and trying to work things out creates a win-win situation. This is something that this government, I am sure, supports when it comes to business but is not supporting in the international arena. Unfortunately, the government and our Prime Minister seem determined to have Australia embroiled in a war with Iraq. That is very sad. My feelings are supported by many hundreds of thousands of Australians. The Prime Minister is arrogantly ignoring the Australian people. He refuses to listen to their protests against war. Instead, he claims he knows best-that he is making the ‘hard decisions'. In doing so, he is ignoring the people of Australia. On the weekend of 15 and 16 February, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets throughout Australia. I am sure that there were more than one million people. I attended the march in Newcastle, along with 200,000 others. There were people from all walks of life. I have never been to any march, meeting or gathering in Newcastle with as many people. On the Sunday, I travelled to Sydney with a group of friends and was overwhelmed by the number of people who filled the streets of Sydney. My mother lives in the National Party Iraq electorate of Cowper. At 83 years of age, she attended her first ever protest march. She is not the type of person who takes to the streets. However, she attended a march in Nambucca Heads where, in a little town that has somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000 to 6,000 people, 1,000 people attended. The people of Newcastle, Sydney, Nambucca Heads, Melbourne, Perth and Canberra, and throughout Australia, joined together to say no to war in Iraq. The reason people joined together like this was that they felt helpless. It was an act of desperation. They felt that the only way they could have their voices heard and have input into what was happening was to take to the streets. They felt so belittled by the Prime Minister's response to their action-they were referred to as a ‘mob' and their action was downplayed and ridiculed-that many of them said to me, ‘If this is the way the Minister treats us, if this is the way he acts, if this is where the government is going, it shows that it is arrogant and out of touch.' The government should go out and talk to some real people. My local drycleaner is hardly a political activist but his family attended the rally in Newcastle. The only solution this Prime Minister seems prepared to embrace is war with Iraq, with or without UN support. I emphasise yet again how important it is for him to embrace diplomacy and give the weapons inspectors more time, as I know Hans Blix has asked for. We have a Prime Minister-John W who is determined to go all the way with George W. It was interesting to hear the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a question today about the destruction of the al-Samoud missiles in Iraq. He said it was game playing, that only 10 out of 100 had been destroyed and that they should not be given any credit for it. I argue strongly that it may not be the ultimate result, but a step in the right direction. It is a step towards the peace that we all want. There was not one positive statement-not one acknowledgment on progress-from the government indicating that it supports peace. A young student, Ben Blackburn, from Gorokan High School was in Canberra today. I asked Ben what he thought about the prospects of war in Iraq. He said that there should be no war in Iraq. He is a young man who is 15 years old. He could possibly have his life affected greatly by this war. He is editor of the Gorokan High School newspaper, and he is currently preparing a survey to give to all the students in the school. What I want to see is a win-win situation. The Prime Minister's actions and his love of war, conflict and the toys of war are placing Australia and Australians in great danger. The newly defined Hill doctrine is a doctrine that the Prime Minister and his government support. His government is moving towards creating instability and conflict in the world and within our region. The Howard government is set to sign up to the US's ‘son of Star Wars' project, as outlined in the Hill doctrine. The US's ‘son of Star Wars' plan-the national missile defence system-has evolved from Ronald Reagan's Star Wars proposal and is seen as an insurance policy. It has been proven to be expensive and fraught with problems. Yet John W. is, once again, preparing to go all the way with George W. and, in doing so, is jeopardising the safety of Australians. The ‘son of Star Wars' project, as everyone knows, has been plagued with problems. It has had problems with its accuracy. It is my understandingand this was supported in Scientific American-that a cluster of metal-coated blooms sent along with a warhead could be confused for a homing system, making a direct hit highly unlikely. For it to be effective, it has to make a direct hit. To do that, you need a highly accurate system with effective radar and no interference. Accuracy has been one of the problems associated with the project. The US over the past 20 years has spent $70 billion on the missile defence system. Congress was recently asked for another $9 it is billion from next year's budget. But a few days after the budget went through, it was said that the missile defence system could be employed in an emergency situation with only limited expectation of success-and this is what we are looking at signing up to. The system has the ability to fire up the arms race and cause enormous problems. We do not want to go down that track in Australia, and down the track of going to war with Iraq. Currently, the situation is that Australia is preparing to become an aggressor in Iraq. At co- the same time, it is moving towards signing up to the ‘son of Star Wars' project. These actions can only increase tension and ignite an arms race, which can only lead to further instability in the world. I urge the Prime Minister to go to the table and put his trust in words, not arms. Diplomacy leads to peace and a win-win outcome for all. (Time expired) Gold Coast: Homeless Youth",85
169,Mrs MAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The lack of short-term crisis accommodation for young homeless people on the Gold Coast is at breaking point. We have a serious problem in our city, and the seriousness of that problem needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth, which commenced in 1984, will shortly take over the management of a new, purpose-built home that will house seven young people on a short-term basis with 24hour on-site management. Some would say that a new, purpose-built home for homeless youth would be a reason for celebration, but there are only seven beds. That is the total number of beds we have in our city right now for homeless youth, and these new beds will replace the beds we have currently. The current facility will be closed down, so in fact we are not gaining any extra beds. The Gold Coast has a population of close to 450,000 people, yet we have only seven beds as short-term crisis accommodation to meet the growing demand of the homeless youth in our city. In 2002 MCLaughlin House provided 2,139 bed nights to young people in crisis. That figure sounds like a huge achievement, but the staff at MCLaughlin House could only accommodate 16 per cent of the referrals and had to turn away 1,117 referrals. This was directly due to the lack of available beds. And where did those 1,117 referrals end up? We must remember that they are young homeless people, not just numbers. They are members of the Gold Coast community; they are our kids and our future. Youth homelessness, adult homelessness and family homelessness are not just a product of the Gold Coast; they are a growing problem throughout Australian communities and they are a problem that we all need to take notice of. It is time to build partnerships with business, with local authorities within communities, and with government to put in place programs and infrastructure, resources and funding to meet the growing demands of a problem that will grow by epidemic proportions if we do not act now. What are the statistics? How big is this problem in Australia? What is ‘youth homelessness'? How is it defined and measured? The Australian Bureau of Statistics recognises three types of homeless people: those without any form of shelter; those in temporary accommodation with no secure housing elsewhere; and long-term tenants of single rooms in boarding houses. In 1989 the Burdekin report identified three categories of homeless young people: those who leave home temporarily and then return; those who have left home and require temporary assistance to make the transition to independence; and those who become homeless in their midto late teens and who find it very difficult to break the cycle of homelessness. It is estimated that throughout Australia, 37,000 young people aged 12 to 24 are homeless at any one time and that approximately 100,000 young people aged 12 to 24 experience homelessness every year. Research shows youth homelessness has increased by eight per cent since 1994. So what are the reasons for youth homelessness, and why are we seeing such a large increase in youth homelessness? The most common reason given by 80 per cent of homeless young people was family and/or relationship breakdown. Another reason is physical and sexual abuse. Some statistics indicate that at least 50 per cent of homeless youth have suffered physical or sexual abuse, usually from a family member. Teenage drug and alcohol abuse is a key cause of conflict within families and that also leads to young people leaving home. The Burdekin report also cites strong links between family poverty and youth homelessness. The report points out that poverty often contributes to drug and alcohol problems, social isolation and domestic violence, all of which may compel a young person to leave home. Many families are simply unable to support an adolescent. Unemployment and teenage pregnancy also indicate strong links to homelessness. Contrary to the perception in communities that young people leave home because they cannot accept discipline, surveys show that most young people are desperately keen to be reunited with their families, and youth agencies on the Gold Coast certainly work towards that outcome. Some family environments are not the best, but young people have told me they have to choose between an unsuitable home and the risk of harm involved in living on the street. If home is not an option, youth workers in my community try and find safe accommodation with extended family members or friends-somewhere that they are safe. With only seven beds for short-term crisis accommodation on the Gold Coast, more often than not there will not be a bed, and alternate safe housing must be found or the young person is left on the street. The lack of appropriate accommodation options on the Gold Coast is an ongoing frustration for both clients and workers. But youth homelessness is not just about finding a bed. Each individual has support needs, and plans tailored to their individual goals must be identified by case workers. The most common support needs identified by clients at MCLaughlin House during 2002 were in the areas of accommodation, education, employment and obtaining and maintaining Youth Allowance. Seventy per cent of young people accessing the service at MCLaughlin House were unemployed and not at school. The MCLaughlin House annual report of 2002 identifies that the majority of the clients are high-need and there is no able accommodation available for them. The report goes on to say that most have a wide range of often multiple issues ranging from mental health, aggression, crime, behavioural disorders, learning disorders and drug issues. All these problems require specialised services. If these services are not available, what sort of impact do these issues have on youth homelessness? Many of these young people express feelings of low self-esteem, alienation, aloneness and abandonment and a sense of being trapped and used-and these feelings can lead them to be suicidal. In a survey conducted on homeless young people by the Howard government, suicide attempts had been made by 82 per cent of females and 61 per cent of males. More than 80 per cent of those surveyed felt that there was not much point in living and were bored with their lives. There is no doubt that youth homelessness is a growing problem that is recognised by this government and many support agencies within our local communities. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Program-or SAAP, as it is known-is an initiative of this government, and one that is welcomed by local agencies meeting the challenges of this very complex problem. But the problem is not just about low-cost housing; it is about ongoing support for these young people. Short-term crisis accommodation is just that: short-term. But it is often the longer term effects of homelessness that need to be tackled on a long-term basis. There is a need to assist young people to make the transition from being dependent on assistance to being independent. The Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth has identified a number of areas that need resourcing to assist in the long-term success of youth becoming independent. There is a need in many cases for assistance with living skills-to teach young people how to shop, how to budget their income and how to cook. In many cases, multiple forms of assistance are required, which could include counselling and emotional support as well as practical support. Through the Gold Coast Project for Homeless Youth, a number of pilot programs have been launched where suitassistance is given through follow-up programs. I believe that follow-up programs are an extremely important part of empowering these young people to take responsibility for their own lives. Crisis accommodation for a few days or weeks does not always solve what can be very complex problems. These young people need the follow-up help to give them the best chance of turning their lives around. But these follow-up programs cannot be offered without resources. Governments at all levels and community leaders need to work together to find local solutions to local problems. The Gold Coast City is perceived as a wealthy well-to-do area. Scratch the surface and you will find a very different story. So what needs to be done? What can government and, indeed, our communities do to address this growing problem? I am a great believer in early intervention to prevent the problem in the first place. Education programs are a must. These can be delivered through our schools, whether they be life skills programs or employment programs specifically targeted to those young people who leave school early. There needs to be increased levels of support for those agencies in our communities who are delivering services to these young people, through relationship counselling or programs that target drug and alcohol abuse. We need to reduce the level of domestic violence in our communities and we need to focus on low-cost accommodation and exit programs for those young people who have nowhere to go. I believe our community and business leaders on the Gold Coast need to lend their support to the growing problem we are facing in our city. We all need to take ownership of the problem, not push it under the carpet, and work together in partnership with government and local agencies to help provide those young homeless people in our city with the economic and social support they require to break the cycle of homelessness. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Hawker)-Order! The time for the grievance debate has expired. The debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question agreed to.

170,Mr MCMULLAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fraser) (6.05 p.m.)The opposition obviously will be supporting the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20022003-we have always supported appropriation bills-but I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of my speech, which I hope will be circulated to honourable members in the course of the speech. Debates on appropriation bills provide members with opportunities to discuss a broad range of issues. But today I want to focus fairly narrowly on issues to do with the economy and the management of the budget. The government's claims of responsibility in budget policy are growing thinner by the day. By now they are almost completely threadbare. Let us look at some of the facts. It is now clearly established that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history. It raises a higher proportion of our national income as income tax than any other gov(Mr ernment in history. If the forward estimates are to be believed, by the end of the forward estimates period, the current Treasurer will be responsible for all of the eight highest income tax to GDP ratios in Australian history. At the moment, he is responsible for the five highest income tax to GDP ratios and ASSENT the only times in our history that the Commonwealth government has taken more than 17 per cent of our national income in income tax. In addition to this record high level of income tax, we have the biggest new indirect tax in our history, the GST, and an array of special levies-milk levies, sugar levies, Ansett levies-which proliferate and raise hundreds of millions of dollars. We currently have windfall revenue flowing to the government as a consequence of higher oil prices. It is the highest taxing government in 2003 history, yet with the record high level of revenue-higher than any Treasurer has ever had to deal with in peacetime in Australiathe government has failed to deliver on its 2003 basic responsibilities to the Australian people. With record high revenues and declining services, the government has failed to keep the budget in surplus after a decade of economic growth. It is on that basis that, as I said, I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of this speech. It will be a second reading amendment that deals with the government's record as the highest taxing government. It deals with the government's failure to deliver on basic responsibilities to the Australian people. It deals with the government's running the budget into deficit, notwithstanding a decade of economic growth and promises to the contrary. The government's management of the budget has been a game of smoke and mirrors. The coalition's budget was excessively tough in its first year, but it has been remarkably soft in the years since then. Revenue has been pouring in, but the government has spent virtually every extra dollar. The budget, even in years when it has been in surplus, is sailing much too close to the wind for comfort these days. The surpluses that the Treasurer likes to boast about are extremely slender. In fact, if properly measured-that is, by the measure the Treasurer himself said just two years ago was a superior measure of budget performance; the accruals measure-the budget will be in deficit two years running, notwithstanding the very high level of economic growth. The accruals or fiscal deficit was $3.7 billion last financial year, and the government's forecast for this year in its own budget papers for the fiscal deficit-that is, the deficit measured by accrual accounting measures-is for a deficit of half a billion dollars. The Treasurer has suddenly, however, discovered the virtues of the underlying cash measure of a budget deficit, which he used to deplore and decry but which he now says is his preferred method. Under this measure, last year's budget was in deficit to the tune of $1.3 billion. This is an extraordinary performance after a decade of economic growth. It may be, at the end of this year, that we will find the budget position is not quite as bleak as the fiscal deficit that has been predicted, but the Treasurer is certainly crying poor and saying he has no resources to fund key public services that are in crisis, like Medicare. If it does turn out to be the case that the budget circumstance is slightly stronger than anticipated, it will not be the product of good management but because of a few unexpected fiscal windfalls. First and foremost, it is ripping out higher levels of income tax. Figures released by the finance department last week show that, in the first seven months of this financial year, income tax collections are 13 per cent higher than for the same months in the previous year; that is comparing like with like. It is comparing the same period in the year: the first seven months of this financial year with the first seven months of the last financial year. Income tax collections have grown by 13 per cent-an enormous increase which is hitting every household. There is a windfall too from rising oil and petrol prices. Every Australian household knows it is paying more for petrol. What people are not so immediately aware of is how much of that extra revenue flows back to the government. The Parliamentary Library has estimated that the government will reap at least $600 million as a short-term windfall from rising oil and petrol prices. The increasing oil and petrol prices since the budget was framed in May means GST revenue this financial year will be more than $220 million higher than last year, as measured by the Parliamentary Library on the best figures available at the moment. Revenue from the petroleum resource rent tax will be between $380 million and $410 million higher than forecast at the time of the budget. This makes a total tax windfall from just these two taxes of at least $600 million. If, as some predict, oil prices rise further, these tax windfalls will grow even further because both of them reflect and are proportionate to the increase in the oil price. But there is more. As well as the oil and petrol tax windfall and the massive increase above already record levels of income tax, the government will next year and in the following years save hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the deferral of the sale of Telstra. The budget papers show that the government will save $218 million it had budgeted to spend on the costs of marketing the sale. It would have cost $218 million to sell the taxpayers' asset-that is in the forward estimates as expenditures. Given that the government, on the basis of the collapsing Telstra share price, has said it will put off that sale, it will save that $218 million in the next financial year. It is also benefiting to the tune of $259 million per year as a result of the special dividend announced by Telstra last week; that is $259 million extra. Yet, with income tax at record high levels and with all those windfalls-$600 million windfall from oil and petrol prices, $218 million from putting off the sale of Telstra and $259 million in a special windfall-we find the government still crying poor. It is crying poor because it says it has to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on deploying troops to the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding the fact that many-probably, if the polls are to be believed, most-Australians believe that the government has sent too many troops and deployed them too soon as a result of a failure of foreign policy. Even on the basis of having to meet the extra costs of the deployment and the extra costs of the drought, with the windfalls it has been receiving, the government should be able to also turn its attention to the crises facing Australian families in issues such as the collapse of Medicare. Let me turn now to the question that I referred to earlier about the budget balance. Budget policy under this government has been intellectually moribund and in recent years it has been out of control. The Treasurer has said that his policy is to balance the budget over the economic cycle. I actually think a proper measure of a balanced modern fiscal policy is a bit more sophisticated than that, but let us consider the Treasurer's performance against his own benchmark. Any sophisticated fiscal policy based on some concept of balance over the economic cycle must logically accept that therefore in the appropriate circumstances a budget deficit can be justified. There has been a lot of Australian debate about fiscal policies being in denial about that obvious fact for far too long. The Treasurer obviously thinks that it is appropriate at the right time in the economic cycle for the budget to go into deficit, because he recently advocated deficit funding for the United States. The Treasurer told the parliament on 6 February: The US President sent his budget to Congress in the last day and has put forward a budget program with a projected deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP the United States in 2003-a sum of some $US300 billion. In Australian terms, that would be the equivalent of a deficit in our budget of $A20 billion in the forthcoming year. Obviously, that is very substantial fiscal stimulation, which we welcome. And we welcome the fact that fiscal stimulation, together with monetary policy, is now being put forward to stimulate a return to sustained growth in the United States ... Whilst I am apprehensive that that budget deficit in the United States is too large and that the nature and extent of the stimulus is inappropriate, I broadly share the view that as an economy slows it is appropriate for a government to look to fiscal stimulus. So let us accept that reality and say we can dispense forever with the argument that no-one in the Australian parliament on either side of the House now believes that it is appropriate to have surpluses in every year whatever the fiscal circumstances are. The Treasurer obviously does not believe that because, first of all, he advocates the opposite in the United States. And then, notwithstanding the economy was growing quite strongly and properly measured by the accruals measure, he delivered a deficit budget last year and this year. But the Treasurer still tries to maintain the pretence that all deficits are bad, even though his own performance and his policy advocacy for other countries is quite to the contrary. There are some unanswered questions about the government's view on balanced fiscal policy. The one big unanswered question, which leaves the proper analysis of what the Treasurer's goals are and which is almost impossible to answer, is: what is the government's view on a balanced fiscal policy? What is the rate of economic growth that they consider the norm around which that fiscal cycle should be based? I assume the government's policy is based on the figures used by the Secretary for the Commonwealth Treasury when he told the Melbourne Institute dinner on 7 February that the average growth rate in the Australian economy over the past 40 years was 3.75 per cent. That seems the only logical basis to say our historic average is X, therefore, when you blow that average you will start to look towards some stimulus and when you are for above it you start to run up surpluses to fund the need for subsequent downturns in the economic cycle. But if that is the case, last year's budget deficit is revealed as a stark failure of policy. Even if you hold the view, as some do-and it is an argument which I think has some merit-that the Australian savings performance is so bad that the Commonwealth government should be a net saver over the cycle instead of striving merely for net balance, it still allows the possibility that when the economy slows below trend it will be appropriate for the budget to be in deficit to respond to that slowing. What worries me about the debate that goes on around these issues of fiscal policy is that at the moment the government's fiscal policy and the debate around it has a very weak intellectual foundation. It does not have any underlying driving logic. It does not even accord with its own purported logic and the arguments that are put for it. But this is not just some intellectual debate between two sides of the House in parliament. I think it is important that the Australian parliament does have a debate about fiscal policy that is intelligent, informed and principled, and it has been very hard to doso for the last seven years. Some people would say it has been more years but, in my experience, certainly in this House, it has been difficult since 1996. It is not just an intellectual debate; it is a debate that affects families directly. In an environment where their ability to service their debt is under strain, they still have to find money for services out of their pockets. Household debt in Australia has doubled under this government and credit card debt has trebled. This is imposing significant funding burdens on families as they have to repay this increased debt. It is facile and superficial to look at that only in terms of how much interest they have to pay on those debts. Every family knows that you have to repay the principal as well and as the principal soars so the amount of repayment rises, and that is why families are under pressure in meeting their debts at the moment. At the same time they are having to fund services out of their own pockets, which substantially were met by the government in previous times. That is most obvious in the areas of health and education. In the area of health insurance, the government has imposed a Clayton's tax. It has passed laws that effectively make it compulsory for some Australians to take out health insurance, because they have to pay an equivalent tax if they do not do so. Through the combination of those and other measures, many families have felt forced into taking out private health insurance. I am sure that other members have had the same experience as me. When you go around your electorate talking to individuals and families, you find them resenting the fact that they felt compelled to take out private health insurance. It costs them a substantial amount each year. The government's penalties, the requirements on high-income earners and the effective penalties on lower to middle-income families that make them feel compelled to take out private health insurance have imposed a substantial burden on families. Those families are paying for higher credit card debts, higher household debts and higher taxes and are having to pay for services that the government previously supplied. A higher proportion of families are having to do the same in the area of education. Having looked at the budget situation, its broad parameters and, very briefly, its implications for families-which some of my colleagues will talk about later-my concern about the economy as we go into the early years of the 21st century is that the government has no plan and no vision for the future. There is no equivalent to the dynamic plan of the eighties and early nineties that transformed the economy and ensured that for the last 20 years of the 20th century Australia was the leading Western economy in productivity, growth and rising living standards. We are in danger of falling back to the complacent failure of the first 80 years of the 20th century, when Australia was one of the lowest ranking and slowest growing economies in the West-falling from the richest economy in the world at the beginning of the 20th century to No. 15 or so by 1983. We entered the 21st century as the fastest growing economy in the Western world but without a plan or a vision for how we would retain that title. We are at risk of slipping into comfortable mediocrity again. We started the 20th century leading the world in economic performance and we were so confident we would do so forever that we believed we did not need to do anything about it. For 80 years we drifted down the economic table. After 20 years of hard changes, we have gone back to the top of the table of the fastest growing economies-not to the top of the table in terms of income level-over that sustained period, but we are at serious risk of slipping back into comfortable mediocrity again. Any plan for a successful, modern 21st century economy needs to be based around rigorous fiscal policy and the targeting of low interest rates, but it also needs a program for high productivity, equitable distribution of the benefits of that productivity and long term sustainability of the economic growth model. This requires investment in education and training and research and development to develop the skills and ideas to be the basis of the new businesses and new jobs of the 21st century. As we enter 2003, the prospects are that economic growth will slow. All the drivers of economic growth either are indicating a likelihood of slowing or have serious question marks around them. The most obvious problem, particularly today, is the problem with exports. The low dollar, high productivity and the focus on developing new areas of exports such as manufactures and services have led to exports making a substantial contribution to economic growth over the last decade or two; however, this is at risk. Our export performance is falling far beyond that which can be explained merely by the impact of the drought-which has been quite significant and will grow, which everybody has to accept-and far beyond the impact of the world economic slowdown. Our exports in non-agricultural areas are falling and our share of the market in growing areas like China is also falling. This is slowing growth in the short term and creating a potential serious current account deficit problem for the future, which may even impact on future interest rate policies. Today's figures were the subject of some attempt to engender a little bit of debate during question time. However, the government declined to respond to the figures or to its previous description of current account deficit and foreign debt figures as significant. Today's figures show that our trade performance-or our net exports-will detract 1.7 per cent from growth for the December quarter. Our trade performance is going south. Much of the economic success of Australia in the last two years has been driven by consumption. In the long term, economic growth driven by consumption is not a sustainable strategy; nevertheless, it carried us well for the last couple of years. This growth is being substantially driven by two things: the housing boom and the boom in household and credit card debt. The Reserve Bank has been saying for some time that the boom in credit card debt, in particular, is unsustainable. Australia has been on a debt binge that has made families and the economy overall much more vulnerable than they need to be. We have record high household debt, record high credit card debt and a record high foreign debt. All of those essentially revolve around the same weakness: a weakness in Australian savings performance. We are not saving sufficiently to fund our consumption or our investment and we are therefore finding household borrowing and foreign debt escalating. The third driver of this crisis is housing, one of the most volatile areas of the economy. We have consistently seen a slowing in housing approvals and finance and there is a serious risk of a rapid slowdown in the investment apartment sector. This will flow through into consumption. We all hope it will be a soft landing, although the housing industry does not have a great record of soft landings. Let us hope that it achieves one on this occasion because it is very important directly for that industry, which employs many people, and indirectly for the manufacturers that supply industry and for the retail and consumption activity that flows from it as people furnish new houses. Business investment is the area to which we are looking for substantial growth, and the indicators are mixed. There are some indicators that should make us cautiously optimistic that business investment will grow and that it will be enough to fill the gap left by the decline in our export performance, in consumption and in housing. It is not possible to tell precisely at this stage, but we can hope so. Some surveys-for example, those conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and by the bankssuggest that this business investment may not be as strong as we need and that some of the business investment, such as aircraft investments by Qantas and Virgin Airlines, will not contribute significantly to Australian has growth because it is substantially imported. Once the equipment arrives it may contribute to our growth through the way it is used, which should be the case in any rational investment decision, but you do not get the multipliers that you get from equipment investment based on the purchase of Australian manufactured equipment. The last point on the growth scenario is that the government's profligacy and running down of the surplus has left little room for government action to assist economic growth, should that be necessary. There is little room for action, should growth fall below some reasonable level at which the government believes fiscal stimulus is appropriate-and we cannot discern where that level might be since the government has failed to indicate that. The government has also badly mismanaged its priorities. It has failed in the Medicare and in the area of higher investment. It continues to leave us in the situation where families are vulnerable because they are having to meet the pressures of falling bulk-billing, higher prices for doctors who do not bulk-bill and the higher costs and lack of availability of higher education. This is making families feel threatened and imposing unnecessary stresses on them. We also find that the government is in a clear state of confusion about how it is going to proceed on the key area of paid maternity leave, where there is a clear case not only for action but for government funded action to get paid maternity leave on the road. I do not totally agree with every detail of the proposal put forward by Pru Goward, but I do accept the fundamental tenet that there should be a system of paid maternity leave which should be publicly funded at its core. We also have to do something in Australia to make it easier for Australians to own their own home. This government has no initiative, no plan and no track record in that area. My colleague the member for Werriwa has been putting forward some very interesting and positive propositions in that area. I want to conclude by talking about the vulnerability of the economy. The Howard government has left the economy extremely vulnerable at a time when it should not be. After more than a decade of economic growth-dating back to the early ninetiesand after two decades of economic reform, the Australian economy should be on firm foundations. But we are failing to invest in the future, and we remain much more vulnerable than we should be. We see this most starkly when we consider the levels of household and national debt, to which I referred earlier. Under this government, household debt has doubled and credit card debt has tripled. Not all of that debt is bad. Some has enabled families to purchase things that they have made an intelligent assessment about, whether those are income producing assets or homes. You cannot say every time a person borrows that it is a bad thing; individuals make borrowing decisions, and in the main they make intelligent borrowing decisions. area of But much of the surge in debt has been driven by consumption rather than by investment, and this leaves families particularly vulnerable to any local, regional or national economic shocks and to any personal adversity. In addition, as we were reminded today with the latest release from the Bureau of Statistics, the nation remains vulnerable because of the soaring foreign debt. When they came to office, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that reducing foreign debt was their No. 1 priority. The Prime Minister said, ‘I promise that we will have policies to reduce foreign debt.' I do not know how long we are supposed to wait. After seven years, that promise to reduce foreign debt has led to foreign debt increasing from $180 billion to $350 billion, which is a more than 90 per cent increase-virtually a doubling. At that time, the member for Higgins and then shadow treasurer complained that foreign debt was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. He thought this was a crisis and a terrible burden. He must be extremely embarrassed today when that debt stands at $18,000 for every man, woman and child. This leaves the whole economy vulnerable to international pressure. One reason for the addiction to debt-in households and as a nation-is that savings are at record low levels and the government has stalled the one great driver of savings in Australia, which is superannuation. The government came to office with a strategy in place to take superannuation to 15 per cent, but it scrapped the final six per cent of that. We now have a very strong superannuation system, which the government is taxing to the hilt-taxing four times. There is no plan to take the system beyond nine per cent and no plan to reform the tax on superannuation for ordinary Australian families-only for the highest income Australians. So we have a situation where, as a result of the failures of its fiscal and economic policies, the government has left households and the economy extremely vulnerable. It is on the basis of this critique of the economic and fiscal policies of the Treasurer that I move the following second reading amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failures in economic management, and in particular its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies because: (1) it is the highest taxing Government in Australian history, and: (a) has imposed the highest level ever of income tax; (b) is responsible for introducing the biggest new tax in our history; and (c) is addicted to imposing ever more taxes and special levies; (2) it has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, for example: (a) bulk billing has collapsed; (b) there is chronic under-investment in our public schools, TAFE colleges and universities; (c) the struggle to balance work and family life continues to get harder; and (d) entry level housing is becoming even less affordable for struggling Australian families; and (3) despite the record tax take, and in spite of declining Government services, the Government has failed to keep the Budget in surplus after nearly a decade of strong economic growth in that: (a) it broke its unequivocal promise to keep the Budget in surplus in 2001-02; (b) future surpluses are dependent on the additional revenue provided by bracket creep; (c) it has presided over enormous waste and mismanagement including billions of dollars of foreign exchange losses and defence procurement losses; and (d) it has lost control over expenditure necessitating wholesale changes to the budgetary management system”.",89
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Is the amendment seconded? Ms O'Byrne-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,95
172,Ms WORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (6.36 p.m.)-I welcome the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I note that these bills provide funding for a number of important new initiatives, including a package of additional drought measures, a donation to the Farmhand drought appeal, additional funding for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, support for victims of the Bali disaster and their families, indexation adjustments for Defence and expected continued growth in New Apprenticeships. This government has an opportunity to make a real contribution to the Australian way of life through preventative health measures, and I believe we are already achieving results in key areas. This debate provides me with the opportunity to speak in some detail on some of them. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to initiate some of these measures, particularly in the areas of food and drugs, including tobacco and alcohol. The simple adage ‘prevention is better than cure' holds particular weight in my areas of responsibility. You only need to consider the burden on our health system caused by tobacco and alcohol related diseases to realise that successfully discouraging somebody today from smoking or from the misuse of alcohol has massive benefits in the future. What I have found through working in this area is that the sledgehammer approach rarely works. People are more likely to respond to government initiatives through carefully crafted educational and promotional activities that target key audiences, including young people. It is no good trying to tell people they should not drink too much alcohol without explaining the dangers of doing so. Locking up people who have committed a crime simply to feed their drug addiction is pointless if there is no attempt offer them the opportunity of rehabilitation. Telling a young girl that smoking is bad for her will not have any impact if she sees her role models doing exactly that. We need to undertake these measures because of the terrible pressures that drug abuse puts on our society. I recently released a report entitled Counting the cost: estimates of the social cost of drug abuse in Australia in 1998-99. The report estimates that illicit and licit drug abuse costs the Australian community $34.5 billion a year. Smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable disease in Australia and around the world. Smoking related disease kills more than 19,000 Australians every year. One in two lifetime smokers will die from their habit. Smoking is responsible for 30 per cent of all cancers and 25 per cent of all heart disease and costs $12.7 billion a year in health care and other related costs. Yet one in five Australians aged 14 and over still smoke. The good news is that the prevalence of smoking in Australia is declining. Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the developed world. According to the 2001 National Drug Household Survey by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the number of Australians aged 14 years or more who smoke tobacco daily has dropped over the past three years to 19.5 per cent. We must continue our leadership role in tobacco control. While Australia was one of the first countries in the world to prohibit tobacco advertising, that legislation is now 10 years old and is showing signs of being out of date. That is why last year I called for a review of the Australian tobacco advertising laws to ensure that they keep pace with emerging advertising and marketing practices that entice people to smoke. I am particularly committed to taking effective steps to ensure that young people are not influenced to take up smoking by being exposed to indirect forms of promotion of tobacco products. While organisations such as Quit and the cancer councils around Australia have been very good at promoting antitobacco messages, we have also received support from some unexpected quarters. A recent report on cigarette smoking among to women in Australia suggests that within the next decade smoking will be more common among women than men, and this is a disturbing trend. However, I am delighted that the Australian fashion industry have recognised that they can play a key role in getting the message across to young people, particularly females, that smoking is not cool. In particular, the 2001 Australian Fashion Week took the issue head-on by launching a smoke-free fashion initiative with the support of the Commonwealth government. There has long been a link between fashion and smoking, with smoking seen to be cool and fashionable. This initiative has helped to dispel this myth and exposed cigarette smoking as an unhealthy and addictive habit. This initiative and a similar alcohol and music industry initiative, which I will outline later, demonstrate how a collaborative approach between government and those who work with and influence young people can make a difference. It provides a more powerful message with a greater reach to target audiences. The government is highly committed to reducing the harm to Australian families and communities caused by the misuse of alcohol. In July 2001 the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy endorsed the national alcohol strategy in recognition of the effects that alcohol misuse has on a wide range of areas. This has provided the foundation for Commonwealth action focusing on three areas of activity: research, treatment and prevention. The Commonwealth government is aware of recent research that indicates that small amounts of alcohol each day for older people can be beneficial to their health. However, misuse of alcohol can have a devastating effect on a person's health and impact on the lives of those around them. Two weeks ago, I announced a new education campaign to help drinkers know how much alcohol is safe and just what is a standard drink. These days many people who have a few drinks at a bar or at a friend's place are aware of the dangers and consequences of drink-driving and therefore tend to keep track of the number of drinks consumed. However, a quick survey at the local pub soon reveals that few people know how much alcohol there is in each glass, bottle can that they are drinking from. For example, a pot or schooner of full-strength beer may contain one standard drink but a can of beer may contain 1.5 standard drinks. Similarly most people are unaware that a single glass of wine served at a restaurant can be the equivalent of 1.8 standard drinks. So what is a safe drinking level? The Commonwealth government, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, has assessed that to minimise health risks men should have no more than four standard drinks a day on average and on any one day men should have no more than six standard drinks. Women should have no more than two standard drinks a day on average to minimise health risks and on any one day women should have no more than four standard drinks. For men and women an alcohol-free day-or, better still, days-is desirable each week. To spread the message the government has produced educational materials including coasters, booklets, posters and pamphlets that will be distributed to licensed venues as well as health care settings. One of the big problems that we face today regarding the misuse of alcohol is the level of underage drinking and in particular binge drinking. I have encountered widespread community concern about the increasing amount of alcohol being consumed by young people and the fact that they start drinking at a much younger age. The 2001 National Drug Household Survey found that nearly 12 per cent of females and 10 per cent of males aged 14 to 19 were drinking at least at weekly intervals and putting themselves at risk of short-term harm, such as violence or injury, while intoxicated. An estimated 1.2 million teenagers consumed alcohol in 2001. Our young people are putting themselves at considerable risk through excessive drinking. Harms associated with excessive drinking include violence, unprotected and unplanned sex, physical harm and humiliation. Two recent announcements aimed at reducing the misuse of alcohol among young people were looking at the problems of alcohol products being targeted directly at young or people and the promotion of safe drinking messages through the music industry. In July last year, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed to ask the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs to review the effectiveness of the current self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising. The ministerial council was particularly concerned about opportunistic marketing of alcohol to young people under 18 years of age. Further to that decision, I asked the National Expert Advisory Committee on Alcohol to examine the marketing and promotion of ready-to-drink alcoholic products to minors. These products are sometimes described as ‘lolly water', as they do not taste like alcohol, and it has been argued that they have been designed and manufactured to suit the palate of young people. In fact, over the past 3½ years, tracking studies for the National Alcohol Campaign have seen the proportion of 15 to 17 year olds drinking pre-mixed spirits dramatically increase from six per cent to 22 per cent for boys and from 10 per cent to 37 per cent for girls. Those are certainly alarming statistics. I also note from the Australian Alcohol Guidelines that the average can of a pre-mixed spirit drink is equivalent to 1.5 standard drinks. The government's stance on these issues has now also received strong support from the Australian music industry. We have joined forces to reach young people with responsible drinking messages, and I would like to thank Mushroom marketing, the Brazin group and members of the bands Another Race, CrashPalace and the Butterfly Effect for their support. Jake Nicolaisen from the band Another Race had a clear message for young people who misuse alcohol. His warning was simple: There's nothing cool about not being in control. Our choices are our own, we live and die by them, we prosper and fall and we can hurt or help, but they are ours and we own them. What we need now is strong support from the community-including from parents, schools and doctors-in taking responsibility for this issue. In particular, the alcohol dustry needs to adopt a responsible approach because it is providing a substance that is potentially harmful. Another area where this government is totally committed is illicit drug use. We are making every effort to address the illicit problem in Australia and accordingly have introduced the largest single initiative ever undertaken in this country to respond to the supply of, and to reduce demand for, illicit drugs. We have evidence that the commitment of more than $625 million is working. Fewer people are now taking illicit drugs, fewer people are dying of overdoses, more parents are talking to their children about drugs, more treatment services are available and, with Commonwealth leadership and funding, all states and territories are now establishing diversion programs. The statistics speak for themselves. The 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey reported a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people using illicit drugs. The number of people dying of overdoses in 2001 was 306, compared with 725 in 2000 and 958 in 1999-a drop of 68 per cent in two years. One of the most encouraging statistics is that 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children about drugs during the 2001 National Illicit Drugs Campaign. But the government is not about to fall back on its achievements. I was delighted to hear the announcement by the Prime Minister at the end of last year that an additional $215 million will be allocated to the continuation of the Illicit Drug Diversion Initiawith tive. That brings to $840 million the total resources that the government has committed to the Tough on Drugs strategy. The Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative gives minor drug offenders alternatives to the criminal justice system by providing access to appropriate education, assessment and treatment services. During the second phase, we will build on the momentum that has gathered to date and ensure that minor drug offenders continue to be given a chance to address their illicit drug use and stay out of the criminal justice system. One of the key components of this initiain- tive is the Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment program, otherwise know as the MERIT program. I recently had the opportunity to launch one of these programs at the Burwood Local Court in Sydney. MERIT is a voluntary program based in the Magistrates drug Court that offers assessment and treatment options for illicit drug users who are apprehended for summary offences. Suitable offenders are bailed for a period of up to three months to undergo treatment. Each offender's progress in treatment is reported to the court and is taken into account when sentencing is determined. Another major part of the Commonwealth government's National Illicit Drugs Strategy is the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants program, which aims to strengthen the capacity of non-government organisations to provide improved services and to increase the number of treatment places available. This program is continuing in 2002-03, with $65 million allocated in the federal budget. Additionally, part of this funding has been allocated to the second stage of the application process, which will allow new organisations wishing to provide new treatment services an opportunity to apply for funding. As with tobacco and alcohol misuse, a significant focus of the National Drugs Strategy is on young people. A paper prepared by the Centre for Adolescent Health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the University of Melbourne highlights that: Early age of a specific substance use is associated the subsequent development of more frequent use of that substance and such patterns of use generally increase the risk of problems with that substance later in life. The government has provided $27.3 million to the National School Drug Education Strategy, which has a goal of no illicit drugs in schools and focuses on improved drug prevention education. In remote and rural areas, the Commonwealth government has been supporting the Croc Festivals. These events were developed to encourage young Indigenous students to attend school more regularly and to lead healthy, positive lifestyles without misusing alcohol or consuming tobacco, illicit drugs or other harmful substances. While on the subject of drug abuse, I cannot let the opportunity pass without condemning the deplorable stance taken by the New South Wales Greens on this issue. I was shocked to read that their party advocates the legalisation of drugs such as ecstasy, speed and marijuana. They are clearly out of touch with the damage that drug abuse causes to individuals, their families and the community. As I have just outlined, the Commonwealth government has introduced a number of proactive measures relating to drug and alcohol issues, and we are not about to rest on our laurels. But the Commonwealth cannot do it alone. The state and territory governments must ensure that they put these issues high on their agendas and keep them there. I was concerned, for example, to hear that the Victorian government was taking funding out of drug and alcohol areas as the Commonwealth government put extra funding in. I am particularly concerned to hear that in my home state of South Australia, the state Labor government is planning to cut $104 million from the forward estimates for health over the next four years. Such cuts would have a big impact on hospital treatment and waiting times, and it makes a mockery of the state government's commitment to increase health spending. There are two areas in particular that I would like to highlight-and which I would like states and territories to consider. Firstly, I would like them to look at their laws relating to the provision of alcohol-and in particular the supply of alcohol to young people-with a view to having more consistent legislation. This issue was brought to my attention as a result of the tragic death of 15year-old Leigh Clark, who died as a result of consuming alcohol in the backyard of a friend's place. Leigh's father, Bruce Clark, wrote to me asking that something be done to provide consistent legislation across all states and territories regarding the supply of alcohol to young people. I have informed Mr Clark that, while this is up to the states, take the opportunity to raise the matter at the next Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting which, of course, will be attended by state and territory ministers. Secondly, I believe far more needs to be done regarding drug rehabilitation and treatment opportunities within the prison system. I am informed that at any one time there are approximately 20,000 people in our prisons. A significant number of them are addicted to drugs. It surprises me that there are opportunities missed within our corrective services system to educate, rehabilitate and treat these offenders. The emphasis has been on keeping inmates there, with opportunities lost to explore the cause of their being there and how they can be helped to not re-offend. It has been put to me that there are real opportunities for non-government organisations that provide treatment services to provide rehabilitation and treatment for people in prison, and to continue this treatment after these people have served their time behind bars. As one treatment service provider put to me last year, one of the hardest things about trying to rehabilitate drug users is to get them fed, clothed, housed and turning up for appointments. He pointed out that all this could be achieved within the prison system. Adequate attention to drug use in prisons could also benefit the wider community by reducing the spread of hepatitis B and C and HIV. There are emerging issues that we, as a government, are working on. One of these issues is the co-morbidity that exists between drug abuse and mental health. We need a greater coordination of services, greater involvement by GPs and, where necessary, links to teaching hospitals. The increasing use of psycho-stimulants is an area of growing concern. Already the government is taking a coordinated approach to stop over-thecounter medicines being diverted into the manufacture of drugs such as speed and ecstasy. Thirdly, there is a real need to look at the provision of treatment services in regional and rural areas of Australia. (Time expired)",95
173,Mr FITZGIBBON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to use the free-ranging opportunity presented by the appropriation debate to talk about a number of issues in my electorate and, if time permits, say something more about the current situation in Iraq, something about unfair dismissalsbecause the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations decided to misrepresent me during question time today-and something about some gas issues in the Timor Sea. I will begin with the issue of health in my electorate and, in particular, the issue of bulk-billing. Even more importantly, I would like to raise the issue of access to medical help, in particular in the Cessnock local government area-my own home town-where the resident to doctor ratio is now approaching 3,000 to one. It has to be said that it is reaching crisis point. I suspect that the resident to doctor ratio in the Prime Minister's electorate, for example, would be something more around 1,200 to one. This has significant knock-on effects. When you have a doctor on just about every corner, competition is intense, access is easy and bulk-billing rates tend to be high. There is another repercussion-that is, if people have easy access to a doctor, they are more likely to get more than their fair share of turn on their Medicare investment. To give a short comparison, again using the Prime Minister's electorate, the bulk-billing rate in the Hunter electorate is around 50.01 per cent; in the Prime Minister's electorate it is in excess of 80 per cent. Similarly, the number of GP visits in the Hunter electorate during the September quarter of 2002 was around 146,000; in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong it was around 186,000. So you can see the impact of a lack of doctors, not only in terms of access but in terms of the return people living in those areas where there is a shortage of doctors get on their Medicare rebate. I think it is true to say that the highest taxing government in the history of federation is coming very close to securing the title of the government delivering the worse health outcomes in the history of federation. In the Hunter, this really is a crisis and time the government dealt with the crisis. Thankfully, due to some very effective work on the part of our local community and, I must say, with some assistance from the Commonwealth minister's office, the Cessnock situation has been alleviated. We have now secured seven new GPs in the course of a few short weeks. However, five of those GPs are there on a temporary basis as postgraduate trainees-doing their work experience in my electorate, if you like. Another is an overseas trained doctor on a temporary visitor's visa-once again, obviously there on a temporary basis. The seventh new doctor in Cessnock is there, for the time being at least, on a part-time basis-once again, possibly only a short-term solution. While we have had some relief in Cessnock, other towns in my electorate suffer similar problems and all the structural issues remain. One of the big issues in Cessnock is that the area is classed as RRMA 2 and therefore does not qualify for a range of assistance measures designed to both retain doctors in country towns and attract doctors to country towns. Cessnock is considered to be ‘other metropolitan'-I think that is the term used-which denies it access to all of these programs. This is despite the fact that Cessnock's general practitioners are members of re- the Hunter Rural Division of General Practice, as opposed to the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. This is despite the fact that Cessnock's GPs operate very much in a rural manner in their interrelationship with their patients and the local hospital. This is despite the fact that the Royal College of General Practitioners has designated Cessnock as an appropriate place for postgraduate students to do their rural doctor hands-on training, which is why we were able to secure five postgraduate students in Cessnock recently. There are anomalies in the RRMA system. I am not saying that the government must move tomorrow to change Cessnock to RRMA 4 because, whenever you have these arbitrarily drawn boundaries, there will be knock-on effects and other anomalies will arise. I have asked the minister to have a close look at Cessnock on the basis that it it is has already been identified as an area of workplace shortage and to introduce some flexibility into the system to allow Cessnock to access some of those programs. I acknowledge that there are currently some good programs to both attract and retain doctors in country areas, but there has to be some flexibility to ensure that those programs are delivered where they are needed most. Having passed some judgment on the amount of revenue being raised by the government-the seventh anniversary of which we are celebrating today-as compared with the health outcomes, the Medicare levy has gone from $3 billion to $5 billion and yet health outcomes in my electorate are going backwards. I appeal to the minister to have a special look at Cessnock. I have been attempting to organise a meeting between her and Cessnock GPs, who are very keen to discuss these issues. She has indicated her preference to have the local GPs meet with her departmental people initially, and I am happy to accept that. But, if appropriate comes are not determined, I will still call upon the minister to give those local GPs the time they need. Obviously, we need higher rebates for GP services in certain rural and regional communities. We must ensure that GP rebates keep pace with rising medical practice overheads. We need better targeted GP incentive programs, as I have said. We need greater support for our public hospitals. We need an equalisation scheme which guarantees that country residents gain an equal share of their Medicare contributions-the point I was making earlier with respect to access to GPs. We need more moneys for our divisions of general practice for the development of local strategies for dealing with doctor shortages within the regions they service. This might be the mechanism for returning the Medicare investment to the regions-an equalisation scheme that delivers money back from areas which are overserviced to local divisions of general practice. In the medium to long term, most importantly we need to be ensuring that more university places are made available for young people from rural and regional areas, because they are the people who are more likely to want to return to the country areas to practise medicine. It is an important issue. The second important local electorate issue I want to raise relates to Australia Post. Australia Post recorded a record net profit of $297 million in the financial year 2001-02. But in Cessnock the postal giant is forcing workplace changes and is currently in dispute with the 12 permanents who deliver mail in my local town. Australia Post wants to change the working hours of postal deliverers. It says that the change is technology driven-that the earlier sorting needs to occur in its main centre in Maitland, because that is where the latest technology is available, and the mail be sent to Cessnock later on; therefore, it wants the local postal workers to commence work later. This has big implications for their family incomes. It means denial of overtime opportunities and some of the penalty rate entitlements they current enjoy under their EBA. I always try very hard to stay out of these outissues when they are subject to further discussion between the parties. Maybe even as we speak there is still a meeting going on between Australia Post, the union and those local workers. We are still awaiting those outcomes. I accept that Australia Post is facing enormous new competition in a rapidly changing society and that it has to remain competitive. Much of that comes in the wake of the information revolution. Having said that I prefer to stay out of these negotiations until at least deadlocks are reached, I was most disappointed, while I was driving through Cessnock on Sunday, to notice a postman delivering mail. That surprised me because I was aware that, late Friday afternoon, the permanent postal workers had walked off the job. It is highly unusual, in any case, to see a fully uniformed postal deliverer delivering post on a Sunday. My investigations revealed that the person on the motor scooter was an employee of or someone retained by Drake Employment. Drake Employment, I understand, has people fully trained in mail delivery services ready to supply to Australia Post when there is a work force shortage for some reason, such as an extraordinary number of people on holiday or sick leave. These people are trained and ready to go if the need arises. That in itself is of concern to me, but what really concerned me in this instance was that the person I saw on Sunday was, effectively, a scab. I always say that, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it is a duck. There is no other description for bringing in Drake personnel to do the work of Australia Post workers at a time when they have decided to withdraw their labour. Some might say that residents would be happy for Drake personnel to be delivering the mail because, while the guys were on strike, they would not be securing their mail. I disagree. I think the general public, particularly in my electorate, would agree that those men have the right to withdraw their labour. It is an important point of leverage for them in their negotiations with the corporation. It is outrageous, in my view, for Australia Post to bring in Drake people to do the work of those Australia Post workers over the weekend and to replace them when they have withdrawn their labour. I will be talking to Australia Post about this issue again tomorrow. I certainly hope that this evening's meeting reaches some conclusions and some positive outcomes. The third thing I want to talk about in relation to my electorate is something I touched on very briefly this morning in the debate on the private member's motion concerning Lang Hancock: restructuring in the coal mining industry in my electorate. It is fair to say, just speaking in general terms, that in the Hunter we are now producing twice as much coal as we were 10 years ago and with half as many people. That is largely, of course, a product of technological change-the large shift from underground coal mining to the more capital intensive open-cut coal mining. This has enormous implications for my electorate in economic, employment and social terms. Huge restructuring, consolidation and rationalisation of mines are taking place. We saw the closure of the Wombo underground mine, the Cumnock underground mine and, more recently, the Nardell mine. Nardell is a slightly different most of the other closures have come from general restructuring and changing economic conditions. But it appears that Nardellwhich is only a couple of years old and which showed such promise in terms of future growth-has been suddenly closed because the Australian dollar gained strength, coal prices went down and they struck some difficult geological conditions, which is not unusual. What is unusual about this case is the suddenness of the decision to close the mine and the short period for which the mine has been operating. The mine is operated by a subsidiary company known as Nardell Coal Corporation, but the major equity holder in the mine is a subsidiary of Macquarie Bank. I spoke to Macquarie Bank tonight and expressed my concern that not only have 100 men lost their jobs but also a huge number of unsecured creditors look like losing a lot of money. It just beggars belief that such a new mine should close so abruptly. I hope that Ferrier Hodgson, the receivers in this case, have some explanations for those creditors in the not too distant future. This is a very concerning development in my electorate: that such a new mine, offering so much in terms of growth, could suddenly be closed. I understand that it is being closed because Macquarie Bank or its subsidiary, the trust that has equity in the mine, has decided that it is all too hard and has called in the receivers. I am not going to turn to Iraq, as I indicated I would, because I am going to run out of time. I have probably said enough about it in this place. I will just say how outraged I have been, since the last time. I spoke on the issue, to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, in here waxing lyrical during question time about the atrocities of Saddam Hussein, which we all acknowledge-the events of torture, dispossession, oppression and all of those sorts of things. They are feelings we did not hear expressed during the refugee debate in 2001, when we were turning away Iraqis who were themselves the victims of the very regime he has been referring to during question time on a regular basis. My view is that the hypocrisy of it all is case in that just mind-blowing. The last thing I will touch on, very briefly, is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who, pretty outrageously, took some quotes of mine out of context during question time today. That is fine because, in the past, I have expressed the view that small business people are concerned about unfair dismissal laws. There is no doubt about that: small business people look at a range of issues when they contemplate employing people, and unfair dismissal is one of them. The minister today took some of my comments out of context and mixed them with others on other issues to produce the mix he was looking for. Labor will reject the government's attempt to totally quarantine small-business employers from any action for unfair dismissal. I have said in here million times before: once a society has made a determination about what constitutes a fair or an unfair dismissal, that standard should be applied equally to all in our society. You cannot say that, just because someone has only 19 work mates, they will not have any protection from unscrupulous employers. And there are unscrupulous employers out there. That is why I have consistently said that there are some problems within the unfair dismissal regime. I point out again that the regime we operate under now is the government's own regime, as put in place under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. It is a regime that the minister of the day referred to as ‘a fair go all round'. If the government wants to talk to us about some changes to the regime, and in particular how it affects small business, we welcome that. We welcome changes to the process, but we will not support a proposition that, because someone has only 15 or 19 work mates, they should have no protection from unscrupulous employers whatsoever. That is ridiculous. If the government wants to talk about changes, it should talk to us. (Time expired)",99
174,Ms GAMBARO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to speak in the cognate debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-03 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-03. In keeping with the theme of finance, I wish to reflect on a matter that is very close to my heart: the state of Queensland. Queensland has earned the title of the Sunshine State. Phrases such as ‘beautiful one day, perfect the next' resonate with many Australians who long for the sunny climates of this great state. The bayside suburbs on the Redcliffe Peninsula in the electorate of Petrie have seen a growing resurgence in both population and the number of daytrippers to this part of the world. Despite the picture-perfect images of this wonderful state, there is a growing concern for the manner in which the present Queensland government balances its budget. On Wednesday last week, the Queensland Treasurer, Terry Mackenroth, released the state government's mid-year fiscal and economic review. The outlook is for another a budget deficit, the third one in a row. While employment growth is expected to exceed by one-quarter of one percent its projected figure of 2.5 per cent, and economic growth is expected to remain on track at 4.25 per cent, the government is still expecting a deficit of $741 million. This figure is lower than the previous year's $894 million deficit, but it is still a far cry from the prediction in June last year of a Queensland government budget surplus of $23 million. So what has gone wrong? According to the state Treasurer, ‘Queensland runs a tight fiscal ship and it runs it wisely.' He has advocated no new taxes yet he has forecast a 10 per cent increase in revenue. However, according to the mid-year fiscal and economic review, revenue has fallen from $20.18 billion to $19.69 billion and expenses have risen from $20.157 billion to $20.44 billion. So, if the mid-year revenue figures are down and expenses are up, where is the additional 10 per cent increase in revenue coming from? The recent housing boom has proved very beneficial to the state government and has resulted in its having a $400 million windfall in stamp duty. Indeed, stamp duty from the housing boom and the subsequent increase in insurance has proved a real winner for state government coffers. But how could the ongoing demand in the housing sector be the source of the 10 per cent increase in state revenue? Perhaps the answer lies in investments that the Queensland government places with the Queensland Investment Corporation. An independent review of the Queensland Investment Corporation's investment strategy found the strategy to be sound and predicted returns of about 7.5 per cent. That would suggest that something very positive is happening, but that is not the case. Last Wednesday, Mr Mackenroth told the state parliament that the Queensland government forecast a zero return from its QC investments, which he said were currently running at minus five per cent. Two years ago, he predicted an eight per cent return, and that was downgraded to 2.4 per cent. Finally, it has been downgraded to zero per cent. Mr Mackenroth has claimed that exposure to international domestic sharemarkets was the real culprit. The irony here is that the Queensland government could have received a greater return, according to the state Treasurer's figures, if it had opened up a savings account at the local bank. But, since the Beattie government's re-election in February 2001, it has spent big in the traditional confines of the executive wing of the Public Service. Commerce Queensland president, Graham Heilbronn, coined it quite nicely when he said: The Beattie government must take a harder look at its own financial management and make the hard decisions to cut more fat out of the Public Service. The Queensland Public Sector Union was the only group to publicly state that the Queensland budget was in a very healthy financial state. This is a very interesting stance given the recent cuts to the Public Service. Again, the state government did give the Public Service a 3.5 per cent wage increase over three years. Unfortunately in this great state of ours, the nurses were not so lucky. The state government could only offer them a three per cent increase, and the health minister referred to them and their profession in a most derogatory way. The cuts to the Public Service came by way of 2,000 voluntary early retirement packages. We were told that this would save roughly $70 million and would cover the extra 0.5 per cent increase but there would be no reduction in the output from the Public Service. The cuts were not meant to affect services. In parts of regional Queensland, road programs could be affected as a result of 200 jobs being cut from the government's regional road building and maintenance unit. How do the regions feel, given that the Queensland government-according to figures it provided to the National Road Transport Commission-slashed road funding by 21 per cent in 2001-02? In 2000-01, the Queensland government spent $1.1 billion, and in 2001-02, that figure has dropped to $713 million. This major reduction in expenditure has many people in the business community concerned. According to the Centre for Business and Industry in Brisbane, there is a concern that the state government allowed the capital expenditure budget to dwindle at a time when capital expenditure should be on the increase. The decrease in capital expenditure has fallen in the 2002-03 budget from $5.3 billion to $4.8 billion. The centre states that, to many in business, government indecision on major productive infrastructure projects is sounding warning bells. The failure of the Beattie government to win over business was echoed recently by the President of Commerce Queensland, Graham Heilbronn, who said that a businessled recovery was highly unlikely. This was indeed reflected in the Pulse survey, released by Commerce Queensland two days after the Treasurer's review last week. Business in Queensland is visibly concerned, and it has every right to be so. The Pulse survey found that business had a strong impression that the Queensland government would increase taxes. This comes on the back of a recently announced ambulance levy of $88 per household, which is expected to raise over $100 million when it begins in July this year. The levy was announced despite a record $558 million emergency services budget, announced in 2002, to provide an extra $18 million for ambulance services; a $50 million program to buy vehicles and build new ambulance and fire stations; and $18.9 million for a new volunteers program. In releasing the Pulse survey, Commerce Queensland's chief executive, Joe Barnewall, saw it as unfortunate that the Queensland government would be introducing an ambulance levy. He had this to say about it: ‘Irrespective of how it is marketed, it is a new tax and it certainly does cause a great degree of unrest and unease out there in the community.' As a Queenslander, my unease rests with the financial skill of the Beattie government, so I understand greatly the nervousness of the business community. The Queensland government's blatant lack of financial management questions the very integrity of its claim that there will be no new taxes. Perhaps in its efforts to raise this 10 per cent revenue through avenues other than additional taxes, it has begun what appears to be the great Queensland state government fire sale, beginning with the sale of prime residential land. In the last month, the state ernment has showcased two pieces of prime residential real estate that it hopes to Stafford Heights in my electorate, and also the old site of the Boggo Road jail in inner Brisbane. Each piece of land is worth millions. In my electorate of Petrie, the state member for Stafford, Terry Sullivan, held a public meeting to talk about the proposed development in Stafford Heights, which is on a section of land that is adjacent to the very important Mountains to Mangroves corridor. The corridor runs from the Ramsar-listed Moreton Bay across the federal electorates of Lilley and Petrie to Brisbane's Forest Park in the electorate of Dickson. The corridor is so significant that it secured federal funding from the electorates of both Lilley and Petrie. The land is currently used by many local people as a recreation area and includes a sectioned-off, dogfriendly park. The proposed development has only one principal access point, which will cause major congestion for local streets. An estimate of the land value is somewhere between $5 million and $9 million. That would certainly be a nice little revenue earner, despite restricting the habitat for many species from the adjacent Mountains to Mangroves corridor that use this particular area of vegetation. The member for Stafford is probably only one of two people I know who are for the development; the remaining hundreds of people are against it. Perhaps he knows that if he delivers this nice little revenue earner for the state government he, too, may be rewarded. He does not care that the people are against it. He said at a public meeting that he did not really care what the people of Stafford Heights thought about him-so much for being elected by the people for the people! Perhaps Mr Sullivan has a new mantra that borrows more from the movie Jerry Maguire than from any sense of duty to his own electorate. More is the pity that the state government is using the guise of 20 per cent more public housing proposed in this development to give it some sense of duty to the people of Queensland. According to the state government, we need more dwellings, particularly gov- in Brisbane, to house close to 9,000 on the public housing waiting list. But a quick sell-at check shows that the number of public housing dwellings in Stafford has remained static at 1,321 in both the 1996 and 2001 census, even though there has been a considerable sell-off of a number of public housing dwellings in the same area over the past few years. If the Queensland government were really serious about public housing, they would not have cut funding to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement by $600,000, while the federal government increased funding by $1.5 million. They would not have sold off public housing dwellings while the waiting list continues to grow. At both ends of my electorate-for example, in the Deception Bay and Stafford Heights areas-there are public housing dwellings sitting idle. There is a litany of examples where the Beattie government have failed to service the Queensland public. One of the saddest examples of how the Beattie government is redirecting funding is the reduction of staff in the Children, Families and Young People Directorate, which is responsible for child protection. According to the annual report of the Queensland Department of Families released late last year, staff in the Children, Families and Young People Directorate have been reduced from 163 to 143. This reduction occurred at a time when child protection notifications have risen by 20 per cent to almost 15,294. Since 2000-01, the number of child protection cases that have not been finalised has risen to almost 3,000. Couple this with dramatic increases in hospital waiting lists, and the very integrity of how the Queensland government provides for the Queensland people comes into question. According to the 2001-02 Queensland Health annual report, public hospital emergency departments were unable to meet Queensland Health's target for treating patients of category 1, 2, 3 and 4 status. It found that 99 per cent of urgent emergency patients were treated within the recommended time frame-and Queensland Health recommends all category 1 patients be seen immediately. However, 71 per cent of category 2 patients were seen within the recommended 10-minute time frame, with a target of 80 per cent. Only 56 per cent of category 3 patients were seen within the time frame of half an hour, short of the target by almost 20 per cent. The report showed that the number of patients had increased from 718,000 to 722,000. I am highly supportive of the work of all our health professionals, from nurses to specialists and the administrative staff of our hospitals. They all provide the outstanding service that led to Premier Beattie's statement in 2001 that Queensland has the best public hospitals. He is probably right. But he did not honour that statement when he was unwilling to give Queensland nurses the 3.5 per cent increase that he offered to the public service, downgrading it to three per cent because it was too expensive. So what value does Queensland Health put on the lives of thousands of people who are on the ever growing waiting lists? In my electorate, there are 802 overdue cases across three categories on the waiting list at Redcliffe Hospital and 34 overdue cases on the Prince Charles waiting list at Chermside. Too often the state government points the finger at the federal government, claiming there have been cuts. But that is not the case. Let us have a look at what the Commonwealth's commitment to state health has been. The states have benefited from a 28 per cent increase in funding under the current arrangements, with a record $31.7 billion in Commonwealth funding for public hospitals. The private health insurance reforms, such as the federal government's 30 per cent rebate, are taking the pressure off public hospitals, with a 12 per cent increase in admissions to private hospitals. Under the current Australian health care agreements, the Commonwealth is providing $682 million to specifically help states improve their safety and quality. The Commonwealth was also instrumental in establishing the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care to lead national efforts in this area. In addition, there is $72.7 million in the 200203 budget to improve access for rural Australians. And the Commonwealth is taking the lead on improving cancer care-obtaining state health ministers' agreement to prepare specific proposals on practical improvements to the organisation, delivery and funding of radiation, oncology and related cancer services within 12 months. Let us not forget the GST. When the GST was introduced, the federal Treasurer decreed that no state would be worse off. In the first round, in 2000-01, Queensland received over $4 billion in GST revenue. In 2001-02 it received over $5 billion. In 2003-04 Queensland is expected to be one of the three states in Australia which is recommended to receive more from the GST than the amount that was guaranteed by the federal government. According to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Queensland is expected to receive $7.42 billion, up almost $404 million on the previous year. That is a significant increase in revenue for the state government, and it may well be a large chunk of any sudden unknown increase in revenue for the Beattie government. It demonstrates the financial input from the federal government to the state government and makes us loudly ask the question: where is the money going? One of the chief benefits of returning GST revenue to the states was that it gave them a growing pool of revenue to be spent as they wished. But public hospitals, education and transport-all of these-could well benefit from this freedom to allocate funding as required by the budgetary priorities. There is a pattern forming. Facing three consecutive deficits, the Beattie government needs to do more now than provide rhetoric on how its investments did not do so well or how it can find blame with external factors. It needs to do more than use the media prowess of Premier Beattie to falsely claim that the federal government is not investing in Queensland. There are seven wage bargaining cases facing the Queensland government at the moment. Even the Queensland Teachers Union, once a flag waver of the Beattie government, particularly in my electorate, is running a public campaign to improve class sizes in Queensland's state schools. Queensland is a great state, but the Queensland state government really needs to remember that its financial mismanagement is impacting on business confidence and contributing to a general malaise among many public service areas, such as health and education. That is not so good for this great sunshine state.",103
175,Mr SNOWDON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Lingiari) (7.35 p.m.)In addressing the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, firstly let me comment briefly on the contribution by the member for Petrie. If I recall correctly, she was telling us about the importance of and the benefits that we get from the private health system. Perhaps it is worthwhile noting, in the context of private health, private medicine and private hospitals, that for the people of the Northern Territory-who are obligated to pay, as they have, to take up private health insurance because of the threats imposed upon them by government-there is only one private hospital in the Northern Territory, and that, of course, is in Darwin. The previous Northern Territory government made a decision to allocate a private hospital ward in the grounds of the publicly funded Alice Springs Hospital, but-and it may not come as any surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Baressi; it certainly was no surprise to me-when expressions of interest were called, no-one was prepared to provide a private hospital service for Central Australia unless they received massive and direct government subsidies. This of course means that the so-called benefits of private medicine do not belong to the bulk of people in my electorate. I say to the member for Petrie, who is no longer in the chamber, and to the other advocates in the government of the massive benefits of private health-noting the way in which they have inveigled, persuaded, threatened and cajoled members of the Australian taxpaying community to take out private health insurance-that, if you happen to live in a remote part of Australia, the benefits of private health insurance in terms of private hospitals are next to nil. This is not admitted to and not owned up to by the government. What we want in the bush is massive additional investment into public health and the public hospital system. Whilst I am not going to debate tonight the issue of Medicare and bulk-billing, suffice it to say that, if you look at those people who access bulk-billing in the electorate in which I live and work, you will see that they are people who benefit from direct publicly funded health services. I do not believe at this point that there is any bulk-billing practice in Alice Springs. I will, however, be undertaking a survey of all medical practices in my electorate over the next little while to establish the veracity of that and other claims. One of the matters that I want to raise tonight is the question of Indigenous education. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on 14 November last year, the Minister for Education, Science and Training released the National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training, 2001. I took particular interest in that report. If you trawl through the Hansard, you will see that I have used the opportunities given to me in this chamber over many years to talk about the issue of Indigenous education and its importance. In the foreword of the report that the minister launched, he wrote, ‘In order for Indigenous Australians to ... shape the kind of future and the kind of Australia they want, the key is education.' Hear, hear to that! ‘There can be no higher priority in a complex and broad portfolio than to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous Australians.' Hear, hear to that, I say! However, something has happened between the launching of that report and the subsequent way in which his department is administering the portfolio. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Indigenous Australians are benefiting from and have benefited from the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance programs, which encompass the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme, ATAS, the Vocational and Educational Guidance for Aboriginals Scheme, VEGAS, and the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness scheme, ASSPA. These programs give Indigenous students access to valuable tutorial assistance, among other things, and encourage them and their parents to be more involved in school activities. ATAS, the tutorial assistance scheme, is an extremely wellregarded program. They all are. However, on 29 January this year, schools around the Northern Territory were surprised by correspondence they received from the Northern Territory State Office Manager of the Department of Education, Science and Training. He wrote to all NT schools on that date about changes to the IEDA programs budget in 2003. What these changes did was undermine and white-ant the capacity of Indigenous Territorians to have the access that they previously had to these programs. He wrote in his letter: Given the level of the IEDA program currently delivered in the Northern Territory, it has been necessary for DEST to review its administrative arrangements. The new arrangements outlined in the attachment to this letter will ensure that program maintains its focus on outcomes for students and that available funds are used in a way that will maximise the benefits for Indigenous students. This came as somewhat of a surprise. Indeed, people who work in the education field in the Northern Territory, from the Northern Territory education minister, Syd Stirling, down to the Aboriginal workers in schools, were astounded by what was presented to them in this correspondence. Because what was presented to them in this correspondence was a radical reduction of the capacity for the tutorial assistance scheme and others-but, in particular, the tutorial assistance scheme. This included cuts of up to two-thirds to the tuition during school hours program, from a maximum 300 minutes per student per week to 100 minutes. Student numbers are to be capped at 2002 levels, so no additional students are allowed access to this program as a result of this directive from the department. There is a cap on the number of schools that operate ATAS. Only schools that ran ATAS programs in 2002 and submitted a report would be considered for funding in 2003. Only in very exceptional circumstances would students have access to the tuition during school hours program. There was to be no access to this program for transition students. Crucially, homework centre hours have been significantly reduced, and no new programs will be considered. These radical changes to a successful program will have enormous implications for the Northern Territory government's Indigenous Secondary Education Strategy and, in my view, will have an effect which will be most dramatic and very negative on Aboriginal communities right around the Northern Territory-from the urban schools in Alice, Darwin, Katherine and elsewhere to the remote bush communities. It is a disgrace that the federal government and its minister for education, who purports to-and, indeed, we had great hopes that he would-demonstrate his commitment to Indigenous education, can wreak such havoc on a much relied upon program without even having the decency to inform the Northern Territory government about its intentions or indeed to have any discussions with the school communities, the the parents and the students themselves about what was being proposed. No discussion, no communication, just a fait accompli. The first that the Northern Territory government heard of these changes was after the beginning of the school year when angry principals and parents began to call the minister for education and, indeed, my office to demand to know what was going on. I put out a release on 12 February raising my concerns about this issue, and my office was subsequently told that I would receive a letter from the minister, which I have yet to receive. I have also been told that the minister was going to fix this problem. The minister has yet to fix this problem and as a consequence there is a great deal of insecurity within the education system in the Northern Territory and amongst Indigenous parents because of what this means for them and their children. On 17 February the minister responded, when he said on ABC radio, ‘What I am determined to do is get this in school tuition program, keep it working and provide whatever funding I possibly can to so that we keep this program working.' Whoopee! There is a dramatic difference between having something working, having it working effectively and having cut the guts out of it in the way which has been proposed by this correspondence. There are many people waiting to hear what the minister is going to say and how he is going to fix this particular problem. The IEDA programs are working. Last week I visited the Batchelor Institute in Springs. They gave a number of examples of how this program was going to affect them and their students. In the context of this recent document that has been sent out, they argued that the assumptions which appear to inform it are as follows. Every adult has had access to and outcomes from primary and secondary education; simply not true in the case of the Northern Territory. Everyone has a good understanding of the English language and numeracy; again, simply not true in the Northern Territory. Everyone understands the complex western capitalist culture of Australia and the academic disciplines that inform the most basic of awards; simply not true in the Northern Territory. Languages are not disciplines. ATAS funds a tutor to learn Indonesian, French or Latin-why not English? Indeed, why not? Access to tutors is easy; that of course is just a joke, as pointed out in correspondence I have seen from the Batchelor Institute to the education department. The use of tutorial assistance for a bridging access or enabling course is because of a shortfall in course design; that of course is also a joke and assessment will tell what is required. I am not going to read the details of that because there is I want to come to in a moment. Let me just say that if the Minister for Education, Science and Training is actually fair dinkum about improving educational outcomes for Indigenous students across Australia-particularly in this case in the Northern Territory-he will not only make sure that the funding is restored to ensure that those programs can operate at the levels that they operated at last year, but he will also ensure that they are extended so that they can meet the demands that are there in the Northern Territory for the expansion of these programs, because they are crucially important. There is another matter I want to raise this evening, which involves another ministerthat is, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It involves the cuts to the living allowance and pharmaceutical benefits that the government has now invoked upon East Timorese people who have failed the application to the Refugee Review Tribunal. This is a very imporAlice tant moral issue, in my view. Three weeks ago an elderly couple came into my office in Darwin- Mrs Siau Ping Li and her husband, most Mr Fong Ting Jong. Mrs Li is 57 years of age and Mr Jong is 69. This couple were the first East Timorese asylum seekers in Darwin to face the Refugee Review Tribunal. On 21 February, the tribunal handed down its decision to reject their appeal to stay in Australia-a decision that is expected to be duplicated to every one of the 1,800 East Timorese asylum seekers across the country who are currently subject to this process. This process, by which a group that is part of the Australian community has been subjected to years of uncertainty and neglect, has been atrociously handled from the beginning. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs rejected our calls last year, which I make again tonight, to deal with this community humanely by creating a special humanitarian visa class. Instead, he insisted on continuing with the torturous, drawn out, costly legal process that is slowly destroying the spirit of these people-and, I might say, undermining the confidence of many in our community towards the minister and the government in relation to dealing another matter with these issues. I briefly want to talk about Mrs Li and Mr Fong. Last week Mrs Lee and Mr Fong were told by the department that their meagre allowance under the Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme, which is less than a standard Centrelink allowance, was being taken away along with their access to Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits. This elderly couple-faced with a $1,000 bill, thanks to the RRT's rejection of their appeal to stay-can no longer afford to eat, pay their rent or purchase the basic essentials that allow them to survive and take part in the community without the support of charities or friends. But it gets worse. A note from last Friday's Northern Territory News states: Mr Fong was scheduled for biopsy on 3 March to see whether or not he has throat cancer. He has to be fed by his wife often. Mrs Li has worked for many years as a volunteer for the Red Cross. She also needs medical care for chronic high blood pressure. Mrs Li said that the decision to nancial and medical support would render them destitute. That is what this government is doing to this community. It is something which I am very concerned and, indeed, most ashamed of. I am astonished that the government could fall to these depths. I was given to expect that this minister had some sense of compassion or feeling and that he would deal compassionately with these sorts of issues. But let me say that this is simply not the case. I might point out that one of our members, the member for MCMillan, was ejected from the chamber today for doing something which I think the world ought to know about. This minister is supposed to be the advocate and look after the interests of these people. These people are the most humble of people and I would have thought they had a right to expect that they would be granted permanent residency long before this. Through no fault of their own they have had delay after delay by successive governments dealing with their particular applications. But this minister simply plays to the gallery, and we had that writ large today. The member for MCMillan was ejected from this chamber because we on this side of the House were running a book as to how many times the minister would look up to the gallery during the course of an answer to a question. The member for MCMillan was close to the markthat in response to a question, the minister turned to look up at the gallery not one, two, three or four times, but 15 times. The question was asked from the floor of the chamber and the minister stands behind the dispatch box and looks up at the gallery 15 times for approval. It is a demonstration of how sincere this minister is. The minister has also said that the East Timorese asylum seekers who have sought refuge in this country have been secreting themselves in the community. That is far from the truth. There is no issue of secreting these people in the community in the Northern Territory. We want them to stay as citizens in the Northern Territory. They have been offered support by the Northern Territory government-indeed, from no less a person than the Chief Minister. The Northern cut fiTerritory community wants these people to stay and does not want them to be dealt with unfairly or harshly-or in the way this government is treating them. There is a very simple way around this. To help these people maintain the dignity that we want them to have the minister should not, in desperation, send them back to the uncertainty of East Timor when they have made Australia their home-many after eight or nine years of living here. Many of these people have had children born in Australia or have been educated here and regard themselves as Australians, yet we have this minister saying that they are, in effect, deceiving us. The deception is on the part of governments-whether Labor or Liberal, we as governments have deceived them. These people had a valid expectation that they would be treated properly, humanely and fairly by the Australian community, but that responsibility has been abrogated by successive governments. We now find that these people are suffering because of the callousness, the lack of compassion and the lack of feeling of this government, and in particular the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

177,Mr BEVIS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I have lost track of how many times the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has been debated in this chamber and in the Senate. It has been the subject of inquiries by Senate committees and more than a few questions without notice to the ministerusually dorothy dixers-as it was today. With minor adjustments, this is a remnant of the huge bill that was introduced by former Minister Peter Reith as part of his second wave laws and which was the subject of extensive investigation and comment at the time. When there was another of these industrial relations bills before the parliament during our last week of sitting, I commented that it was just like Groundhog Day in the United States. There was a sense of Groundhog Day in this chamber as we went through a debate on a bill that was very much like bills we have debated on a number of other occasions. Here we are again with a Groundhog Day sensation, debating a bill that the parliament has clearly said it does not support but which the government insists on pursuing. The minister is a bit like Punxsutawney Phil, the gopher that comes out on Groundhog Day for the predictions of the weather. Punxsutawney Phil brings out these bills on a regular basis and they get knocked over on a regular basis, but, much like the punching clown that former Prime Minister Paul Keating used to fondly refer to, they keep bobbing back up. I must say that they bob back up with basically the same idea that got them on their backside in the first place. One of the things that surprises me about this minister is that, having been in his job for some years now, I thought he would have developed a few ideas and a few plans of his own. It is clear from the revolving door of bills-basically, Peter Reith's legislationthat the current minister, Mr Abbott, has no real clue, plan or idea about the operation of industrial relations, other than to regurgitate the previously presented material or to play games with the tactics. The problem the government has with all of these things is that they usually present a bill which has-as this one has-some superficial political attraction. The reason they advance those bills is that they hope to get some political benefit from the games that are played, in this chamber and outside, as the issues are debated or presented-usually in an inaccurate way. This government, this minister and the minister before him are not honest brokers. They do not conduct affairs in industrial relations as independent, honest brokers, seeking to put in place a fair and proper system for workers and employers for the good of the nation as a whole. That is not a view held by members of the Labor Party alone. The fact is that this billlike the others doing the circuit, going backwards and forwards between here and the Senate-has been rejected by a majority of the Senate. It would be nice if the Labor Party had a majority in the Senate in its own right. I would be very happy if that were the case, but we all know that it is not. The reason this bill gets rejected is that few people outside the Liberal and National party rooms support any of this. That is why it continually gets defeated. It is being driven by an ideology that is harmful to ordinary Australian workers and also to Australian business. It is not in the national interest, although the government seem to think that it is in their short-term political interest. The fact that the government come to these debates with dirty hands is clearly understood across the Australian communityso much so that it even gets mentioned in publications such as Inside Canberra. Inside Canberra is not a publication that many of our constituents would be familiar with. It is, if you like, a trade publication. People subscribe to it, and it provides in-house news, so to speak, on what is going on around the corridors of the parliament. Just last year, Inside Canberra had an article about the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the way he conducts industrial relations. The article talked about the fact that industrial relations was an issue that ranked low in the minds of the voters but one where Labor had a strong lead over the coalition in public support. It said: There was a time when the minister running industrial relations was supposed to do something about settling dangerous strikes, not exacerbate them. When Harold Holt was Minister for Labor in the Menzies Government and a serious strike broke out or threatened he would immediately get in touch with his good friend, Albert Monk, the ACTU president, to try to facilitate a settlement. Tony Abbott, on the other hand, stands firmly in the employers' corner at all times. And he does. He makes no bones about it. When there is a dispute-and the article goes on to refer to a dispute that was happening at the time in BHP-he refuses to do anything. The article states that Tony Abbott ‘refused to do anything other than say that the strikers are law breakers'. I well recall how, during a dispute at one of the component suppliers in the car industry, the same minister said that the striking workers were guilty of treason. They were in fact taking industrial action, and it was lawful. It was legitimate, legal, industrial action, for which they were publicly berated by this minister, as if they were guilty of treason. He used those words; he said those workers were ‘guilty of treason.' In a debate about industrial relations, you cannot go to the people of Australia and say, ‘Here is a set of new laws that we are putting in place,' when the people know that that is your form. When people know that in every step you have taken in industrial relations as a minister you have tried to take rights from ordinary Australian workers-and to take from the industrial commission the discretion it has to look at cases on merit and decide things freelyyou cannot expect them to embrace your proposals. At every turn, that has been the record of this minister and this government, and this is another one of those proposals. This bill is supposed to be about compulsory ballots for workers intending to take strike action. Unlike some of the other bills that have quite Orwellian titles, this one does roughly reflect what it is about. It is the rhetoric that goes with the bill that does not reflect what is in it. I sat and listened to the debate before the House rose two weeks ago, and I heard a number of people on the other side talk about this terrible problem of strikes and the democratisation we need in the work force to make sure these ballots are held. There are a couple of interesting things that need to be put in the mix. One is that strikes are at a very low level. The government boasts about this fact, and it is a fact: strikes are at very low levels. I cannot understand the rationale for saying, on the one hand, ‘Strikes are at very low levels that we have not seen for 30 or 40 years,' but on the other hand, at the same time, saying, ‘It is absolutely imperative for the operation of our economy that we put in place a legislative requirement that there be a very complex balloting process before anyone can take strike action.' Hang on: you have just told us that there are no strikes happening, so why have we got this bill before the parliament? What is the genuine industry workplace requirement to have this bill here? The answer is that there is none. There is a political agenda and a philosophical agenda, but there is no substance driving that. Industry is not looking for it, companies are not asking for it, the economy does not need it and it is, in fact, oppressive. Before I leave the issue of the decline in strikes, let me point out once again, for the record, that the major shifts in strike activity in Australia did not occur when John Howard became Prime Minister. The two major shifts in the pattern of strikes in Australia occurred during the former Labor government's time in office. During the period from 1983 to 1992, there was a 50 per cent reduction in strikes, from a much higher base. The accord process did produce a level of industrial harmony that was out of step with the level during the decades before it. That was one of the significant achievements, I think, of the former Labor government and its accord with the trade union movement. Members on the other side also talk about the United Kingdom. They say: ‘Labor Party members do not talk about Tony Blair. They should talk about Tony Blair and the British Labour government.' The Liberal Party say that the British Labour Party have introduced these laws and we in the Australian Labor Party are somehow out of step with that. I am sure that is what they are told to say by the minister's brief. I suggest to those on the other side of the chamber, before they hop up and say that again, that they ask the minister's office to provide them with the details of the operation of the UK law and then compare those with the proposals that the Liberal Party in Australia have advanced. There are balloting requirements in the United Kingdom, but they are significantly different to the balloting requirements here in this bill. The government is comparing apples with oranges. The only similarity between the two pieces of legislation is that they are both about ballots to do with strikes. This is not the same as the UK legislation, and members of the government should stop making that reference if they want to be honest in the presentation of the argument in this debate. The International Labour Organisation has made some comment about provisions of this kind in legislation, and some of that comment was referred to when this bill-in a previous guise-went before a Senate committee for consideration. I will quote quickly from that Senate report. It refers to a submission provided by the International Centre for Trade Union Rights, which said: It is true that the ILO supervisory bodies have, in the past, taken the view that mandatory pre-strike ballots do not necessarily conflict with the princiassert ple of freedom of association. However they have also maintained that the legal procedures for declaring a strike, such as secret ballots: - should be reasonable; - should not place substantial limitations on the means of action open to trade unions; - should not be so complicated as to make it practically impossible to declare a legal strike; and - are acceptable, and do not involve any violation of the principle of freedom of association, only when they are intended to promote democratic principles within trade union organisations. I put it to you that this bill would fail that test. I am not convinced that this bill would stand up to a challenge before the ILO. The government do not seem too concerned about that. They have other legislation that has been found wanting at the ILO and they just ignore it or, in the case of one piece of legislation, they withdraw from the ILO convention they were contravening. When it comes to actually conforming to the minimum international standards set by the ILO, the Howard government are not too concerned about it. They either ignore the fact that they are in breach of the standards or, as they did on one occasion, they withdraw from the ILO protocol rather than put Australia in line with the provisions in that minimum protocol. Professor Ron MCCallum gave evidence about some of these matters when a very similar bill was before the parliament. I certainly would not in any way misrepresent Professor Ron MCCallum's views, and I readily acknowledge that this bill is a little different to the bill he was making a submission about. Ron MCCallum is one of the most respected industrial relations authorities not only in Australia but in the world. His advice is sought in Europe and in the United States, and he is well recognised around the globe as a very capable person in this field. He said: ... I suspect, from my long experience in labour law, that such a bureaucratic system will drop industrial action down from union executives and union secretaries to wildcat action. I think we will see an increase in short-term wildcat action, and there will be a series of legal decisions seeking to that wildcat action on the shop floor can be sheeted home to trade union officials. He then refers to cases where that has happened overseas. We do have some experience with this sort of legislation in Australia. The former Liberal government in Western Australia had provisions like this in place through the Kierath bill. That was, in my view, the worse industrial law in the country-actually worse than Peter Reith's law, and that is a big call. The Kierath law had a requirement for compulsory balloting before strikes. We should talk to people in Western Australia about how that operated. I notice that there is a government member from Western Australia in the chamber. The truth is that it did not operate. The government, the unions and, for that matter, the employers understood that the legislation was non-functional. It was ignored-that is what happened. It was ignored because everybody in the process knew that, in spite of the political rhetoric that the Liberal government went on with, it just did not work. It made matters worse, so no-one took any notice of it. If that is the sort of approach you want to adopt in legislation in the national parliament, you should at least be honest about it. There is another thing that government members need to be honest about. We already have in our legislation today a provision for secret ballots to be ordered. Anybody who thinks there is a problem with a ballot or with a strike that may be mooted has the opportunity to go along to the industrial commission-the independent umpireput their case and actually have an order issued requiring a secret ballot to be held. Do you know how many applications have been made for that? Hardly any. Unfortunately, the most recent figures I have are a couple of years out of date, but I doubt very much whether there has been any change over the last couple of years. Over a four-year period, as at the end of the 1990s, there had been a sum total of nine applications. Under the existing Liberal government law, there were nine applications in four years to have a strike ballot conducted. We have a low level of strikes, which prompts the obvious question: why do we need this law at all? We already have in the law of the land today an opportunity for people to get an order requiring a compulsory ballot, which is what this bill seeks to impose, but no-one uses it. If this is such an important issue, why is it that virtually nobody has bothered to seek a compulsory ballot before the strike occurs? Why haven't they done it? Why haven't the employers, who you tell us are concerned about this, ever applied for this in the past? Indeed, why hasn't the government used its leverage through the Employment Advocate or any one of its other mates to seek to have these ballots conducted? This government's law currently has a provision that allows the order to be issued requiring that a secret ballot be held. Again, the answer is the same: there is, in fact, no need for this in the place. There is no driver for this coming from the shop floor, whether it is from the bosses' side of the desk or the workers' side of the desk. This is being driven for the crass political advantage that the Prime Minister and the current minister think they can get out of it. The thread that runs through most of the comments you get from Liberal-National Party speakers on this matter is that they are democratising the workplace. They say that they are stopping workers from being forced into a decision they do not want to take and that this is all about making workplaces fairer and more democratic. Let us put that to the test. Let us democratise the process of industrial relations and give shareholders the same rights. Let us say that, before an employer can lock out a worker-that is, before the employer can withdraw their capital, as distinct from the worker, who withdraws their labour-they actually have to have a vote of the shareholders. It does not happen, and the government does not want it to happen. When this was in a different guise we actually moved an amendment in this place. As the shadow minister, I moved an amendment to do just that. It said that, if you are fair dinkum about this and you want to democratise the process and say that workers have to have a compulsory vote before there is any industrial action, let us do the same with employers. If you want to be fair dinkum about democratising it, do it with both sides of the argument. But this government, the Liberal and National parties who sit opposite, have never been willing to do that-not once. The case is much stronger for shareholder ballots before lockouts. When strikes occur, typically they are fairly short term, although there was for some time under this government a growth in long-term disputes. Typically, strikes last for a couple of days or maybe a week; if one lasts for two weeks, it is a major dispute. How long are lockouts conducted for? Lockouts are conducted for not just days or weeks but months, and this is not in just one or two isolated cases. People have heard me recite a number of examples in the past. At Joy Mining, there was a threeworkmonth lockout. ACI locked out its workers for five months; on Christmas Eve, it shut the gate on them. The daddy of them all, of course, was G&K O'Connor Abattoirs, which locked out its workers for nine months because they would not take a pay cut. There was not one word of criticism from any member of the Liberal Party when those workers were being denied the opportunity to work for nine months. If you want to be fair dinkum about having a democratic process, get up and say you support the requirement that shareholders have a vote before companies lock out their workers. Then I might start to take some of you seriously. This government and this minister have been properly pegged by everyone in the Australian community when it comes to the issue of industrial relations. They do not come with clean hands, they are not honest brokers; they are biased, they are vindictive and they are driven by ideology. The Australian people do not expect that and will not tolerate that from a government seeking to administer industrial relationswhich, after all, is what regulates the capacity of most Australians to put bread and butter on the table and a roof over their head.",110
178,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Canning) (8.16 p.m.)It is my pleasure to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This bill has been in this House before. It is back here again because it has not passed through the Senate, which is largely controlled by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in concert. Before I say anything further, I will say that it was interesting to sit here evening and watch the previous speaker, the member for Brisbane, try to recreate history and put his own inflection on the situation. As the opposition spokesman for workplace relations in the previous parliament, he could not cut through, and he is now trying to fight back from the back benches. There was a diatribe of the same old mantra of the Labor Party protecting the unions and having a go at the bosses. It is the old-fashioned class warfare. We know the Labor Party is largely controlled by the unions. Whether there is a 60-40 rule or a 50-50 rule, the majority of people on the other side of this House have a pedigree in the union movement. They must belong to a union to be a member in this place and they depend on the union movement for their preselection. I will go into that further later on. The fundamental principle of democracy in the world hinges on the secret ballot. It is only totalitarian and authoritarian regimes that hate secret ballots. I repeat: it is only totalitarian and authoritarian regimes that hate secret ballots. They do not like democracy because they want the control in the hands of one or two. This is no different from the union movement in this country, which is supported by its friends in this House, the Australian Labor Party. Why is this legislation back here? It is back here because the purpose of the bill is to provide that industrial action taken by employees will not be protected unless it is approved by secret ballot. It is a fundamental right in a country like Australia. We are not talking about some draconian country that is controlled by one, as in a dictatorship, or by a socialist government. We are talking about one of the great democracies, and the second-oldest democracy in the world, Australia. The secret ballot is pivotal to this democracy. It is clear-cut and understood by everybody that the secret ballot will ensure that those participating in an action have decided upon the action and have not been misled or bullied into it as a result of the union they are forced to belong to. When I say ‘forced to belong to', I do so because we know in this country that the rule of no ticket, no start still this applies. Whenever you try to wipe it out, it goes underground. We have heard in the Cole royal commission, for example, large companies saying that they find ways on their books of paying the union membership of employees who do not wish to belong just to save peace on the industrial site. As I have said in this place before, if the Mafia were running an extortion scam like this, they would be locked up. But the union movement in this country can get away with standover tactics and extortion and have people dragooned into unions and into taking action. I will mention the measures of this bill very briefly to get them on the record, because they have been mentioned by many people in this House. Applications for secret ballots must be made to the commission and can be made only when a bargaining period is in place not more than 30 days before the last occurred nominal expiry date for any relevant certified agreements. What must be included in the application? Applications must include the question to be put or proposed in the ballot, the nature of the proposed action and details of the types of employees. The commission must determine applications within two working days of the applications being made. The application must not be granted unless the commission is satisfied that the applicant has genuinely tried and is still trying to reach agreement with the employer. These provisions are to make sure the ballots are well run, democratically organised and properly controlled. What is required for a ballot to approve action? At least 40 per cent of the relevant employees must vote and more than 50 per cent of the votes must approve the action. That is fair; 50 per cent plus one is the rule of majority in this country, so that is inordinately fair. The action must commence within a 30-day period beginning on the latter of either the date of the declaration of the ballot or the latest nominal expiry date of any existing certified agreements. Who can be the ballot agent? The ballot agent can be the commission, or it may appoint the AEC or another person as the authorised ballot agent. However, the non-AEC person must meet certain criteria before being appointed. Here is a very interesting case. This is how concerned and interested the government is to see properly conducted secret ballots: the Commonwealth will be directly liable to the ballot agent for 80 per cent of reasonable ballot costs, provided that the applicant notifies the industrial registrar of the cost of the ballot and the industrial registrar determines the reasonable ballot cost. So the federal government is saying, ‘We are not only going to help you organise the structure of this process but we will pay 80 per cent of the costs.' That is very fair, especially given the outcomes that may flow. The limits of this bill are that an order for a ballot or result of a ballot may be challenged in a court. In order for the ballot to be challenged, it would generally need to be in contravention of secret ballot provisions that amount to more than just a technical breach or involve fraud or misleading the commission or some irregularity that may have affected the outcome of the ballot. Those are the measures. This bill was introduced here in February 2002 and was rejected by the Senate in 2002. You can understand that the Greens may vote this way because they vote with the Labor Party all the time. But the Democrats, who wish to be negotiators and be relevant to the debate, for some reason have decided to take themselves out of this debate and allow it to become a running sore in the community. They have no will to resolve the matter other than to see it drag on and on, denying the workers of Australia the democracy that they are entitled to. As I have said in this place a number of times, the greatest myth in this country is that the Labor Party stand for the workers of this country. They do not. The Labor Party in this country stand for the elites and the union bosses; they do not stand for the hands-on coalface workers. In fact we know that those sorts of people now vote in droves for the coalition government. I am talking about the sorts of seats where they use their feet to change their votes because of what we offer. The Australian Labor Party will oppose this again on the basis that it is aimed at limiting strikes and eliminating the remaining rights of workers to strike and because it is contrary to ILO standards. The Australian Labor Party will oppose the bill because it is contrary to the existing role of the IRC, because it orders that secret ballots are sufficientand we just heard the member for Brisbane rattling on about that-and because the bill favours employers. All this is class warfare stuff: us and them.",115
179,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,They are 100 years out of date.,116
180,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is it. The dinosaurs on the other side might wonder why they are still sitting over there. The bill removes the intimidation factor felt by many employees who feel pressured into approving industrial action in hands-up vote situations. I began my working life in the Pilbara as a schoolteacher and I had a number of other jobs there, including labouring on the site. A number of times in Wickham it was ‘everybody out the gate'. Mr Stephen Smith-Were you a signedup member?",116
181,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I was a member of the teachers union. In fact, I was a union organiser until my last year of teaching. So I believe in collective bargaining, but I do not believe in it when it becomes rorted, in the hands of one or two, and not democratic. So I have a bit of background in this, and the member for Perth knows that. We know how intimidating the hands-up vote can be. I am aware of many cases, particularly with militant unionists-as Joe Bullock calls himself, as a member of the CFMEU in Perth-who stand over and belt the living tripe out of those blokes who do not vote their way. And they will not employ them on the sites again. The no ticket, no start regime makes sure that these guys, the subcontractors in particular, do not get to come back on the site. It is all about control and the bosses being in charge.",116
182,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,The union bosses.,117
183,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Yes, the union bosses. Continue to help me because we need to identify the ones in the woodpile. In most voting situations people are entitled to, and expect, privacy surrounding that decision. Given time, I will return to an element of the debate that I brought up last time. I spoke on this and that is the Chartist movement, which was basically the genesis of the secret ballot in the world. It is something that the Labor Party should adopt because it is the grassroots of their industrial organisation. It grew out of the heart of industrial Britain.",117
184,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,They will not adopt it.,117
185,Mr RANDALL,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Of course they will not. I will continue with a few elements about the Chartist movement while I am at it. If the Labor Party were serious about their background, they would identify with the Chartist movement which grew in Britain in 1838. The Chartist movement had six demands: universal manhood suffrage-they got to women's suffrage later on; equal electoral districts; votes by secret ballots; annually elected parliaments; payment of members of parliament; and the abolition of property qualification for membership. Chartism was the first movement that was both working class in character-hear this, those over there who pretend to represent them-and national in scope. It grew out of the protest against the social injustices of the new industrial order in Britain in 1838. It was led by a chap called Lovett. They collected three million signatures in Britain and took them to the British parliament, yet the British parliament rejected the idea. You may ask whether that was the end of it. No, they continued to push this issue until 1848. But how about this: the principal leaders of the Chartist movement in Britain-and nearly every other Chartist leader-were arrested and sentenced to short prison terms. In fact, a number of the Chartists were transported to Australia as convicts. Unbelievably, people who fought in Britain for the secret ballot were sent to Australia as convicts because they were fighting for the six democratic changes that I was talking about. What we do know is that all the six points of the Chartist movement, with the exception of annual parliaments, have been secured over time in Britain and in Australia but not in the union movement. Australia became the first country to introduce the secret ballot. For example, Victoria and South Australia were the first states to introduce secrecy of the ballot in 1856. That is the reason it is referred to as the ‘Australian ballot'. This system eventually spread throughout Europe and the rest of the world. In Great Britain, the secret ballot was finally introduced for all parliamentary and municipal elections by the Ballot Act of 1872, 16 years after it had been introduced in Australia. In the United States, the Australian ballot system was put in place for the presidential election of 1884, 28 years after it had been introduced in Australia. I rest my case. The Chartist movement was born out of the industrial movement in Britain-which the Labor Party should identify with. The key element of the Chartist movement is secret ballots, yet because the Labor Party are prisoners of the union movement in this country, they will not agree to the secret ballots because they owe it to their preselection bosses and they are not allowed to do it. This bill does aim to protect jobs through democracy. Those workers affected by taking strike action will have an unfettered say about whether or not they want to take the action. What is wrong with that? The Australian Labor Party are more interested in putting the rights and concerns of those who control them before the rights and concerns of the workers, the ones they purport to protect. The unions tell the Australian Labor Party to just ignore this sort of democracy, that it does not exist in the confines of own internal processes. Not only do Australian Labor Party members not have the chance to have a fair say in the unions; the unions get the first say. Without secret ballots before strike actions, the unions unfairly deny the workers a say. Other governments, such as the UK government, have been encouraged to introduce the secret ballot. Tellingly, overseas Labour governments have had the courage to stand up to the unions and go ahead with these changes. The member for Brisbane said that Tony Blair's courage to introduce secret ballots was somehow flawed because the British secret ballots are not the same as the Australian secret ballots. What a load of baloney. They are secret ballots after all. No matter what mechanism is used, ultimately, if they are regulated by a fair regime and they are conducted in a proper way-like our own ballots when running for seats in parliament-what is so bad about that? It is just a natural right that people should be entitled to. In Australia, of course, we do not have a Tony Blair. We have a Simon Crean as the leader of the Australian Labor Party-and when I say ‘leader', I say it very guardedly. When I read columns such as Glenn Milne's in this morning's Australian and listen to other commentators-and the faxes and the emails are flying-it seems that, in the absence of a strong leader, there are a lot of nervous nellies on the other side who are anxious about where they are going. They are very concerned about the absence of leadership in the Labor Party. George Campbell said before Christmas that Simon Crean had only six months in the job. I think the months are running out. After the New South Wales election, we may very well see. But we want Simon Crean to stay. We think Kim Beazley is good on the back bench, and we want Simon Crean to stay where he is. We think he offers the sort of leadership that the Australian Labor Party are entitled to. As a result, people in the Labor Party are being robbed by the union movement because they do not have a leader who will actually come out and stand for something. Look at all the things that have been knocked back through their sheer opportunism. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister went through them today. Tony Blair amended the secret ballot provisions in the UK in 1998-99. Industrial reform will secure a more productive and more competitive workplace and a more rewarding and fairer workplace for workers. These outcomes will provide a stronger and more efficient economy and more harmonious and fairer workplaces. We know that just the other day Ian Macfarlane, chairman of the Australian Reserve Bank, said that Australia's position and solid performance in the world economy compared to the OECD countries was the result of flexibility in the work force. That is what the leadership of the Howard government has brought to the Australian workers: a far more dynamic and stronger work force because it is more flexible. If you go back to the old rigid dinosaur days under the Hawke-Keating government, it was so regulated and regimented that productivity was strangled. Now that the Labor government in Western Australia has taken the state back more than 10 years in labour laws, we are finding, for example, that young kids cannot get weekend jobs to the same extent because they come up against double time, treble time and all those sorts of things. Employers will not pay that; they cannot afford to pay it. As a result, young people are being denied jobs. There is a genuine desire to see unions be more accountable to their members, and should this happen they might have far greater participation in the organisations, and this bill will address that. Finally, the minister has made the comment that the secret ballots bill is the single most important piece six of legislation to ensure that we do not have strikes in this country without first having secret ballots. If it is good enough for the German socialists and good enough for the British Labour government, it should be good enough for us here, too. (Time expired)",117
186,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise this evening to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2000. I do so because I think there needs to be some effort by this parliament to examine the provisions of the bill and to discuss more fully-and, perhaps, more precisely-the manner and form of the bill, and the way it would apply if it were enacted and, therefore, used compulsorily in the workplaces of Australia. To date, the contribution by those on the other side debating on this bill has been woeful, in that there has been very little effort to discuss the machinations or practicalities of the provisions. That is important. If one is to look at the effectiveness or erwise of a bill, one has to look at the proviThat sions. Labor considers this bill impractical best and, at worse, a further assault on one side of the industrial playing field; namely, Australian workers. The government has sought to impose an elaborate and unwieldy mechanism upon employees who may consider taking lawful industrial action. Although this misguided attempt to stymie workers' rights in this country, under the guise of the high-principled notion of secret ballots, is intended to minimise industrial action in the workplace, I fear-given the manner and form of the bill and the added formality of the proposed process-that it will cause the opposite effect. Furthermore, this increased bureaucratic load will undoubtedly impose a greater burden upon the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, thereby diverting its attention from preventing and settling disputes, which is its primary function and has been since its introduction in 1904-almost at the time of Federation. Equally important is that the Industrial Relations Commission focus upon the important principle of ensuring productivity and flexibility in the workplace-a principle that is based on a balanced approach and does not target one party to a dispute more than another. We have already heard from the member for Brisbane and others that, if this particular provision is so noble, the question begged is: why, then, does it not apply to all? We will leave the manner and form aside for a moment. Why is it that to withdraw one's labour one is asked to go through an arduous and convoluted-and, one would say, deliberately lengthy-process to establish a determination on whether people wish to take lawful action? Why is it that that occurs when labour is being considered but, with respect to lockouts, there is no provision for shareholders to exercise their democratic rights and have a secret ballot? I suppose the difficulty for us in immediately accepting the noble intentions of the government in this area is that there is no effort to show any balance or to suggest to the parliament-or, indeed, to the community at large-that this government wants to apply equitable laws that are consistent to oth- employees and employers in the workplace. underlines the nature of this governat ment: in the end, when it comes to applying law, it has one law and one form of regulation for Australian working people, and another law for employers, corporate directors and executive officers of companies. Already this year we have seen that on a number of occasions. We saw that with their failure to accept amendments by Labor on regulating corporate bonuses. We saw that today when they argued that secret ballots are a principled approach to industrial relations but should only apply to employees and not to the employers-that is, the shareholders of companies-who will be affected by industrial decisions made by their boards or executive officers. So there are some real problems about accepting the genuineness of the government with respect to this area. There is a real difficulty because they have, yet again, clearly illustrated their incapacity to be fair and to show that they have an even-handed approach to industrial relations. The arduous process outlined in the bill is as follows, as I understand it. In order for an employee, a group of employees, a union or agents on their behalf to consider legal industrial action, they must apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for an order for a secret ballot to be conducted. I should add that-despite the government's rhetoric about individual choice without the presence of a union-in the case of an enterprise of fewer than 80 employees, no fewer than four employees are required to support the order. At least five per cent of the total work force is required for enterprises employing between 80 and 5,000 workers, and, for enterprises over 5,000, the requirement is for no fewer than 250 employees to support an order of this kind. As I said earlier, the manner and form of this provision seem to be unclear. It suffices to say that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be distracted from its primary role, and no doubt the civil courts will be crowded with parties looking to judicially determine the extraordinary number of ambiguous and deficient provisions of this legislation. After reading the minister's comments with respect to this bill and listening to some members opposite, you would be forgiven for thinking that this country is beset by widespread, wildcat, protracted industrial action. The minister would like people to believe that we are experiencing industrial warfare in workplaces across the nation. The reality is that that is not the case. If you lieved the rhetoric of the minister, you would conclude that industrial unrest is commonplace. But, as I said, that is not the case. The empirical evidence points to a consistent and gradual decline in strikes since the election of the first Hawke government 20 years ago this week-on Wednesday, in fact. Any dispassionate analysis of this phenomenon would recognise, firstly, that the prices and incomes accord was a major contributor to the fact that fewer Australians' working days were lost as a result of industrial action. My view with respect to the prices and incomes accord is that it was an imperfect compact. The accord, however, did impose a discipline upon industrial parties and helped redress some of the fundamental inequities in workplaces of this country. Unfortunatelyand I think it should be noted so as not to be forgotten-the inability to regulate prices left the burden to bring about industrial harmony and the consequent economic gain almost entirely upon Australian workers and their representatives: the unions. That is the reality. If anyone were to observe the economic realities of the 1980s, one would suggest that the responsible parties to bringing about those efficiencies were primarily employees and their unions. It is timely to contrast the behaviour of Australian workers in the 1980s with the elements of the business community in that period. It is fair to say that a large proportion of those so-called businesspeople were aptly named ‘corporate cowboys'. At a time when employees and unions acted in the national interest, I would argue that many businesspeople at that time were motivated purely by greed and self-interest. We had only to look behind the bars of some of our jails in this country over a period of time to see some of the corporate identities eventually coming unstuck and being brought to justice as a result of their irresponsibility and their greed. Whilst we had this image of some of these high-flyers-these people who acted improperly, corruptly on occasions, and unlawfully-I think it is fair to say in the broad sense that we had a union movement and an Australian work force that acted in a mature, responsible manner and looked towards the be- needs of the economy and the broader issues that could offer long-term benefits to the community and the workers of this country. The employees and the unions exhibited that form of behaviour, even at a time when many of the corporate cowboys, so called, were failing in their duty and their obligations to this country. Notwithstanding that, since 1996 this government has attempted to turn history on its head. The fact is that this government has always failed to recognise the positive contributions made by Australian working people. Such a compact did not always benefit certain sectors of the workplace that could have struck greater benefits for themselves and could have sought to ensure that they were in receipt of far greater economic return because of their industrial strength. However, they chose to protect the community at large. This government has never accepted or acknowledged that these contributions were made, and they were made at a time of important structural change in this country. The government has failed in any way to acknowledge the fact that there were leaders in the workplaces at all levels who saw the need to change this country and to produce the benefits, notwithstanding in many instances the failure by their own employers. It is fair to say that there were employers who came on board and assisted in that process, but there were many who did not. There were also many union leaders, and many Australian workers generally, involved in that process, but they have never been recognised by this government. It is fair to say that, since 1996, this government has sought to use instruments of the state-whether it be bringing attack dogs and masks to workplaces or establishing politically driven royal commissions-to undermine and weaken the rights of employees and their representatives: the trade unions. The fact remains that this continues today. It is very important that we stop to make some comment about the witch-hunt into the building industry that has been commissioned by the government. One would find more credibility in a commission-even if the results were mixed as to where the breaches of law were coming from-if there were some focus on occupational health and safety matters, if some efforts were made to look at underpayments of employees' entitlements in the industry or if health and safety matters generally were also being redressed in this area, given the fatality rate the building industry. I will not for a moment stand here and suggest that the building industry is in any way squeaky clean-it is not. Bribes might be offered by more than one person, and, as the CFMEU has said time and time again, if those things occur, they should be brought to the attention of the proper authorities. The fact remains that there are employers and, quite possibly, employees doing the wrong thing in every industry, but this commission's scope has been narrowed to focus purely upon the work force and their representatives rather than on issues like health and safety or fatalities in the building industry. Its scope is purely to look at the behaviour of certain individuals and not at others. There is no effort to look other behaviour. This commission will ultimately fail in its outcome because an objective person will realise that there is no effort to be impartial or to act for the betterment of the industry as opposed to directing its enmity and its energies towards adversely affecting working people and their representatives. That is the failure of this commission, and this bill is another example of this government focusing purely on working people and their representatives. The government is not focusing on shareholders and the need for them to possibly conduct a secret ballot to lock out people, nor looking at those rights and entitlements of employees and their unions. That is a failure of this government and it exposes the government's bias, as indeed the way the royal commission has been set up has exposed its bias. The government is focusing all its energies on the building unions by setting up the royal commission and focusing all its energies upon other areas such as employee entitlements, but what is it doing to assist shareholders to save their own capital from greedy directors? Again, we have seen a spate of executives-many of them failed executives-receiving obscene sums of money when leaving the company. After Southcorp announced its profit had fallen by 97 per cent, it dismissed its then CEO, Mr Keith Lambert, and he received $4.4 million. Of course, that payout followed the national in outrage when a payment of $33 million was made to Mr Cuffe, the former chief of Colonial First State funds management business. And let us not forget BHP Billiton's former boss, Brian Gilbertson, and AMP's Paul Batchelor, who are also going to receive millions of dollars. I think that it would be a hard case to argue that, in all the circumstances, those people have done a great thing for their companies. Even if they had, I do not think they could ever argue for or justify the amount of money they will receive. Clearly, we have a government that fails to regulate the conduct of greedy corporate directors. Indeed, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in question time today at said there was no need to regulate bonuses for corporate directors. I think that shows that, when it comes to regulating the behaviour of greedy directors, this government goes missing. It is not even there to assist in the regulation of such conduct, but it will go through hoop after hoop in order to make the bargaining negotiations for Australian working people as hard as possible. It will go to every length in order to impose its ideological view upon the Australian work force. The fact is that this bill is flawed because it is biased. Its process is deliberately lengthy so as not to provide an effective process. I think it is also important to note that there are already sections of the act enabling a secret ballot to be conducted. Section 135 allows the commission to order the conducting of a ballot if it seeks to discover the attitudes of employees whose employment will be subject to a proposed agreement, if it helps to prevent an industrial dispute. That provision has been in existence in some form or another for 70-odd years. It is there for employers to take advantage of if they wish to. To take one example, in 1996 there were 4½ thousand applications for a bargaining period, and only two orders were made for secret ballots. In 2001, there were 6,600 applications for a bargaining period, and only one order was made for a secret ballot. The fact remains that this bill is all about imposing an ideology upon the workplace. Again, it exposes the unfairness and bias of this government towards Australian working people. (Time expired)",118
187,Mr SECKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise tonight in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Employers and employees have clearly embraced workplace bargaining in the past decade-which is something that clearly has escaped members opposite. More than 41,000 collective agreements have been formalised under the federal system alone, with thousands more under state bargaining systems. Over 1.3 million employees are covered by current federal wage agreements, including those who are on one of the 220,000 individual arrangements made since 1997. The very purpose of this amendment is to make the process fair and just when determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action, without their facing the consequences or standover tactics from their union representatives. It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is upheld-which should make those members opposite happy-free from consequences of an individual's right to action, and without the repercussions of a militant union that may be out to cause havoc and not resolve the issues at hand. This amendment is about making sure that individuals are free from any type of intimidation and how they can best be served, in many cases, by their own employer. At the end of the day, employees still have the freedom to strike if they are not satisfied. Minister Abbott in his second reading speech on the current bill reflected on his proposals to amend the current secret ballot provisions and stated: A secret ballot is a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action. It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned. At present, certain sections of the Workplace Relations Act deal separately with secret ballots for industrial action, and notices to initiate bargaining may involve industrial action. In the case of secret ballots, there are also separate ballot provisions dealing with the election of officials of registered organisations for unions and employers. Ballots are also used for voting on amalgamations of registered organisations and for approving certified agreements. Having said this, this bill will benefit many ordinary working Australians. This bill, along with the other bills-the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, will assist the government's commitment that was made in 2001: choice and reward in a changing workplace. This bill proposes that employees and organisations of employees who take industrial action have protected action under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. (Time expired) NA",122
188,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Australian Greens",122
189,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to discuss the issue of principle in politics. In the inner west in Sydney the Greens are portraying themselves as the sole occupiers of the moral high ground. There is no doubt that Bob Brown is a political activist who has earned respect. In New South Wales, Ian Cohen has come into parliament after an active participation in the environmental movement. But what about the New South Wales Greens and their candidates in the upcoming election? In the last federal election, the Friends of Callan Park distributed a survey to all candidates. I had stated very clearly my opposition to the sale of any public land. This was consistent with my political position and I clearly indicated that. Despite this, they showed their antiLabor agenda by producing a full colour pamphlet advocating a vote for all political parties, including One Nation, ahead of Labor. They were the only group in my multicultural electorate that did not seem to understand the imperative to put One Nation last. But it should not come as a surprise. The Greens candidate for Port Jackson is Jamie Parker. He gained some prominence in today's Daily Telegraph as a publicist for the extreme fighting event held at the Masonic Centre in Sydney last September. This is when two competitors are placed in an octagonal cage and allowed to cause as much physical damage to each other as possible. Due to the danger of such events, it had no permit. There was no medical doctor present, but it did have Jamie Parker-so much for the great advocates of peace and antivio Leichhardt Council. It is not just in areas of violence that the hypocrisy shines like a beacon. When it comes to selling off public land, they are right into it.

190,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"When not organising  land. The Greens need to be made accountable. Many of their policies are just plain loopy, particularly in economic areas. They advocate their tax and revenue policy section 2.3.5, which is a capital gains tax on five per cent of family homes in any region. As if there is not a disparity in housing prices from the top five per cent in Brewarrina to the top five per cent in Rose Bay, they draw no distinction in their policy. Secondly, under their housing policy 3.3.11 they propose a tax on renovations and excessive and unjustified housing unit sizes. Some of their branch members in my area should have a good look at that, given their propensity for renovations. Believe it or not, Parker may not be the Greens' most unprincipled candidate. I think that goes to Sylvia Hale, No. 2 on the upper house ticket. She ran in September 1999 as the No Aircraft Noise Party candidate for Marrickville Council. She had previously been the No Aircraft Noise candidate in the federal election for the seat of Grayndler in 1998. Her main opponent when she ran in that 1999 election was, of course, the Greens. So they were competing, essentially, for the same vote. What occurred after that, though, was that Sylvia Hale, about a year later, resigned from the No Aircraft Noise Party and suddenly became a Greens councillor. She did not resign her position and put that change before the public-that was too principled for her; she could not do that. But we had a look back and thought, ‘How long has this Greens connection been going?' What we found on the public record was that she was the single major donor to the Greens campaign in that same Marrickville Council election-she donated $5,000, just pocket money for this bourgeois aristocrat. So on the one hand she is running for the No Aircraft Noise Party, but, on the other hand, she is funding her opposition. The Greens have taken it to the logical next step. Not just are they privatising public assets on Leichhardt Council, they have privatised their position on the legislative council ticket. She has gone from being a No Aircraft Noise Party councillor to buying her spot on the ticket. I call upon Bob Brown to intervene and remove her from the ticket. Nominations have not closed yet. When you actually examine the record of these people, you find that they simply do not measure up. The people of New South Wales need to have a very close look at the sorts of people who are standing under the Greens banner, the sorts of people who have been members of many political parties, and they need to reject this opportunism. (Time expired) Health: Pneumococcal Disease  draw the House's attention tonight to a disease that has become one of Australia's most pressing health concerns. Pneumococcal disease affects a broad spectrum of Australian groups, with infection common amongst people over 65, but particularly infants and other children. The communicable diseases centre explains that there are two identifiable strains of the disease: invasive pneumococcal disease, IPD, and non-invasive disease. IPD may manifest itself through infections of the brain and spinal chord-that is, meningitis; infection of the lining of the bloodstreamsepticaemia; and also through bacteremic pneumonia-lung infection. Non-invasive disease, on the other hand, includes less severe non-bacteremic pneumonia and middle ear infections, extremely common in children. Sadly, the statistics do not lie with regard to the seriousness of pneumococcal disease. Studies by Wyeth Australia, the Centre for Disease Control in the Northern Territory, the National Centre for Disease Control and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia have proven the seriousness of the situation. Eleven per cent of children reported to have pneumococcal meningitis will die-compared to Haemophilus influenzae, which, before immunisation, recorded a death rate of less than three per cent. Half all children who contract pneumococcal meningitis will be left permanently disabled. One per cent of all Australian children will suffer pneumococcal pneumonia annually. Half of this number will be hospitalised, representing 30 per cent of all pneumonias. All children under five years will experience middle ear infections at least once a year, with 20 to 30 per cent of these attributed to pneumococcal infections. Previously, before the introduction of pneumococcal vaccinations amongst Indigenous children in Central Australia, Aboriginal infants under the age of two had the highest risk rate of pneumococcal disease in the world-15 times higher than the risk in non-Indigenous children. The antibiotic currently used in the treatment of pneumococcal infection is becoming increasingly resistant to the disease, and penicillin resistance is now above 30 per cent and continuing to rise. These figures are a harsh portrayal of a serious threat to the well-being of the nation, particularly with respect to our young people. However, as I will point out, the disease is easily and responsibly preventable using methods that already exist within the standard immunisation schedule for children and infants. Whilst there are over 90 strains of pneumococcus, it is surprising that seven of these strains are responsible for 80 per cent of serious infection. With the current access to the low cost vaccine, Prevenar, 97 per cent efficacy against the strains that cause 80 to 90 per cent of the problem is provided. Thus there can be no contention over the usefulness of such a vaccine. Proven benefits of the vaccine according to Wyeth include: the prevention of 80 to 90 per cent of the estimated 750 cases of serious pneumococcal disease, which otherwise may result in disability or death; the prevention of more than 2,000 hospitalisations due to pneumococcal pneumonia in children under five; the annual prevention of over 3,500 grommet insertions; reducing the reliance on antibiotics and penicillin, which have recently proved inefficient in treating the disease; and reducing the likelihood of the bacteria being passed from sibling to sibling. With the benefits I have just outlined, it of would be hard to ignore a request for pneumococcal injections to be included in the Australian standard vaccination schedule. Programs already exist for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to receive free Prevenar vaccinations funded by the federal government. Other special groups to receive immunisation include non-Aboriginal children in Central Australia, as well as children suffering immunodeficiency. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation considers the benefits to the community to be significant. I feel strongly that, if we have the grounds with which to prevent serious disability and death that may affect any child, then it is our duty to see that that happens. Howard Government",123
191,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"This week recognises the seventh anniversary of the Howard-Costello government. The event should be marked by their greatest achievement, and that, of course, is that they are the highest taxing government in Australia's history. They have had a pretty soft ride in the last seven years, courtesy of a compliant media, an indulged business community and an inherited economic dynamic which was made more effective by a Reserve Bank governor, Ian Macfarlane, who actually knew what he was doing and reduced interest rates when his predecessor failed. Nevertheless, when analysis is applied to the achievements of this government, it is a very narrow list. For me, three things stand out: the response to the Port Arthur tragedy, the response to the East Timor situation and the nation building task of the Alice SpringsDarwin railway. They were all very positive and decisive. But then you start to look very empty indeed. In fact, the economic dynamic of which the Treasurer and Prime Minister bragged in question time today has gone a little bit missing. Remember the foreign debt truck, when we had a foreign debt of $180 billion? It is now $360 billion. I notice that the media frenzy that surrounded the Liberal Party announcement at that time, prior to the 1996 election, has suddenly gone missing. If you look at the current account deficit, noone particularly wants to comment about that. There is a little bit of a plus in terms how you define net debt. I wonder how ordinary people in the electorates see the lack of achievement of the Howard government. We all visit capital cities. I am not having a go at Sydney-this could happen in my own town-but I could not help but be quite shocked to see the begging going on in the streets of Sydney by young women, young men, women and children, old men, old women, some of them obviously professional beggars but some of them not. You see them in all our capital cities and all our big regional centres. You sometimes think that the transfer of public never money from public health to private health might have just changed that. That $2.5 billion a year that has gone to the health insurance rebate maybe could have been targeted in a much better way. I watched in alarm some of the pensioners in my electorate, whose only income is their pension, who live in big houses on their own-their rates per year are sometimes $1,500, even with their concessions-and who pay for private health insurance when they obviously do not need it and cannot afford it. I look at the couple who came to me separately, whose marriage broke up because they sent their kids, when they could not afford it, to a private school because they believed the government propaganda that the public school system was failing their children. Because they were having particular difficulties with their children at school and at home, they both went out to work-unfortunately, they both earn minimal incomes-and they put their children into the private education system. They are no longer married, their kids are fostered out-the whole thing collapsed. People look at the functional parts of what happens when you transfer money from a public system to a private system. For some people, it does not have any impact at all. For a lot of people in this country-like myself-having a rebate for health insurance does not matter one way or another. It is another $500 or $600 in my pocket each year, but I do not actually need it. But for people on modest incomes, that is a significant amount of money. For single pensioners, that of is a very significant amount of money. People sending their kids to private education in the false belief that it will solve their child problems, when it definitively will not and when it will cause them financial trouble, is ridiculous. Have a look at the mushrooming credit card debt, where people in this country are in way over their heads. The real interest rates for most people in this country are not 4.8 per cent; they are 16 to 24 per cent, because that is what they are paying. The real inflation rate for many Australians who are working is not under three per cent; it is around 10 and 15 per cent. The unemployment rate is not about 6.1 per cent; there are two million Australians who are negatively affected by unemployment because they cannot get full-time jobs. Those who want full-time jobs can only get part-time jobs. Those who want high skilled jobs, even those with degrees, are working in low paid, low skilled jobs in retail and hospitality. Two million Australians are underemployed, or not employed and not counted in the figures. That is not some achievement of the Liberal government. (Time expired) Social Capital",125
192,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"The Sydney Morning Herald recently ran a feature series on what it described as the ‘echo boom' or the ‘X generation'. One of its writers commented that generation X-those reaching or in their 30s-is: ... the most materialistic, selfish and apolitical generation the modern world has ever seen ... From my experience, the columnist was overstating the reality. Nonetheless he did point to a social trend which has deep implications for Australian society, and, to the extent that it is a global phenomenon, for western communities generally. Many members of this place will be familiar with the discourse that is occurring around the world about what is termed ‘social capital' and its decline but also its fundamental importance to our society. According to perhaps its most influential advocate, Robert Putnam, social capital refers to: ... features of social organisation such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate dination and cooperation for mutual benefit. It is considered to encompass many aspects of our society, which an ABS paper listed as including social networks, empowerment and community participation, civic and political involvement, trust in people and social institutions, tolerance and diversity, and altruism and philanthropy-in short, those things that bring us together as a society and a community. Social capital has become popular as more and more people have realised that the often intangible concepts that it seeks to encompass are really a vital part in human development, both economic and social. It has also become accepted that in many nations social capital is on the decline as people become more insular, less involved in their communities and less likely to establish networks of contacts and friends that extend across their neighbourhoods and workplaces. There are many examples in Australia of how this trend has manifested itself-perhaps most poignantly for those of us in this place is the decline in membership of and involvement in political parties that has been generally witnessed over the last two decades. But more broadly we also see this trend in participation in voluntary organisations at the community level. Promoting social capital and, hence, ensuring that people do have the opportunity to help themselves and to become part of networks within their communities is important and an aim that I believe governments should promote. It is, however, a major challenge in both establishing why social capital-the very sense of community-is on the decline and what public policy makers can actually do. Governments can build community centres but bricks and mortar do not actually make a community. How do we, in fact, alter the psyche of individuals and whole generations that have become isolated from their communities, be it as a result of social and economic disadvantage or as part of the type of generational trend that the Sydney Morning Herald commented on? And, just as importantly, how do we ensure that in promoting that sense of community we create forces coorwithin our society that are positive? I say that because social capital is not always intrinsically good. As a Liberal, social capital to me must be about helping individuals, not stifling their creativity or creating the types of societal norms that we associate with the 1950s and that resulted in discrimination or intolerance. We must also ensure that in promoting strong communities we do not create a divided society based on such groupings. The Howard government and the Liberal Party have, in so many areas, been working to develop positive social capital. Mutual obligation and our support for communities are obvious examples, as is the Prime Minister's personal drive to promote volunteerism and corporate philanthropy. Those efforts are undoubtedly being strengthened by the work of those advancing our knowledge in this area. The World Bank is one international leader, while the Australian Bureau of Statistics is conducting valuable research which will improve our capacity to measure social capital within our borders. Our record contrasts with that of the Labor Party. While some have sought to use the rhetoric of social capital, I am yet to see proposals from the opposition that demonstrate they have learnt that their traditional support for highly interventionist government programs is not the answer. In the past, such an approach has weakened social capital to the extent that it has dampened community initiative and built an unhealthy dependency on government in areas that it has been ill equipped to deal with on its own. In this respect, the comments of Noel Pearson during the last 12 months have been timely in drawing our attention to how government has often harmed the community fabric and initiative of Indigenous communities, rather than assisting those communities to reach into themselves for solutions. This government will continue to support stronger communities that are more self reliant and effective. The work being done here and overseas will inevitably enhance our capacity to build social capital, particularly in more marginalised areas of our nation-be they in Indigenous communities, in the neglected fringes of our cities or in struggling regional areas. It is imperative that we do so to help build the networks within and between communities that will benefit both individuals and the strength of Australian society. Reid Electorate: Indigenous Affairs",126
193,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Some years ago the Auburn Council in my municipality gained a degree of notoriety when it became Sydney's last municipality to raise the Aboriginal flag during NAIDOC week. In the period since then it has made major advances in regard to reconciliation and in facing the realities of being one of Sydney's greatest concentrations of non-English-speaking background people. Tonight I want to speak about the more positive and sustained efforts by another municipality in my electorate-that is, Holroyd-in regard to recognising Australia's original Indigenous people. Recently the council produced the CD Darug: the people that live between the mountains and the sea. I want to put on the record my congratulations to the entire council, regardless of political affiliations. I congratulate the former mayors Mark Pigram and Peter Herlinger for their work on this, but I especially congratulate the current mayor, Mal Tulloch. He really has a passion for recognising the Aboriginal people and making sure they have centrality in the public events of Holroyd municipality, and he has driven very strongly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Consultative Committee, which was established back in 1997. This CD stems from a 1999 grant from the Western Sydney Area Assistance Scheme to provide an educational resource about the effects of white settlement on local Indigenous people. Its culmination was the launch of the CD last month. The CD-ROM has had the assistance of the University of Western Sydney's Linkwest Ltd and the continuing hard work of the consultative committee of the council. Also, Lucy Maguire, a council officer, has been at the helm throughout the whole project. The CD aims to interrelate and to connect with Aboriginal studies in the New South Wales educational system. It will be provided to libraries and to the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councilswhich, I should say, is an area that represents more people than the state of South Australia, so that gives you some indication of the dimensions of this project. Also, it will go to the group called Reconciliation for Western Sydney and to local schools. The CD clearly relates to Aboriginal studies in schools, and more particularly to localised events in the history of white settlement. Amongst those events, of course, is the resistance of Aborigines led by Pemulwuy, who fought heroic battles against the encroachment of whites into the Western Sydney region. The CD also covers the local clans of the 1790s, the vestiges of which survived into the 1840s in some cases; Watkin Tench's visit to the Prospect settlers in 1791; the Aboriginal Blanket Returns up to the 1840s, which show the nature of continuing Aboriginal settlement; and an account of some of the early white settlers. Finally, the CD also covers the 1805 meeting-which many people outside the region would not be aware of-which was a reconciliation meeting between blacks and whites that occurred in the Prospect region. This is a very historical CD. From recollection, even when you do not take all the alternatives from the main theme it still goes for two hours. This was produced by a council. It was not produced by the National Library, the state government, ATSIC or any other body-it was produced by the Holroyd Council. I want to mention Michael Flynn, the historian who provided much of the material. I am pleased to say that I recently found his unpublished thesis of many years ago and directed it to the attention of the Granville Historical Society. The society will publish his work on Western Sydney Aborigines, which will be another book in a very proud record of publications. Finally, I will briefly mention council of Parramatta, which is also making a massive effort towards Aboriginal recognition. The council conducted last year's Aboriginal film festival. It has a consultation committee and its recent work on the Parramatta River included many Aboriginal motifs in the surrounding vegetation and artworks. Multicultural Affairs: Citizenship",127
194,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the great privileges of being a member of the Australian parliament is the opportunity that it provides to meet a variety of people. Never in my wildest imagination did I believe that coming to this great democratic chamber would give me the opportunity to meet so many people from so many walks of life and from so many different backgrounds-indeed, from all parts of the world. Tonight I want to speak in this chamber on one of the opportunities that was afforded to me as the federal member for Ryan. On Australia Day I had the great privilege to be the presiding officer at a citizenship ceremony and confer citizenship upon our newest citizens. I had the privilege at the Jindalee Boat Ramp in the electorate of Ryan to confer citizenship on some 58 residents, who of course then became citizens of our nation. I want to comment briefly on citizenship. Citizenship is a very unifying force that binds our multicultural nation together. Becoming an Australian is a very important decision. I took particular pride in being involved in the ceremony, because I am a migrant to this country, my mother is a migrant to this country and my father is a migrant to this country-indeed, my wife is a migrant to this country. I am one of the members in this House who like to think they understand our multicultural nation and the themes of participation and inclusion, of harmony and of promoting tolerance in this great country. As we all know, Australia Day is a very important opportunity, particularly for those who become new Australians, to think about those themes, about what it means to be an Australian and about what contribution we can make to this country. It is also an important time for people to reflect on where they came from: their background, heritage, the adjacent culture and language. As I said, on Australia Day this year I had the privilege of conferring citizenship. With me at the ceremony were a couple of organisations that I want to pay tribute to tonight: the Centenary Chamber of Commerce and the local Rotary Club of Sumner Park. The support and involvement of those organisations in the community of the centenary suburbs in the Ryan electorate is tremendous. It was a great pleasure for me that they participated in the citizenship ceremony. Also at the ceremony were Mr Keith Hamilton, the immediate past President of the Centenary and Districts Chamber of Commerce; Mr Ron MCElwaine, President of the SherwoodIndooroopilly RSL sub-branch; Mr Jeff Seymour, Secretary of the SherwoodIndooroopilly RSL sub-branch; Pamela  Ho, President of 4EB; Mrs Manju Jehu, Vice President of the Federation of Ethnic Councillors and a broadcaster on 4EB; and Ms Rita O'Hanlon, President of the Brookfield Recreation Trust. I mentioned those names because it is important to acknowledge leading community figures who lend their voice and their weight to important occasions such as a citizenship ceremony. Those distinguished individuals from the Ryan electorate were very generous with their time and their contributions in meeting many of the new residents of Ryan who became citizens of our great country. I also want to pay tribute to Mr Les Hannaway, who recently became the President of the Centenary and Districts Chamber of Commerce and had the role of chairman at the ceremony. I also pay tribute to Robyn Nixon, the President of the Rotary Club of Sumner Park, and to Dr Gordon Young. Their enthusiasm was tremendous and their contribution to the event was terrific. I also want to comment on the young Australian who sang the Australian anthem so beautifully at the ceremony. Dianne Belschner is a local performer. For those who were present, it was hard to imagine that she is only 16 years of age. She has a big future indeed. Dianne is another young migrant to this country from the Philippines. It is my great privilege to be in this parliament as a migrant. I love this country and it is a great privilege to be the federal member for Ryan and to represent all the people of Ryan, particularly those new Australians. There are many new Australians coming on board as citizens of this country, and I want to pay tribute to their lives and to the contribution that they will make to enhancing this great country's future.",128
