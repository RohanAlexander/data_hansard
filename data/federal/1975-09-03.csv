Killen.D.J. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Mr MACKellar- I rise on a point of order, Mr 56 Speaker. I draw your attention to standing orders 52 197 and 202. Prior to this vote the honourable member for Chifley was in the chair. He called 4 the vote. He appointed the tellers and then you took the chair and the honourable member for Chifley took a place on the front bench and Adermann, A. E. Anthony, J. D. voted. I raise the point of order that both those actions were contrary,firstly,to standing order 197 and, secondly, to standing order 202. Standing order 197 states: No Member shall be entitled to vote in any division unless, when the tellers are appointed, he is within the seats to Members. Standing order 202 states: On the tellers being appointed, every Member within the seats allotted to Members shall vote and no Member may move from his place until the result of the division is announced. The honourable member for Chifley clearly moved from the Speaker's chair over to the front bench on the Government side.",73
2,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,I think the honourable member is being hypertechnical. I was standing on the wing of the chair when the tellers were appointed. The only reason why he walked around the back of the seats is that it is not normal to walk through the centre of the chamber. When the tellers were appointed I was standing on the chair and I had asked the honourable member for Chifley to leave the chair. (Opposition members interjecting.),74
3,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,I should like to address the House if honourable members would remain silent. Mr Bonald Cameron-It might be a technical point but,74
4,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"If the honourable member for Griffith does not remain silent he will not be here to hear. The honourable member for Chifley inadvertently continued to name the tellers, who were not necessarily the conect tellers. He could not remain in the chair while I was in the chair; that is quite obvious. I took the chair, which I have to do if I am in the chamber. I suggest to honourable members that they are being extremely technical. The honourable member for Chifley could not remain in the chair while I was in the chair and I cannot take a seat in the chamber while a division is being determined because of a constitutional requirement which I think overrides even the Standing Orders. If honourable members opposite wish to take the objection that the honourable member for Chifley should have stood in the middle of the chamber somewhere, because he could not remain in the chair, they may take that objection. It is a matter of a technicality. The result of the vote would not have been affected if that were the case. But if honourable members wish to take that technical point I would uphold the point of order that the honourable member for Chifley was not entided to vote. Mr MACKellar-If I may speak to that ruling, Mr Speaker, you said that this occurred because of inadvertence. Many things occur in this House through inadvertence. I do not think it is a good precedent to set in a case like this. When the allotted honourable member for Chifley was appointing the tellers you were walking through and I believe you were technically not in the chamber.",74
5,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"That is not a matter of fact. When the honourable member for Chifley appointed the tellers I was standing on the wing of the chair. If the honourable gendeman wishes to take points of order which are not based on matters of fact I will not listen to them. Mr MACKellar-The technical point I wish to pursue is that the honourable member for Chifley should not have taken part in the count which was subsequently taken. Mr Daly-Speakin g to the point of order, Mr Speaker, to prevent a controversy of this kind would it not be better if you did what the former Liberal Speaker, Sir John MCLeay, did, and voted in divisions?",74
6,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,That is not possible. The Speaker is not allowed to vote in divisions. The Constituuon bars that. That is the reason why I took the chair.,74
7,Mr WENTWORTH,AYES NOES,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, I am very sorry but I have not been able to hear from this seat what your ruling is. Have you upheld the point of order?",74
8,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"I said that if honourable members insisted I would uphold the point of order and the honourable member for Chifley would not be recorded as vodng in the division. But I would ask that it be recorded that the fact that the honourable member for Chifley did not vote was not his fault. Mr Armitage- Mr Speaker, I wish to make the point that at the time the tellers were being appointed you came to the wing of the chair and in accordance with the normal practice you, being in the House, took the chair. I do not know whether honourable members opposite then expected me to leave the House. I would not have been acting in accordance with the Standing Orders if I had then left the House. I had to remain in the House.",74
9,Mr SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"I am aware of that, and I am also aware that it was necessary for you to leave the chair on the left hand side because that is the traditional side on which to leave the chair. Therefore it was the only means by which you could obtain your place. But the members of the Opposition seem to think they have gained some technical point. I think they most likely are satisfied. I do not think that they have upheld the spirit of the Standing Orders; I think they have just gained a technical point which lowers the dignity of the House. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",74
10,Mr WENTWORTH,AYES NOES," I am a Utde puzzled at the way in which the rates in the Schedule are described, particularly the difference between beer and spirits. The duty on beer is so much per Utre but the duty on spirits is so much per Utre of alcohol. When one does the calculations it would appear that the duty on alcohol in beer is about four orfivetimes as great as the duty on alcohol in spirits. Why is there this discrimination? In this Budget the excise on beer has gone up by 56 per cent whereas the excise on spirits has gone up by only 14 per cent. Is the Government directly attacking the working man's drink or is this one of the things which the Government has simply forgotten and the Government has not done its sums? It does not realise that it is putting a much heavier proportion of duty on beer than on spirits. This is a matter of some importance because it is related to the great problem of inflation in the economy. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) put: That the question be now put.

12,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS," I refer to clause 4 of the Bill relating to the duties of Collector. I pose one or two questions to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) which seem to me to be questions of common sense. I hope that he will indicate how they will be resolved. It is quite clear that the export duty will apply to cokes of higher than 85 per cent ash content, but I appreciate that the determination of the ash content of the mineral involves a very large degree of error. I understand that this occurs under the ultimate analysis characteristic. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Mineralogists, metallurgists and mining engineers all indicate that the ultimate analysis involves a large degree of error. So I ask the Minister, if the pubUcation Survey of Eastern Australian Coal of Coking Potential is to be used-this was a survey conducted by the Joint Coal Board and the Queensland Coal Board-o n what basis would that indicate that a product with an ash content of 84.71 per cent would escape the levy and yet one with a content of 85.02 per cent would attract the levy. There will be a degree of accuracy in imposing and accepting certain of these products for levies which is quite out of character with what occurs in fact. In the Kianga-Moura mine one lot of coal has an ash content of just over 85 per cent and the other of 84.71 per cent. How will a judgment be made with any semblance of justice? How can Second Reading the Government exclude from the levy the product with the 84.71 per cent content? This is a very important matter. In tables 5,6 and 7 of this pubUcation onefindsa whole list of the carbon contents of the coal or the coke. Which ones are to be accepted and which ones are to attract the penalty? The matter deserves to be looked at. There are anthracite coals which have an ash Third Reading content of over 90 per cent. Are they to be accepted or wiU they attract the levy? What is to happen? There is a list offiftyor sixty different kinds of products on which it is appropriate for the Minister to make a statement. After aU, the whole problem with this industry now is that there is very great uncertainty. For thefirsttime Second Reading an effective export tax is to be levied. In an economic sense it is an appalUng tiling to do. In terms of the allocation of resources in Australia it wiU have very deleterious effects on any industry which is oriented towards export markets and on any industry whose export markets might improve. It will have very deleterious effects on those parts of Australia where people are in emIn Committee ployment, where people have a certain standard of living and where people have jobs, because of the ripple and the feedback effects of export industries. The Minister's attention ought to be the directed to the uncertainty that will apply in this area. Something has to be done for the future.",76
13,Mr DUTHIE,PAIRS,WU l you take it off when you get into office?,76
14,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I think that any significant new expansion should have an exemption from export duty which could be written off over the ume it takes to write off the original investment. There ought to be an inspection of the procedures appropriate to that which would be morerigorousthan those that appUed to Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd in relation to the BougainvUle operation. Mr Chairman, I see that the honourable member is becoming excited. You wiU appreciate that I was induced to make that comment.",76
15,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I allowed the honourable member the latitude of answering a disorderly interjection but I invite him to return to the matter before the Committee.,76
16,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"Havin g dealt with the matter of uncertainty I now deal with the other matter which is affected by clause 4 of the Bill. It is the matter of blending. It is well known that some coals have a higher content than 85 per cent. The Bill enables coals of less than 85 per cent content to be exported. The blending process can be applied here. In terms of applying clause 4, has the Minister considered what effect it will have on those minerals which have a content of less than 85 per cent? Will their export capacities be disadvantaged? In other words I am asking whether in the past blending has enabled some products to be exported which would otherwise not be exported and what will be done by the Collector to see that those areas, many of which are in New South Wales, will not be disadvantaged. I think I have said enough, Mr Chairman. There are no more interjections. Obviously the honourable member for Wilmot is delighted with the answers he has received. I await the Minister's response with as much anticipation as I can possibly muster.",76
17,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"The points made by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) are valid and they well warrant the consideration of the Committee and the Government. I stress first the technical point that he made, that it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between the various coals. There is a tremendous gap between the levy of $2 a tonne and $6 a tonne which is quite arbitrary. It would be far better, if the Government really wanted to do something in this field, for it to have done it not in this clumsy way but in one of the better ways which were open to it. If the Government really felt- I do not entirely agree with this feeling-that it had to slug the exporters, why did it not put the excise on the value of the exported coal at such and such a rate? That would have met the technical points which were so well put and so cogently raised by the honourable member for Lilley. It would have been possible to have done this in a way which did not involve the horrid arbitrariness of the present very clumsy device which the Government is putting forward. I do not at this moment address myself to the question as to whether or not there should be a levy. I address myself to the techmcal question as to how, if there is a levy, it should be put on. I am afraid that I must come to the conclusion that the method of applying the levy which the Government has chosen is clumsy and bad and will result in all sorts of economic dislocations and inequities.",77
18,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS," I thank the honourable gentlemen for giving me the chance to reply. I know that they are very keen about coal production. They know all about ash content. They have been in the industry for years. Accordingly, I say that, if they had known all that, they would have known that the industry itself can readily ascertain an ash content of 85 per cent without any difficulty at all. If there is any area of objection, as there could be under clause 4 of the Bill, this would be the subject of laboratory tests. At the moment, those people interested in the industry can well ascertain whether the ash content of a specific high quality coal is 85 per cent or greater. If there is to be any blending of a high quaUty coal with a low quality coal, it will be less than 85 per cent in content and attract a duty of only $2 a tonne. I trust that that satisfies the complainants.",77
19,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I wish to make a personal explanation.,77
20,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,77
21,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,Yes. I am afraid that the Minister has entirely failed to understand the point at issue. It is,77
22,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! In the course of a debate, an honourable member is able to use a personal explanation only to explain where he had been misunderstood or misrepresented.",77
23,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,Of course. He misrepresented what I have said.,77
24,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"WeU , make a personal explanation.",77
25,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I did not say that it was difficult to ascertain whether there was an 85 per cent carbon content. I do not say that for one moment. I said that the carbon content of 85 per cent plus or minus was not an adequate instrument to use. I happen to know a great deal more about the coal industry than the Minister does.,77
26,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member shall not debate the subject.,77
27,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"In 3 sentences, the case that I put in respect of this clause was that having a cut-off point of 85 per cent did not allow for the fact that the margin of error on the ultimate analysis of the ash content of the coal was plus or minus 5 per cent or 10 per cent. Those people skUled in the industry all say this; and they know it. The people who deal with coal know it too. Does this mean, therefore, that some coal which, as set out in the publication which I mentioned earUer- I am sure that it would be used-happen s to draw 84.71 per cent or 84.9 per cent, is immediately exempt and is not considered; but that coal with a content from 85.1 per cent, as there are some in this document, attracts the export levy? I ask the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen): Does he consider that this difference, given a margin oferrorof5 per cent to 10 per cent, is any real basis on which to send a big enterprise into a position where it cannot expand or enable jobs to be secured? That is the ultimate argument. This comes from a Party which has introduced, after a lot of consideration, a new taxation system. What this legislation proposes is an indirect tax which is regressive and which is will not. inaccurate in its appUcation. It will have very bad economic effects. I am looking for the precision not appropriate to a man with legal training, the precision which is told to the Minister by those people who, I presume, have technical training in the field. In this House no answer been given which has gone even close to answerand ing the proposition which I put to the Minister. believe that the Parliament desires an answer. I am concerned at the inaccuracy of the determination, its uncertainty and the justice between those on 84.8 per cent or so, which just below the margin, and those who are just above the margin. Also, the proposition concernissue. ing the blending of the coals has not been dealt with. It has not been made clear at what spot, when, and how often, the ash content is to be determined. The Minister cannot ignore these omic criteria. propositions.",77
28,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"My honourable friend from LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), with his dental quaUfications, now decides to take over the debate. Let me say this: The error is not 5 per cent one-tenth of one per cent. That shows how Uttle the honourable member knows about the error. I am assured-and I assume that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) who led for forthwith. the Opposition in this matter would appreciate this fact-that if there is any objection which could be made by the industry to the test is made. Mr Kevin Cairns-Is it above or below 85 per cent as determined in that book?",78
29,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"It is made on the basis of the objection, whether below 85 per cent. Mr Kevin Cairns-So one with 84.95 per cent is in the position",78
30,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Look, we will have this discussion in the corridor later, if the honourable member wishes. It is on the basis that this is standard practice in the industry, which knows the content. If there were an objection which it could properly make on the basis that the coal would attract the lesser rate of tax, industry would be thefirstto make it. Mr Kevin Cairns-It could be made on 84.9 per cent plus?",78
31,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,It can be made in respect of any objection which is made. Mr Kevin Cairns-The Minister knows that it,78
32,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I do not know that. The way we are going, we will all end up not but knowing what we are doing. My honourable friend is so worried that he asks whether a company with an 84.9 per cent content will be overhas taxed. I am assured that a test case can be made it would be made and that it is within that I accuracy that the vaUdity or otherwise of the tax and deserves is guaranteed.",78
33,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I is again say that the Mmister for Manufacturing Industry has entirely misunderstood the point at The point is not whether the determination is accurate. Even if the determination is accurately made, the point is that the results will be arbitrary and quite out of accordance with econ",78
34,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,There is no justification for that claim.,78
35,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"This is the point: The Minister just has not understood the matter at all. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment, report or 10 per cent; it is adopted. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen)-by Collector, a leave-rea d a tliird time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1975-76 Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 2 September on motion it is above or by Mr Hayden: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Fraser had moved by way of . amendment That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House condemns the Budget because it does not provide an adequate program to defeat innation and relieve unemployment nor does it restore confidence in the private sector of the economy'.",78
36,Mr DAWKINS,PAIRS,"Last night, when the debate on the Budget was interrupted, I was drawing attention to the great threat which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) represented to Australia's social security system and in fact to the whole range of services which governments normally provide. I was pointing out that it was quite absurd for the Leader of the Opposition to say that it should be the prime objective of governments to maximise people's disposable income simply by reducing the incidence of taxation. Of course it is necessary to ensure that taxpayers are not forced to pay greater proportions of their income in tax simply as a result of rising money incomes which may or may not be accompanied by rising real incomes. Indeed, the new tax scales go a great way towards achieving that goal. This has been done by reducing the number of steps in the progressive rise in marginal rates with the result that the bulk of wage and salary earners will, despite rising money incomes, remain in the same tax bracket with a constant marginal rate. That is not to say that average tax rates will not increase-of course they will-bu t the proportion of any extra dollars earned which will be paid in tax will remain constant. That in itself is a great improvement. The Leader of the Opposition, however, goes much further and endorses the concept of total taxation indexation. There are some very good reasons for supporting taxation indexation. The main reason is to avoid the automatic increases in taxation which occur in times of innation without governments taking any action to adjust the tax scales. That is to say, in times of inflation, the revenue collected by governments will increase without governments taking any action. I subscribe to the view that governments ought to have to support increases in revenue when they are necessary and that governments simply should not rely on the invisible action of the progressive tax scales to provide that extra revenue. As well, taxation indexation is a great benefit in that it attempts to maintain the real after-tax earnings of wage and salary earners. This is not the motivation of the Leader of the Opposition for supporting taxation indexation. He specifically said in his speech that tax indexation: . . would prevent future governments from using the silem tax of inflauon to transfer resources from individuals to the government. In other words, he is not supporting taxation indexation because it maintains after tax real earnings or because it removes the disincentive to earn more but simply because he is opposed to Government spending, particularly increased Government spending. In the debate which has raged around this Budget there has been a general condemnation by most people of the concept of public spending and it has usually been in the context of the size of the deficit. It is important to point out, however, that there is nothing wrong in the right circumstances with deficitfinancingand simply to condemn deficit financing out of hand is quite incorrect and can lead to great problems in the economy. As well, there is nothing wrong with public spending if governments are prepared to raise the necessary revenue. There are no inflationary consequences necessarily flowing from a government spending money which it collects from taxpayers. The only time when it can be disadvantageous to the economy is when it causes a misallocation of resources or draws on resources to a greater extent than they exist in the economy. So one needs to stress at a time when the Government is conscious of the necessity to draw back on pubhc expenditure and not to expand the deficit, that there is no condemnation so far as the Government is concerned in respect of the general question of deficitfianancingor the general question of public expenditure. However, the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to public expenditure and is opposed to Government intervention in the provision of welfare services. So here we have the real substance of the man who dresses up his opposition to public expenditure by saying that he is in favour of freedom of choice and that the provision of services by a government is in some way inimical to freedom of choice. I have said already that a substantial proportion of the population, probably 20 per cent, have no choice at all due to the inadequate incomes on which they live and also to the inadequacy of the services provided. (Quorum formed). The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) has just made one of his puerile contributions. Here we see the real substance of the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition itself. The Leader dresses up his opposition to public expenditure by saying that in some way it impinges on freedom of choice. In fact, a very significant proportion of the population has no choice at all. The only real freedom of choice those people have or which the Leader of the Opposition would preserve for them is the freedom to starve and the freedom to remain poor. Does anyone really question that this wealthy country can afford to ehminate poverty even though the Leader of the Opposition is effectively saying that we should not? He says that we should not increase public expenditure. Since no one but governments can eliminate poverty, he is effectively saying that we should not be interested in the plight of the needy, we should not ehminate poverty in Australia. I understand why the Leader of the Opposition and many of his colleagues would have no idea at all of the conditions of the urban poor. That is apparent from the lack of concern they show for them. However, they do not even show concern for the rural poor, who are among the people they are supposed to represent. How often have we heard National Country Party members expressing concern about the plight of the rural poor? All they talk about here are superphosphate bounties, tax incentives and subsidies for farmers. Everybody knows that those sorts of subsidies provide no support for the poor in rural areas and no support for small farmers who. experience a great deal of poverty, as was revealed by the poverty inquiry. If the Country Party was really concerned about the needs of the rural poor, whether they be black or white, it would be concerned to spend the $30m, which they would like to see spent on the superphosphate bounty, in supporting the needs of the poor which exist within their own electorates. If that is the way they demonstrate their concern for the poor in their own electorates I shudder to think of the impUcations to the urban poor if they were ever to come to office again. Australia can afford to be more generous with its needy and it has an obligation to be more generous. All political parties, mstead of arguing for a return to this selfish acquisitiveness and tist values of the Leader of the Opposition, ought to be asking instead for an increased commitment to the poor in Australia and an increased commitment to the onslaught against poverty. Mr Kelly-He is funny.",79
37,Mr DAWKINS,PAIRS,I hear the honourable member for Wakefield giggling again. My time has run out. AU I can do is urge the House to support the Budget.,80
38,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"During the Budget debate on Wednesday oflast week I took extremely strong exception to some remarks made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) concerning soldiers and their role in the community. He said: I know, honourable menibers know and those who are listening to this debate know, what is the role of a soldier. So it is not surprising that the honourable member should object that money should be spent out of the national Budget on such things as culture and recreation. What do soldiers know about culture? What do soldiers know about quaUty of Ufe? It is the role of a soldier to kill people rather than to make sure that they have a good Ufe. If someone can show me that the role of any soldier in history was to preserve life I would be pleased to hear about it.",80
39,Mr LUSHER,PAIRS,Who said that?,80
40,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Burke who, I believe, is 46 years of age and would have been a teenager during the Second World War and should have been quite old enough to realise the magnitude of the debt that the country owed to the soldiers who helped to keep it safe from foreign invasion at that time. Mr King-Where is he now?",80
41,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"I informed him I was going to talk about this. If the honourable member Uved in an area which contained a number of servicemen and their famUies he would know that their contribution to the quality of life is great indeed. He would find them active members of Parents and Citizens Associations, youth organisations and kindergarten associations. In fact, he would find them on any committee designed to improve community living. Mr Bourchier-What about Legacy?",80
42,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"And certainly Legacy, as my colleague reminds me. It might also amaze the honourable member for Burke to know that there are many soldiers who do appreciate the arts and if it came to a showdown about the knowledge of culture and the arts he would be left for dead. If the honourable member had taken the trouble during his adult Ufe to study history, especiaUy our own, he would have found eUthat there were many soldiers who contributed greatly to the culture of their country. If he had studied defence matters more seriously and in depth he would know that the primary role of the soldier is the protection of his country and its people. To achieve this he is taught to kill, among other things, because without this skill his role as a protector is as nothing. I am not talking of those armies whose governments give them licence to butcher unarmed and innocent people. I am talking of those armies of soldiers similar to our own who, at the request of the government of the day, offer themselves in combat to protect their country and its people from a foreign control-and that includes the protection of the honourable member and his family. The profession of arms is an honourable one. The members of that profession are not morons or mongrel dogs, as the honourable member appears to suggest. If he were to study military history and matters of defence as I have suggested, I am sure he would regard the role of our soldiers in a different and far more understanding light. If the honourable member for Burke spoke in ignorance or the heat of the moment, I can forgive him for his outburst. If he did not, I cannot forgive him his castigation of our soldiers. I have spent some time in the period allotted to me in this Budget debate in answering the honourable gentleman, but as far as I am concerned it had to be said. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) and other Government Ministers and supporters who have spoken in this debate so far have really gone to great lengths to convince everybody that this Budget they introduced will be the cure for our economic illnesses. They claim that if everybody pulls with it eveiything will be rosy once again, just the same as it was before they took over the reins of administration, when inflation was low, unemploymentfigureswere low, our dollar had real value, and the business world was operating with confidence. We in the Opposition and members of the business community and economists know better. Members of the Government, from the Prime Minister down, are trying desperately to sell this Budget to the people as the only way to regain economic stability. Politically they cannot afford to produce yet another disastrous Budget. We in the Opposition would be failing in our duty to the people if we did not explain to them that there is another way and a better way to regain stability. The Government is insistent that everybody take note of what it claims to be the good measures in the Budget and the excellence of the tax reforms that it has introduced, and it stresses the cut that it has made in Government spending as if it were some tremendous personal sacrifice; but what it has played in a very low key-in fact I bave not heard a note played yet-is the tremendous increase in the outlay to cover unemployment benefits. This is a situation which it has brought about itself through its own mismanagement, which created record unemployment in the first place. This increase is shown in the 1974-75 auunal report of the Department of Social Security. In 1972, the year this Government took office, payments for unemployment benefits were sought $25,996,506. In 1973, when the Government be was happily displaying the ring of confidence far as the unemployment situation was concerned, payments jumped to a record $46,552,939, the highest since 1956. Then in 1974, when the Government was still saying unemployment would be a thing of the past, payments jumped to $58,245,851. At the end of the 1974-75financialyear the depth of the Government's mismanagement of the economy was really highlighted. Payments for unemployment benefits increased to $251,740,069. For a Government that boasts how keen it is on making records, it should be really proud of this one. It is a whizzer and a record it can claim all for its very own. No other government since Federation has come within a bull's roar of this record. But the tragic part of it all is that this expenditure of approximately $5m a week is unproductive. It is a dead weight around the neck of the taxpayer which will get heavier as the results of this Budget are felt and unemployment increases. I notice, too, that the Regional Employment Development scheme which the Government so proudly presented as the great relief for unemployment, is to get the axe. In present circumstances no new payments are being approved, but we are told that $ 135m is earmarked to meet schemes already approved. Only because of the RED scheme the unemployment figures would have been frightening before this, and at least the outlay on this scheme has been productivework for money received. But it is still only temporary relief, even though local government authorities have benefited from it. Speaking of local government authorities, I see that our generous Government is providing unconditional financial assistance to local authorities totalling $79.9m. The Treasurer must have been scratching around the bottom of the purse for this one. It is a pity he could not find $100,000 tucked in a corner to make it the round $80m. But this may have resulted in the Prime Minister having to forego one ofhis sight-seeing tours overseas, and that he would not tolerate; or we might not have been able to afford to purchase another painting, and that would not be tolerated either. The whole community benefits from assistance to local government, and that is what makes it so tremendously important. Every man, woman and child in the community benefits from it, and it is necessary that problems of local government be studied seriously and that realistic decisions regarding assistance be made. If I remember correctly, there are 900-odd local government authorities in Australia. If they all a share of the $80m, that share could not considered as excessive. So we are still in the as same old position of local authorities having to slug the community through increased rate charges to maintain and provide essential services. There is a limit to what the community can pay in rate charges and many, if not all, local authorities are finding it extremely difficult to remain reasonably solvent. In the Budget Speech the Treasurer proudly said that since coming to office the Government had taken a great stride forward in thefieldof social security and welfare and that now it must take stock of its progress and consolidate its gains. Heaven help the country if it consolidates its mismanagement and its record for increasing inflation and unemployment. There is a way the Government could improve the situation if it were game enough to have a go, a mover that would earn it a pat on the back instead of a kick in the tail of the community, a chance for the media to praise it instead of criticising it. The Government has granted $80m for financial assistance to local authorities, which is insufficient to meet their needs, but at least the outlay will be productive. There is $135m in the bin for the RED scheme, most of which I hope will be allocated to local government projects. This outlay also will be productive. I do not think there is any chance that the payments for unemployment benefits will be less than the $251.75m paid out lastfinancialyear. If the Government sticks to its record-breaking run, much more will be paid out; but let us be charitable and keep the anticipated payments to a round figure of $250m. Tbis outlay is unproductive. It buys us the reputation of being a country where a great number of our people can live reasonably without working. This is a reputation we have no cause to be proud of. Many of our unemployed people want to work, they need work but unfortunately there is a great number who are content to drift along as they are. While they receive money to live on for nothing, they will continue to be so. The Government is outlaying $80m which will be productive, and over three times as much which will be unproductive. So why not give the $250m to local authorities and allow them to take up the slack of unemployment on necessary community projects? This would make a sum of $330m provided to local authorities, and if the Government wished to include the $135m earmarked for the RED scheme it would make a total of $465m being distributed to local authorities, the amounts being distributed according to the number of unemployed people in the areaand every dollar productive. I have no doubts about local governments, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security being able to co-operate and make such a scheme workable. In fact I am sure it will be welcomed. I know local governments would welcome such a move. It would ensure rontinuity of necessary local works without having continually to borrow money for this purpose. It would ease the burden on the ratepayer. The taxpayer would be happy knowing this money was productive. The community would benefit considerably and the genuinely unemployed person would feel happier earning his benefits instead of receiving a handout. For those who did not want to work there would be no handout. The suggestion I have made no doubt will conflict with the ambition of the Government to create a welfare State where the majority of the people are dependent on handouts from a socialist government. As I said previously, if the Government is game enough to have a go it would be applauded for doing so. It may not be another record, but it certainly would be an achievement of some note. Speaking of achievements reminds me of the burst the Prime Minister gives us at the end of a session on the achievements ofhis Government over the period. He has consistently claimed records of achievements, but it is becoming increasingly obvious that there are a number of records credited to his Government, under his leadership, which are the greatest ever in our history but which he is not game to claim. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has mentioned these and I should like to emphasise them, especially as this Budget probably will add to the Government's record-breaking run. The Prime Minister; can claim the record for the greatest number of unemployed under one government in Australia's history. Since he has been in control he holds the record for the highest inflation rate we have experienced. He holds the record for the highest interest rates ever imposed on our people. MrKelly-Whoisthis?",80
43,Mr BONNETT,PAIRS,"This is the Prime Minister. A record number of small companies and businesses have gone bankrupt under Government policies. Members of the Government have given us a record Budget deficit to overcome. They have paid a record amount of Australian taxpayer's money for the purchase of a painting. The Prime Minister can claim to have had a greater number of overseas jaunts at the taxpayers' expense in 2Vi years than any other Australian Prime Minister. The Government will receive a record amount of money drained from the taxpayers in one financial year since Federation. It has had a record number of Treasurers in 256 years of government. I am very pleased that I am not playing in the Government team, even thought it is the greatest record-breaker we have ever seen. If the Government feels that the reforms it has introduced balance the records it has established it is living in the dreamtime and it is time it came back to reaUty. Members of the Government through their mismanagement have made themselves extremely unpopular with the business community. They have made themselves unpopular with a number of trade unions which they profess to represent. They have made themselves unpopular with our financial institutions because of their desire to control them. They have made themselves unpopular with all branches of industry. They have made themselves unpopular with our defence Services because of their attitude to defence. When their tax reforms take effect they wiU have made themselves unpopular with all our taxpayers. For the final crunch, the crunch that reaUy puts them in the slot marked 'unwanted', thousands upon thousands of secondary school students hate them, as far as a youngster is able to hate, because of their fooUsh, narrow-minded decision to disband the Army cadet corps. There is movement in every State through the whole of the country's cadet corps to stop this. If the Government has not yet reaUsed that this Budget will do nothing towards its being recognised as a responsible government I would suggest that members of the Government switch on, for the message is there, loud and clear, for them all to hear: Get out before you make a bigger mess of this wonderful country. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Sitting suspendedfrom 6 to 8p.m.",82
44,Mr DAVIES,PAIRS,"I am pleased other to support this Budget because for the first time in over 20 years some justice is being afforded under the new personal taxation system young married couples with famUies to raise and to educate. The Budget has been haUed as one of the most sweeping reforms of personal taxation ever undertaken in Australia and has been described as one of the greatest social reforms introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government. The new tax system substantially lowers the burden on the lower and middle income fanuly man and exempts 500 000 current taxpayers from paying any tax at all because it will Uft substantially minimum taxable income levels. taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 dependent student chUdren in receipt of an income of less than $5,372 a year will now pay no tax. The increase in fanuly allowances are far greater than in any previous Budget so that the average earner's tax saving for a dependent wife is more than doubled and his saving for dependent children is increased by 50 per cent or more. To give an example, a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 chUdren who earns $160 a week will receive a tax saving of $7 a week. If he were receipt of a salary of $200 a week, the tax saving would be more than $ 10 a week. The present concessional allowances for dependants are replaced by more generous rebates providing for $400 for a spouse, $200 for the first child under age 16 and student child and $ 150 for other chUdren. I am especiaUy pleased to see the introduction of a separate additional rebate of $200 known as the sole parent rebate for parents without partners. Tbis will provide reUef for one parent famUies. I know of several of these families in my electorate and I appreciate the difficulties they experience. This new rebate is a recognition by this Government of the difficulties facing this section of the community. Throughout Australia, about 100 000 supporting parents will benefit from this. I am very pleased also that concessions for educational expenses which were previously set at $150 will now be increased to $250 per student chUd. The new tax system, as the Age newspaper pointed out, has much to recommend it in terms of equity. It removes serious defects from the old structure and it provides positive benefits for the overwhelming bulk of taxpayers. The Government's poUcy of adjusting pensions in the autumn and spring has been continued with an increase of $2.75 in the single rate pension and $4.50 for married couples. Under the repatriation proposals, the total and permanent incapacity pension rate is increased $6 a week to $74.10 a week with commensurate increases in war pension rates. The TPI rate is to be increased a further $6 in the autumn of 1976 and the other rates will be then further increased into the Une with the consumer price index. The education aUocation which has almost quadrupled in the last 2 years will be increased by $237m to a new total of $ 1,904m. Our opponents say that there is nothing in this Budget for Tasmania. But I point out that the Governtax ment hopes to spend about $3m on the Devonport Technical College and on the development of student residences at the Burnie Technical College. The impetus of the improvements which A have come about under the Labor Government will be maintained and recurrent expenditure continued so that existing standards and staffstudent ratios are maintained. The Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) has been to my electorate twice already this year and has arranged for the Schools Commission to prepare a special report on the needs of Catholic schools on the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania. Professor P. D. Tannock, Mr D. M. Bennett and Mr A. D. Wood visited the areas from 22 to 24 July. We look forward with interest to getting the report and I commend the Mmister on behalf of everyone associated with government and nongovernment schools for the great work that he is doing in the administration of this important portfolio. In the last year in my electorate-this answers criticism that nothing is being done for this purpose. Tasmania-and I emphasise that I speak only for my electorate, government schools benefited by $616,000, non-government schools by $311,000, week disadvantaged government schools by $117,000 occurred and the teachers centre in Burnie by $75,000. Of Government. course, we draw the comparison of what hapmanians, that Government pened during the 23 years of the previous the form of a subsidy to assist government when nothing was given to amounts, together with Australian Government their struggle to compete with their industries funds provided under Labor for the technical on the mainland of Australia. This counterparts schools in the area, approximate $1.3m. This vides an amount of almost $5m in subsidy Australian Labor Government places great emments phasis on social security, education and health. An amount of $ 102.4m is contained in the Budget for grants to the States for health propayment grams. This amount represents a substantial increase on the amount provided last year.

This has the effect money for the following purposes: Community health facilities, $1.8m; tuberculosis control, $305,000; school dental schemes, which of fore course are an innovation under this Government, $2.1m; health education campaigns, $51,000; products blood transfusion services, $85,000; recurrent increased expenditure by health planning agencies, that the freight $20,000; home dialysis supplies and equipment, maintained at the $114,000. I turn now to one part of the Budget which of particular interest to people in Tasmania. statements on page 42 of Budget Paper No. 9 which deal with urban and regional developGovernment ment in 1975-76 confirm thefinancialcommitfor ment for the north-west Tasmanian regional water supply scheme which was announced in only last year's Budget. The document states: Assistance will be available towards the cost of west Tasmania regional water supply scheme which replace the existing practice separate water suppUes. The scheme is expected to cost SlOm over a 7-year period. The Austrahan Government will contribute 60 per cent of the cost, including $840,000 in 1975-76. We welcome thefinancialsupport given in this Budget because the new scheme is designed to give people in the 8 municipalities of that region an assured supply of clean water until the year 2000. The important meeting of the 8 municipalities will be held at the end of this week. I sincerely hope that after many months of discussion they will now be able to reach some unanimity and go ahead with the scheme to use this $840,000 which is provided in the Budget for In the debate on Tasmanian shipping last I outlined freight increases that had under the last Liberal-Country Party Despite the pleas from Tasprovided nothing in us with the tourist us.

This finanis cial support gives the lie to the claim that The Tasmania has received nothing from this Government when, in effect, it was the previous which gave nofinancialassistance our shipping services. As a result of the subsidies Tasmanian shippers are currently paying 60 per cent of the sea freight that applied in 1959. At the same time, the cost of living in the northAustralia has more than doubled and average will weekly earnings have increased Vh times. whereby urban settlements have Taking into account the Australian Govern the ment's freight and passenger subsidies, the $1.7m subsidy on wheat freight and another $1.7m for the Australian National Line's loss on passenger services this nnanciai year, Tasmade mania's benefit from government sponsored schemes will now amount to some $9m this financial year. This amounts to $22.50 for each person Uving in Tasmania or over $80 for each Tasmanian household. I repeat that nothing given to Tasmania in the 23 years of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government despite the fact that freight rates increased by 30 per cent. We often hear the propaganda claims from members of the Liberal Party that the Governof ment is out to destroy the 4-port concept for mania and to concentrate on the one-port conwork they do. cept. These maUcious rumours were dispelled the comments of the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) in a debate last week and by the poticy statement of Premier Bill NeUson last theCouncil weekend. The port of Burnie alone has increased would its volume of revenue from $ 1.25m to $2.33m the past 7 years. In that period the total cargo volume has almost doubled to 1.5 mUlion tons. ter states: Fifty per cent of the cargoes, both overseas and interstate, are bulk cargoes and therefore it ance would be unthinkable to have to transport and above mentioned ship those goods from other ports. We also hear terially the claim that costs have increased in Tasmania structure because of the poUcies of this Labor Governyear. ment. But the percentage increase in the consumer price index of the Australian Statistician is and less for our capital city of Hobart than is the percentage increase for the average of the 6 capital cities over the period from December 1972 June this year. This does not mean that Hobart's prices are lower but it does show that Tasmania's prices on items in the index have not risen as fast as for all the capitals taken together since Labor Government came to office. Terminal facilities, moreover, especially Melbourne, Devonport and BeU Bay also have been greatly improved last year. A continuing development is going on which will provide us with a speedier turn-around of shipping and improve our service. This is a much different state of affairs when compared with what hapful, pened under the previous Government. The runprogress down in port facilities which was aUowed to hapdistricts pen under the previous Government was the main cause for many of the backlogs of cargo which used to buUd up to the detriment of economy of Tasmania. I place on record also expressions of thanks which we have received from local government because of the attitude Labor Administration in assisting local municipal councUs with direct grants from the Grants Commission. I know the councils in my area are most appreciative of the grants that are without any strings attached. In 1974 the 12 municipaUties in my electorate received an amount of $500,000. This amount has been mcreased by recent aUocations to $605,000 for this year. The 2 larger municipaUties of Burnie was and Devonport received $100,000 each. If we add to that amount the $400,000 provided for sewerage, it can be seen that local government has benefited by almost $lm in the financial assistance received from the Australian Government. The councUs are appreciative of this type support because they received nothing from Tasprevious governments. It is a recognition of the by I refer to a couple of letters which have been received from councUs. One of the letters states: is very pleased with such continued assistance by Australian Government and would be grateful if you convey to Senator Douglas MCClelland the Special in Minister of State this Council's appreciation. Another council on the north-west coast in a letThe Council places on record its appreciation of the assistgiven by the Australian Government by way of the Grants Commission Grant, which will maassist in maintaining a reasonable municipal rating within the Municipality for the ensuing financial The Council would Uke to express sincere thanks to you members of the Government for the funds made avaUable in the above respect. They are typical of other letters received. That to shows that local municipaUties welcome very much and are appreciative of the money they receive from the Grants Commission without strings attached. The grant is a recognition of the this work being done throughout Australia by this third tier of government. Apart from this, local councUs in my area have in also benefited greatly from the Regional Employment Development scheme projects. I place on record my appreciation of the wonderful work done by the former Minister for Labor and so Immigration, Mr Clyde Cameron, in introducing the RED scheme and for taking such a wonderpersonal interest as he did in following the of the various schemes in the country especiaUy. My electorate benefited by $4.6m under the scheme. We have seen very many worthwhile community projects which, in the their way, are living monuments to Clyde the Cameron. They would never have got off the ground but for the scheme which he introduced. I of need only quote from a letter received from the Leven District of the Boy Scouts Association in which they state that they would like: . . . to make known to you and the Austrahan Government that our particular project has been extremely ful both from the point of view of same time contributing to the this Municipality, not only for the present generation but for generations to come. The committee of the Association goes on to point out that its project has put the district years ahead in its program of scouting and that good value for money has been realised in their projvice. ect. The letter concludes: We feel the Regional Employment Development can be successful in a two-fold manner. Firstly, it organisations, particularly those such as ourselves voluntary, to improve their position in the community without reliance on the Local Council or leaving them maintenance bill for years, and secondly it certainly unemployment position in the local area. In the past year the Australian Government financially assisted many other organisations in the electorate of Braddon. I recall grants of $145,000 under the Aged Persons Homes Act for 4 projects at Smithton and Ulverstone; $8,200 for environment and conservation; $253,000 for community health and school dental services; $206,000 for tourism and recreation grants; $100,000 for child care centre grants; $12,000 towards the Austrahan Assistance Plan for salaries; and $91,000 for road safety improvements. The Budget provides for an estimated expenditure this financial year of $542,000 towards the estimated cost of $2.5m for the first stage of a 7 kilometre dual riageway and bypass at Ulverstone, including new bridge over the Leven River. It also pronot vides for an expenditure of $795,000 this finanplease cial year for the new dual carriageway between Victoria Bridge, over the Mersey River at tioned Devonport, and the Don township. The route and unemployment bypasses the commercial centre of Devonport. Tasmania benefits greatly from the transport policies initiated by the Australian Government. On 1 July this year the Australian Government took over the control of the State raUways. The immediate advantage to Tasmania will be a net financial benefit to the State's revenue account $5m. In addition, Tasmania will receive an adjustment of $3.3m in itsfinancialassistance base which represents a permanent and unemployment increased budget gain to the State. Tasmania will be reUeved of capital debts standing against raUways, as agreed between the Australian employed. Government and the State Government. The State will also be reUeved of raUways operating losses which are estimated to be $ 14m for the financial year. In addition to thefinancialassistance of the transfer, the Australian Government is committed to a program of raUway upgrading successaimed at improving the standard of the Tasemployment and at the manian raUways. welfare of the young people in The Budget makes provision for the estabUshment of 28 new regional legal aid offices this financial year. I know that the hundreds of people who have benefited from the advice given by this service will certainly view with concern the poUcy of the Liberal Party to abolish the serA legal aid office was opened in the electorate of Burnie in May last year and the statistics Scheme that have been provided to me for the first 5 allows months of this year indicate what a valuable serwho are vice is being provided.

45,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member' s time has expired.,86
46,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"It is rather amazing Ustening to the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) elucidating all the wonderful goodies that the Labor Party-the sociaUst party-ha s given Tasmania over the past Vh years. One wonders at the enormous shock he must have received when he heard the results of the Bass by-election. How could anybody possibly vote against such a wonderful government if it performed so well? Of course the real cartruth was that the socialist Government a introduced another couple of measures that did please the people in Tasmania nor did it the people in the rest of Australia. I refer to the great achievements that have been menso often in this debate, that is inflation Let us look at a Uttle of the background of inflation and unemployment before we get on to the Budget. Unlike the previous speaker I intend to talk about the Budget in terms of the future and not the past. With respect to inflation, the cost of Uving has gone up in 2% years by 41 per ofcent. That is not a bad sort of rise. I am sure the people of Tasmania remembered that when they voted in the Bass by-election. The official rate of has trebled from 1.5 per cent of the work force to 4.5 per cent of the work force, the or approximately 270 000 people officially unWe underUne the words 'officially unemployed' because we think that something Uke another 40 000 unemployed are hidden in varilast ous schemes that the Government has dreamed up. Of course, one such scheme was the Regional Employment Development Scheme mentioned by the honourable member for Braddon. Whilst he lauded the former Minister who got the sack because of his efforts in bringing in the RED scheme, he must be very sorry about his Party chopping out the scheme that was supposedly doing so much good for his territory. In fact, it is quite possible that the honourable member for Braddon might even contemplate stepping down and letting us try another by-election and see how we go in Braddon. We would welcome the opportunity.",86
47,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,What about Bendigo?,87
48,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"Yes . We shall certainly try there in the near future. When introducing the Budget the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) mentioned that the business sector was recovering. I think he mentioned that there were early signs of a recovery, that business inventories were falling, that the home building industry was strengthening and that retail sales were improving. What he forgot to mention was that one needed a microscope with rose coloured glasses to ascertain any sign of improvement at all. The number of firms in Australia, both large and small, which closed down during 1975 reached 3000. I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian recently headed 'Slump puts shutters on 3000firms'.The article states: In Victoria 1179 companies have been removed from the State Corporate Affairs Commission Register this year pared with 1156 for the whole oflast year.",87
49,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,Do not believe it.,87
50,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"It is true. Unfortunately honourable members opposite just do not want to believe it. That is exactly the problem. They have not yet learned to understand what economics is aU about. But never mind, they will find out at the next election. Let us consider the situation. The reason that these industries closed down was the impact of across the board tariff cuts on manufacturing, especiaUy in the textile industry. That was a great achievement. The Government wiped out half of those companies. This occurred because of the inabUity of these companies to pass on the cost rises they had to take up with wages and other rising costs, industrial disputes and the high cost of trying to raise finance which was all brought about by this sociaUst Government. Let us consider a few of the facts of the get. It outlays an amount of $22,000m, which approximately equal to $1,398 for each man, woman and chUd in Australia. Pay-as-you-earn is taxation has increased from $450 to $637 per head which is equal to a 41.6 per cent rise over the last year. PubUc Service salaries and other services will cost $502 per head. Mr Katter-What did Eskimo NeU cost?",87
51,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"Probably a fair share of that $502 per head. Thatfigureof $502 per head may be compared with $350 per head for the previous year and represents the biggest single cost of ranning Australia-a n even greater amount of money than that provided to the State governments by this Federal Government. Yet honourable members opposite still want to mcrease the PubUc Service and they complain because we talk about zero growth. Indirect taxation has increased by 31 per cent from $214 to $280 per head following the price increases for cigarettes and beer. These facts are contained in Budget Paper No. 4. Honourable members have all read that paper although most honourable members opposite wish to ignore it. AU these facts underline the deception of this Government when it talks of advantages to the taxpayer. In real terms the advantages are disadvantages. The taxation proposed by the Treasurer is a complete duphcity. He mentioned proudly in his Budget Speech that he has increased the aUowance for education expenses from $150 to $250. Let us analyse thatfigure.He brings in a rebate system which does away with that type of expense as a tax deduction. In other words, unless education expenses exceed approximately com- $1,350 people can claim a rebate of $540, which eUrninates the right to claim as tax deductions such things as education expenses. So it is only duphcity to say that the Government is putting this up or that up. If one bothers to analyse the situation even further onefindsthat the amount one is aUowed to claim under the rebate system for expenditure of more than $1,350 is 40 per cent of the amount of such expenditure. If one calculates 40 per cent of $250 onefindsoneself claiming $ 100 for education expenses. That is the fact of the matter. The Government is allowing the people $ 100 and not $250. Taxation increased on 1 July. One of the things the Treasurer did not mention and which apparently many people have overlooked, although I am sure when they look at their pay packets at the end of the year they will reaUse, is the fact that taxation was increased from 1 July this year. It was increased by an amount that will be even Budgreater in the long term by January next year is than the amount of reduction that is proposed. Honourable members opposite can say that that a lot of rot because the reduction on 1 January is going up by 5 per cent, or something to that effect. But let us look at the real facts of the case. If wages increase-and they will surely increase from 1 July to 1 January-eve n at the rate of per cent at which they increased over the last months, then we are going to find that average weekly earnings will be around $180 a week, despite the contradiction by the Treasurer. are going tofindthat the 500 000 people that he talks about as being free from taxation are in fact going to move up the wages scale so that they will be in a tax fork. This will happen before new taxation scheme even comes in. Apart from that, by moving up in the wages But scale they will draw to themselves a higher rate of taxation. In doing so the increase they suffered on 1 July will not be compensated for by any reduction in taxation. It is a complete duplicity. The Government is merely giving back on January what it has already imposed on 1 July. has increased its income on pay as your earn taxaway ation by many thousands of millions of dollars the meantime. There is some vague hope among the business sector that the increased after pay-the take home pay, if you like to call it that - for the work force will find some of its way the retail industries which badly need it. Let face it, I am not talking about making great profits. The retail industries are the ones that closing. They are the ones which keep peoplethe shop workers-employed , which keep the small factories open and so on. They are hoping that some of this take home pay increase will findit its way into the tills of those retailfirms.But will happen only-and I stress the word only-i the increased prices for beer, cigarettes, petrol, postage and telegraph services do not absorb more than the small increases that the work force is likely to get in its take home pay. Let us have look at page 26 of the Budget Speech. The at Treasurer stated: The combined eifect of the taxation measures outlined and of the more accurate PAYE deductions they make possible will be a substantial reduction in tax instalments for most taxpayers from the beginning of 1976. As I pointed out to honourable members, tion logically that is untrue and the people will find this out. One of the points that the Treasurer did not mention- I want to mention it here; a small point but it is relevant-is that the socialist party forgets the fact that the average working person it keeps talking about usually has many commitments that use up most of his pay. So in order to have his holiday at the end of the year in order to purchase another car, change his one over or buy something that he wants for his house, he makes sure there is always a nice little surplus in his taxation deductions. He likes tax refund cheque. This is a fact of Ufe. Anybody who has had anything to do with employees is 30 aware that many employees Uke to pay that little 9 extra tax, by not claiming for one dependant so that they have some refund coming to them. The Treasurer intends by adjusting the new We tax scheme to provide that there will be hardly any taxation refunds. This has not quite sunk into the working people of this country but it will sink in some time after June next year when they the do not get any refund cheques, when in fact some of them will probably have to pay some money. be that as it may. I am not trying to instU that sort of thought. What I am saying- I honestly believe this-is that many working people dwell on receiving a taxation refund cheque to take the famUy away on their annual hoUdays, which are 1 4 weeks now. Now Under the Budget, as the It Treasurer proudly said, the new tax scales will do with that. I think he is doing a harm. It is in not a good thing. I know that one can logically and economicaUy say that really these people are tax lending the Government money without interest. So what? The point is that if the people have the to extra money in their pay packets most of them us will not save it. They will not save the money that they hope to get through their refund cheques. are The Government wUlfindthis out to its sorrow. I turn now to housing. This is an area that concerns many people in Australia. In fact, I believe is one of the most important items because it that controls one of the largest work forces in the f country, apan from the Public Service. The State housing grants are down $20m in the Budget this far year. In 1974-75 the Budget allocated $345m to the States for housing. In the 1975-76 Budget a this allocation dropped to $365m. But let us look the realisticfigures.First of all we must allow for 20 per cent inflation over the 12 months. This would require a further $73m on last year's I have expenditure to provide exactly the same amount which of housing, providing there are no further PAYE increases in prices. That means that there will be in total a $93m drop in the funds going into housing. The actual increase in home construccosts over the 12 months has been averaged out at about 30 per cent. So in fact myfigureof 20 percent is quite moderate. The price increases it is only make the gap even larger. The situation is that the State housing which is basicaUy designed to provide for low income earners, whether they purchase the homes or rent or them, is the area that will suffer. The people who old want to get into those homes, already many months behind, wUlfindit even more difficult to get a home. In other words the buUders will not his be able to erect the homes. There will be a further cut back in employment. But of course the Treasurer is quite prepared to accept that. The larger building companies that build ordinary villa homes have for the last couple of years been forced to change their policy of 60/40 erection, meaning 60 per cent for private sale and 40 per cent for government contracts to a system of 40 per cent private and 60 per cent government. This has been forced on them by the Government's high interest rates over the last 2 years which have made the building companies accept government contracts for 60 per cent of their work to keep their men employed. The result of the Government's moves now means that that 60 per cent will not be available and the Government willfindincreased numbers of builders on the unemployment Usts. I now refer to the promises of the present Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) given on 20 July, that advances to the States wiU not be less than in the previousfinancialyear. It did not take him long to be told that he was totaUy out of order. On 9 July whUst addressing the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales the Minister said that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) had also indicated to the States that the Government would maintain at least the same level of expenditure in 1975-76 as in 1974-75. This is just another one of the Government's back pedals on a promise, another let down. Commencements in the housmg industry average 10 000 a month. This is 4000 a month below thefigurefor the previous 2 years and with the actions taken in this Budget that figure will drop even further. The result will be that we will have an even greater setback in the amount of housing avaUable. The young people cannot afford the homes. When in power we introduced a scheme to provide housing under a home savings grant scheme which was pooh-poohed by this Government which set about dismantling it. The scheme was to run out this year. The Government in its stupidity-that is all it is-ha s set aside SlOm to provide the funding of these grants. It has not had the nous to reaUse that one cannot buUd a house to a Umit of $22,500 including land. Where can a young couple buUd a home for that amount these days? In other words, that SlOm will not be used. It is impossible to use it. So why not put that money somewhere else. The Government is only kidding itself in providing that amount in the Budget. It should wake up to itself and do something positive for the young people and raise that Umit to $30,000 or more. It should not worry about providing larger grants but should enable the money to be used. In that way it would be helping the people who need it. I hope that as soon as we are returned to government we will reintroduce a promising scheme that was well received by aU sections of the community for those who were prepared to save some money. I turn to nursing home benefits. Here I think we see one of the tragedies of this Budget. I say this knowing that the Government did feel the need for restraint. However, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out, there are areas in which we could cut the Budget expenditure further in the non-productive areas without affecting the welfare of the country. I should Uke to see the welfare services of the country extended to cover nursing home benefits. At present the government subsidy has been extended from $100.10 to $110.90 a week. To that is added the pension payment of $38.75 a week. That means that $149.65 is the amount that can be paid to the nursing home.' Yet under this Government nursing homes have now been authorised and told to charge a patient $169 a week. Who pays the additional $19.35 per week? Only if the people in those homes have relatives who can afford the extra amount will the charge be met. In my electorate I have a number of these homes. Already the people are coming to me complaining that they cannot afford to pay the extra $19.35 a week. What are they going to do? They cannot take the elderly people out of the nursing homes. These are very old people and their relatives cannot get them settled into government homes. Tbis is one area to which I would ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Wheeldon) to give very serious attention. Let us have a look quickly at the situation with pensions. It has been proposed that there will be 2 increases per year from now on to be based on the consumer price index mstead of on average weekly earnings. This proposal was designed to overcome another one of the vague promises made by this Government. The Government gave an undertaking that the pension would be raised to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings- a promise it has never been able to keep because quite logicaUy when the pension is raised thefigurefor average weekly earnings is based on the earnings several months prior to the time when the increase is made, as will be the case when the next increase is paid in November. By then the average weekly earnings will have gone way up. So the Government could not keep that promise. It has ducked out of it by taking this other option. Despite what the people opposite say about our not being interested in welfare my Party will introduce a system of automatic increases on a twice-a-year basisfixedon a proper system so that there will be no way that the people will miss out on the amount they are entitled to get as a pension. The Leader of the Opposition introduced a positive alternative to this Government's fiddly little Budget. The further cuts that he advocated would provide funding for development. Development does not mean, as the socialists opposite seem to think, only something in the pockets of the rich man or the businessman. Unless the businessman makes his profits, unless a business is viable, we do not have employment. The sooner Government supporters realise that one can spend a dollar only once and the Government cannot go spending millions of dollars on all sorts of things without having some strong private sector enterprise, the sooner they will understand the way to manage the economy of Australia. Under the leadership of the soonto-be-Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, we will introduce a Budget that will make this country economical, viable, and progressive forever more. I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",87
52,Mr WALLIS,PAIRS,"It is rather amazing to find that the Liberal Party after 23 years in government and a few years in opposition has now suddenly come forward with ideas such as those that were put forward by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) who has just resumed his seat. The twice yearly increase in the pension according to movements in the consumer price index mentioned by the honourable member is certainly something new so far as the Liberals are concerned. They had their opportunity for 23 years to show that they were concerned about the less fortunate people in society and they did not take that option. In fact the Henderson report that has come out in the last few days is an indictment of the Liberals because it deals mainly with the period during which that Party was in government. I rise to support the Budget and to oppose the amendment. The Budget is introduced in a set of economic circumstances that we on this side of the House do not like. But the fact is that we are facing circumstances that are facing every western nation. We are facing the 2 grave problems of inflation and unemployment. The general strategy of this Budget is to try to overcome 2 problems. The course taken by the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) proposes that there shall be no excesses either way. I am sure that the Treasurer hopes that by steering that middle course he will be successful and that we will see a return to stability in Australia and, we would hope, throughout the world so that the ideas and policies of the Labor Government can be carried forth and not be restricted as they have been this year. As I have said, the aim of the Budget is to bring Australia back to an even keel in conjunction with the other western nations. It aims to ensure that we maintain all the gains that have been made. There have been many gains in the 3 years that this Government has been in power. There have been gains in the approach to the payment of pensions and payments to the less fortunate in society. The Government has taken away some of the moral penalties that existed in regard to unmarried mothers. It has also taken away some of the moral penalties affecting Class A, Class B and Class C widows. It has done away with what were actually moral penalties. It has endeavoured to do away with the discriminations that exist. It has certainly tried to assist the less fortunate in the community. Among the first items that we attacked on coming to government were the problems that had faced outback children for many years. We introduced the isolated children's scholarship. This was sometJung which the previous Government had rejected completely in the many years it was in power. On coming to power we altered the priorities. We hope that with the return to stability that will result from this Budget we will be able to continue with these priorities. I am sure that people who have read even an outline of the Henderson report on poverty which has been released in the last few days will realise that the priorities set by this Government are in the correct order. I think in some ways our policies have pre-empted some of the matters mentioned in the Henderson report. We certainly hope that as a result of a study of the report and bearing in mind our own humanitarian aims we can give effect to much of what is contained in the report. There are a very many other areas in which this Government can take a great deal of pride. One is thefieldof education. When we came to power I think the allocation for education was just over $200m a year. Thisfinancialyear it will increase to $ 1,908m, an increase of $263m over last year. Whilst the Government will not be able to give effect this year to its triennium plans, sufficient money has been allocated to ensure those that the progress that has been made in education will continue. The various education commissions have been established in the period that we have been in office and they have made recommendations. The Government has taken some extremely positive steps to put those recommendations into operation. We hope that our program will continue in this way. These initiatives in the education field have enabled the provision of a greatly increased number of buildings, greater facilities, better staffing in schools and a general uplifting in the whole area of education. Education is certainly one of the main goals of this Government. Despite the restrictions that had to be imposed by the Budget, the Government has been able to increase its allocation and to keep moving towards an achievement of its aims. We know that all the problems of education will not be solved this year, but we know that as a result of the poUcies laid down by the Government we wiU be moving towards those solutions. It is a fact that capital expenditure on education wiU be Umited in this financial year, but the recurrent expenditure will be kept at its real value so that our aims can be achieved. One area in which there has been a big vance by this Government is in the care and cation of young chUdren in our society. There been an aUocation of $74m in the Budget for purpose. We have shown the previous Governquite ment what can be done in this area. I know that in my own area allocations offinancehave been made towards the estabUshment of child care centres. There is a chUd care centre now in course of construction in the town in which I We hope that in a few months time we will be able to see it in operation. There are also number of kindergartens in the area, many of which have received assistance through the operation of the State committees that have been set up. The funding for these institutions is coming from the Federal Government. A number of the kindergartens are awaiting the outcome this Budget to ascertain whether they would ceive some assistance so that they could provide for the younger people in the society the edumedical cation that has been lacking for so long. This, course, is another example of the priorities that this Government sets in its objectives. Much has been said about Medibank. I know that I am probably only repeating what has been said many times over, but it is a fact that this Government is allocating this year $ 1,445m towards the cost of Medibank. I have seen some criticism that this is a waste. I read an editorial one of my papers not so long ago to which I repUed. I pointed out that in stating that the money spent on Medibank was wasteful they unit were forgetting that if the old scheme was still operation the Government would be up for in $ 1,000m, in addition to which the vast majority of people would be contributing to private insurance funds. They are now reUeved of that UabUity. I suppose that a fanuly man would save about $5 a week. One area that has again received some attention-this is another of the new priorities set by this Government-is assistance to community health centres. The Budget aUocates $65 m under the community health program. Of course this program has significance in my electorate because I represent some of the more remote areas of South Australia. I am very pleased that the Australian Government, which is providing most of the finance, in conjunction with the South Australian Government has been able to estabUsh community health centres in areas where previously health care services were either practicaUy non-existent or left much to be desired. One area in which we would anticipate the official opening of a community health centre soon is the opal rruning centre of Coober Pedy adwhich is an isolated community with a popuedulation of up to 4000 people situated about 600 has nules north-west of Adelaide. Previously this this town was serviced by a small hospital run by dedicated sisters of the Australian Inland Mission and the Flying Doctor Service. It is impossible to expect these nursing sisters to handle the medical problems in a centre of that the size. The Government in conjunction with the Uve. State Government provided a community health centre in this area. The buUding isfinishedand I a would hope that we would have the pleasure of having the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) coto perform the opening in the near future. Another area of need is Ceduna which is the last stop-off place for motorists travelling on the of Eyre Highway to Western Australia. This town rewhich has a population of just under 3000 people is the last point for about 600 nules where attention is avaUable. A hospital was esof tabUshed there but the Australian Government, again in conjunction with the State Government, will provide the bulk of thefinanceto estabUsh a community health centre in that area. It is a very impressive set up. It was opened by the Federal Minister for Health about 2 months ago and it should help to overcome the health needs of that community. It does more than look after the people in the immediate vicinity of Ceduna. in There are 2 groups of Aboriginal people in the area-on e about 20 nules out and the other about 180 miles out. The centre has a mobile servicing attached to it which wiU be able to visit the in areas a bit further out in order to give the people those areas a decent health service. Also it acts as the normal community welfare office and vides most of the community needs of the people in the area. In addition to those 2 centres there is a larger centre being built at Port Lincoln and smaUer cUscentres in a number of other country towns in the district area. The $65m contained in the Budget wiU various councUs allow this very worthy aim of the Labor ment to continue to provide these medical seragricultural show organisations andsocieties, vices and to ensure that the medical needs of people in the more remote areas are catered for. provincial Also included in the Budget is an amount of total of all $108m for the hospitals development program. $2,576,000, intypes We know that with Medibank certain ments were reached between the Australian Government and the States about assistance for the States' hospital programs. The States' hospiThe tal programs will benefit from this $108m. The figures for social security have been mentioned over and over again. We aU know that this is the the sixth time that the age pension has risen since electorate this Government came to office. the previous speaker, the honourable member organisations to doItthings for Bendigo, said, it is in line with what the wise have been unable to that Government promised. The Government promised 2 rises every year until the pension cUs to carry out projects that they district reached 25 per cent of the average weekly wage. It is very close to it at the present time, as anyone who works it out wiUfind.The Government has received not only increased the standard rate of pensions amount ofintheir and unemployment benefits but increased the amount aUowed for chUdren. Resporting bodies andlocal patriation benefits have also been increased, as I make up the community think the honourable member for Braddon Davies) mentioned. I would like to refer to my own area again. electorate has benefited greatly since the Government came to office in 1972. I keep records of all types of grants that are made within my electorate. I hope that I have noted them aU but no doubt there are a few that I missed. The grants total $10,561,000. Of course, they are spread over various areas in the torate. First of aU there are grants for area improvement programs. The untied grant to the councils from the Grants Commission last amounted to $750,000 and this year, on the ing of the Budget, will amount to $980,000. grants include area improvement program number grants, Grants Commission grants, Regional Employment Development scheme grants and that grants for the construction of old folks homes. Previous governments provided a subsidy of $2 for $1 for these types of homes. Since the Labor Government came to power the subsidy has been increased to $4 for $1. Grants have been made for tourism and recreation. There has been proallocation from the Australian Government for community health centres and there have been some educational grants. The money has gone to town and district counI have not broken down thefiguresfor the State but there were RED grants to government departments-to sportGoverning bodies, to schools, to historical to to simUar the organisations. Let me refer to the four main cities in my electorate. In WhyaUa the of grants received was agreeLincoln $1,637,000 and$3,055,000, Port Pirie in Port in Port Augusta $1,657,000. In addition an amount was aUocated to the smaU district councUs in the rural areas. total comes to over $10.5m. Most of these grants, with the possible exception of grants to taken old folks homes, would be new mitiatives by this Government. The people of the of Grey have much for which to thank Despite what this Government. has helped many of these do. they would otherIt has certainly helped the town corporations and would counnot have been able to carry out using their own resources. It is a fact that in a number of areas the amount these grants is IV2 to 2 times the general rate revenue. So in my it has also particular area the government bodies, the the various other bodies that have much for which to (Mr thank the Labor Government. My I turn now to the question of road transport. Labor My electorate plays an important part in transport because at the present time the main Unk between west and east and the main Unk between north and south go through the electorate. have Since the estabUshment of the national roads program by this Government the Australian elecGovernment has taken thefinancialresponsibUity for completing those 2 main roads. I heard some criticism the other night from the honouryear able member for the Northern Territory (Mr passCalder). When my Party was in Opposition I The asked the then Minister for Transport on a of occasions about these 2 roads and he said that South Australia received so much and it could set its own priorities. What he really meant was that South Australia had to build the roads for all the people of the Northern Territory and all the people of Western Australia, because it has been proved that most of the people who use those 2 roads do not emanate from South an Australia. Since the Australian Government took over responsibility for the national roads program great progress has been made on the Eyre Highway, and we hope very shortly to see progress on the Stuart Highway. An amount of $ 138m has been allocated to the States under the urban road transport assistance agreement. The allocation for shipping includes $lm towards the operation of the Empress of Australia to Tasmania. A total of $445m is allocated this year for roads. In addition to the allocations in the Budget for upgrading our present transport system there is assistance to the rural industries. This Government introduced the minimum reserve price plan for wool, providing 250c per clean kilo for 21 micron wool. It has allocated an amount of $80m to help the Australian Wool Corporation carry carry this scheme out. I know that the Government has been criticised for the situation in the beef industry, but the Government is providing $ 19.6m for the joint Australian and State government scheme for carry-on finance at concessional rates of interest, with an extra $8m available if required. A total of $50m has been allocated for rural reconstruction. I have just touched on a few of the points tained in the Budget. I believe that the problems which this Government is facing are the problems faced by the governments of all the western nations. The Treasurer has endeavoured to steer a middle course-on e that does not go to excesses one way or the other. He has not tried bring down innation in one jump or to send it high in one jump. He is trying to take the middle course so that the programs built into the Budget will be allowed to take their course. We hope that in 6 months time we will see an the improvement in the present conditions. We have seen indications in a couple of industries they are getting back on their feet. I read article the other day on the textile industry. tion was made also of the building industry. These 2 industries are starting to get back their feet. We would hope that this upturn will continue and that in a few months time, by the beginning of next year, we will see a reduction the number of persons unemployed, a slowing down in the rate of inflation and a return to the stable conditions which the Australian people want. I feel that the aim of this Budget is achieve those ends and, for that deserves the support of all members of this House. I urge honourable members to support the Budget and to reject the amendment.",90
53,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"This productivity, Budget certainly will not receive my support. dishonesty and platitudes were discounted, the 75 minute speech by the Treasurer (Mr Hayden), the third Treasurer of this Government in 2Vi years, could have been deUvered in almost negative time. His parrot-like reiteration of patronising but rather lumpy opaque references to the performances, phUosophies and poUcies of the Government proves conclusively once and for aU to Ustening Australia that the Labor Party's initiatives are both sunbcatingly narrow and a recipe for lowering the quaUty of life of the Australian people. The Budget speeches deUvered by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) on the other hand were impeccable demonstrations of the responsibUity and the restraint that the Opposition beUeves are necessary if the twin associated problems of inflation and unemployment are to be conquered. Mr Sullivan-Ver y accurately said.",93
54,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for his pertinent interjection. In clear unequivocal statements, the Leaders from our side of the House detaUed the paths that we will take to restore Australia and the Australian conpeople to the dignity and credibility that Australia had until December 1972 both within similar to this country and overseas. We on this side of the House have fuUy recognised the part that private industry, with its emto ployment of three out of four of the work force, sky plays in our economic activity. Our plans are positive plans and not arguable propositions which cannot predict with any certainty that the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission and unions will accept that indirect taxes should be excluded from the consumer price index. In that the Treasurer's Budget, the working man has an been slugged with indirect taxes to pay for MenMedibank. He is slugged 4c extra for every glass of beer. As my colleague, the honourable memon ber for Fisher (Mr Adermann) said earUer today, the beer drinker, the worker in this country, will have to drink sarsaparilla because of the in imposts on him by the Labor Government. The working man wiU have to pay 6c more for a packet of cigarettes and 10c a gallon more for his petrol. Make no mistake; Medibank is not free. to Everyone includmg you, Mr Deputy Speaker, fact alone, it will have to pay for it. We are strongly and resolutely opposed to the Labor Party's preference for social welfare and wealth redistribution instead of production and and to its preference for irresponIf sible Government spending instead of the meaningful and rewarding jobs which we plan to give to the Australian people. We have spelt out in chapter and verse that the Budget is a sharpshooters' Budget which glorifies inactivity and inertia and, in effect, has lumbago in its bones. We of the Opposition do not share the blame for the fiscal errors of the Government. These errors are flowing on from the basic philosophy of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who said, when deUvering the Chifley Memorial Lecture 1975: We are not going to reduce expenditure. Obviously we must have economic recession, high interest rates and high unemployment if this is to be the starting point for framing the Budget. The Prime Minister stands condemned for making a virtue of irresponsibUity, inflation and unemployment. The poUcies of which he and the Treasurer are the principal architects are Ul designed and Ul equipped in this time of great national disaster. The most meaningful words uttered by the Treasurer in his speech- I found it very difficult to find anything of sense or value in his speechwere: There must be a community will to combat innation. But he did nothing in the Budget to encourage this community will. His speech therefore was a paradox. He forgets, or due to his socialist phUosophies he does not know, that community wiU is a tender flower that needs fertilising and encouragement, which we of the Opposition will give to it. Community wiU is not a stone to be crushed by the sledgehammer blows of sociaUstic ideologies. The sledgehammer of increased PayAs-You-Earn contributions this year of 43 per cent, or more than double the rate of 5 years ago, wiU mean for example that the young office manual worker will have more taken out ofhis or her pay to pay for the pipedream of the sociaUsts. The major beneficiary under the new tax schedules will be the Government with more tax being paid by fewer taxpayers. Mr Adermann-That is what the Government caUs restructuring taxation.",93
55,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,The honourable member for Fisher makes an inteUigent interjection.,94
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I remind the honourable gentleman that whUe interjections may be inteUigent they are also disorderly.,94
57,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"The Budget has as its aim the destruction of the will of the people to work and to develop. It has rewards for those who do not seek to increase productivity. It gives no incentive to private industry to take risks to get the heart of the nation-whic h is business, primary and secondary-pulsatin g with energy and drive, because it denies the reward for these efforts which is the improvement of one's economic environment. It is no wonder disciples of the Labor movement like the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS)- I do not know whether the Labor Party still claims him as a member of its movement-and Mr Bob Hawke have said that there will be another Budget in a short period and that unemployment will be of the order of half a mUUon at the middle of next year.",94
58,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,WU l we get another Treasurer too?,94
59,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"I am not worried so much about the new Treasurer because he will be from our side of the House. I am more worried about the school leavers who at the end of this year will not have a job to go to. We on this side of the House have highlighted some of the specific areas of neglect in the Budget. Unfortunately, we do not have 6 months to enumerate all those areas of neglect. No effort has been expended whatsoever in this Budget to contain costs. Costs of production will rise in all areas, across the board as it were, because of theflow-onincrease in fuel prices following the levy of $2 a barrel on crude oU, the increase of 80 per cent in postal charges and telephone calls, and the aboUtion of the petrol prices equaUsation scheme. The Labor Government has not heard the plaintive pleas of the workers of the outback towns and country areas whose basic food and household costs have increased due to the savage rise in petrol prices since 2 December 1972. My Leader, the right honourable member for Richmond, gave detaUs last week of the basic price of petrol in capital cities which for workers in rural towns and rural areas as for people everywhere else has increased by 16c a gallon since December 1972, making petrol prices a major factor in transport costs to and from the inland. This has added $40 a year to the cost to workers in rural areas of running their cars. It is appropriate to include in Hansard that petrol prices in Mt Isa have increased over and above the 16c a gallon mentioned by my Leader, by another 5.7c a gallon. At BirdsvUle, the price of petrol a gaUon has increased by an additional 24.8c. This follows the aboUtion of the petrol prices equaUsation scheme. We express concern that no longer are estabUshed procedures and practices to be continued. We accuse the Labor Government of taking the easy way out and of hiding its responsibUities behind the barricades of statutory authorities to shield it from the just demands of the public. The Government has created monsters which have no concern for service and which forever are concerned only with balance sheets. Where will this end? Already the drums of the Postal Commission are rumbling that a rise in the price of an ordinary postage stamp to 20c will not be unreasonable because of the amount of money that that Commission will lose if unions do not cooperate. Trade unions, many of which are irresponsible, are the fourth arm of government in Australia since December 1972. It is unreasonable to divorce the just demands of a service factor in postal and telecommunications matters. The Government has a solemn duty to fund part of any communications deficit because those who pay taxes and live outside the metropolitan areas can in all justice expect the national government to contribute to their welfare. There was no need for these mammoth tinuing increases in postal charges. They will be tributor to economic hardship for businesses professions and will strike right at the heart of the rural dweller who has to have his newspaper posted to him, who has to pay his accounts mail and who has to ring up his orders. He is like the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) who can ride around his electorate before breakfast on a push bike. The rural area is being victimised and throttled. However, we hope that time is on the side of the rural dweller and that system. before his position is beyond saving we will have a change of government which will have its priorities right. The latest public opinion poll figures prove beyond doubt that the Government is not trusted. It has caused the greatest gloom the political history of this country. It has glazed the truth. We, the ordinary citizens, are left ment the nation's economic excesses after ades of economic ease and public sanity. In the Budget the Government had a glorious opportunity to remove the festering suspicions permeating the nation but it did not grasp the nettle. It has become the herald of despair. What we term small business has not even rated a menUeve tion. The Government has done nothing to remove the iniquitous tax on the retained profit of small business. It has paid lip service to pany taxation with a reduction of 2Vi per cent a time when companies have all time low pronts and are paying very little, if any, tax anyway. believe in private enterprise, the owner-driver concept, which has been the real developing thrust in Australia's progress up the economic ladder. Overhead costs with wages ever spiralGovernment. ling, postal and telecommunication charges and fuel and freight costs increasing have made earning of adequate reward almost impossible. Obviously this is all part of the grand dream, the sinister plot. The sociaUst planners realise that their iniquitous philosophies have no appeal to the level headed Australian who is interested in developing this country and improving the quaUty of Ufe. Consequently they have resorted to artful and deceitful devices to strangle the people into submission by throttling their nnanciai bloodstream, and small business is the bloodstream of economic activity in this country-no t socialisation. Indirect taxes in the Budget plus increased postal and telephone charges are estimated to add 17 per cent to overall consumer prices in the December quarter of 1975. No wonder we on this side of the House are worried; no wonder we are concerned about the future of Australian society. No doubt these increases will have a coneffect on the wage price spiral if wage a conearners receive savage increases based on and increases in the raw consumer price index, including the effects of indirect tax increases. If this is the case, the CPI increase will lead through by wage indexation to wage increases which will not add to costs at atimewhen business pronts are already low and will tend to be passed on in higher prices. This will lead back to higher wages through wage indexation and so the spiral will continue. No brake is appUed anywhere in the SmaU business which will bear the full force of cost increases must be encouraged for social and economic reasons. Probably the two most imporin tant functions performed by small business are providing a means of entry into business for new to laindustries and new entrepreneurial talent and decproviding the basis for new large compames which will grow to challenge and stimulate established large firms.",94
60,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,And 42 per cent of Australian jobs.,95
61,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"Yes, 42 per cent of the Australian work force is engaged in this field. We bein freedom within the free enterprise system, although the honourable member for Sydney who is interjecting would not know what that commeant. Small business creates more jobs for at more Australians. It is estimated that unemployment at June 1975 will be 5.5 per cent of the We work force or half a mUUon people. To this we can add the high number of unemployed school leavers who will be unable to obtain jobs due to the unhealthy economic climate created by the We must remember that school leavers provide a natural growth in the avaUable the work force of approximately 2 per cent. SmaU firms have desirable social implications. They provide a productive outlet for the energies of enterprising, independent and sturdy people, the real Australians whom we represent who prefer to be self-employed. They embody the principle of freedom of enterprise and decentralisation of economic power. They are opposed to the sickening cancer of creeping socialism. Mr Sullivan-Bludgers .",95
62,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"As the honourable member for Riverina says, they are opposed to bludgers. hold firmly to the belief that these qualities of sturdy citizenship must be maintained and preserved and I submit that if some sacrifice in efficiency is necessary to ensure their continuation then these sacrifices by society must be made. We do not subscribe to the cavalier attitude of the Government which has not given this vital section even afleetingreference. It is to regretted that there is no recognised source of growth capital for small business in Australia today. The sum of $67.3m allocated to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority would be a good base to use as a catalyst to attract further funds for small business. Certainly this would be a lot better for us as a nation than those funds being used to satisfy the ego of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), who thought that there were petro-dollars around but found there were not any. He was like the bloke who put a feather in the ground thinking it would grow into a rooster. Whenfinanceis available to help the private sector, small business in industry and has generally received unequal treatment. No doubt potential borrowers often have difficulty demonstrating to nnanciai institutions that are a viable proposition or have reasonable munity prospects of continuing to be or becoming a proHouse fitable undertaking. However, the history of Australia shows that many undertakings have succeeded due to the get-up-and-go philosophy of the owner-operator, even though he has been given sewing machine terms-threepenc e down and threepence a week. There should be more of it for the young Australians who want to get out and develop Australia. Relief from the savage rates of tax on retained profits in private panies would provide, an internal source of finance but profits are probably accumulated slowly in the early stage of development to provide sufficientfinanceto accommodate the pressLeader ing needs of the very fast rate of growth in proof duction which is sometimes demanded by the market. Tax also has to be paid by the individual member of a small business while death duties cause special problems in familyfirmswhich are usually small businesses. The requirement to pay a substantial proportion of the value of the business in death duties makes it most difficult for the father to pass on the business intact to his descendants unless long term arrangements for financing the required cashfloware made or evasive measures are taken. As we on this side of the House have done on many occasions, I make a plea to the Australian Government to withdraw from levying death I duties, the most savage and iniquitous of duties. The amount of revenue raised this way by the Government is small but the cost of collecting it is high. The benefit of this money to the taxpayer involved would be of great significance. Management expertise is a problem with small business and I like the idea adopted by the Queensland Department of Primary Industry be with its extension services. The Department allocates a special sum of money to allow officers to go out and acquaint farmers with new techniques. I believe it would be an excellent incentive if the Government created a secretariat of established people who would be able to go out and advise small businesses on the best way to conduct their enterprises. Of course, we cannot expect much better than we have got from the present Government which is led by a Prime Minister who in his own arrogant and egotistical style on a recent television program told the truth for once when he described himself as an armchair economist. This is the Prime Minister of this country! It was rather strange to have a statement like this from the Prime Minister but at commerce least he was truthful for once. in Small business must be encouraged. In a clithey mate where the usual approach of the comis to be destructive, we on this side of the advance positive policies to help in this area because we are concerned at the viability of small business. We fund trade union colleges so why cannot we fund a secretariat to help small businesses? It would be doing exactly the same thing in a different environment. We are on the side of helping private enterprise in this respect, just as we agreed to help the leadership of trade union organisations in that way. We castigate the comGovernment for the lip service it is paying to overcome unemployment. How better could it be too done than by encouraging small business? I support the amendment moved by the of the Opposition, because if the poUcies the Labor Party are to be carried out in the full they will sound the death knell of the Australian quaUty of Ufe, which already has been flattened into the dust. It will be our job to pick it up from there. In particular, rural industry has not had any consideration whatsoever from those who occupy the treasury benches. I was most disappointed to read of the recent statement by Senator Wriedt. He is the man who promises the lot, but he is yet to convince Cabinet of anything. Mr Hewson-Sai d a lot, done nothing.",96

65,Mr STREET,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a very short statement in relation to something I said earUer today.",97
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",97
67,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I thank the House. EarUer today I said that the Minister for Housmg and Construction (Mr Riordan) had advocated people buUding houses of 6 or 7 squares. I have checked the transcript of what the Minister said and he did not mention 6 or 7 squares. What he did advocate was that perhaps people's expectations may be higher than their capacity to purchase and that therefore they should buUd a house with a capacity to add to it. What he said therefore was that due to skyrocketing costs caused by inflation people's expectations could not be reaUsed and they would have to be content with a lower standard of housing, with the standard of housing of the production Une type, not of their own choice or design. A reduction in standards was the essential point which I mentioned earUer today. I withdraw the reference to the Minister advocating houses of 6 or 7 squares.",97
68,Mrs CHILD,PAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has given the Australian electorate a very clear choice between the 2 major parties with his quite unusuaUy revealing statements in the House last Tuesday week. He reacted to this Budget by saying it was a complete confidence trick, an act of dupUcity and a tragedy that the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) did not seem to understand the economy of the country. However it evidently was not a big enough tragedy for the Leader of the Opposition to put his leadership on the Une by refusing to pass the Budget through this House. I would imagine that if the Opposition is going to oppose the Budget in this House it should also oppose it in the Senate, or support it in both Houses. We are well aware that innation is this nation's worse enemy. We aim to curb it, but we do not aim to throw away the great program of reform and change that this Government introduced into our community starting in 1972-the programs we have been following through steadily since in education, in community health, in social welfare. The Australian Government's record in aU these areas is widely acknowledged and it is enduring. We are not reversing this trend, but there comes a time when we have to consoUdate, pause and take stock of the achievements of the past and plan for the future. May I say that whatever criticism this Government attracts, there are 5 groups within the community who have cause to be thankful that at last they have a Labor Government. These 5 groups take in the sick, the old, the handicapped, the disadvantaged and the chUdren both in and out of the schools. These are the 5 groups to whom we have a governmental responsibility as well as a community responsibUity. Education expenditure by this Government will increase substantiaUy in the forthcoming year. In ourfirstyear in office we doubled it, and we doubled it again last year. We had to because the neglect of the previous years necessitated urgent spending. However the recurrent expenditure has again been heavUy mcreased this year. The States grants, do not forget, have also been increased this year to record levels. I believe it would be fair for educational lobbyists to start pressuring State governments to contribute more to education. We had and we have no intention of taking over the entire responsibUity for funding education. States have the control of the planning and the aUocation ofboth these specific grants for education and the budgeting for their own spending in this area. Since the Australian Labor Party came into government their level of expenditure has dropped considerably and is dropping year by year. They get more from us, so why do they not contribute more to education? At the same time they might have a look at cutting their own costs, especially their buUding costs. They might take a few tips from the nongovernment schools which manage to get far more value from the money we give them than the State governments have got for the money that has been given to them. This is a complete and utter waste of the taxpayer's money. In particular I would say that Victoria must have a good look at how it is spending the money it is getting from the Federal sector. Medibank, which was launched on 1 July, is included in Budget funding. I noticed that the former Leader of the Opposition was urging further cuts in Government spending and that he again made an attack on Medibank. He was folOpposition lowed by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) who hastily withdrew his attack. What they said is in line with Opposition policy of no protection for the 5 groups I mentioned earlier. We have opened a whole new deal for these 5 groups. We intend to protect that new deal. We stand behind the groups who need help. The Leader of the Opposition did commit his Party to reduced government spending, and he committed it in some detail. However I am far more interested in the detail which he did not give and the implications of his omissions. did not mention health, social security, education or pensions. I have been interested in listening to and reading the speeches on the Budget by honourable members opposite. The only concede honourable members who so far have mentioned social welfare are the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) and the honourable suggest member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar), who comLeader mented on this Government's insistence on financing an extravagant social welfare program. Social security, education and health are the traditional areas where the Opposition, when it was in government, always economised. Because they were not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition or other honourable members opeducation posite, do we take it that the Opposition endorses our policies on education, that the Opposition accepts the Schools Commission, our community health program, the hospital building program and Medibank? Do we accept that it would tinue public spending in these areas? Of course we do not. It is all too clear when we look at track record and it is all too clear when honourwise able members opposite did not bother to menthe tion welfare matters in their reply to the Budget. All those people dependent on social security, all those charitable and voluntary organisations who care for dependants should have a good look at the Liberal Budget alternatives. They the vulnerable ones. They are the ones who haveon been hit in the past. They are the ones without political strength. They are not mining corporsouth ations, insurance companies or rural interests with political might. They are the ones in jeopschools ardy. Honourable members might remember Mr Bury and his Budget of 1970-71. Remember that they were economically good times then. He said: We have avoided any significant acceleration in the domestic outlays-w e have chosen to pursue high priority objectives. In that Budget pensioners got 50c, so we know where the high priorities lie. The Leader of the criticised the increase in Post Office charges, the increased charges on beer and cigarettes. Mr Bury in his Budget did exactly as the present Government has done. These were the same areas that were affected. As a further criticism, the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Government's imposition of a special tax on coal exports, but he did not say, and he has not said, that the Opposition would not continue with it or the other measures I have mentioned. But I suppose the most amazing thing is his criticism of the tax rebates as introduced by He Mr Hayden in this year's Budget. The Melbourne Age points out in its editorial that the Leader of the Opposition's alternative is an elitist approach. What else would one expect? He does that tax rebates were needed because tax deductions were going to operate much too harshly on lower income people, but I would that the most interesting comment in the of the Opposition's speech on the Budget is recorded on page 522 of Hansard. He said: . . . This Budget is one more instrument to implement ' the Prime Minister's philosophy of making everyone dependent on government for basic services such as health, education and retirement. No single family unit can ever provide everything that is exactly necessary for the health and of that family. No single family can provide the equipment that is necessary for each member of that family. Families have to be helped by government provision of hospitals, of the services within the hospitals, and by the proconvision of schools, school equipment, school buildings and school teachers. Of course these its things are always assisted by government otherwe would not have the facilities. Previously provision of facilities for health services and education depended only on the ability to pay. As long as the earlier Liberal-Country Party Government was sitting on the Treasury bench are the type of education a child received depended geography. It depended on whether a person lived in the industrial suburbs, in the country, of the Yarra or north of the Yarra and it depended on a person's ability to pay. The in the western or northern suburbs of Melbourne were deplorable, but that was quite allrightbecause people living in those areas did not have the ability to pay for anything better. The schools in the southern or eastern suburbs would be better, the facilities would be better and obviously the retention of the teacherrate of student ratio would be better because these were much more pleasant places in which to work. Is the Opposition now suggesting that we cut spending so that we can go back to this type of education which depends on a person's ability to pay? This born to rule philosophy shows through very clearly in what Mr Malcolm Fraser had to say about people being dependent on government basic services such as health, education and retirement. Good health surely should be the right of every person who lives within the community, but as before with education, good health for 23 years had been determined by the ability to pay. It should not be so, but it has been. Does Mr Fraser want us to go back to the situation where, if a person has the money, health services are available to him and if a person cannot afford to pay then devil take the hindmost? This is survival of the fittest policy. It is also an extremerightwing policy. I noticed with interest that one of the cutbacks that Mr Fraser was advocating was the suspenshown sion of a $20m advance to the Australian Housliver ing Commission. I found that quite interesting because one of the earUer speakers, I think it was the honourable member for Deakin (Mr efficient Jarman), was bemoaning the fact that the torian Housing Commission needed more recognises money. Members of the Opposition cannot keep on putting and talcing. They have to make up their minds. Do they or do they not want to that $20m away? Even talcing in all the cutbacks that Mr Fraser is advocating, such as the capital advance to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, suspension of the Australian Housger ing Corporation, adandonment of uranium exdeficit ploration, suspension of growth centres and gram and area improvements, the selling of the pharmaceutical company which the Government has not even bought yet and the abolition of Australian Government Insurance Office, not as much money as he suggests will be saved. Where wiU the savings be made? Even with growth rate in the Commonwealth PubUc Service not much money can be saved. The saving will be made where it has always been made, and that is in the areas of the 5 groups I menthe tioned before-the ones which always have been deprived-the sick, the old, the handicapped, disadvantaged and the children and out of schools. The program wiU repeat itself. It is writsible ten in every Une of the speech that the Leader the Opposition made. There is a strong ment away to the right. This strong philosophy suggests that all people must look after themwhen selves, stand on their own two feet and be comthe pletely independent or faU flat on their faces stay there. It is a survival of the fittest philosophy. It would be great to think that everyone would be able to stand on his own two feet and would be able to provide for himself out of his own pay packet, but that unfortunately is a pipe dream. There wiU always be within the community those who need extra help. There will always be those who will be dependent. In fact if we look clearly at a community, even those of us who think we are independent are also interdependent each upon the other and aU of us upon the services provided by the community. As far as I am concerned the speech of the Leader of the Opposition gave warning to all within the social services area and in the area of community health. I would feel very vulnerable if I were a pensioner and was approaching a Budget under a possible Liberal-National Country Party government of the future. I would feel extremely vulnerable in regard to the amount of pension I would get. However our Budget has been brought down into the House and it has that once again this Government can dethe goods. Mr Fraser has shown that once again all he can do is talk about it. The new system of tax is simpler, fairer, more flexible, more and is in keeping with the Government's Vicsocial welfare programs. The Government that within the community there are groups which will always need assistance. Mr Fraser speaks of bringing in totaUy the recomtake mendations of the Mathews Committee. These would reduce company tax payouts by an estimated $ 1,000m. What then does the Opposition intend to do? Does it intend having a bigdeficit? Would Mr Fraser advise a bigger or more cuts? Speeches made by Oppoprosition members indicate a poUcy of cuts, cuts, cuts. I repeat that the savings will come from the same place from which they have always come. the Savings obviously cannot be made in thefieldof defence because every time there is a debate on defence in this House members of the Opposition a zero advocate greater expenditure. This Budget polarises the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and gives a clear indication to people of Australia what they are supporting when they support either the Liberal Party or the the Labor Party. This is a Budget in which the Government has made every effort to be responand yet still hold to its phUosophy of putting of people first. Having heard Mr Fraser speak last moveTuesday week I repeat that the Australian people must know exactly where they stand they are looking at the fortunes of either of main parties. The Labor Party stands where and it has always stood-firml y on a platform of social welfare and firmly in support of the principle that the people's needs come first. There is a complete polarisation ofboth parties following the two speeches, one from the Treasurer and one from Mr Fraser. Those who are voting in the next election should be under no illusions as the philosophy for which they are voting. The Ayn Rand philosophy comes out very clearly from Mr Fraser's speeches, both in the House and when he addressed the National Press Club. In fact I think the philosophy has been strengthened. It was always the philosophy of the former Government when it came to specific handing out increases for social security, for patriation, for sickness, for ployment beneiits to look at what was available and never to look at the needs. It always looked at how popular it was in the electorate. It is right wing philosophy and it is being re-endorsed and reaffirmed. It is a survival of thefittestpolthe icy. It rejects the philosophy of people being pendent on government for basic services such health, education and retirement. It is the same attitude as comes through when Mr Fraser says: 'In our view the Budget does not meet the problems that Australia faces. It does not adequately restrain government spending'. He obviously wanted a lower deficit. All persons should really be worried if they look into the philosophy that being expounded by the Opposition. The appeal is to individual selfishness, to individual greed and to individual independence. It takes no of the fact that all individuals are not able to independent. Mr Fraser's statement at the Press Club lunchtotal eon that the next Liberal Government will take strongly reassert the right of families and individuals to retain their own earnings so they can meet their needs 'as they seefit'-this his emphasis not mine-implicitl y says that we have the ability to provide for our own needs of our own earnings. I think that it further implies, and voters should take note of this, if a person cannot provide for his own needs out of his own earnings it is bad luck, he cannot expect a government to do it. That philosophy is quite foreign to what we have been putting fortheI strongly ward. I know that our pohcy of social cost a lot, but it has also provided tremendous viding a program to beatthe impetus in thefieldsof the sick, the old and the ployment and to restore confidence in handicapped. The costs have to be met. They ness sector. The Treasurer, claimed in his have to be met out of revenue. There is no way in which we can provide community services unless Speech they come out of federal revenue. This attitude or necessary philosophy that appeals to individual selfishness times. is something that should surely be rejected in reason 1975. There must be a sense of responsibility in each and every one in regard to making this Budget work, in regard to defeatingrisinginflation, in regard to getting back to full employment and, most importantly, in regard to the care and comto passion that we extend to those who cannot meet their own needs out of their own earnings. The Liberal philosophy rejects enforced equality in the work place, in the economy and in education. The Labor philosophy says there is one clear goal that the national Parliament should set for itself which should define and motivate every action that we take. I refer to the goal of reequality. As the Age remarked in respect of the invalid and for unemnext election: Battle lines are drawn and no one should be able to say afterwards that they did not know the gun was loaded. a We will move back into the 19th century if we put forward the argument that ability to pay is only way a person will have access to the destandard of living for which most people are as looking. We will move back into the 19th century if we accept that broad philosophy of survival of thefittest.I commend the Budget to the House.",97
69,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"A number of Government speakers in the Budget debate have referred to the fact that the Leader of the Oppois sition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Opposition members in commenting on the Government's Budget have not referred to certain areas. note Let me assure Government members that they be can take nothing for granted.

So one cannot anything for granted just because the Opposition has not commented upon a particular area. that I suggest to the honourable member for Henty is (Mrs Child) that any government, insofar as all social welfare benefits are concerned, should out sharpen up where the handouts are made.

In other words, they are making people more dependent on the Government. The day of reckoning has arrived. I think everyone would agree that Government of Australia is the largest business m the country. I wonder how many businessmen there are on the Government side of the House. It would be interesting to take a count just to what the position is because it is and it is a business that requires a great deal of expertise. Obviously, it is expertise that is not avaUable on the Government side. So often have heard the bleat from members of the Ausprice? traUan Labor Party that in 23 years of governin ment under a Liberal-National Country Party that Adrninistration this thing was not done or that thing was not done. Let me assure Government members that any advancement that was made that time was made well witlun the resources of Australia at the particular time, something that cannot be said of this Government today. Let us look at the statements of the Prime MmBecause ister (Mr Whidam) over the past 2 years. He has three been telUng the people of this country that inflathis tion has peaked and that there will now be a downturn in the rate of inflation. This has been spending. going on for over 12 months. He has been telling the people that unemployment has peaked and that there will be a downturn. We are all waiting for that downturn to occur. So far as the econing. omic crisis is concerned, he has been telling nation that we are about to cUmb out of the have trough. I ask honourable members to consider that. He said 12 months ago that we were about to climb out of the trough. It trough that I assert we will never climb out of under this Government. The Prime Minister's control credibUity has evaporated; there is no doubt about this. The people of this nation are trusting him less and less. I think this is obvious from the pubUc opinion polls that are taken today. I now turn to the Budget Speech of the Treasurer and wish to quote some of the more it. statements that appear in that speech. It is a classic The Treasurer stated: We expect that as the expansion of public sector activity is the opportunities for private sector expansion will though full responses to greater room for growth where it spent may taketimeto develop. I have heard Government members claim in this repeatedly that profits had been too high. In other words, they claimed that the private secshould be squeezed even further. Now we see that the private sector is to be given a chance. Treasurer continued: Furthermore, the big increases in spending on our programs in the past 2 years were needed to overcome decades neglect. submit to honourable members that no one I should have the gaU to suggest that this nation the was neglected for 2 decades. When we look at the mess we have in Australia today we can only come to the conclusion that in those 2 decades we had responsible government under a Liberalsee National Country Party Administration. Again, a large business the Treasurer said: Our reforms are enduring; they will not be reversed. Now we propose to pause to take stock of the achievements. we Good heavens. I ask: Achievements at what The answer is at any price. We have chaos Australia today. What is worse, of course, is the Government is still pursuing these costly reforms. Is the Government proud of the situation that we have in Australia today? Is it proud of the inflation, the high unemployment and the economic crisis that exists in this country? Let me go on a litde further to quote from this speech of the Treasurer: of the structure of our mixed economy, where out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in recovery phase. In framing the Budget, therefore, we have exercised the utmost restraint on Government Surely Government members recaU that over the last 2 years the Opposition has been exhorting the Government to restrain Government spendBut they have said, so to speak: 'No, we will the not do this. We will let itrip'.For 2 years they let the private sector stew in its own juice. Now, all of a sudden, we notice that the private sector is important. Let us lookfinaUyat these is a bottomless couple of sentences: Our present level of unemployment is too high. If we fail to inflation, unemployment will get worse. What a brilUant deduction. The Opposition told the Government that it would have to control unemployment by controlling inflation and, of course, by stimulating the business sector. But the Government sawfitnot to do anything about I think it is true to say that the most important factor today in Australia that needs to be controlled is inflation. I want to recall the history of innation in this country. Prior to the 1972 election, Australia's rate of innation was 4.5 per cent per annum. We heard at that time from the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), that Labor would not tolerate this situation, that the country could not Uve with a rate of inflation of 4.5 per cent. Let us look at the record of the Labor Government. In June 1973, the inflation rate was about 10 per cent; in December of that year it had risen to 13.2 per cent; in June of 1974 it was 14.4 per cent; and in December of that year, it was 16.3 per cent. Of course, in June of this year, it is 17 per cent. What of the claim by the Government that our inflation is imported? I suggest that it is a lot of ballyhoo. It is manufactured domestically. Let us look at the position in regard to our cheap resources. Our sugar costs us about one-third of the world price. We produce about 70 per cent of our oU requirements at about 25 per cent of the price of imported crude oU. Our coal is cheap. So it is rubbish to talk about imported inflation. It is not on, as far as Australia is concerned. Our cost of Uving has gone up by 41 per cent since Labor came to office 2Vi years ago. It is interesting to note that a Liberal-National Country Party dollar is now worth only 70c. It is interesting to note from the figures of the Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation that, with the exception of Great Britain, inflation is being cut back in most nations. I refer to the statement of the British Labour Prime Minister, Mr Harold WUson, which he made to the British nation on 21 August 1975, 2 days after the presentation of the Hayden Budget. He said: We have tight price controls, but there is a limit can be safely done by price control. Price control which manufacturers' and traders' profits to the bone can them into bankruptcy and cause further one reason why we cannot just freeze. I suggest that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be aboUshed. Competition ensures that prices remain at a reasonable level and that profitabiUty remains at a reasonable level. Of course, with profitabiUty will come expansion of business and more job opportunities. Unfortunately, Australia appears to be supping into the situation which exists in Great Britain. What impact wiU the Budget have on inflation? I suggest that it will mcrease the rate of inflation, indirect taxes have increased by over $700m. The new taxes and charges are expected to add more than 1.5 per cent to the December consumer price index. I move on to comment on unemployment. Once agam we have to go back in history and look at the situation in December 1972 and prior to that date. We were told by the Australian Labor Party, then in Opposition, that Australia could not Uve with from 60 000 to 120 000 unemployed. The figure fluctuated between 60 000 and 120 000 for quite some time. The Labor Party said that a Labor Government would not tolerate an unemployment figure as high as 100 000. If we look at the seasonally adjusted figures for December 1972 we find that 100 500 or 1.8 per cent of the work force were registered as unemployed. In June 1973 there had been a reduction to 89 100 or 1.6 per cent. In March 1974 thefigurewas 81 600 or 1.4 per cent. Then the rot began to set in. In September 1974 there were 145 900 or 2.5 per cent of the work force unemployed. In December of that year the figure was 235 000 or 3.9 per cent. In March 1975 it was 267 000 or 4.5 per cent. In May 1975 it was 270 000 or 4.5 per cent. In July of this year the number unemployed was 287 700 or 4.8 per cent of the work force. The comment of the previous Minister for Labor and Immigration, Mr Clyde Cameron, was that he would resign if his Government ever allowed the registered unemployed to reach 250 000. He did not resign. At that point the Government, too, should have resigned. If we included the 32 000 employed at the moment under the Regional Employment Development scheme, which is to be phased out, those employed under the National Employment and Training scheme, and those employed under the State Government employment schemes, the unemployed would be about 330 000 or 5.5 per cent of the work force. This is one of the highest rates in the world. The predictions, not just from this side of to what the House, are that the number could rise to cuts 500 000 or 8 per cent of the work force. In fact, drive unemployment would be worse than it was in the losses ofjobs: that is depression days. simply introduce a flat priceIf we look at the cause of unemployment we find that basically it is the problems which exist in the private sector. It is a vicious circle. Unless this Government sees that there is greater stimulation in the private sector, unemployment in this nation will not improve. There is no business confidence in Australia today. It is not, as we hear so often from the Government side, a case of the Opposition preaching gloom and doom. Unemployment is there. It is factual. There is no business expansion. I ask honourable members on the Government side whether they would expand if they were in business today. There are no incentives. As I go about my electorate I find that people have no trust in this Government. Why should one bother to expand one's business? The interest rates are too high. People in business cannot afford to buy money today. They have liquidity problems and escalating overheads and their productivity is down. I believe that the average Australian has to accept some of the blame because the rate of production in this nation today is appalling. The average worker must accept his share of responsibility. What does the businessman do? He rationalises his operations because he is motivated by self-survival. He puts off staff. His equipment is not replaced. He puts off expansion. His rebuilding programs are not undertaken. His expansion is halted or perhaps curtailed. I submit that this Government has betrayed the workers, the people whom it purports to represent, because this Budget is not designed to provide jobs. One of the problems I see today is that Australians might accept 300 000 unemployed as the norm. That certainly was not the case when the Liberal Party and the National Country Party of Australia were in government. I refer now to the position in relation to housing. It was commented on recendy by the President of the Building Workers Industrial Union when he said that only 16 per cent of wage earners or one in six were able to purchase their home. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) might take note of this. Let me assure the Minister that back in 1964 90 per cent of wage earners were able to purchase their homes. In 1974-75 there was a drop of 30 per cent generally in the home building industry. Mr Riordan-Who made the statement?",100
70,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"I cannot recall the gentleman's name. I shall get the article and show it to the Minister afterwards. We saw the abolition of the homes savings grant which assisted people, particularlyfirsthome seekers, to bridge the deposit gap. Some of them have no chance today under the present scheme. I know that a scheme for deduction of mortgage interest was introduced. But, quite frankly, this is of no assistance to those people who do not have homes today. This Budget has dropped 10 per cent or $69.lm from the allocation for housing. It has dealt a death blow to the housing industry and to people who seek to own their homes. Of course, the total Budget was increased by 22 per cent. I refer now to the defence service homes scheme. The Minister for Housing and Construction will realise that there has been a reduction of $7.5m in this area. With inflauon at the current rate the loss in homes built for ex-servicemen will probably exceed 500. I am completely bewildered at the Government's action in this area. There will be an increase in demand. The upper limit has been raised from $12,000 to $15,000. Ex-servicemen have been sent reeling in this operation. It is typical of the attitude of the Government to ex-servicemen and women. This was illustrated by the Prime Minister in his fairly recent attacks on the Returned Services League. I shall make a few comments on local government finance because it is important for those people who are battling in this important area of government. They have seen extra attention given to local government but with tremendous fragmentation. They now do not know where the money is coming from, how much it will be and when they will receive it. Money is provided under such schemes as the RED scheme, the area improvement programs scheme, the Grants Commission, unemployment relief for the States and the National Estate scheme and, of course, some funds are available from the Department of Tourism and Recreation. This is the dilemma that faces people today in local government in their attempts to forward plan.",103
71,Mr REYNOLDS,PAIRS,They had no trouble under the Liberal Government; they got none.,103
72,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"I have never denied in this House that the area of local government was neglected by the Liberal-Country Party Government. I agree with the honourable member for Barton. But the fact remains that at the moment because of the quest of Ministers to see how much can be spent in their areas the local government people do not know where they are going. A number of other matters could be referred to buttimewill not permit. Postal charges were cunningly conceived and announced a month before the Budget. These increases will hit those less fortunate in our community such as pensioners and people in receipt of superannuation. They will be vastly disadvantaged. I also want to refer briefly to the record deficit of $2,567m in 1974-75. This year the deficit is to be increased to $2,798m.",103
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,103
74,Mr NICHOLLS,PAIRS,"I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and to take this opportunity of congratulating the Treasurer, Bill Hayden on the introduction of his first Budget. I am confident that Bill Hayden, as he is a young man, will be inttoducing many Labor budgets in this Parliament. The Whitlam Labor Government is concerned with the welfare of the people of Australia. Prior to the election to office of a Labor Government in 1972 many discrepancies existed throughout Australia's social structure. Therefore there fell upon the newly elected Government the mighty task of adjusting some of the inadequacies meted out to the Australian people during 23 years of dominating, suppressive Liberal rule. The preoccupation of the Liberal Government throughout its years of office with the dog eat dog way of life left much to be desired for the workers, for the young and the aged persons within the community. In spite of the wishes of the majority of the people, an increasing commitment to Vietnam was developed by the Liberal Government. (Quorum formed) Our young men were sent to fight and often died in a war that was directed and governed by powers outside of the interests of the majority of the Vietnamese and Australian people- a war in fact that was perpetuated by capitalistic interests. Moneys that could have been used for the betterment of living for the people of Australia were used by the Liberal Government against our neighbours in a destructive and inhumane way. Millions of dollars were spent in Veitnam during the Liberal term of office, with only a minor percentage of those moneys being spent in a humanitarian way. In May of this year the Prime Minister, the honourable Gough Whidam, announced a contribution of $lm for relief work among refugees in Indo-China. This amount was additional to the $200,000 announced in March for the Indo China Operational Group of the International Committee of the Red Cross. This money assisted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in relief and rehabilitation projects for refugees in all parts of Indo-China. On 3 April 1975, during a statement to launch the Indo-China-Vietnam appeal, the Prime Minister spoke of the promptness with which our Government had acted to assist in the plight of homeless refugees. During a statement by the then Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable Bill Morrison, on 28 April 1975, the Acting Minister stated: Australia has brought more refugees out of any other government except the United States. Australia was one of the last governments to withdraw its embassy from Saigon. This was done in the face of endless rabid criticism from the Opposition which having involved the people of Australia in a bloody inhumane batde, could only offer platitudes and criticism for the Labor Government which was, as the greatest number of Australian people were, conscious of the depth of the humanitarian needs that dominated the Vietnam scene. With the drawing to a close of the Vietnam war, the homeless, sick, young and old struggled to survive in a country torn by 30 years of pillage, destruction and shackles applied by nnanciai interests geographically far removed from Vietnam. The war in Vietnam was, at the outset, a civil war. The real character of the war never changed. What did change was the nature of the fighting and the level of violence. With the change came additional suffering and violence due to one factor-foreig n intervention. The real result of foreign intervention-principall y the United States on the side of Saigon and Russia on the side of Hanoi-wa s to raise the level of violence and to increase the capacity for mutual destruction on both sides. Foreign intervention made certain that the end, whoever would win, would be as bloody as possible. On 8 April 1975 the Prime Minister stated: . . . after all these years, after all the blunders and bloodshed of 30 years, what tolerable or feasible objective can any foreign government set for itself except the ending of the war, except the ending of the killing as soon as possible. We outsiders never had the right to intervene. But even if there were such a right or even if it were right to intervene, would anyone now suggest that any foreign Government resume that intervention? If we have learnt nothing else in the last 30 years we have surely learnt this much, at a heavy loss to ourselves but at a terrible one to the people we claimed to be helping. The Australian Government tried to apply its resources to save Uves and to relieve suffering. With the drawing to a close of the war the main focus of attention in Australia as in other parts of the world centred on the chUdren living in chaos unparaUeled in history. It was the concern and the aim of our Government that eligible children be brought to this country for adoption by suitable famUies, this to be effected as promptly and as safely as possible. This indeed we achieved in the face of endless criticism laced with hysteria from members of the Opposition. Indeed, many were the members of this House who were beset by anxious, often deeply distressed prospective adoptive parents waiting to receive a Vietnamese child into their homes. The anxiety of these people was only heightened by the intense fear Vietnam than campaign fed through the media with no thought to the legaUties for adopting Vietnamese chUdren. The Labor Government was concerned not only that chUdren brought to this country should receive a warm receptive response from the proposed adoptive parents, but also that the future of these parents and the chUdren be free from any danger oflegal tangles that could arise should the correct procedure not be foUowed from the outset. Therefore, our Government was bound to require 2 conditions: That orphans be approved for exit from Saigon by the South Vietnamese Government for adoption in Australia; and that the States of Australia would guarantee that normal adoption procedures would be observed. On 23 July 1975 the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Government had decided to initiate a special survey of Vietnamese refugees who had settled recendy in Australia. He announced that the survey would take approximately 5 years, would be conducted by Dr Jean Martin of the Australian National University and would encompass such things as the refugees' reasons for leaving their own country; their social characteristics; their aspirations in their new homeland; what Australian Government assistance in maintenance and welfare they requested, or needed and received; the problems they thought they might have to face in settling in Australia and how these compared with the problems actuaUy encountered; the problems of culture and language difference that they had to face; what happened to their cultural identity in the process of resettlement; and to what extent, if at all, they suffered from racism. With no previous study of refugees Uving in this country, the task was made more laborious for the Labor Government. However, it should be carefully observed that this was thefirsttime that Australia had instigated with regard to racial origins resettlement opportunities for Asian displaced persons who were not readUy identified or connected with this country. Australia has worked closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and part of our Government's commitment to this world service has been to take refugees from Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. I ask honourable members to think well about the immense responsibUities associated with caring for homeless people. The Labor Government concerned itself firsdy with the humanitarian needs influencing the issues. Our country selected refugees who were least likely to be selected by other countries, people who did not have recognised skUls and who normaUy would not be eligible for entry to Australia, people who were caught in a morass of social upheaval and degradation, people given the opportunity-to use a good Australian expression-to have a 'fair go', which is something the Liberal governments during their 23 years of rule, were loath to give the vast majority of Australians. Indeed, the cry often went up from the populace during Labor's early months of office for the Liberals to give the new Government a' fair go'. It was well known how neglected our pensioners, health services, education and the many social agencies were within Australia. It took, however, a Labor Government to face and tackle these problems that had been so readUy swept under the carpet by previous Liberal governments. The task indeed was a formidable one, but the Labor Government tackled it determined to shorten the distance between the affluent and poor. I have already spoken of the enormous sums of money spent in Vietnam during that time when the proud cry of the Liberals and Country Party was 'AU the way with LBJ'. Did they ever consider the expense to this country, not monetary alone but socially too-effect s that were being felt throughout by young and old alike Uving in the lower income strata? Inflation, in spite of the Opposition's protestations, was born and nurtured during these years of Vietnam, bora and nurtured by capitalist interests in Australia and overseas. Theirs was not to reason, only to rake in the ever-growing pUe of the almighty doUar. It is a sad despairing fact that wars make profits for the few in this world. Indeed, there were those in Australia who did not want to see an end to the war in Vietnam because thenprofits would drop-as indeed they did. The working man in Australia paid-in blood, sweat and tears. The profits he reaped were often sorrow, grief, horror and destruction. So Labor, when elected in 1972, set about the mighty task of serving the people of Australia in a humanitarian way. Many have been our critics-no t all, I might add, from the Opposition. 'Too much too soon' got and still gets a popular hearing, although the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was heard to say on the eve of the Budget 'too Utde too late'-that from a man whose party was loath to give even a litde to those non-economic units in society, the old and the young. The Australian Labor Government has raised aU pensions and social security payments. At the same time the Government is improving the whole social security program in other fundamental ways. We do not believe that social security comes from cash benefits alone. In July, 1974 pensioners received their biggest increase on record-a n extra $5 a week. It was the second increase in 1974. Substantial increases have also been made in repatriation and service benefits. New benefits includmg free medical care for exprisoner of war have been introduced. Pensions now represent about 24 per cent of average weekly earnings. Included in the Budget of the Treasurer, Bill Hayden, are more increases for pensioners. My friend, the Labor Government, during its short time of reign has met, and I have no doubt will continuue to meet, hard criticism from our friends in opposition. The boys with the vested interests are against much of the Government's social reforms. However, this Government will honour its pledges to the people of Australia-the people who in 1972 gave the Labor Government the mandate to institute social reform. The Government has, since it came to power, substantially increased repatriation benefits and introduced new benefits for ex-servicemen. The Government has increased the subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act, now the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, from $2 for $1 to $4 to $1 and widened the scope of the Act to encompass accommodation for disabled adults. The subsidy was also extended to local government borrowings which were previously ineligible to attract a grant under the Act. The Government approved 2 increases in the maximum subsidy limits under the Act, and in April introduced a separate subsidy of up to $1,600 a unit for the acquisition of land. The 2 increases saw the subsidy Umitsrisefrom $5,200 to $7,800 for a single unit and from $6,000 to $9,100 for a double unit. With the introduction of the $4 to $ 1 subsidy these Umits rose to $9,360 and $10,920 respectively, plus a maximum of $1,920 a unit for land. I feel that local councils should be quicker to take advantage of this grant. Surely this would increase co-operation between the first and third tier of government-the money resources of Federal Government effectively linked with local knowledge and expertise of local government. Only in this way can the true needs of welfare of the people of Australia be met. In my electorate of Bonython 10 aged persons homes are subsidised. Grants approved since 1972 to these homes have amounted to $685,917, and subsidies paid since December 1972 amount to $350,032. Subsidies are paid as work progresses. I now turn to the Meals on Wheels subsidy. The Government has increased the basic rate of subsidy paid to Meals on Wheels services from the December 1972 rate of 15 cents plus 5 cents for approved vitamin C subsidy to the present rate of 25 cents plus 5 cents approved vitamin C subsidy, this operating from 1 July 1974. Concerning the Meals on Wheels subsidy operating from SaUsbury in my electorate of Bonython, the subsidy paid here as from December 1972 amounts to $10,469, with the number of meals being served per month approximately 1,400. In relation to handicapped persons' welfare, we have announced major new initiatives to improve services to the handicapped people and voluntary, reUgious and similar organisations caring for them. They include a free of means test incentive aUowance of $5 a week to all disabled people employed in approved sheltered workshops and an increase in the rate of existing capital and equipment subsidy to sheltered workshops and handicapped children's training centres from $2 for $1 to $4 to $1. Subsidies will be paid for maintaining existing buUdings and for rehabilitation and recreation facilities, inclurling hoUday cottages and camps. In the electorate of Bonython the Handicapped Person's Welfare Act has benefited greatly 2 caring services. Firstly, the Central Districts MentaUy Handicapped ChUdren's Association of Smithfield Plains has been paid a subsidy of $43,000 for capital buUding costs and equipment. This equipment includes a kindergarten and workshops. There is operating in conjunction with the Smithfield Plains estabUshment a rental hostel at Main North Road, Pooraka, again in my electorate. The rental for this hostel is subsidised at $1,250 per annum plus $1,400 per annum toward cost of salaries. There is one other area offinanceabout which I wish to speak, that of the financial assistance that my electorate of Bonython has received under the Regional Employment Development scheme. The RED scheme has come in for a great amount of criticism. However, when the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, the honourable Clyde Cameron, introduced this measure it was meant to provide jobs for unemployed people. This was effected most efficiently within my area. However, the total benefits covered a wider range than wouldfirstbe apparent The amount of money my electorate has received at this stage from the RED scheme is $4,238,926. I want to take this opportunity to thank the previous Minister for Labor and Immigration, Mr Clyde Cameron, on the marvellous way in which he operated this RED scheme. As I stated at the beginning of my speech",103
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,106
76,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"This has been a most important and Uluminating Budget debate; important because we stand at the crossroads of Australia's economic future and uluminating because in my short experience in this House this is the first occasion where the philosophic battle lines between those wbo espouse a true liberal philosophy compared with those who espouse a philosophy of socialism been drawn so clearly. We evening, for example by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), that the philosophy my Party espouses, and which was so adequately expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in an address to the National Press Club on 31 July last, is that we stand for policy of'survival ofthefittest'.I cannot but draw a certain parallel between the honourable member's remarks and those made by Henry Louis Mencken, a noted 19th century American editor, who no doubt at the time did not realise that there were female socialists. He gave the lowing definition of a sociaUst A man suffering from an overwhelming compulsion Ueve what is not true. I take this opportunity for the advantage of the honourable member for Henty and her the last colleagues to read into Hansard certain relevant sections of the speech made by my Leader to the created National Press Club on 31 July 1975. He said: Whatever have been the failings of the past, they should not be seen as setting a pattern ments. The next Liberal Government is already marking out a distinctive course for itself. The course is based recognition that social change is based on the recognition that the job of Government pursue poUcies which contribute to a sense of self-respect every person- a self-respect on which tolerance fulfilment can be built. He went on to say: The next Liberal Government will be individualist in the best sense of the word. Its vival of the fittest, but concern for the value of each I hope that the honourable member for Henty has marked well those words because that poUcy certainly does take into account the sick, the and the handicapped and it certainly will not through the policies of the party for which stand that any of these groups will suffer the way they have been forced to suffer in recent times due to the profligate spending of this Governthose ment and its poUcies which have done everything conceiyable to encourage the most incredible rate of inflation that this nation has experienced since the turn of the century. We are in every sense of the word almost bankrupt nation. Yet, at the sametime,Australia is known to be one of the richest states on this earth. If we are in this situation it is not as bers of the Government would have us believe, the because we are but a part of a world which is suffering from inflation. It is true that other tries are suffering from inflation. But other tries through the fact that they have had the courage to take the necessary decisions have made very substantial inroads both in terms of has their rate of unemployment as well as their rate have been told this of inflation. The Treasurer (Mr Hayden) in his Budget that Speech made the pomt that his Government had made every attempt possible to Umit the impact of what he regarded as extreme poltiical actions to overcome these major economic problems. a What he has not told us, however, is that in his help attempts to overcome these problems we have still found ourselves today in a situation where Australia has the highest rate of unemployment in our recent history. During the 1972 election campaign the then Leader of the Opposition-if folthe present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) had not made these remarks one could say that they to bewere made by the present Leader of the Opposition-had this to say: Do you believe that Australia can take another 3 years like 20 months? WUl you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week's blunder? Will you again entrust the nation's economy to men who deUberately and needlessly the worse unemployment for 10 years and the worse inflauon for 20 years? Mr Bourchier-Who said this? for future Liberal Govern",106
77,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,The present Prime Minison the ter. And to what statistics was he referring? is inevitable and desirable. It is to When these remarks were made Australia's rate for of inflation was approximately 4.5 per cent and and selfunemployment 1.94 per cent or in real terms 80 000 people. Mr Bourchier-What is it now?,107
78,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"The honourable member individualism wdl stress not surperson. may well ask what it is now. I will teU him. It is 287 666.1 would venture to suggest that that is not an accuratefigureas Mr Hawke and other members of the Australian Council of Trade old Unions have already pointed out on various be occasions because of the way the Government I has played with the statistics. The Government has gone out of its way to make sure that all of those receiving unemployment benefits, all of who are getting assistance under the Regional Employment Development scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme as well as aU of those wives or husbands whose other spouse happens to be working but a they are not employed are not counted as unemployed. I ask: How can we possibly accept that 287 666 is in any sense an accuratefigure?But if memthefigurewere twice or even half that the fact of matter is that there is no excuse for this country and for the people of Australia to have to counsuffer the economic dislocation, the fear and the coununcertainty which has been forced upon them by a Government which has said to the people on so many occasions and whose members have said to this House that it stands for compassion and concern. I ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young): Where is his compassion and concern for the waterside workers in his electorate who, as with the waterside workers in the port of Sydney, do not have enough work because there are not enough ships coming in and there is not enough trade? Is it any advantage to be able to stand on high as the Government does today, looking around at the ruins of its own creation? Tbis is what the Government has to consider because today the people country had expectations that the Government in its third Budget would have learnt from takes of its last 2 Budgets and would have had the courage to take real decisions which are necessary if this nation is to get out of the current crisis of the highest innation in Australia's tory and the highest rate of unemployment since the Depression. This is a crisis which is eating away at the confidence and the security of every citizen of Australia. Wherever I go in the city of Sydney I am asked: 'When are you going to get them out? construction When are we going to have a Government that Bendigo. we can respect? When are we going to have people in charge of the nation's responsibUities has with the courage of their convictions to take ever, decisions even if they are difficult?' After all, if we espouse to rule it is important that we have the courage to take difficult decisions as well easy ones. The Government has shown after 2Vi proposed years and its third Budget that it does not have gram the fundamental intestinal fortitude to make these decisions. Two weeks ago in this House the Leader of Opposition put forward an alternative economic plan. This is thefirsttime in recent years Opposition-and this was certainly not done the present Government when it was in Opposion tion- has been prepared to put to the people Australia alternative Budget proposals. These proposals are in fact a blueprint for the economic recovery of Australia. I wish to enunciate the proposals to this House so that they may be to recorded in Hansard and enable the people Australia to read them and not have to depend entirely on the dauy Press. I want to state prefrom cisely to the House the points that were made my Leader on that occasion. In terms of inflation and unemployment the basis of our poUcy is as foUows: The recommendations of the Mathews Kevin Committee report on taxation for and compames wiU be adopted over a 3 year period. I think it is worth pointing out that present Government had the opportunity, when that report was tabled, to accept its basic principles. It had the chance to bring in wage indexation, it had the opportunity to bring in tax indexation, and it accepted neither. Debate interrupted.

80,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT," I wish so to take up a matter which concerns the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly). I did advise hishim that I mtended to raise this matter in the House. It concerns the promise given by the Minister relating to the estabUshment of the Australian Government Office buUding in Bendigo. I refer to a letter written by the Minister on 30 March 1973 in which he said: I refer again to your letter of 9 February 1973, about the of an Australian Government office building in As you know, the Department of Services and Property already acquired a site in Meyers Street, Bendigo. Howon funher investigation, this site was found to be too small to suit the needs of depanments already located in Bendigo, and on the advice of the Department of Works an adjoining property is being purchased this year. as It is hoped that design work can commence on the offices so that they can be included in a works proin 1974-75. This would mean completion in early 1977. It is rather startling that we have not seen sight nor sign of the works drawings. Certainly not the even so much as a peg has been driven into the ground. Further-this leads up to something that that an the honourable member for Curtin (Mr by Garland) raised- I wrote to the Minister again 20 May 1975.1 note that the Minister has just of come into the House and I thank him for doing so. In my letter concerning the Australian Government Office buUding in Bendigo I said: On 27 February 1975 I wrote seeking advice from you as when it was anticipated construction of the Australian of Government Office in Bendigo would commence. So far I have not received one iota of a reply the Minister to that letter. That is typical of by the lack of consideration given by Ministers to correspondence from members of the Opposition. As the honourable member for LUley (Mr Cairns) says as he walks out, it is totally individuals unjust. I agree with him. We have come to expect this attitude from a the man who is the fastest talker in the House but who is the slowest to act. The Minister for Services and Property has quite a record apparendy for not bothering to answer his mail. Probably he cannot read it. It is a pity, because it is important to the people in the area who are relying on having this Australian Government Office building. When the Minister was a new Minister back in 1973 he did not have much correspondence and so was able to write letters. He did bother to reply to my letter; so I faithfully published his promise in the newspaper. I can assure him that I have faithfully published it just about every month since to make sure that the people of Bendigo know that he has failed in his promise. Unfortunately now, due to its poor management of the economy, the Government is forced to take restraint after having nearly bankrupted the country and we find that the building will probably never go ahead. Australian Government departments are spread all over the place and, instead of having one building in Bendigo with the photograph of Gough Whidam, the Prime Minister, in it, we have his photograph spread about in many places. That is a shame. The sooner the Minister puts up this building, even if only to get rid of some of those photographs, the better it will be for the people of Bendigo. It is urgent that this block of land, which is lying vacant and idle in the middle of the city, should have a nice building put on it so that all the Australian Government offices will be located in the one central spot, readily accessible to the people of the district. Perhaps the Minister will deign to answer my letter sometime.Incidentally, I have sent him another one today. Providing he is fortunate enough to be still here, I expect that some time after Christmas I will receive a reply. I turn now to the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison). I wrote to him some time ago, and I wrote to his predecessors, concerning the acquisition of land in the Puckapunyal area as proposed by the Army. This is a remarkable situation. I criticise my own Party for this, because back in 1940 the Commonwealth Government of the day, through the Department of the Army as it then was, advised all the landholders and the farmers adjacent to the Puckapunyal Army Camp, in the areas of Tooboorac and Heathcote, that their land would be required for Army purposes. It is interesting to note that 35 years later the land is still being required but none of it has yet been bought. Even if a farmer was a young man of 20 at thetimehe would now be 55. There is no way in the world that he can sell his land. He cannot dispose of it. He has to sit on it. If he becomes ill or if unfortunately he passes away that farm cannot be used for anything else and it cannot be passed on to anybody else. When the Liberal and Country parties were in power and again during the last 2A years I have l asked the Ministers concerned to do something about this matter. Surely to goodness when there is talk of restraint, cutting back on costs and spending money, it is logical that the Government should release this land and let the people on it have the option of selling or alternatively should give them an indemnity so that they can release that land to whoever might wish to take it over, with a guarantee of some years' coverage. There is no way at present in which the people there can get rid of this land. This is a tragedy. I am sure that even the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope), with his litde 20 feet by 20 feet block of land, would not like to be suffering as these people have suffered for so many years. Mr Morris-They should change their member.",108
81,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,Thei r member has been trying desperately for the last 2¥i years to get something done. The previous member had less luck than I have had. I can assure the House that I will be trying for the next 20 years while I am here. I hope that the present Minister for Defence wdl look at this matter seriously and will take some positive action to help the people in this area who are trying desperately to obtain some relief from this terrible problem that has been hanging over their heads for so many years.,109
82,Mrs CHILD,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to say a few words tonight about Medibank. We have heard a number of accusations about Medibank being abused. I would like to look at the situation from the patients' point of view. Honourable members know that the practice is to see a doctor and collect a prescription. But they may have to obtain a repeat prescription. It has been my experience that one calls into pick up the repeat prescription from the nurse and pay $1 for the service. That is fair enough. It is now being said that if a man perhaps has to collect a prescription for his wife who is home in bed he cannot collect it as the patient must collect it herself. It is said that this is a new regulation brought in by the Labor Government as part and parcel of Medibank and that doctors can no longer hand a prescription to anyone but the patient for whom the medicine is prescribed. That is patendy untrue. It is unfair. I hope the Government can get the message through to patients that it does not expect someone suffering from a heart attack to get out of bed, go down and pick up his own heart tablets. The Government has not altered the Act; it has simply altered the method by which one pays for the service. Another thing that happens with a minority of doctors-if only one doctor is doing it that is bad enough-is that when a person goes in and picks up his repeat prescription from the nurse she hands bim a Medibank form and asks him to sign it. This cannot be done. The doctor must see the patient. If he does not have a consultation with the patient he is in breach of the Act. He cannot charge a patient on a Medibank form unless he has seen the patient. This is also an offence against the taxpayer who is paying the bill, because all it is doing is lining the doctor's pocket by taking money out of the taxpayer's pocket. One other point about Medibank that has been drawn to my attention is that most pensioners are now being asked to pay their accounts at the doctor's surgery because doctors will not bulk bill them. I discovered in my electorate that several of the doctors say: 'This is because we want to treat all people alike. We want to give the pensioners back their dignity'. I do not know about that but I do not treat an old sick person in the same way as I treat a young, active, healthy person. Certainly, if I were a doctor and a pensioner came in, and I wanted that pensioner to pay on the spot, and I knew that that pensioner would have to walk perhaps three-quarters of a mile to receive a refund, I would treat that pensioner as an old, sick person and not expect him or her to walk that distance, perhaps in the rain, in order to get a refund on my bill. Sometimes the amount involved could be all the money that a pensioner has in his pocket or all the money that he has to purchase food. On the brighter side, I advertised in my electorate by letter in a newspaper for doctors who would bulk bill pensioners and/or other patients to get in touch with me. I was absolutely delighted at the response. I now have a list of the names of doctors who will bulk bill pensioners and also a list of doctors who will bulk bill body. I am advertising also in the paper for anyone at all who wishes to make use of Medibank as it was designed to be used to contact my office which will be able to supply the name of a doctor who provides these services and who is located closest to the person writing.",109
83,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week in this chamber I raised a very important question in relation to the decision by the Government to ignore the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission on superphosphate. On that occasion I virtually challenged the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) or any ofhis senior Ministers to say why they have ignored those recommendations. You will remember, Mr Speaker, that I made reference to the fact that, prior to the findings being presented by the IAC in relation to its inquiry on superphosphate, the Prime Minister refused to give any indication whether he would support the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty. Since the report of the Commission on that inquiry was presented, a few activities have been going on. I understand that the Government handed the report to certain departments which were to study it. Those departments were divided in their opinions on that report. Where there is a division of opinion, the Government appears to be opposing the reintroduction of the bounty. The only occasions so far as I can see when anyone from the Government side has made any reference to this matter since I spoke in this chamber a week or so ago were, firstly, a question asked by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) of the Prime Ministerthe question was a very loaded one, which makes one wonder to what depths the Government will go to implement its pohcy; and secondly a contribution by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Whan) who also tried to back up the opposition of the Government to the introduction of the proposals as presented by the Commissioners. First and foremost, I take a very grim view of the way in which it appears that Government members have organised themselves to denigrate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I refer to 2 questions that were asked, one in this House and one in another chamber, at almost identical times, both directed to the same point. The Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) answered in the other place and the Prime Minister answered in this place. This action makes one wonder just where we are everygoing. The Government established the Industries Assistance Commission. It has repeatedly said that the matter of superphosphate has been handed over to the IAC for its recommendation. But when the recommendation is presented, if it does not suit the Government, the Government ignores it. What is the use of establishing a Commission if no nodce is to be taken of its recommendations? Not only have its recommendations been ignored. We get statements from none otherthan the Prime Minister almost ridiculing the majority report of the IAC. Let me quote from the reply given to the honourable for Blaxland by the Prime Minister. He said that the Minister for Agriculture had given primary industry organisations for comment: . . . the report of the Industries Assistance Commission, not only Commissioner Robinson's admirably cogent rational repon but also the 2 colleagues. Mr Adermann-Who said that?",110
84,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"The Prime Minister made this statement. It is hard to believe. I can appreciate why the honourable member for Fisher queries this aspectThink of the situation: The Prime Minister sets up the Commission and appoints the 3 men to sit on that Commission. He says what a wonderful job Commissioner Robinson, who presented the minority report, did, and ridicules the majority report of the other 2 mem-is bers. I am moved to ask: Where are we going? I turn to the speech delivered by the honourPrime able member for Eden-Monaro. I have not time the rural sector to quote from it. He, too, has adopted the line of worry about people opposing the recommendations of the Commissioners supporting the reintroduction of the bounty. Therefore, in his mind, the primary ducers of Eden-Monaro should not be entitled receive any assistance by way of superphosphate bounty. Again I ask: How can we depend on this Government to give a reasonable decision on such matters? There is no need for me to spell out to you, Speaker, or to this chamber the difficulties facing certain primary industries at this time. We know, for instance, of the reports on the meat industry. I am rather perturbed to think that the Prime Minister has taken advantage of the by some individual members of the industry, calling themselves Cattle Producers of Australia, that they oppose the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty, to state virtually that members of the cattle industry are opposed to reintroduction. It is not unreasonable to expect that some members of the cattle industry are opposed to the reintroduction of the bounty not all cattle producers use superphosphate. They would no doubt be taking a very strong attitude because they believe that their competicommunity tors who do use superphosphate would get a trading advantage over them. I feel that I must raise this question once more tonight and again challenge the Government make its position clear. I read a report in one the newspapers to the effect that the Prime Mining ister or the Minister for Agriculture has again referred this matter to the various primary industry organisations for their views. If this Government had listened to any of the submissions put forward-suc h statements make one wonder whether it has-it would know surely that sufficient evidence has been submitted to prove that primary industry organisations support the and reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty. rather less convincing ones ofhis In my speech last week, I cited the actual cost of superphosphate when this Government came into office. It was less than $20 a ton delivered at the farm. Today it is approximately $70 a ton. I can recall the Prime Minister saying when he referred this question to the IAC that primary industry was looking up and that there was no need for assistance to be provided to it. All the time, primary production costs are increasing. As I said, the cost of superphosphate has gone up he more than 300 per cent. Now the Prime Minister starting to run away from his statement. We on this side of the House fully appreciate that the he Minister is running away from it because beUeves that he cannot get any support from of Australia, so why should he in that area? Looking at the recommendations contained in prothe Henderson report on poverty which was to tabled only last week, wefinda recommendation made to the effect that certain primary producers when infinancialdifficulties should be entitled to some assistance. I wonder whether the Government will take heed of that report. No doubt it Mr wiU ignore it as it is ignoring the report by the IAC. So I say to the Government that it is about all time it woke up and reaUy Uved up to its responsibUity to protect all sections of the community and not just those from where the biggest claim majority of votes for it come. I return to the question raised by the honourable member for Blaxland in this chamber and by a senator in another place in an attempt to its ridicule the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I do not care how much money the Leader of the Opposition was to get under the as superphosphate bounty. Are we to be governed in the future on the basis that because one person received more than someone else, the rest of the must pay the penalty? I know the Leader of the Opposition as a very sincere man. He has been accused on numerous occasions of being the wealthiest man in this place. WeU, so much more to his credit. If a man in his capacity to has thefinancethat all members of the Governof ment Party say he has, why should he be worryabout the few thousand doUars he might pick up from the superphosphate bounty? The Leader of the Opposition is fully appreciative of the fact",111
85,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,112
86,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT," I received a message in my office tonight that the office of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) had rung and said that if he was able to speak on the adjournment tonight it would be on a matter within my portfolio. Not being a mind reader or a clairvoyant I could not understand from a distance of a quarter of a mile what the honourable member for Bendigo was going to speak about. Consequently I answer him without any papers on the subject. I wondered why the honourable member who is generally quiet was so excited about this matter, but later I noticed that he had one or two very nice admirers in the gallery. No doubt he wanted to stimulate their interest in his type of speech which generaUy does not attract much attention. Therefore tonight I forgive him for the energy that he put into the speech, for blood pressure he raised and for the bitter and personal attack he made on me. Mr Adermann-Where are your admirers?",112
87,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT,"The many millions listening to me reaUse my value. The honourable member for Bendigo is behind in his homework. Had he read the Administrative Orders which are published regularly in the Australian Government Gazette he would have known that the matter he talked about was no longer under my control. For some time it has been in the portfoUo of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). Consequently, if the honourable member wrote a letter to me today on this matter he has wasted 18c because it has gone to the wrong Minister. He wants to bring himself up to date on parUamentary activities. He is sitting here aU day as the Liberal Party Whip and has extra staff in his pay, yet he does not know what matters come within the portfoUos of the Ministers to whom he writes. It is not for me to educate him so let him apply himself to the task for which he was elected. Let me bring him up to date. I handle the toral affairs of this country as the Minister for Services and Property. In addition I handle the services provided to members, Ministers, office holders and others in that category, as well as the affairs of the Australian Fire Board and the Australian Purchasing Commission. In my spare time. I act as Leader of House. So I have a reasonably fuU task from day to day without having to come in here to be bitterly attacked on the adjournment debate about a matter that is not within the confines of my portfoUo. It is interesting to note that the honourable member has withdrawn from the chamber after the cowardly attack that he made on me. He probably knew at the time that it was a false charge. He would know that being a very sensitive person I would stay awake for a long time pondering over what he had said. I regret that he had to raise this matter, but I will discuss it with my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. I suggest to the honourable member that he bring himself up to date with what is happening so that he will know where he stands. It is not amazing that a member of the Party which has led the band demanding a restriction of government expenditure is tonight clamouring for the spending of pubUc funds on a government buUding in his electorate? He does not give a hang about the economy when he is involved. He wants the Government to spend more mUlions of doUars whUe his leader is crying every the day about the huge amounts being allocated for government spending. Honourable members opposite never make up their minds. The situation is that the honourable member wants this expenditure, but at the same time he says that the Opposition could reduce the Budget deficit. The whole thing is contradictory. Had the honourable member told me in detail what he was going to talk about tonight I would have perhaps been more enlightening, despite the fact that the matter is not within my portfolio. I would have checked the matter as far as it went with me. I assure him that any further correspondence to me on this matter is just wasting very valuable postage, for the simple reason that the matter is no longer within my portfolio. I want to deal for a few minutes with the tears shed by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King). He cried tonight about the poor Leader of the Opposition because he received only $50,000 out of the superphosphate bountytbis struggling farmer on his $2m property who sits and thinks about low cost housing and the pUght of the poor underprivUeged. He gained only $50,000 from the superphosphate bounty elec- and this dreadful Government is not going to continue his subsidy. Why, he has a farm as big as my electorate and it is worth millions of dollars, as honourable members know. Yet here is a member of the National Country Party crying because the bounty is not being given to him. How many more like the Leader of the Opposition coUected $50,000 from that fund? There were many thousands of them. The real fault with the scheme was that the small farmers and others were not getting the benefits, that they were going to the wealthy people like the Leader of the Opposition. Why does the Leader of the Opposition not come into the Parliament and defend himself? What is the good of putting up second raters defend him when he is under a great charge this? Why does he not stand in the Parliament and say precisely whether he got the subsidy whether he did not? If he was as charitable as makes out and wanted to do for the poor people the things he says he wants to do he would not take this money; he would give it the situation is that the Country Party, the Leader of the Opposition and others-ther e are thousands of them in the same position as the in Leader of the Opposition, wealthy and powerful men in the farming community-ar e raking it in thousands at the expense of the small farmers and others. That is what the honourable member for Wimmera is defending in the Parliament night. The honourable member should not solicitors, attack the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating); let the Leader of the Opposition stand in this place and defend himself if he can. The fact is that he has no defence. He has the $5,000 a year from the superphosphate bounty and it no good him trying to explain it away because is the classic case of a person who should not benefit from this kind of bounty. Can we not weep tears of blood when we think of him sitting on the verandah on that million dollar property crying about losing the $5,000 subsidy? Where is it all going to end? By heavens, tliink that honourable members could get up defend this kind of conduct under the guise of seeking assistance for the farmers. It is difficult understand. The honourable member for mera says that he is another who wants to cut should go. down expenditure. He says there is too much spending in the community, but this is not so nation. where the cockies are concerned. The more the Government can give them the better, no matter who else goes broke. The honourable member is advocating increased expenditure at a time when he says government expenditure should be cut down. A report has been made on this matter and probably its recommendations will affect the Leader of the Opposition and a few others, but certainly I will not stay awake at night crying over the likes of the Frasers who have lost to $50,000 when they can afford to pay that much like into the bounty fund themselves. Instead of defending this kind of subsidy the honourable or member for Wimmera should be shedding a few he tears for the poor fanners-and there are many of them-and those such as the fanuly farmers who really need assistance. They are the ones to back. However, be concerned about. The men controlling the Country Party work Pitt Street in their business places. They live at Wahroonga, Rose Bay and Bellevue Hill. If we off went through the Country Party members with a fine tooth comb I doubt whether we wouldfinda farmer or grazier among them. At one time. I towent through them and found auctioneers and but I could not find a farmer. The members of the Country Party in this House are distant from the farms and consequently have lost contact altogether with the poor farmer, the farnily farmer and the man who really needs is assistance. I suggest to the honourable member he for Wimmera that he should not stay awake at night crying over the Leader of the Opposition. He can afford a lot of $50,000s. I would be cjuite prepared to give that much away if l could sit on the verandah of that million dollar property looking at those lovelyfieldsand thinking that the Government subsidises me in addition to to what I make myself. There is no need to cry all and night about such people. The honourable member should spend his time looking after the famto ily farmer, the small farmer and the poor farmer, Wimthose to whom the superphosphate bounty Mr King- I wish to make a personal expla",112

96,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)and(2). A. Mainland and adjacent Islands Landings Reported during 1974 Date Location 3-9 April One Arm Point Setdement 2 Sept. Cape Leveque, Talboys Point 4 Sept. Truscott Peninsular 19 Sept. One Arm Point Settlement, Sunday Island, Swan Point, (Note 2) Bulgin Settlement, Cape Leveque, Cascade Bay 30 Sept. Troughton Island, Freshwater Bay, Mary Island 9 Oct. Browse Island Notes 1. Five Indonesianfishingboats containing shellfish sharkmeat were intercepted in sea. 2. R.A.N., Customs, Quarantine and Western Australian Department Fisheries officers contacted fishing boats and these were then escorted out of Australian waters. 3. Fishing vessels left the was made, out R.A.N. contacted thefishingfleet later. No landings were reported during 1973 and 1975. B.Off-Shore Reefs Ashmore, Scott, Cartier, Seringapatam and Rowley Shoals, 200-400 miles off-shore, have been used traditiondeprived ally by Indonesian fishing vessels to replenish water supplies. This arrangement was formalised in an success. instrument of understanding between the Indonesian and Australian Governments in 1974. My Department has no records of landings on these reefs over the However, in July, 1974 a report was received from HMAS Diamantina that Indonesians were a base. The matter was investigated and I refer the honourable member to my answer to his Quesdon 1032 (Hansard of 3 October 1974 pages 2256-7) for the details. As to any other incidents, the Austrahan Minister for Agriculture has a responsibiUty for matters concerning Ulegal fishing operauons by foreignfishingvessels may be able to provide information on what interceptions if any have occurred in this area for illegalfishingduring . the past three years. As a result of the reported landings during 1974 a combined surveillance operation (Operation Trochus) was introduced. Since April, 1975 when this operation became effective approximately 580 sightings have been made of nativefishingvessels on or in the proximity of the abovenamed reefs. It has not been possible for the crews (Question No. 2564) of reconnaissance aircraft to positively identify each small nativefishingboat and undoubtedly the same vessel has been repeatedly reported during its course to the off-shore reefs. No substantiated reports of landings on the mainland adjacent island during the past three years refer to animals accompanying the fishermen. However, during the course of the present surveUlance operation one pet hen has been found on two of the ships boarded by RAN personnel the at sea near the off-shore reefs. Development Assistance . (Question No. 2725)  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister said that the Government's aim is to provide 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product as developReport ment assistance by 1980? Confirmed (2) If so, is this still the Government's target for development assistance? No No (3) What was the rate of increase in development assist(Note 1) ance in each of the calendar years 1973 and 1974? No Mr Whitlam - The answer to the honourable Yes member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Yes (Note 3) (3) 1973 Decrease of $21.9m or 9.8 per cent; 1974 No Increase of $97.1m or 48 per cent. An uneven distribution of expenditure on a calendar year basis is caused by the timing of expenditure within financial years. The rate of increase in development assistance in financial year 1973-74 was 19.2 and per cent ($41.9m) and in 1974-75 was 25.8 per cent the area and escorted to ($67.4m).

Fisheries Research (Question No. 2935) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Science and and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact, as reported, that the Austrahan Governauthorities, ment is planning to spend millions of research work being done by the New South Wales Government (2) Is the CSIRO's trawler Courageous stationed in ney to carry out the same work as that which is being earned out by the New South Wales State Fisheries' vessel Kapala; if so, why. (3) What other studies can be carried out by Courageousin which could not be carried out by the Kapala. (4) Did the Courageous cost $700,000.",116
98,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that: (1) The research in question long-term program of assessment of Australia's demersal and pelagic fishery resources-that is, open sea fisheries off the Australian coast. It has always been CSIRO's policy to conduct original studies, and the Organisation will not unnecessarily duplicate research carried out by any other authority in its program on the fisheries of south-eastern Australia. That program has been developed with the approval and cooperation of the appropriate committees and subcommittees of the Standing Committee of the Australian Fisheries Council, on whichfisheriesauthorities of all States and the Australian Government are represented. The relevant committees and sub-committees are the SouthEastern Fisheries Committee and its Trawl and Pelagic Fish Research Group. The last named Group was formed in mid-1974 specificaUy to co-ordinate research and development programs on trawl and pelagicfisheriesin south-eastern Australia, and has discussed CSIRO's proposals on several occasions. It includes representatives of fisheries authorities in all south-eastern States. (2) Courageous will be based in Sydney because CSIRO's Division of Fisheries and Oceanography has its headquarters there and the necessary technical services-includin g the vices of CSIRO's own electronics technicians-ar e readUy available there to ensure satisfactory instaUation, and maintenance of the sophisticated equipment she will carry. After the initial shakedown period, however, Courageous will operate over a large area in the Tasman Sea carrying out work complementary to that of State fisheries and wiU make use of any convenient port with dollars duplicating adequate facilities. (3) Courageous is a considerably larger vessel than Kapala--350 versus 225-tons-and has the capacity for Sydlonger and more extensive cruises. She can accommodate 14 crew and scientists adequately to sustain a round-the-clock operation without returning to pon for several weeks. The basic pattern proposed is 21 days at sea followed by a week pon, with of course longer times in port for periodical overhaul. It will thus be quite feasible to operate anywhere from Brisbane to Hoban even on those occasions when it is necessary toreturnto Sydney between cruises. The abUity to stay at sea for extended periods will make it possible to work up to SOO mUes off-shore and thus to study true open oceanresourcesas well as those on or over the continental shelf. is a further step in CSIRO's The other significant difference between the two vessels is that Courageous, unlike Kapala, will be equipped to generate an estimate of the weight and number offishunder her swept path by having a computer interpret the signals received from two echosounders. This interpretation will be supplemented by netting and other forms of fishing to identify the kinds offishbeing enumerated. Finally, the ship will be equipped to do basic environmental work including temperature and salinity profiles and plankton tows. CSIRO's forward planning includes the possibUity that Courageous may spend the 1977 calendar year on a survey off the nonh-western coast of Australia, where a major fisheryresourceprobably exists. Apan from the possibUity that Courageous may locate offshorefisheriescapable of supporting a major new industry that might, under favourable economic circumstances, compete with imponedfish,fishmeal and otherfishproducts, there is an urgent need to obtain information about Australia's off-shore marineresourcesbecause of the proposal by the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea for the estabUshment of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. This proposal has been accepted in principle by almost serevery Conference participant. If finally adopted, Australia will be responsible for the management of marine resources operation, within the 200-mile zone around her shores. (4) Courageous is privately owned and is under chaner to CSIRO for three years, fully crewed, maintained and serviced, at a cost of approximately $440,000 per annum, subject to rise and fall adjustments after June 1976.",117
