3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and At to r n e y - G e n e r a l) [ 3 . 5 ] H is Excellency the Governor General has received from H is M a j e s t y the K in g , t h r o u g h the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the following message: To MY PEOPLEAt this grave moment in the struggle between my people and a highly organized enemy, who has transgressed the law of nations and changed the Ordinance that binds civilized Europe together, I appeal to you. I rejoice in my Empire's effort, and I feel pride in the voluntary response from my subjects all over the world who have sacrificed home, fortune, and life itself in order that another may not inherit the free Empire which their ancestors and mine have built. I ask you to make good these sacrifices. The end is not in sight. More men and yet more are wanted to keep my armies in the field, and through them to secure victory and enduring peace. In ancient days the darkest moment has ever produced in men of our race the sternest resolve. I ask you, men of all classes, to come forward voluntarily and take your share in the fight. In freely responding to my appeal you will be giving your support to our brothers who for long months have nobly upheld Britain's past traditions and the glory of her arms. GEOBGE R . I . To that the l a te G o v e r n m e nt asked H is Excellenc y to despatch the following reply: I feel confident that Your Majesty's Message will evoke patriotic response from the people of the Commonwealth and will tend greatly to Clerks, augment the ranks of the 160,000 Australians who have already provided an assurance of the whole-hearted co-operation and determination of Australia to carry the war to a successful issue. ADJOURNMENT. CONGRATULATION TO MINISTERS - MESSAG E FROM THEKING - PERSONAL EXPLANATION-GERMA N TRADE MARKS-TRAD ING WITH THE ENEMY-APPOINTMEN T NA - TELEPHONE REGULATIONS. Rules Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-Prime Minister and At to r n e y - G e n e r a l) [ 3 . 6 ] In order that new Minister s m a y have a n o p p o r t u n it y of becoming acquainted with the i r D e p a r t m e n t s, and considering w h at legislation is necessary at the present j u n c t u r e , I ask honourable members to consent to an adjournment of the House u n t i l tomorrow, and I move That the House do now adjourn.",5
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Parramatta) [3.7] - I offer the heartiest congratulations to the honourable member for West Svdney on his acceptance of the highest position in Australian politics, and I believe that every man on this side is of opinion that it is one that he has well and rightly won. The honourable gentleman may be assured that there is no tinge of personal feeling on this side against his acceptation of the office of Prime Minister. I hope that we may find it , at least, as pleasant to work with him in his new capacity as it was in his old, and he may be assured of all the help that we can give to him in the discharge of his high and,' at the present time, particularly onerous duties. The other Ministers, too, I cordially congratulate, wishing them good health, good luck, and strength for the discharge of their duties. May we hope that their accession to office may lead to an even more efficient discharge of M in isterial functions, to the benefit of the country as a whole.",6
5,Mr KING OMALLEY,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"He a r , hear! Mr JOSE PH COOK - We welcome the prodigal home again-hom e to the Home Affairs Department. supposed that now a good many things will be quite right, including the famous digest, which has earned for the honourable member the encomiums of the expert who has been investigating the business management of the Department. The appeal from the K in g, which has been read by the Prime Minister, has been heard, I imagine, with somewhat eager and mixed feelings, and I wish to express the fervent hope that my honourable friend will think well over it with in the next few days, and see if he is doing all he can, in view of his political intentions for the immediate future, to give effect to that appeal in the most wholehearted and efficient way. Mr J . H . OATTS (Cook) [3.10] - I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to make a personal explanation. When the House adjourned some few weeks ago I was absent because of illness. I had not been able, unfortunately, to attend for some days, but the present Prime Minister, then Acting Leader of the House, moved that I be granted leave of absence "" on account of urgent private businesa."" That statement was the result of a misunderstanding. I had written to the secretary of the party, and had telegranhed to the Government Whio that I was sick. I make this explanation because, as I was one of those who objected to the House adjourning at the time, it might seem peculiar that I could not. attend because of urgent private business at a time when I was protesting against the proposed adjournment. The fact that I was sick probably was not brought under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister, and his statement was made under a misapprehension, but I thank him for the precaution he took in my behalf.",6
6,Mr KELLY,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Wentworth) [3.12] - The Prime Minister's predecessor has expressed his approval of the principle of endeavouring to nrevent the continuance of German trade names, and the use of German trade marks, in Australia during the war. I wish to ask the present Prime Minister whether, in his capacity as At torney-General, he will look into the licence that has been given to certain gentlemen with German names to continue the use of the German trade description "" Aspirin "" during the currency of the war. It may be Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [3.13] - Touchin g on the question raised by the honourable member for Wentworth, I should like to point out that in the opinion of the chemists and druggists of Australia-and their opinion on such a matter should be entitled to great weight - by issuing licences to certain people to manufacture aspirin and other patent medicines under their old trade names, we are perpetuating in Australia the German trade names that we do not desire to be continued.",6
7,Mr KELLY,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,We are keeping alive the trade for them.,6
8,Mr MATHEWS,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Exactly . I join with the honourable member in asking the Prime Minister to seriouslv consider the position. There are many ways out of the difficulty. This objection applies not only to aspirin, but to veronal and a number of other patent medicines, the constituents of which are well known. We might ' give to aspirin some Australian name, under which it could be manufactured and sold here, and become widely known.",6
9,Mr KELLY,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"English , and Australian equivalents ef aspirin are being sold today.",7
10,Mr MATHEWS,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"That is true. My reason for suggesting the giving of a new name to this drug is that great importance is attached by many people to a particular brand or name, and that they seem to think that aspirin is the name of the sole constituent of this patent medicine. I hope my suggestion will be adopted.",7
11,Mr WATKINS,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Newcastle) [3.15] I wish to bring before the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a matter of some urgency. I refer to the fact that officers are being sent away in charge of troops from New South Wales in preference to others who have attended a school of instruction, who have passed the necessary examinations, and who have had previous experience. The officers who are being sent away have not passed any such examination, have never been in camp, and cannot drill the men on the green. This is a serious state of affairs, and has arisen for the second time in connection with the departure of contingents from New South Wales.",7
12,Mr BOYD,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,The same thing is occurring here.,7
13,Mr WATKINS,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,The young men in the camp to which I refer feel that they are going into danger under leaders who are not fit to lead them. That is a serious situation.,7
14,Mr CHARLTON,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"The same remark applies to a lot of naval officers, who have not had previous experience.",7
15,Mr WATKINS,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"That may be so; if the honourable member's statement is correct it serves to make still more serious the position which I have explained. It is time this matter was taken up seriously by the Ministry. We have lost many lives, and probably many more will have to go, but for Heaven's sake let our valorous Australian soldiers have a chance of being led by men who know the game. I have before me the facts relating to a case where competent officers, who had drilled the men and brought them to a state of efficiency, were superseded by others who could not nut the men through "" f o u r s "" on the green. It is a positive scandal, and should be rectified at the earliest possible moment.",7
16,Dr MALONEY,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Melbourne) [3.16] I have much pleasure in endorsing the remarks made by the honourable member for Newcastle. Undoubtedly, fair play is not going on at the camps. Men who know their work are being ordered about by young officers who do not know their duties. Further than that, in this time of stress and trouble I wish to raise a note of warning in regard to the expenditure that is taking place. I do not think it is the desire of the people of Australia that public servants, whether in the employ of the State or the Commonwealth, should receive double pay on entering these military camps-thei r pay as soldiers as well as public servants. Unless care be exercised in this respect, great expense is likely to be incurred in connection with the appointment of officers. As to the statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth regarding the continuance of German trade names in Australia, I think it an infamy that such a state of affairs should be allowed to continue. This Parliament can require that every patent medicine shall have its formula shown upon its label. Such a provision would be welcomed by every medical man and chemist throughout Australia, and would also prevent the people being robbed and plundered as they are by the unjust prices charged for many patent medicines. The Minister .of Trade and Customs did good service in reprinting the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in regard to secret remedies. The House, at the instance of the Minister, ordered that report to be reprinted and circulated in Australia. I hope that every Australian who loves the land that has given him his language, if not his birth, will say, "" From this time forth I shall never buy a thing made by Germans or imported from Germany.""  we adjourned I find that a new regulation with respect to telephone charges has been promulgated. Will the Prime Minister, before the proposed adjournmentsafford the House an opportunity to discuss the regulation, seeing that it is of such moment, not only to one State, but to the whole of the Commonwealth?",7
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"It ought never to have been made. M T. PAGE - That is my opinion, but, at any rate, I ask tfce Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to debate the regulation.",7
18,Mr HUGHES,OF OFFICERS INEXPEDITIONARY FORCES,"Prime Minister and Attorney-General-Wes t Sydney) [3.20]. - T-In reference to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa, I can only say that it is the intention of the Government to ask the House, so far as concerns the business it is intended to 'bring forward, to adjourn on Priday week. It therefore follows that whatever is to be done must be done in that time. Honourable members will be able to ventilate the matter on Supply, and I do not think that any further opportunity is required, so far as that is concerned. The question of German trade names raised by several honourable members is not quite so simple as it might appear. There are some names that offer no difficulty, because they are only trade marks on sufferance, and, as a matter of fact, any parson can use them with impunity. All are, however, not of this kind. I granted a licence to two Australian chemists to manufacture and sell aspirin after it had been demonstrated that their product was the purest on the market, and fulfilled absolutely the requirements of the British pharmacopoeia. I think that if aspirin were sold under any other name', it would be a long time indeed before the people would accept the drug under the new designation. Whether that be so or not, that is the opinion of medical men. Such a disability does not apply to goods in general, hut to a large extent it applies to drugs. A test case is now being beard by the Commissioner of Patents in regard ' to sanatogen, and I shall be . largely guided by the decision in that case as to the formulation of a general rule to apply all round. Broadly speaking, however, the Government's policy is by every means to . substitute Australian or British goods and names for German goods and names. I might mention that by an order recently promulgated it will be possible to prohibit the importation of certain classes of goods, which, under the law as it stood, we were compelled to admit. With the power we have now, I think we can deal with enemy trade sufficiently, providing we have the co-operation of the people of the country; but' I do complain, and with good reasons, of a tendency on the part of some people to still purchase, and to insist on facilities being given to purchase, enemy goods. Question resolved in the affirmative. Honse adjourned at 8.26 p.m.",8
