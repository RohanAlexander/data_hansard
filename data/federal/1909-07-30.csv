Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) [10.31]. - An article, written by some person connected with this House, has just been published by the South Australian Advertiser. In it my name occurs frequently, and most of the references to me are absolutely incorrect. I shall not refer to these passages in detail, but I refuse to allow misstatements to go uncontradicted. Whatever is written about me, the truth will ultimately be known. The article is headed,,. "" A Great Speaker,"" and begins in this wayI t was at the time when every one was wondering what was going to happen after Lord Hopetoun had sent for the Premier of the senior State, Sir William Lyne, to form the first Federal Ministry that two men were waiting on the North Melbourne platform for the express to arrive from Adelaide. These two were Mr Deakin and Sir George Turner, then Premier o i Victoria. I believe that, so far, it is correct. Subsequently it is stated that certain things were said to the late Sir Frederick Holder, and that the gentlemen .who met him tried to dissuade him from promising to join me in the formation of the first Commonwealth Ministry. The statement as to the communication from Sir Frederick Holder to myself is not correct. It is absolutely untrue that he declined to join me. Although, when it was found that he could not be stopped at the North Melbourne railway station, Sir George Turner was sent after him to get him to promise not to join me,' he agreed to join me, and we had a discussion in which we tried to arrange matters regarding the Tariff. He then came back from Sydney, to see two gentlemen in Victoria on my behalf, to get them to join with us. As he arrived on a holiday, they were out of town. I have little doubt that otherwise the Ministry, would! have been formed. I do not wish to enter into small details, and did not intend for some time to come to publish the early history of (Federation, though I got the consent of the Marquis of Linlithgow, before he left Australia, to do so when a suitable occasion presented itself. I am forced to do so. by this article, which, it is said, was written by a very close friend of the Prime Minister. I shall not mention the name until I am positive that my information is correct.",14
1,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I think that one can pretty well guess who wrote the article.,14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think so. A ' garbled statement, much to my disadvantage, has been published, and therefore I think the time has come for me to give the history of what occurred. That history will bring into prominence names which their owners would, I think, like to see left out, and other information which must ' sooner or later come to light. I regret very much that Mr David Syme is not now living, because he took my part; but there is a gentleman in Melbourne now through whom everything was done, and others, including a Judge on the Bench iii South Australia, who will be able to testify that my statement regarding the transactions of the time is correct. 'Dr WILSON - Why not write a book on. the subject?",14
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not wish the matter to be treated lightly. It is a serious one.,14
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Persona l explanations should always be treated seriously. An honourable member who thinks that he has been misrepresented is entitled to have his explanation' heard sympathetically. There are limits beyond which a member-making a persona] explanation may not go, and I am sure that the honourable member for Hume recognises that. I ask honourable members to permit him to .make his statement in his own way.",14
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall not weary the House with a long statement now, but shall content myself with giving reasons why I think the time has arrived when I should put myself right with the public in this matter. My actions have been misrepresented, I fear with the object of making political capital. I had intended to give the early history of Federation, but I did not wish to do so until the events were a little more distant. There are those alive today who will be able to prove my statement. I telegraphed to Sir Langdon Bonython on Wednesday night or yesterday morning, asking who the writer of the article was, but, following the usual practice of newspaper proprietors, he declined to give me the information.",14
6,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It would be interesting to know who prompted the article.,15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have a good idea. Sir Langdon telegraphed that he could not furnish the name, and added. Knowing Holder's version, can say article incorrect in parts. Did not see article prior to publication. The publication of this article must draw from me the full history of what occurred in connection with the formation of the first Federal Ministry. I shall give the names of those concerned, and shall stand by what I publish. I repeat, most emphatically, that Sir Frederick Holder agreed to join - me, and that he did so after a consultation between us as to the Tariff.",15
8,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Was that confidential ?,15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"A m I to shut my lips when an article like this is published ? Am I to be blackguarded without - reply? I do not think that what occurred was confidential. I mention the matter because Sir Frederick Holder was a known Free Trader, and I a known Protectionist. The Tariff was the only thing that we ' really argued about. We came to the conclusion that we could harmonize our views with regard to it, and when that decision was arrived at, the difficulty was over, and be agreed to join me, and came to Melbourne with a message to two' gentlemen in Victoria.",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [10.40] - My name having been associated with this matter by the honourable member for Hume,' I may say that I have no knowledge of the article, of what prompted its reference, or of anything connected with it - those of.",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I accept assurance. PREMIERS' CONFERENCE: ADJOURNMENT ,15
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister in a position to say when he will propose an - adjournment to enable Ministers to be present at the Premiers' Conference? I ask the question because, if there is to be an adjournment, members from distant States would like to know beforehand, so that they may use the time. I am of opinion that there should not be an adjournment, - but shall do everything possible to facilitate an early decision on the question.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have undertaken to mention the matter to the Hpuse next week, and shall consult the honourable member as to a convenient occasion Probably the middle of the week will be a suitable time. NA DOCTOR.",15
14,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION OF A JAPANESE,"In a paragraph from Perth, appearing in this morning's newspapers, it is stated that a petition, has been presented to the local Parliament by the honourable member for Broome, protesting against a Japanese doctor being permitted to practise there. Has any application been made to the Department of External Affairs for permission for such a person to land there?",15
15,Mr GROOM,IMMIGRATION OF A JAPANESE,"^-The incident was brought under my notice only immediately before the meeting of the House, so that I have not yet had time to obtain any information. If the honourable member will give notice of his question for. Tuesday next, I shall be glad to reply to it then. NA CONFERENCE.",15
16,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I desire to ask a question in reference to the remarks of Colonel Foxton as cabled out in the message appearing in the press on Monday morning last. To-day there is an account in the press of further remarks by this delegate or representative of the Government; and it is obvious from the remarks of the Minister of Defence that Colonel Foxton was merely expressing his own views. . . I should like to know now from the Minister whether, as a delegate from the Government, Colonel Foxton was expressing the views of the Government or his own. If he was expressing his own views, and not the Government, has Colonel Foxthat ton been generally instructed or specifically instructed in regard to the views of the Government? What I desire to know is whether Colonel Foxton, speaJcing as the representative of the Government-and he cannot speak in any"" other capacity-ha s been authorized to take up a particular attitude or uphold a particular policy, and, if so,, what that particular policy is.",15
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I wish to say, in reply, that Colonel Foxton is absolutely free to act as he thinks best at the Conference. That, I think, was made clear by the Prime Minister last night.",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,I did not quite catch the reply of the Minister of Defence as to Colonel Foxton's function. Has Colonel Foxton been sent to England with carte blanche permission to agree on behalf of the Commonwealth to anything it may be his whim to agree to? not asking the question in any antagonistic spirit; but I do think the Government should retain the power to control Colonel Foxton before he decides anything.,16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,The notions that are being developed regarding this delegation to the Defence Conference are extraordinary. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is an extraordinary position the Government are taking up.,16
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Honourable members have been told over and over again that Colonel Foxton has gone to a .secret consultative Conference, and he is perfectly free there to discuss whatever may be brought forward. more to say.",16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,The Minister not answered my question.,16
22,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact, as reported in the newspapers, that Colonel Foxton is not to bind this Government at the Conference, but that, from time to time, he will cable to the Prime Minister and receive instructions by cable, through a special code, as to the action he may take.",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Once more may I remind honourable members that this is solely a consultative Conference; and it is solely consultative so far as Colonel Foxton is concerned. So far as he thinks necessary, Colonel Foxton will communicate with us by cable, and we shall exchange views; and I shall, perhaps, receive in advance some information deemed to be of special value, information which will afterwards be available in more detail when he returns.",16
24,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"As this is to be a secret Conference, and no one will know what takes place there, is it not reasonable to suppose that the whole of the military, authorities, both of the Old Country and elsewhere, will take the views expressedpublicly by Colonel Foxton as the views of the Government ? If they are not, ought the views of Colonel Foxton not to be supDressed ?",16
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,I do not know whether the honourable member is serious in requiring an answer.,16
26,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Certainly ; we shall not know what Colonel Foxton says at the Conference. A'Ir. JOSEPH COOK - May I suggest to the honourable member that, before now, I am cable messages have been known to be wrong, though I am not assuming that anything is wrong in the present instance. I desire to say generally that the Government will take full responsibility at the proper time for its actions. Mr Webster , - Will the Minister of Defence inform this House whether Colonel Foxton has authority to bind this House by anything he may do at the Conference? Or is Colonel Foxton instructed not to do anything which is likely to prejudice the judgment of the House in the matter ?",16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I shall require notice of any more questions on this subject. I have nothing Sir WILLIAM LYNE - At the risk of being thought importunate, I must ask the Minister of Defence whether he really canhas not say whether this House will have an opportunity to deal with the question of defence before anything definite has been decided on. This, I think, is only a fair question. I do not desire to make any threat, .but I think the House is entitled to the information and if we cannot get it by asking these questions, we shall have to take some other course.",16
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Do I understand the honourable member to suggest that before anything whatever is done in the elaboration of the defence policy, this House should first be consulted?",16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Yes, ' as to what the defence policy is to be.",16
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I can only say that the Government will, of course, be bound by the House ultimately as to what the defence policy shall be, but the Government must, in the first instance, as the honourable member is quite aware, decide upon their policy",16
31,Mr WKBSTER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,Will the Government submit the policy to the House before they decide ?,16
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"No , certainly not. IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.",16
33,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"Does the Minister of Defence intend to accept the suggestion of General Hoad, in his memorandum in connection with the Imperial General Staff, that the chief of the Commonwealth section of the Staff shall be the chief military adviser of the Commonwealth ?",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I desire to say generally, without committing myself to the answer at this particular moment, that the suggestions of General Hoad are what they are-suggestions . I have not quite decided what the relation of General Hoad to the Military Board is to be, but my own idea, at the moment, is to make the greatest possible use of the Board in all matters pertaining to the military forces. SMALL ARMS FACTORY.",17
35,Mr MATHEWS,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"In engaging men for the small arms factory, will the Minister of Defence exhaust the supply of suitable persons in the Public Service before taking others from outside?",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,The Department will make an endeavour to select the most suitable men from anywhere. ELECTORAL ROLLS.,17
37,Dr LIDDELL,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs a question in resibly lation to the electoral rolls. On inquiry gaged in other occupations? at .a. non-official post-office in New South Wales, I was surprised to find that postmaster had not a copy of the Federal electoral roll, nor did he know anything about it. Will the Minister give instrucsuggested. tions to his officers to see that every post office is supplied with one of the rolls, and that the police officers, who collect the names, shall be similarly supplied?",17
38,Mr FULLER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I shall have full inquiries made, and I shall be glad if the honourable member will forward the names ceedings, of the official and the office where the rolls are wanted. It is understood that rolls are supplied at all such places.",17
39,Mr TUDOR,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"We have been informed by the Minister of Home Affairs that it is intended to collect names and form the new electoral rolls in Victoria in September, and I desire to know whether he thinks that the time allowed for their preparation, printing, and circulation is sufficient, having regard to the date of the next elections? What is the length of 'time usually taken up by this particular work ?",17
40,Mr FULLER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,I have been informed by the Electoral Department that the time allowed is sufficient. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.,17
41,Mr HALL,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether the New South Wales Government have taken any steps to cede to the Commonwealth the territory required for the Federal Capital, and whether he can give us any information as to how matters have progressed in this connection ?",17
42,Mr FULLER,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,I had an opportunity to see the Premier of New South Wales when in Sydney last Saturday morning. The honourable gentleman is considering the whole legal position in regard to the next step to be taken by the New South Wales Government; and .1 expect by Monday or Tuesday next to be in receipt of an answer from him as to what has now to be done with a view to a surrender of the territory to the Commonwealth Government.

Ordered to be printed. o ADJOURNMENT (Formal). POSTAL NOTES AND ORDERS-BANKIN G CHARGE. - Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [10.58] - I desire to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., ""The attempt of the banking corporations to de* stroy the Commonwealth revenue by charging exchange on postal notes and post-office orders."" 1 Five honourable members having risen in their Question proposed. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The combination of private banking institutions has announced that from the ist August next - they intend to charge i d . on each postal note or money order banked, and I claim - that, if this is permitted, it will seriously decrease Commonwealth revenue. I - desire to review the great powers with which the people of the Commonwealth have endowed the banking corporations. In 1908 the banks of issue of Australia made a net - piofit of over ,£2,400,000 on a paid up capital of £18,000,000, or 13^ per cent. A financial man looking into those figures will see that the gross profits could not have been less than between ,£5,000,000 and ,£6,000,000. Those profits were made, not in the process of developing Australian industries or creating wealth, but in the process of enabling the producers and traders of the Commonwealth to exchange their property and products. The producers have had to pay to foreign banking corporations between £5,000,000 and ,£6,000,000 sterling for the right to exchange their own property and products, after furnishing the capital to those institutions - In other words, gauging the gross profits, based on the net profits, the banks made £ 1 5s. per head of the whole population, and ,£2 13s. per breadwinner. Every man, woman, .child, and infant in its cradle gave .them a profit of 25s. per head for the right of exchanging his or her own property and products. The people of the - Commonwealth furnish the banks with ^46,526,971 of deposits not bearing interest, which the banks have the use of daily. Every man who has had a training in a bank knows that in the great cities that amount is paid over the counter_ fifty - or a hundred times, but it is all back"" in the banks, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for balancing, to be loaned out again next day. The deposits bearing interest amount to £71,218,463, so that those corporations have the joy of having ,£ii7>745>434 of - the people's money which they can utilize - to make profits on their shares, yet they are not satisfied, but want to drag the last penny out of the producers and traders of the Commonwealth.",17
45,Mr SPEAKER,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"I have several asked for order, and honourable members a moment appear to comply with my reexchange. The quest, but then they completely forget it. I hope I shall not be compelled to take other - places, steps, but I can assure honourable members that I shall do so very soon if disorder does not cease. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Nobod y will listen to finance in this House, so I often wonder what is the good of bothering about it.",18
46,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"How much gold do the banks hold against those deposits? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The whole of the gold of'Australia is only ,£24,000,000. There are deposits of ,£117,000,000 in the banks, and only ,£24,000,000 of gold. Therefore ,£93,000,000 must be balanced by paper against paper.",18
47,Mr ATKINSON,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"There is good security against most of it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Who said there was not? I am simply showing what benefits the people are conferring upon these corporations, which, nevertheless, want to destroy the little currency that the poor working man has as a medium of exchange. The highwaymen of olden days could not have done a worse thing. I am sorry to think that I was trained in institutions which would be guilty of trying to destroy the people's currency. Every time a man knows that he has to pay this charge he will write: -""Don' t send me a postal note, send a cheque, it is easier to negotiate."" I have had many letters lately to that effect. Every cheque that one gives on any bank in Australia will be exchanged between the banks. In Melbourne the banks will exchange each others' cheques. You can draw a cheque on one bank, and some one else may draw one on another bank, but there is no money taken out of either bank; they simply liquidate obligations, like the great clearing house of. London, by offsetting indebtedness. I hope honourable members will understand that there is never any money used in proper banking. It is only the poor man that uses money. No rich man ever carries money. The whole of the exchanging is done by offsetting indebtedness, and that is what is called international or local exchange. To talk about money is good enough for outside people who do not understand the question. Many years ago the Rt. Hon. William Lidderdale, a governor of the Bank of England, told a gentleman, in my presence, that you could times operate a bank without any gold if for you used some other bank as a bank of Commonwealth could operate a banking corporation without gold if it asked the Bank of New South Wales or the Commercial Bank to act as a bank of exchange for it, .letting that bank keep the gold. There is no need for honourable members to try to tell me about the business. I was reared as a child in it. I ask honourable members to study the question before they tackle it. I confess that I do not like moving the adjournment of the House, because I do not wish to take up time; but let me put another question. The banks pay taxes on about ,£4,000,000 of their note issue, but they issue ,£8,000,000. ,£4,000,000 of notes are in circulation, on which they pay-2 per cent., amounting to about ,£80,000 a year. My object is to show the tremendous privileges that we bestow upon the banking corporations. Another £4,000,000 of their notes lie in their branch banks as reserves, which they can utilize whenever they want to. Those reserve notes are the capital of the branch banks, and enable the institutions to take the whole of the gold away from their branches and operate in the big cities with it. I wanted to see if Australian ""banking was run in the same way as American banking, and I find that there is no difference in the basis. While the banks do not make a large profit on the circulation of their notes on which they pay the States 2 per cent., yet they make an immense profit on the notes which are not circulated.",18
48,Mr SAMPSON,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Does the honourable member think the Commonwealth should work upon the gold reserves of the banks ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No ; I do not want to touch their gold reserves. Let me manage a Commonwealth bank for two years, and I will give the Commonwealth a gold reserve of its own without charge. I do not want any more money, so honourable members need not bother themselves about that. I am simply pointing out that the people of Australia are today living in a fool's paradise so far as finance is concerned'. They are running into debt year after year, and making no provision to repay. Australia in that sense is a "" ne'erdo-well,"" and it worries me. Every man to whom I speak says, ""Oh, the public works, if they were sold, would pay the whole debt."" What nonsense that is ! I shall have something to say about it on the Budget. The number of postal notes paid during 1908 was as follows :-Ne w South Wales, 2,700,000; Victoria, 2,091,119; Queensland, 500,000; South Australia, 421,783; Western Australia, 349,877; and Tasmania, 454,410, or a total of 6,517,189 postal notes cashed for the whole Commonwealth.",19
49,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"What was their value? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I did not bother to ascertain the value, because the banks propose to charge i d . per note. If they took the value as the basis I should not mind so much. With regard to money orders, New South Wales cashed last year 630,000; Victoria, 318,365 ; Queensland, 165,000; South Australia, 81,115; West Australia, 136,595; and Tasmania, 66,537, or a total of 1,397,612 money orders cashed for the whole Commonwealth. Adding the two together gives a total of 7,914,801 postal notes and money orders. A charge of i d . on each of these means that the banks are grabbing £32,978 from the people of Australia-fro m the poor. That is to come out of the pockets of people away in the back blocks. The small note will pay as much as the big one. The poor man if he owes money and has a postal note, pays it with that. note. He never goes to cash it himself. The poor man would not be poor if he were trained in finance. Not being trained, he goes to another man who is trained,, and gives him a profit for looking after his affairs. No man ever made money by working; men make money only by learning how to gather the profits of the work of others. As the honourable member for Maranoa pointed out on Wednesday, the banks are now issuing to customers postal notes that have been used for the purpose for which they were originally issued by the Department. Many of these are being sent to Tattersall's. They are being used over and over again, but the Postal and Telegraph Department receives nothing in respect of them, save the fee charged on them when they were first issued. Is it right that such a practice should be allowed to continue at a time when the Treasurer does not know where to look for monev for defence purposes, the payment of old-age pensions, and various other matters necessary to a progressive community? Although we have £[24,000,000 of gold in the Commonwealth, the gold actually in circulation is only about .£5,000,000. The banks are allowed to have the use of enormous gold reserves on which they do not pay a penny. It is true that as soon as they put their notes in circulation, they have to pay a duty upon them, but bank notes, after all. only represent gold reserves. In this age of progress very little money is required for trading purposes. The great medium of exchange is not money, but fructifying indebtedness, or reinforced credits. Banks issue their credits in exchange for the credits of producers and traders, and these become transferable media of exchange, until they are finally redeemed by cancellation. We have a banking aristocracy which is a world unto itself. The people who are able to regulate the movements of the money volume-wh o are able to regulate the operation of the credit volumehave the power to raise or lower prices whenever it suits twenty or thirty of them to do so. They can by their operations affect the value of every property in' the Commonwealth, and it is amazing to me that an intelligent House like this is not prepared to seriously discuss - these financial questions. It will be little short of an act of Divine Providence that will cause the House to discuss the financial question free from political partisanship and sectional bigotry. It is impossible to. accurately estimate the total loss of revenue resulting from the system to which I object. But if we were to introduce tomorrow a system that would make the Standard Oil Company pay a tax amounting t 0 £ 3 i ° ° ° per annum-and the re2 venue of that Trust is nearly three times as great as is that of the Commonwealth - Mr Rockefeller would hurry to New York, and devise a scheme by which that loss would be transferred from the Trust to the Commonwealth. The banking corporations are the prototype of Mr Rockefeller, and if they are going to tax the people to the extent of £32,978 per annum, by this charge on postal notes, the Commonwealth will have to bear the loss in the shape of a depreciated revenue.",19
50,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"It is such actions as these that will force on a national bank. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hail this act on the part of the banks as the great hammer of heaven falling on the heads of the boodleiers. Why should we not offer Mr French, of the Bank of New South Wales, or Mr Everest, of the Commercial Bank, or the manager of some other banking institution, a big salary to take control of a national bank, in order that the Commonwealth may successfully carry on such an institution, and derive large profits from it? Just as the railways of the States are departmental concerns, so I would make a national bank a department of the Commonwealth. Since my fellow countryman, Mr Tait, has assumed control of the Victorian railways, they have been paying.",20
51,Dr MALONEY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Bos h ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not going to quarrel with any one in regard to these questions. I repeat that Mr Tait is an able railway man, and that we must be prepared to pay for trained technical brain power. Last week the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out that the banks made £250,000 per annum by charging their customers ios. a year for keeping their current accounts. That is. another item which the people of Australia had not to pay until a few years ago. That charge is made, although the banks have the use of their customers' credit balances, and these institutions are now going to virtually filch from the people ,£32,000 per annum in respect of this impost on postal notes. That must be added to the £250,000 per annum they secure by means of a charge of ios. per annum on current accounts.",20
52,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"£80,00 0 per annum is the amount derived by only one bank. The total in respect of all the banking institutions is £250,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If we add to that amount the £[33,000 which they are now making by means of this charge of one penny on every postal note paid in, we find that they are deriving from the producers of Australia, £[283,000 per annum, for which they give absolutely no service.",20
53,Mr HUGHES,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"And that amount must be taken from about 500,000 persons. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I think that the number is less. I do not think that there are 500,000 producers in Australia. I trust that the Government will take steps to make postal notes a legal tender. if they do, they will immortalize themselves. Only such an action as that will make them live in history; they have done nothing yet to cause posterity to remember them. They should take steps to make postal notes a legal tender, and so teach the great corporations-thes e wolves-that they can no longer fleece the lambs of Australia.",20
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Balaclava) [11.27] - I have one or two suggestions to offer the Government, with a view to a settlement of this difficulty. This tax affects not so much the large traders as those who are in a small way of business. There are many tradespeople carrying on business in a small way, who receive three, four, or five postal notes every day, and a tax of id. per note, when the face value of that note is only 2s. fid. is a fairly heavy one. speaking yesterday to a couple of bankers, I inquired why this charge was insisted upon. They replied that some of the trading firms and companies pay into their banks as many as two hundred hundred notes per day. The receiving teller has to check each of these notes fore he can pass the pay-in slip, and whilst he is doing so a large number of customers are kept waiting at the counter, and are lose both directly and indirectly. seriously inconvenienced. I was informed by these gentlemen that in many cases there was a post-office between the trading pany's warehouse and the bank with which they did business, but that their officers passed the post-office and paid the notes into the banks. The desire of the banking institutions is to induce traders to collect amount of the notes received by them at local post-offices, and one suggestion would make is that there is no reason a trader should not be able to hand in his tradespeople. two hundred or three hundred postal notes per day to the nearest post-office, and receive in return a cheque for the full amount, which he could then pay into his banking account. If that cannot be done, the Postmaster-General might arrange for notes to be cleared by an officer of the Department at the clearing house Then he could pay in the balance at end. of the day, or at the end of the week. Another arrangement, which I am would be acceptable to the bank, would one under which five or six postal notes would be received free of charge-because it is not much trouble to a bank clerk have to add up four or five amountsthe man who paid in 200 or 300, keeping other customers waiting, having the inconvenience he caused. If a man pays in £200 in notes, nothing is charged tions for collection, because the notes are legal tender, and the tellers do not bave to enter them separately. Postal notes, ever, are for various sums, and have to entered separately. If the Postmasterthey General would enter into negotiations with the banks, a settlement could be arrived at, and the banks would be prevented from making the large profits spoken of by the honourable member for Darwin. with whom I discussed the matter yesterrangement. day told me that they do not wish to make a profit, but that they wish to prevent a loss If an arrangement is not made with the banks, persons will begin to draw Mr Agar Wynne. cheques for is., 2s., and other small amounts.

Unless an arrangement is come to with the banks the Commonwealth will I am satisfied, from my conversation of yesterday, that the bank authorities are willing comto meet the Government, and if the Postmaster-General .will take the matter in hand, he can quickly settle it to the satisfaction of the public and the banks, and without loss-to the Government.

It is a serious thing that the banks should be able, not only to place to a tax on paper of value issued by the Commonwealth, but to curtail the use of that form of currency, which will be the to pay for effect of their action. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Private corporaare taxing the Commonwealth.",21
58,Mr HUTCHISON,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"The powers of howthe Commonwealth should not be interbe fered with in any way, and the fact that are being interfered with is a sufficient justification for action by the Government. The honourable member estimates . that if the. postal notes issued next year equal in value those issued last year, the Those banks will gain ,£32,000 by the new arOf course, an exact estimate cannot be made. A postal note might pass through one bank after another, paying i d . each time. It might happen that a note worth 5s. would go through a dozen banks, and thus have to pay the enormous tax of is. I do not think that many notes will be taxed as often as a dozen times, but some notes would be taxed several times. The Government should not allow either a corporation or an individual to interfere with its privileges. If the circulation of the postal notes be curtailed, as it will be by the charging of a penny for collection, we shall lose revenue. That is so important a consideration that the discussion of the matter could not wait. I am sorry that some of the remarks of the honourable member for Darwin were received with a certain amount of levity. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - He gave the House some humorous illustrations.",21
59,Mr HUTCHISON,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"We all enjoy his humour. It would be an unhappy thing for us if we did not. But some of his serious remarks were received with levity. This is one of the most important questions with which the House can deal. those who, like the honourable member for Darwin, have studied matters of finance, know how far-reaching in its influence the action of the banks will be, though, of course, no estimate can be very accurate.* I was delighted to hear of the large increase in the issue of postal notes, but if the practice which has been objected to is allowed to continue next year, there will be a falling off,- and we cannot afford to lose a penny of revenue. I object to any interference with thp currency of the Commonwealth. There is no probability of the House, as at present constituted, lishing a bank on the lines proposed by the honourable member for Darwin, but whatever may be the views of honourable members regarding a national banking system, it is their duty to safeguard the rency.",22
60,Mr KELLY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Wentworth) [1.1.41] - I hope that the Government will give the most earnest consideration to the suggestions of the honourable member for Balaclava. The remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh were slight] v, though, of course, unintentionally, misleading. The action of the banks is to be regarded, not as the taxation of postal notes, but as the levying of a chargefor the trouble of doing what the holders could easily do for themselves. In the aggregate, the work of entering up the amounts of hundreds of postal notes is considerable. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Any boy could do it in two seconds.",22
61,Mr KELLY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"At the present time, on busy mornings, persons sometimes have wait for nearly half-an-hour before the bank tellers can attend to' them, and the passing of postal notes through bank accounts makes the work more arduous. The post-offices are the proper places for cashing postal notes. If these are to be made iegal tender they should be issued only for certain values.",22

The complaint against the banks is being cur- made, not on behalf of the poorer sections, but on behalf of the rich trading corporations, and the matter may be discussed without ad cai>1andum appeals for humanity, and in the light of reason.

69,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Cook) [11.45]-Honourable members are now able to appreciate all the more the efforts of the honourable member for Balaclava when they are contrasted with the effort of honourable members who sit on the same side of the House. The honourable member seems ta be filled with a desire to assist in the solution of some of those greatfinancial Questions which in the end lie at Ihe bed-rock of practically every polito tical question. Those sitting around him, however, when a question arises which affects the vested interests of the large banking corporations, are 'ever ready to explain away the inroads which those corporations unrighteously make on the wealth of the community. One would expect in a debate of this"" kind to hear those who have been connected with financial concerns for many years, and who must know something of banking usages. We have the chairman of the Employers' Federation here, and he is associated with large moneyed interests in the country. Why is he not taking the floor on a question of the kind, and helping to assert the rights of the common people as against the great banking institutions? Then there is the honourable member for Parkes, than whom no one is better qualified! to inform us, associated as he has been for many years with all sorts of boards of control in financial concerns. Yet we never hear these gentlemen speak on the subject they are most qualified to deal with. The Treasurer has asserted his knowledge of finance; - and it would not be overstating the case, I think, if I said that he regards himself as a financial expert. Yet we never hear that honourable gentleman taking part in a debate which may be of assistance to the people. There seems to be a conspiracy of silence amongst honourable members opposite'the moment a question is raised affecting great financial institutions.",22
70,Mr MCDONALD,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,They dare not speak; they have not had permission.,23
71,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"I do not know whether the interests of those honourable members are so interwoven with the interests of financial institutions that they dare not assert themselves here in their representative capacity. They ought, however, to remember that they do not come to this House as the representatives of their own interests or the institutions with which they are connected, but as representatives of the people who are affected by such actions as that contemplated by the banks. In the Melbourne Age of the 8th of this month, the following appearedThe report noted the success achieved by the deputation from the Employers' Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the Labour Government, and which resulted in the appointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question, while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions. That shows that the Employers' Federation, with, the moneyed interests behind it, is exerting pressure on the present Government. In the same report we are told that the Postmaster-General, after listening to the representations made to him regarding the very matter under consideration by the secretary of the Associated Banks, and representatives of other institutionssaid the explanation given showed the subject in a new light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders' association made further complaint. Is it not a ridiculous attitude for a Minister to take up, that he should, when asked to conserve the rights of the people, take his instruction from the secretary of the. Associated Banks and from the Employers' Federation? I had no desire to take part in this debate; but I think we are indebted to the honourable member for Darwin for bringing the subject up. That honourable member is one of the few who make an earnest attempt to deal with financial questions which affect the people. I do not pretend! to have any great qualification to speak on the subject, but, as a young man who is endeavouring to learn something about these great problems which I know vitally affect the people, I feel, as I say, that I am deeply indebted to the honourable member for Darwin for placing such proposals before us from time to iime with the view to conserving the interests of the rank and file, as against those of the great financial institutions-the money bags of Australia. Notwithstanding the fact that, on a capitalized value of about £[18,000,000, the banks hadi a profit of £[2,400,000 last year, they are not satisfied, but desire now to impose a tax on the postal notes and post-office orders of the poorer classes, to the amount of nearly £[33,000 per annum. It is said that this tax will not affect the poorer, people; but, as a fact, anything which depreciates the currency of the poorer people must affect them.",23
72,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,It has a tendency to put currencv out of use.,23
73,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Certainly . The Commonwealth Government have introduced postal notes and postal orders for the purpose of conveniencing the people, and the banks deliberately propose to do something which will check the action of the Government. The Commonwealth Government are entitled to take the attitude of the banks as a direct challenge on account of the efforts which are made to assist the poorer people in finding a suitable medium of exchange between town and country. Those who have banking accounts have a medium of exchange in cheques, on which the banks lay no embargo; and I guarantee that there are as many cheques changed in this city without charge, as there are postal notes and postal orders charged for. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There are cheques to one postal note or postal order.",23
74,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"But even supposing there were the same number, the injustice is great. Inside the banking ring no charge is made on certain cheques which are banked; but the moment Commonwealth postal notes and post-office orders are concerned, a general tax is imposed, although it hns been said that the Commonwealth confer - many privileges on banks by act or by non-interference.",24
75,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,The banks have overstepped the mark this time.,24
76,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,Exactly .,24
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,Do the banks propose to include post-office orders which are pavable to certain persons?,24
78,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Yes ; anyhow, post-office orders become transferable the moment they are signed and have attached to them the name of the sender.",24
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,Is it a practice to deal with post-office orders in that way ?,24
80,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Ver y common indeed ; I have banked many thousands. Sir JOHN FORREST:-Then able member has had great experience. Mr J. H . .CATTS"" - I have had some experience in connection - with my own business, and with a large industrial union, the members of which very often send their contributions in postal notes and post office orders. These I banked on behalf of the association; and thus I haye gained, as I say, a little experience. I was a customer of one of the private banks when it was determined to charge an annual fee of ios. on each account. That charge I regard as an outrage.",24
81,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,It was the very best thing ever done.,24
82,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Accordin g to ""the returns the banks have 500,000 accounts, and, although all of them may not be very much in credit, they practically supply the floating capital on which the banks operate their business. If a customer obtains an overdraft, it is not an actual one, but merely a credit; he is informed that he may draw up to .£500, and instead of that money being lent by the bank, the current accounts of other traders are simply being used. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Fictitious capital!",24
83,Mr JH CATTS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"The banks have the benefit of all these current accounts, out of which they make huge profits, and still fifty they make a charge of ios., simply and solely because they have a monopoly-because there are no other means open to ihe traders of the community. If we had a Commonwealth bank, there would be no talk of a charge of the kind. The banks, having obtained this £[250,000 per annum from the small traders for keeping their accounts, now go a step further and make a charge on postal notes and post office orders, with the effect of placing another £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 in their already overfilled coffers. If we sit down and permit this, what will be the next step? The banks have it within their power to extend credits and limit credits, and by that means to tighten or loosen the money market which in turn largely influences the prices of property, lands, and commodities, and thereby increase or decrease the purchasing power of wages. We hear a lot said about arbitration and other in dustrial Courts raising the value of comcommon modities, and we are told that, on account of the Tariff, £[ 1 will buy only as much now as 16s. would ten years ago; but, from my study of the question, the expansion and contraction of credit has the honor- much more to do with decreasing the purchasing value of money than has the action of the Courts. There is a district in New South Wales which was brought under my particular notice, where a couple of years ago there was a boom in business, and land values were high. The banks, however, called in their overdrafts, and compelled those who had land to pay up, with the result that there was a drop in values, and the district is now one of the wordt in New South Wales. This, I say, was owing to the action of the banks in limiting credit. The time at my disposal has expired. I can only hope the Government will take action to safeguard postal notes and orders against taxation by ""the great banks of Australia.",24
84,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Dalley) [11.58] - There has not been a more useful discussion than this during the session, and the effects of it will be far-reaching. I desire to compliment the honourable member for Darwin, who, under cover of the motion, has presented to the House, in a sort of axiomatic manner, a knowledge of banking science, for which, probably, many members did not give him credit. I take the liberty of saying to members of the Labour party that, judging from certain scholastic training I had in my earlier life, the honourable member is absolutely sound in the ideas he has expressed this morning; and honourable members on this side, who have practical experience, cannot dispute his contentions, more particularly those in relation to banking corporations. We have also to thank the honourable member for Balaclava, who admitted the weakness of the banks' position, and suggested how it should be altered. His suggestions were those of a shrewd business man - He realizes that the banking people have bitten off more than they can chew; and, speaking from his experience, he has advised them to back down under cover as quickly as possible. But the matter has gone a little too far for us to allow them to take cover under the honourable member's wise advice and suggestions. Personally, I thank him for his keenness and shrewdness. His speech was an acknowledgment that the banks have, gone beyond their functions, and apparently he has pointed out to them ti.e dangerous path that they are now treading. This debate has drawn attention to a neglected power of the Commonwealth under the Constitution-the power to pass banking legislation for the whole of Australia. The banking corporations, by their greed and avarice, in trying to get a poundage on postal notes, have really awakened this Parliament to the necessity for introducing banking legislation, and so exercising a power which has lain dormant too long. Some honourable members say that the honourable member for Darwin puts the subject in a humorous manner; but it is one of that honourable member's characteristics to illuminate his addresses by a certain amount of personality. Certain other honourable members are so intensely respectable and dignified that I believe they would play the Dead March, and palm it off as a wedding march. They try to pass through the .world as knowledgeable men by clothing themselves with a serious air, and a mien of ultra-respectability, to conceal lack of knowledge.",24
85,Mr BRUCE SMTH,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,The honourable member is very severe.,25
86,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"I did not think the honourable member for Parkes was so sensitive. He is one of the striking examples of whom I am thinking, but I thought his epidermis was more like that of a rhinoceros than the tender covering which it now seems to be.",25
87,Mr SPEAKER,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,I do not see what the peculiarities or distinguishing characteristics of honourable members have to do with the question before the Chair.,25
88,Mr WILKS,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Then , sir, it is your crowning disgrace that you do not possess a sense of humour. If the honqrable member for Darwin wrapped himself up in the air of a bank official, walked slowlv to the table, joined the digits of each hand, and took a quarter of an hour over each argument, he would probably pass for a serious and well-advised man like the honourable member for Parkes. The question before us is the invasion by the banks of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament. To show the importance of it, I would draw attention to the general use of postal notes in the daily life of the Commonwealth. In 1901 there were issued in the whole Commonwealth 3,516,908 postal notes of a value of .£1,293,039. In 1907, the most recent year for which complete returns are available, 6,077,237 postal notes were issued, of a value of £2,271,155. There was, therefore, in six years an increase both in volume and value of nearly TOO per cent. In New South Wales, to show what a ready medium of exchange they have been made by the people, the total number of postal notes issued in 1906 was 2,161,069 °dd, of a value of about .£808,759. By T907 the number had grown to 2,436,085 of a value of £887,105. These figures show to what extent the interests of a large section of the public are involved. The notes are a public convenience. The honourable member for Wentworth pleaded that the banking authorities had a lot of trouble with regard to the matter, and that it involved a great deal of clerical work. He forgot to point out that the banking institutions are presented with the use of a number of facilities at the cost of the Commonwealth, without anv charge for them. Take the circulation of cheoues as an instance. If the Commonwealth wished to their begin reprisals upon the banks, a readv means to hand would be to treat all cheques going through the post as registered letters. If the banking officials are going to fightthe Commonwealth for the sake of £[33,000, and lessen the value of a public convenience, they will be met with reprisals like that which the honourable member for Darwin said that skilled financiers in the Old World resorted to. If the Postmaster General desires to regain any ground in this matter, I make the suggestion to him to treat cheques passing through the post as registered letters. The Post Office is becoming a larger and larger concern, and it is performing banking business in the interests of the general public. The growth - in the number of postal notes is an evidence that that work is valued, and taken advantage of by the community. The honourable member for Wentworth, when he argues that :we are only fighting on behalf of people in a large way of business, does not go far enough, because the class of people who use postal notes is mainly the industrial class, and by far the larger proportion of the - notes are for amounts of £ 1 and under. In many parts of Australia they are not even conveyed to a bank, but are passed from hand to hand like bank notes as an ordinary medium of exchange. The difficulty in the way of making them an actual medium of exchange is that certain clerical work with regard to signing them would have to be got over; but that could be done. The bank officials, who are generally well advised! and shrewd, have overstepped the mark on this occasion. I am not surprised that the bank managers, who simply work on routine lines, knowing their banking science and insolvency laws, but not knowing the world beyond, should have recommended this step; but I am surprised that the bank directors, who are men of the world, did not see that they were arousing the dormant power of the Commonwealth to establish a national bank. This discussion has done a lot of good. When banking legislation is brought before the House, the banks will undoubtedly ask for many - conveniences and facilities, and. out. of the - mouths of those who have been silent today, there will proceed many respectable and heavy speeches in the interests of the banking corporations. No attempt will be made in those addresses to depart from - stereotyped phrases. They will be uttered slowly,' and will sound well. Commonplace generalities will take the place of originality, and because they are spoken slowly, an - opportunity will be given to the reporters to record them, and to the House to accept the instructions which they will be intended to convey. But one happy feature of this debate is the evidence that the Labour party, or any other advanced party, will now give more attention to the immediate necessity of introducing banking legislation. I believe the shrewd suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava will be acted upon tomorrow morning by the - banking authorities. He has simply said: "" Get cover as quickly as you can, boys; the lions are roused. You have gone too far; it is not worth the risk; stronger measures will follow."" I am surprised that the Postmaster-General has. not already made a suggestion similar to that of the honourable member for Balaclava. When legislation is introduced honourable members will be found to be much more versed in the higher branches of banking science than other people think. Because a man betrays his individuality and makes his points in a characteristic manner, it does not follow that he is ill informed on these questions. I admit that the banks have a perfect right under the present system of private enterprise to do the best they can for themselves. I do not blame them, but I do blame the authority which allows them to impose a fresh tax upon one of the conveniences of the people, when they have already a large number of facilities given to them free. Let them demand their pound of flesh if they like. They have a perfect right, as a business concern, to make a charge to meet expenses for clerical labour. I do not ask them to be charity-mongers or philanthropic institutions ; but I do say, as a representative of the public, that the Commonwealth must wake up, and, in turn, make its proper charges upon the banks for the free facilities which it now gives them. It will be a fair go, and the question will not stop here. I do not suppose it can be done during the life of this Parliament, but I hope that whatever Government is in power in the next Parliament will be forced to bring in banking legislation, and that the outcome will be the utilization of our postal service to form the nucleus of a national bank.  seems most peculiar that when any proposition emanates from any honourable member on our side of the Chamber, so little notice should be taken of it upon the Ministerial side. So far no Minister has taken any interest in the debate. I look upon this as one of the most serious problems that the Postmaster-General has to face. I suppose, as there are no chambers of commerce, or chambers of manufactures, or banking institutions on this side to wait upon the Treasurer or Postmaster-General, no notice is taken of what we say-simpl y because the masses, and not the classes, are affected. Sir John FORREST - That is right. Always attribute motives.  has been taken in this debate by any Minister in the chamber? I am not imputing motives, but stating facts. Nine-tenths of my constituents use the postal note service. Hardly a mail comes from Queensland in which I am not asked to induce the Postmaster-General to afford facilities for getting postal notes. To people living in the bush a postal note is practically currency. No one can bear me out more strongly than can the honourable member for Darling Downs, because the same thing happens in his district. The Postal Department in Queensland) gives every possible facility to people to get postal notes, and the Deputy Postmaster-General in that State has, since he went there, opened more offices for the sale of postal notes than have existed before. He is increasing the facilities for that purpose every year, and postal notes are practically becoming the currency in Western Queensland. People in far back portions of that State find it easier to obtain goods from Brisbane and to send postal notes in payment for them than to obtain their supplies from the nearest town; it is easier to forward postal notes through the post-office to bane business houses. They, now find that on every postal note which they use for the payment of services rendered, or goods supplied, they are to be penalized by the banks to the extent of i d . This question is of great interest to the people generally; and particularly to those who reside in the back places of Australia. If there is one section of the community to whom my heart goes out more than to any other, it is that section which resides in back-blocks of the different States, for I have lived in such places, and know the disadvantages under which they labour. If it is possible for the Postmaster-General to make their lot a little easier than it is, I hope that he will do so, and I am sure that any such attempt on his part will receive ithe cordial assistance of his colleagues. It is imperatively necessary that action should be taken at once. Notice has already been issued by the banks that the charge is to be levied as from ist proximo, and I ask the Treasurer, in the absence of the Postmaster-General, to take this matter in hand without further delay. If the banks are not prepared to accede to our request, I am satisfied that the Government will be able, within twenty-four hours of its introduction, to pass a Bill that will give effect to our desire.",25
89,Dr MALONEY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Melbourne) [12.18] As a one-time bank clerk of seven years' experience, I wish very briefly to put the views of the bank clerks in regard to this question. Their contention is that there is more trouble involved in entering up a post office order than there is in entering an ordinary cheque. I dare say that the average amount of the cheques that are drawn by customers of banking institutions in Victoria is considerably over £ 5 , whereas the average in respect of postal notes is probably 5s., or even less. A great deal of work is involved in dealing with these small notes.",27
90,Mr HUME COOK,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,The bank clerk has to put in his six or seven hours a day. What does it matter to him what he has to do during that time?,27
91,Dr MALONEY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,Heave n forgive the honourable member for'his want of knowledge on the subject.,27
92,Mr HUME COOK,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"All that I say is that the bank clerk has to work for a certain number of hours, irrespective of what he has to do.",27
93,Dr MALONEY,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"A Factories Act might well be applied to the bank clerks of BrisAustralia, and I speak with more knowledge-of this phase of the subject than is possessed by the average bank director. There is another point to which I desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer, and that is that by means of the charge of ios. per annum on current accounts, the banks are slowly eating up the unclaimed balances which belong really to the people of the Commonwealth. The Colonial Bank, to its credit be it said, was the one institution the to stand out against the proposal to make the charge, but the honourable member for Darwin-tha n whom no honourable member has a higher knowledge of banking practices - wil l bear out my statement that it is impossible for one bank to stand out against all the others. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear. It would be crucified if it did.",27

105,Mr MCDONALD,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Perhaps it is as well that I should read the report of the remarks made by the Postmaster-General. According to the Age of 8th instant, the honourable gentleman, after listening to the Secretary to the Associated Banks, saidThe explanation given showed the subject in a new light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders' association made further complaint. ' In these circumstances it is idle for the Treasurer to say that the Postmaster General is doing this, that, or the other thing. It appears to me that, having regard to the action of the Government in relation to the telephone charges and other matters, they are bound hand and foot, and dare not move without the express permission of the Chambers of Commerce or the Chamber of Manufactures.

110,Mr STORRER,PAPUAN LABOUR AT THURSDAY,"Bass) [12.26] - I wish to draw attention once more to the fact that whenever a financial question of great importance to Australia is brought before the House little notice of it is taken by Ministers and their supporters, who display the utmost indifference to views expressed - by honourable members on this side of the House. When the honourable member for Darwin was introducing this question I could scarcely hear what he was saying, because certain Ministers and some of their supporters were conversing in a way that was not respectful to you, Mr Speaker, or to the honourable member who was addressing the Chair. The question that has been raised 1879. by the honourable member for Darwin is great importance to those who live in try districts. For some time in Tasmania this charge on postal notes has been force, and the unionism of the banks gone beyond that which is reasonable. after year they have gone on piling up promises to do. new charges, and it would appear that them it is a case of unionism run mad. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) enters [12.27] - I thank honourable members the attention that they have given to question that I have submitted for their sideration. The ' speeches made by honourable member for Balaclava-wh an ablefinancier-the honourable member Dalley, and others, show that voted much study to this problem, and I hope that action will be taken by the GoOrder. vernment without delay, Already I have had 'letters from people with. whom I had business dealings, saying, "" In future send us one of your own cheques instead of a postal note, because we have now to pay one penny - on every postal note that we pay into our banking account."" This means that, even in the case of a cheque for 5s., I have add sixpence exchange. Representatives country districts should consider for a mo.rnent how this charge by the banks will affect them. The storekeeper pays the postal notes that he has received from customers into his banking account, and this way the banks are collecting a very large revenue. The revenue of the monwealth will also suffer, because, owing the introduction of this system, people naturally demand to be paid by cheque stead of postal notes. The banks did away with the Inter-State exchange on bankto notes as the result of the policy speech livered at Gympie by the late Treasurer, who said that he proposed to provide for Commonwealth note issue. I regret the honourable gentleman did not at once bring down a financial scheme in accordance with that which I proposed, and which adopted by the Brisbane Labour Conferof ence. My scheme provided for a national system of banking, including a CommonWestern wealth note issue,' gold reserves, and demption of the note issue in both gold and in consols, at the will of the Comptrolleris General of the currency. I made up mind that we should have such a scheme that half-a-dozen banks would not be able to corner the Government as the Governand ment of the United States was cornered after the resumption of specie payment in The Government of the United of States had then to hire a corporation of counbanks to float gold bonds. I remember the incident well, for some of my own people in were in the deal. It seems that every one has desires to get at the Government. I know Year that the Treasurer-will do that which he I have every confidence with in him. He has been an explorer, and we know what an explorer can do when he the financial world.

111,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [12.32] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. his Honourable members are invited to give in their attention to ""a very important question, which seriously affects the welfare of Comthe Commonwealth, and is part of a still to greater problem lying before Australia. will One has only to turn to the map, and see inhow unpeopled our northern lands are, to realise the obligation upon us. We have hold and maintain this country as a depart of the British Empire, and to so develop its resources that it shall become a an important part of the Empire, peopled that by a white race, preserving the highest standards of the civilization of which we are so proud. To-day we have to conwas sider, not the development of the whole the northern part of Australia, including vast and fertile areas in Queensland and Australia, but only the developthe rement of what is known as the Northern Territory of South Australia. That Territory important by reason of its area alone. my It contains 523,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres, so that it is nearly onesixth of the total area, of the Continent, equals in size France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy put together. It possesses a coastline of 1,300 miles, which lie large islands. It is watered magnificent navigable rivers, such as the Victoria, the Daly, the Adelaide, the gator, the Liverpool, the Goyder, the Roper, and the MCArthur. Although much of its land may. not equal the best taken in other parts of Australia, it possesses the rich, fertile coastal districts, suitable for agriculture, and, inland, large pastoral areas and extensive and valuable mineral isolation deposits. Yet its population last year was Australia. only 2,973 persons, of whom 1,081 were Europeans, and 1,892 men of other races, exclusive of the aboriginal population, as possible. whose conditions are dealt with in the memoA randum circulated. This population been decreasing year by year,' and of the questions we have to face is how to get it to increase. Hitherto the sheltered, Territory has been governed by South Australia, but that State is finding the burden pelago more than it can bear. We are obliged to port consider the position of the Territory from the point of view of defence also. How does event the Territory lie in its geographical relaamongst tions with the rest of Australia and my the countries of the East? A few figures, giving distances by sea routes, thing will help honourable members to realise the facts. The distance from Port Darwin to Thursday Island is 730 miles; to Fremantle, 2,092 miles; to 2,160 miles; to Sydney, 2,634 miles; to Melbourne, 3,210 miles by the east coast route, and 3,952 miles by the west coast route; and to Adelaide, 3,453 miles by west coast route and 3,709 miles by the east coast route. From Port Darwin to Amthat boina. in the Dutch East Indies, is sideration. 580 miles; to Sandakan, in Borneo, 1,440 miles; to Batavia, in Java, 1,705 miles; to Manila, in the questions Philippines, 1,872 miles; to pore, 1,902 miles; to Hong Kong, 2,350 miles; and to Colombo, 3,253 miles. Thus Port Darwin is nearer to Hong Kong it is to Sydney. Representatives of Western Australia have complained that thaf State, is as difficult of access from the eastern States as is New Zealand; all communicanexion tion having to be carried on by sea. Port his advisers. Darwin is similarly situated. We have there large and valuable areas of country, layman. which are much more easily reached from other part's of the world than from the populous centres of the Commonwealth. considering. For the sake of defence alone, it is important that our communications with it its value? off should be improved. On this matter, the by opinion of Major J. Bevan Edwards, C.B., at one time commanding the troops in China Alliand Hong Kong, is of value, though it was written twenty years ago. He saysNo general defence of Australia can be underunless its distant parts are connected with more populous Colonies in the south-east of the Continent. If an enemy was established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. Their is, therefore, a menace to the rest of . . . The interests of the whole Continent, therefore, demand that the railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other Colonies should be made as soon former Governor of South Australia, Sir has George Le Hunte, has also spoken of the one harbour at Palmerston in these wordsThe harbour is a very fine one-deep , well and capable of being easily defended. Its position with regard to the Eastern Archiand the great Asiatic trading centres ought to make it a very important commercial in the future, while from its strategic position it might prove a very valuable base in the of developments which may, and in the course of time, are nearly certain to, take place the Powers in the East. There is, in opinion, every reason why Australia should appreciate and safeguard one of its most important, positions. It will be a most dangerous to neglect or undervalue it. That opinion was expressed in 1905.",29
112,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is Sir George Le Hunte Brisbane, an expert on defence?",30
113,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In his administrative capacity, he has had to consider important problems from the Imperial, as well as the from the Australian, point of view, and those who know his character will be aware his opinion is worthy of careful con",30
114,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the Minister think it wise to ask the House to be influenced on of this kind by the views of reSingapresentatives of the Crown?,30
115,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have quoted from a public document which has. been laid on than the table. Sir George Le Hunte is no longer Governor of South Australia. The opinion does not relate to a constitutional' matter, and was not arrived at in conwith the relations between him and",30

117,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is, nevertheless, worth",30
118,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does any one dispute,30
119,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In addition, I might offer the opinion expressed by Lord Northcote after he had retired from his position of Governor General, when he uttered a warning in respect to the northern parts of Australia. He stated what is obviously a fact, namely, that it would be quite possible for an alien force "" to seize Port Darwin and to march southward at its 1 leisure."" That is a possibility we have to contemplate; and if all means of communication were cut off from the southern centres, we should have a very serious problem before us.",31
120,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that is correct, ought we not to connect the centres of population with the Northern Territory by the most direct route?",31
121,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is another question. We have in the north a rich, fertile country, practically isolated; and no matter what means of communication may be determined in the future, that Territory, as it is today, especially in relation to other nations, is a menace to the Commonwealth. Honourable members will realise that there is only one means by which we can hold the Territory, and that is by having there a settled population-no t a population settled merely on the coast, but, if we are to retain the Territory permanently as a portion of the Commonwealth and of the Empire, there must be a large population settled on the interior lands also. The remark of President Roosevelt, in reference to Australia, is, I think, as applicable today as when he made it. He saidBeware of Keeping your north empty ; and remember that an unmanned nation invites disaster. The position of the Northern Territory is exactly that described by President Rooselonged velt ; we are in possession of this Territory, and, at the present time, it is unmanned. Queensland. The problem which Australia has to face, whether the Commonwealth takes over the Territory or not, is how we can alter the present state of affairs. At present .we possession of the Territory; that is, we can say that we have actual possession, and that it is occupied from the point of view of international law. But when we observe the growth of population in other countries, and see there the overcrowding and desire to occupy fresh territories, desire proceeding from laws of nature which we must recognise-it becomes increasingly pressing on us as a people to retraversed member that, if w.e are to justify our title, the only way we can do that is by effective occupation. Effective occupation does not mean merely placing a Customs official at a port and flying the flag; to my mind, it means permanent occupation by' a people who are applying their energies and industry to developing the resources of the country, not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the community as a whole. These are the problems which lie before us. South Australia, for a period of forty-six years, has had the responsibility of this Territory; and I think that that State is entitled to a meed of praise for having kept the British flag flying over that great portion of the Commonwealth. If South Australia had failed to recognise her Imperial obligations-if she had so neglected her duty as to leave this, as it were, a no-man's land-the problem might have been even more serious. But for the benefit of Australia as a whole, as it ultimately proved-thoug h probably selfish considerations may have actuated some of her citizens-South Australia has resolutely faced the position all these years, and tried to do her best",31
122,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the Minister say that South Australia has kept the enemy out of the country ?,31
123,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I say that South Australia has retained possession of the Territory.,31
124,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Because nobody else wanted it.,31
125,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think that is the case. When South Australia took possession of the Territory, the population of the State was only 140,000. I might say that before South Australia took the Territory, a large portion of it really beto the State of New South Wales.",31
126,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And so did,31
127,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite so, but Queensland was constituted a separate colony in 1859. At that time, the Queensland border have did not extend so far west as it does today; it was in 1862, by an Order in Council, that the Queensland borders were extended on the west up to the present border of the Northern Territory. The question of dealing with the Northern Territory was discussed at the time. About 1863 there a was considerable stir in South Australia by reports that were presented by the great explorer, MCDougall Stuart, - who had the continent, and made reports as to the richness of the land which he had seen. Mr A. C. Gregory, another explorer, had also been across the Territory; and he, and all acquainted with the facts, spoke highly of this portion of the continent. Some correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Governments of Queensland and South Australia took place in regard to the disposition of the Northern Territory; and the request of Queensland was not that it should be attached to that State-it was felt that Queensland had enough territory to develop-bu t that it should be annexed by South Australia. The South Australian Government asked for the annexation, and in the year 1863 the annexation was made.",31
128,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,After England failed to settle the Territory.,32
129,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Englan d had never seriously attempted to settle the Territory.,32
130,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There are remnants of English settlement there today.,32
131,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There was no serious attempt at colonization, or to govern the Territory in an administrative way. By letters patent on the 6th July, 1863, the Northern Territory was annexed to the province of South Australia. That was in pursuance of two Acts of Parliament; one, passed in 1842 for the government of New South Wales and Van Diemeri's Land, giving authority to erect into a new colony any territories within New South Wales, and the other, passed in 1861, dealing with the Legislature of Queensland, and containing a clause, enablinjg the Imperial Government, by letters patent, to annex to any colony in the continent of Australia any territory which, in pursuance of the previous Act, might have been created a separate colony.",32
132,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is no constitutional difficulty raised, is there?",32
133,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Any such difficulty has been only suggested. The substance of the letters patent has accordingly been set out in the memorandum I have circulated. As I say, this Territory was annetced to South Australia by letters patent.",32
134,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,At the request of South Australia.,32
135,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and also with the acquiescence of. Queensland. letters patent, while they contained a clause enabling the annexation of the territory to South Australia, also gave power, at any time, to revoke the annexation. In 1882, the South Australian Government sought to have that power of revocation withdrawn, and to have the Northern Territory permanently annexed'. That request was refused by the Imperial authorities, but, as we know, under the Constitution Act, the Northern Territory was incorporated as part of the province of South Australia. Therefore, South Australia has power to deal with the Territory-to surrender or dispose of it, just in the same way as New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland may deal with any portion of its territory. It is in pursuance of that power, which is undoubtedly possessed under the Constitution, that we are asked today to accept from South Australia the transfer of the Northern Territory. had Mr Bruce SMITH - How does the Minister account for the paucity of population, when there are such fine rivers and lands ?",32
136,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All I can do is to refer the honourable member to the report of a South Australian Royal 'Commission of 1895, a portion of the report of which appears in the memorandum, showing the causes suggested for the failure. No doubt mistakes have been made in the government of the Northern Territory; but has any State governed the whole of its territory without error? South Australia, according to the best of the financial ability of those in power, attempted to deal with a serious problem. I ask honourable members to remember that had South Australia been completely successful in its dealings with the Northern Territory, and succeeded in settling it with a population of, say, 500,000, the Territory would today have been a separate State. What, then, has South Australia done in the past? In her attempts to settle-the Territory, she landed herself in heavy financial obligation. To-day the State has a population of 398,093, but for the whole of the period of forty-six years a small population took upon themselves a great burden of taxation, until now, I believe, South Australia is the second most heavily taxed State in the Union.",32
137,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Ha d South Australia any alternative?,32
138,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There was the alternative of abandoning the Territory, but South The Australia has acted according to British tradition, and borne a great burden rather than sacrifice the Territory. The State has tackled the problem seriously. Her initial attempts to make land sales ended in failure and disaster. Land was sold which had not been surveyed, and the consequent delay in granting titles for five or six years involved the State in considerher able loss,, and set back its progress. doubtedly, there was a mistake there; perhaps, the State, in the course of her history, has made other mistakes.",32
139,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,33
140,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was putting the queswe tmen-""What has South Australia done on behalf of the Territory?"" She has made attempts at land legislation, of which of the earlier ones certainly landed her in disaster. She also undertook large, lic works, one of which in particular not only a boon to South Australia, distinct national advantage. I refer action in undertaking solely out of her own financial resources the construction the overland telegraph line. That work has been of infinite value to all the States. It gave them their first communication by stand-point. cable with the great markets of the world. It was a distinct business advantage Australia, although South Australia underaffirm took the enterprise on her own account. The construction of the line had to be made fended. through a large and practically unexplored territory. The responsibility had undertaken of bringing all the material through that area, and to take upon herquestion self the risk of the line not paying. That work alone ought to stand for all time the credit of Sir Charles Todd, who pleted it when others had partially, if wholly, failed. It cost South Australia less than £603,959. Three-fifths of line runs through the Northern Territory. In addition, South Australia constructed the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway, and made harbour works and jetties in connection with it, which cost her a capital expenditure of £[1,184,612. A series of attempts made to settle the country by making costly surveys, in order to get a proper ception of its pastoral resources. Explorthat ing parties were equipped and sent out prospecting parties. Money was in sinking wells, and in various other ways attempts were made to induce settlement in the North. These works landed willing the State in continual expenditure, which ists left a series of accumulated deficits year after year, until today she bears upon her shoulders the burden of a total expenditure Territory, in connection with the Territory of Australia, £[3,327,983. It will therefore be seen that by her efforts, supplemented by the establian lishment of experimental stations cate the line upon which agricultural velopment should take place, and by doing best to encourage pastoral settlement, UnSouth Australia has made some serious and, attempts to solve this great problem.",33
141,Mr STORRER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not that an argument why we should not take the Territory?,33
142,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . The argument why should take it is that as South Australia has hitherto been bearing what is really a national obligation, the time has some come for transferring to the whole community of Australia a burden too great for pubthe small population of the State. From was a national stand-point the question of but a the settlement of the North must to her be faced. The Commonwealth as a of whole must realise its position. I have already referred to the necessity for taking the Territory from the defence The defence authorities of the Commonwealth concur in the opinion to expressed by Major-General Edwards, and that no defence of Australia would be complete unless Port Darwin is deSouth Australia has undoubtedly made mistakes, and it is quite to be possible that something more than has been done might have been done. But the whether South Australia has done her duty or not is apart altogether from to the national question which now has to be comfaced. The question is not what South not Australia has not done, but what the Comno monwealth of Australia is going to do. the When Federation was accomplished, the late Sir Frederick Holder, who was then Premier of South Australia, wrote on 18th April, 190.1, to Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, offering to transfer the Territory to the Comwere monwealth. He did this, not under the authority of Parliament, but in his concapacity as head of the Executive, realizing whatever was done would be subject to parliamentary ratification or rejection. In expended making the offer, he said :I may mention that, had South Australia been to have given carle blanche to capitalto introduce coloured labour into the Territory a sum of money estimated at about ^10,000,000 would have been forthcoming to establish a chartered company to take over the with its assets and liabilities to South and to carry out the construction of the remaining portion of the overland railway. This offer was declined by the South AustraGovernment in its own interest and in the to indiinterests of Australia. deThe Commonwealth Parliament discussed the matter, and in September, 1902, this House, on the motion of the late Mr. mon, passed the following resolution :That in the opinion of this House it visable that the complete control and jurisdiction over the Northern Territory of South Australia be acquired by the Commonwealth upon just terms. Therefore, this House has already by lution affirmed the desirability of acquiring the Territory. South Australia passed, 1902, a Trans-continental Railway Act, authorizing the construction of the line - land grant terms, and the previous offer withdrawn. When that Act was passed, certain offers were made, with which I  became Premier of the State. He subthe mitted to the Prime Minister of the Comdatta monwealth certain resolutions passed by Parliament on December 7th, 1905, autholoans. rizing the transfer of the Territory Commonwealth on the following condinecessary tions :(a) Payment of the total amount expended by South Australiain connection with the settlement and administration of the Territory up to the date of its transfer. (4) That the Commonwealth Government agrees to construct the transcontinental from the southern boundary to the present minus at Pine Creek. (c) That the line of route of the proposed railway shall be from the terminus of the railway the South Australian boundary to the terminus of the northern section of the line at Pine and within one hundred miles east or the present overland telegraph line. (d) That the work of construction of the railway shall be commenced by the South Austrareturns-thos lian Government from Oodnadatta, and by Commonwealth Government from Pine Creek end, within twelve months of the passing of the necessary Acts by the State and Commonwealth Parliaments, and the approval of the transfer by the Imperial Parliament. Negotiations took place, the details of I need not mention, and ultimately it agreed between the Premier of South Austurns. tralia and the Prime Minister of the monwealth that the Territory should surrendered to the Commonwealth upon terms of the agreement which are the schedule to the Bill that is now before House. I shall go through those terms briefly and explain them. In the first place, the Territory and all the State propertv and assets in the Territory, are to be translated, ferred to the Commonwealth - In return, the Commonwealth undertakes to be responTerritory, sible for the indebtedness of the State respect of the Territory, 'as from the of acceptance, by annually reimbursing the State interest on the loans, and by paying Soloannually into a sinking fund the amount which the State is at present liable to pay is adinto a sinking fund, and also redeeming or paying the loans as they fall due. The Commonwealth undertakes to pay the deficit account which now exists on the Territory. It also covenants to cause a railresoway to be constructed from Port Darwin southward to the northern boundary of in South Australia proper. It agrees to acquire the railway running from Port Augusta upon to Oodnadatta, and to construct a railway was line northwards from some point on that line to connect with the other porneed tion of what is described as the transcontinental railway. It agrees to pay State the indebtedness on the Oodnato Port Augusta line by becoming rehis sponsible for the interest and for the The State, on its part, covenants to the to give the Commonwealth all the powers to construct those lines, and to give consent to the construction of the railway from Port Augusta through the South Australian territory towards the Kalgoorlie-Perth extension. Those, generally speaking, were the terms of the agreement. line If honourable members will bear with me, terI shall now go through the agreement in a little detail. In the first place the State at has undertaken to transfer and surrender to the Commonwealth the Northern Territory. Creek, What does that Territory mean to us as a west of Commonwealth? From the point of view of its natural wealth, let us take the last e for the year 1907. Its imthe ports in that year were valued at £78,996, and its exports at £345,721. The leading exports were gold, wolfram, copper, tin ore, silver, pearl shell, cattle, horses, hides and tallow. Up to date the total mineral which wealth won from the Territory amounts to was £2,565,578. It has increasing stock reTo-day its wealth in that direction Comamounts to about 400,000 cattle, 20,000 be horses, and 44,232 sheep. I mention those the figures simply to give honourable members some idea of the latent resources of this the great portion of the continent. I do not wish to go in detail into the opinions which have been expressed about the Territory. In the memorandum which has been circuhonorable members will find the views of men who have been long resident in the and have had considerable exin perience of it. Those will give them some date idea of its agricultural, pastoral, and mineral resources, but I feel in duty bound to submit to the House a few opinions of piactical men. The Honourable J. Langdon Parsons, who for a long time administered be the Territory, and also resided in it, saysThese Northern Territory lands by some much over-praised, by others much under depreciated. In such a vast expanse of Australian country there are stony wastes, ing sandhills, spinifex .thickets, waterless regions, rocky and sterile ranges. But there are also wide undulating downs, broad wellgrassed plains, rich alluvial flats, and north coast large navigable rivers. Captain Barclay, F.R.G.S., who has resided in the north for many years, divides the more. Territory into three districts, namely, coastal, northern, and southern, and writesFully one-third of the Northern Territory is first-class pastoral country, admirably suited for sheep. Northward from the Jervois range great tableland stretches for hundreds of miles. one. The southern limit is 2,500 feet above the thence it gradually falls until it meets the coastal ranges bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean. Owing to the eleland. vation above the sea, the climate is perfect, and there seems no reason why agriculture should not flourish, the rainfall gradually increasing over vast plains of rich soil, from about 10 inches in the MACDonnell Range to 45 inches Pine Creek and 62 inches at Port Darwin. Then again Mr Winnecke, another explorer, Springs, saysreportedMy experience of the Northern Territory extends over 35 years. I have been astounded at the frequent mention of desert country. My experience is that some of the finest pastoral country in the world is to be found in Central Australia. Water, principally artesian, is more abundant than supposed. . . . Another, who has had great experience in the north, Mr Giles, saysFrom the northern base of the MACDonnell Range to the west range (Hann) is a distance of 70 miles, the whole of which is magnificently grassed, although timbered thickly in places by mulga (acacia). At 25 miles from the MACDonnell Range are rolling downs thickly grassed and equal in richness of soil to any in South Australia, being inundated plains of rich black and red soils, fit for the growth of wheat. This excellent country extends east and west for considerable distances, also to the north-east and north-west. Mr John Costello, of Lake Nash, in giving evidence before the Royal Commission, gave evidence thatsaidThere is a large area of country from Newcastle Waters and the head of the Roper to the Queensland border at Cammoweal. This magnificent belt of country known as the tableland may be said to be the cream of the pastoral land of the Territory. I have the fullest and greatest faith in the future of squatting in it. I have travelled over most sheep raising country in Queensland, and I can safely say that in no part of that Colony have I seen country better adapted for wool growing than this splendid Mr Groom. tableland. A permanent supply of water can obtained in this country at a depth varying from 150 to 250 feet.",33
143,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is said that it will have been carry 5,000,000 sheep.",35
144,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Mr Lindsay, the exrollplorer; who has been over the Territory, makes a higher estimate of the sheep-carrying capacity of the country than that menon the tioned by the honourable member. He personally informed me that it would carry at least 10,000,000 sheep, whilst the more sanguine estimate is that it will carry many",35
145,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,My estimate is based on the opinion expressed by men who have travelled over the country again and again.,35
146,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would appear that a that estimate is a somewhat conservative The enormous tableland, shown on sea; the map is in itself almost a province.",35
147,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It runs into Queens,35
148,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It extends beyond the border, and the Cloncur-ry railway line could be extended into it. As to the prosat pects of the Territory as a horse and cattleraising country, Mr E. S. Flint, of Alice Cattle and horses thrive well, especially the latter, which in dry seasons are able to travel farther from water to feed. He was speaking then, not of the tableland to which the honourable member for Kennedy has referred, but that part of the Territory, which is often referred to as desert countryI am of opinion that Central Australia will be the chief horse-producing district of Australia. Its contiguity to the tropics renders horses more hardy, and better able to cope with the heat and other drawbacks attaching to a tropical country than animals bred further south. Professor Spencer, who, in 1901, visited the Territory said I saw wide areas of magnificent stock country which only requires water to make' it habitable. And the needful water can be obtained partly by artesian boring and partly by conservation. Mr H. Percy, a Queensland stock-owner, I have seen nearly all the best coast country in Queensland, and I can safely say I have seen none that I like so well. I was surprised to find it so good, as, previous to my visit here, I had heard the Northern Territory so often run down that I looked upon it as a foregone conclusion that I should see inferior country; but it is nothing of the kind, and it is destined sooner or later to be made use of for agriculture and to carry a large population.",35
149,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,To what part of the Territory was he referring?,35
150,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am quoting from the general evidence given by him in respect to the Northern Territory. Mr David Lindsay, than whom no one has a better knowledge of the Territory, and' who those who have met him will admit, may be relied upon to give a judgment based on experience in summing up the whole position in regard to the Territory, saysThus we have a country capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of cattle and horses and millions of sheep; extensive agricultural areas which will produce sugar, 'rice, coffee, cotton, and nearly all other tropical and sub-tropical products necessary for our use; and the wonderf u l mineral wealth of gold, silver, tin, and copper, all combined, will make the somewhat despised Northern Territory of vast importance, and place it in the front rank of the Australian States. By glancing at' the map which I have caused to be exhibited in the Chamber, honourable members will obtain an idea of the extent of the area, concerning which these opinions have been expressed by practical men. The areas at present occupied under lease are coloured pink on the map, and perhaps at this stage it may be well to give honourable members some figures as to the actual occupation. The total' area of the Northern Territoiy is 335,1.16,800 acres, and of that only 473,809 acrescoloured green on the map-hav e been alienated in fee-simple. There - are 99,740,068 acres held under pastoral and other leases, whilst under annual leases and permits, 16,563,840 acres are occupied. We have thus a total occupation, under leasehold or permits, of 116,777,717 acres, leaving a balance of 218,339,083 acres still untouched. Honourable members will find in the memorandum I have circulated a complete list of the lands held under lease. The leases extend over periods ranging up to fortytwo years; but a portion of the time of some of them has already expired. In dealing with the problem of the occupation and settlement of the Northern Territory, the question that will confront us in regard to the large areas, totalling 99,740,068 acres, held under the long leases, is a serious one.",36
151,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Fort y years is not long.,36
152,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Relatively , it is not.",36
153,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The terms vary from twenty-five years to forty years.,36
154,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Accordin g to the time that the leases have been in existence.,36
155,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And those leases apply to the best land in the Territory.,36
156,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So far as I can gather from the evidence, they relate to some of the best land in the Territory. The area coloured pink on the right-hand side of the map, represents the tableland, and the area on the left; coloured pink, is the Victoria River country. Some of the best lands in the Territory are to be found in the Victoria River district.",36
157,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the best for some purposes, but not for all.",36
158,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Victoria River country comprises good agricultural '-and pastoral land. As honourable members are aware, the coastal fringe contains agricultural country. Men of considerable experience say that the large tablelands in the centre will also be found suitable for wheat-growing, and there we have a rainfall of from 20 inches upwards.",36
159,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is doubtful whether all the conditions under the long leases have been complied with.,36
160,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so; some of the leases have already been determined. When the Northern Territory is taken over by the Commonwealth, it will be open to the Government, if they desire to acquire some of the better lands now held under lease, to exercise their power of resumption with compensation. In the last annual report presented by the Government Resident, there appears a list of cattle-stations, showing the cattle at present on the various holdings.",36
161,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is nothing to prove that the number of cattle said to be on the holdings are actually there.,36
162,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At page 4 of the report, which is an official one, there appears a list of stations having 500 cattle or over, and it shows that on three of them, namely, Victoria Downs, Wave Hill and Ord River, there were 151,000 cattle at the end of 1908.",36
163,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Oh !,36
164,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member may have better information than the Government Resident has, but I remind him that this is an official return.",36
165,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Showin g that there is about one beast to the square mile on the occupied territory.,36
166,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The stock-carrying capacity of the country occupied is much greater than that. As regards part of the Victoria River country, the most recent official reports give 15 to 20 head of cattle per square mile as the stock-carrying capacity. As regardfe the possibilities of agriculture, the Government Resident points out that this year settlers are beginning to go in for mixed farming, a change which he looks upon as most promising. The officer in charge of the botanical station considers the Territory suited for such productions as maize, tobacco, rice, palms, fibre plants, arrowroot, spices, sugar, rubber, and tropical fruits. His experiments with upland rice have been so satisfactory that he is confident that the crop will be as valuable to the Northern Territory as the wheat crop is now to South Australia. Sisal hemp has also been grown successfully, and is beginning to be planted for commercial purposes. He looks for a great future from it. With regard to the mineral resources of the Territory, let me read the opinions of experts, who speak very highly of its possibilities. The Rev. J. Tenison Woods saysI confidently assert that the Northern tory is exceptionally rich in minerals, only a as elsewhere in Australia. small part of which has been made known the public. I do not believe that the same quantity of minerals, veins of gold, silver,' copper and lead, will be found in any equal area in Australia. In fact, I doubt' if in many finest land in Australia. provinces will be found any country so singupart, larly and exceptionally favoured as Arnheim's Land is, in respect to mineral riches. In the opinion of Mr Brown, the Governon a large scale will be possible. ment Geologist, one of the most competent and careful men we have in Australiathe present gold mining field is capable of much further development. They are only worklation ing on the surface now. There is a good of country for prospecting in the neighbourhood of the existing gold-fields. . . A good portion of the best mining country is still Professor Tate says The development of the mineral resources the Northern Territory is but in its infancy, and I believe that rich stanniferous lodes yet be found. Rich auriferous lodes abound over a large tract of country. It is my conviction the gold reefs can be worked profitably and to a considerable depth.  claresI have no hesitation in saying that the Northern Territory is phenomenally rich minerals, but more especially in gold and tin. Judge Herbert saysI am convinced from what I have seen, that no part of Australia can show tin lodes to the same number and extent as the Northern Terriclimatic tory, though in particular instances, Mt. Bischoff, they may be richer. . Northern Territory may be emphatically proHe saysnounced to be a tin country. On Monday last the Soutli Australian Government received a telegram from Mr. Brown, the Government Geologist, reporting a very important discovery of Mr Groom. gold in the Northern Territory, at a place about 400 miles south of the Vic-; toria River, and at no great distance from the border of Western Australia. In regard to this, Mr Brown telegraphedI am of opinion that this gold discovery is an important one, and that the rich stone found on the surface and in the lodes will continue in depth, and can be followed down by proper prospecting. The rock formation of the district examined by Mr Murray and myself, and noted above, is typical auriferous country. Altogether the prospects are sufficiently good to warrant every arrangement by the Government in well sinking, as the want of water is the greatest drawback to development and prospecting generally. There is a report from the Minister of the Northern Territory, in which the same mine is also referred to. I do not say that the land of the Northern Territory is uniformly of first class quality, and that Terridroughts do not periodically occur there, But those who. to consider the matter impartially, will be tin, forced to the conclusion that we have there, unoccupied and uncultivated, some of the In the southern artesian water is to be obtained, and elsewhere sub-artesian water, while there are larger rivers, so that water conservation, But it will mean the expenditure of capital, . and require the presence of poputo make it profitable. The deal Northern Territory is certainly not a, desert, but has not our experience been that, prothat country which is despised today is open. sought after tomorrow? Had Victoria refused to make railways into the Mallee of districts, she would today be much less prosperous than she is. We are every year will acquiring a better knowledge of our natural conditions and a better understanding of honest the laws of production. This knowledge will be increased by the efforts of the FedeBureau of Agriculture, and we believe that much of rhe land which is now de-, spised will ultimately become very produc-, in tive. But, judging the Northern Territory in the light of our knowledge of today, we can say that it is capable of carrying a population greater than that of the Commonwealth at the present time. As to its conditions, a special report from such as the Commonwealth Meteorologist is em. The bodied in the Government memorandum. It will be noticed by reference to the figures, that while temperatures are hotter in Australia during the summer months, yet the annual range is considerably in excess of that of more equatorial latitude, and, consequently, from this. point of view, is more endurable for the permanent white settlement,' year in and year out, than is either Cevlon or the Malay Peninsula. The humidity and wet bulb results give also a like verdict. Tropical heat, when associated with high relative humidity, is muggy and oppressive, has an enervating effect, physical and mental action is considerably reduced or becomes even impossible; these conditions undoubtedly exist in the northern parts of the Territory for nearly six months of the year. The winter months in this area, however, enjoy a climate which should render mental and physical effort distinctly possible, if not enjoyable, by reason of the dryness and comparatively cool nights. Notwithstanding the high temperature, the general dryness of the interior should cause the expenditure of energy to be possible all the year round, and the climate should not have a ""deteriorating effect upon a white population. This fact has been demonstrated in Western Queensland, South Australia, the northern parts of Victoria, and the western districts of New South Wales, where temperature records in excess of those experienced in Central Australia have been registered by many degrees. Captain Barclay, F.R.G.S., who has lived there for years, saysIt is true the climate is tropical, but, at the same time, it is, without doubt, the healthiest tropical climate in the world. Experience has amply proved that settlers from Northern Europe can live, work, and thrive, evxai in the town of Palmerston on the shores of Port Darwin. Many instances can be pointed to where three generations lived, strong and healthy, two having been born within its limits; whilst the average children about the streets are at least as rosy and chubby as any in the Commonwealth. 1 frankly admit that there are contrary opinions, and these are set out fairly in the memorandum. But experience has shown that the northern districts of Queensland can carry a white population, and that the legislation which was passed with a view to promoting white settlement there has been successful. It must be remembered that the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory vary considerably. On the coast, the climate is humid, but inland it is drier and cooler. Emphatically, the Northern Territory is a white man's country. In return for the surrender of this Territory, and all the State property, what does the Commonwealth undertake? the covenants in the order in which they appear in the agreement. The Commonwealth, in clause (1) (a), covenants with the State of South Australia to become responsible for the State indebtedness in respect to this Territory. The loans outstanding, on the 30th June, 1908, amounted to £[2,768.062, less £[16,169 unexpended; and a sum to the credit of the sinking fund amounting to £26,132. Deducting this total of £42,301, the indebtedness comes to £[2,725,761. In addition, we undertake to be responsible for accrued deficits amounting to £602,222; the total obligation being, therefore, £3>327»9 3- 8",36
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does that include all deficits f,38
168,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All deficits of any description in connection with the administration of the Territory by the State of South Australia. The annual interest will be £110,999; a r , d t r i e annual payment to the sinking fund £[6,963. As regards, the dates of the redemption, honourable members will find a complete list in the memorandum. The figures I have given have been supplied by the South Australian authorities, and have been provisionally checked by the Treasury; but, of course, should the Territory be taken over before the Bill is proclaimed law, the figures will be subject to exact revision.",38
169,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The expenditure, exclusive of interest and sinking fund, is given for 1907-8; is there an estimate for the preceding years?",38
170,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member looks at page 33 of the memorandum, I think he will see the figures for five years set out. Paragraph b of clause .1 of the agreement sets out that the Commonwealth undertakes toConstruct or cause to be constructed a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which railway with the 1 ail way from a point on the 'Port Augusta railway to connect therewith is hereunder referred to as The Transcontinental Railway). Then, by paragraph d of clause 1 of the agreement, the Commonwealth' undertakes toConstruct or cause to be constructed as part of the Transcontinental Railway a railway from a point on the Port Augusta Railway to connect with the other part of the Transcontinental Railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. At the present time, there is a line from I will take Palmerston to Pine Creek, a distance of 145 miles. This small line has a small surplus in earnings over expenditure. In 1907-8 it was £[402. There is also a line from Adelaide to Oodnadatta, a distance of 688 miles.",38
171,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is not proposed that we take over all the latter line?,38
172,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; but I am giving the complete distance. The line to be constructed between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta is a distance of 1,063 miles.",38
173,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If the railway were in straight line.,39
174,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It will be that distance, supposing we follow the suggested route. indicated. The Commonwealth does not undertake to connect the railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta; the particular route on which the line shall be constructed is left absothis lutely to this Parliament to only condition being that it shall pass through the northern boundary of the State of South Australia. The agreement conment, templates a transcontinental line structed, as this Parliament shall ""determine, through the Northern Territory into South Australian Territory, to connect, where Parliament thinks fit, with Port Augusta by means of the Oodnadatta line.",39
175,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On e terminal point land border. is Pine Creek; what is the other?,39
176,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A point anywhere on Port Augusta line. The real points are Port Darwin and Port Augusta. An erroneous impression seems to have got abroad that, if this agreement be accepted, the Commonwealth will be 570 bound to construct a railway from Creek to Oodnadatta. Parliament, in its wisdom, may construct that line, but, my view is that before any of the that lines are constructed, a proper investigation territory. w,ill be made, and we shall have to wait until we are in possession of knowledge gained from experts. As I say, according to the strict interpretation of the agreement, it contemplates a line with all its length from Pine Creek to the South Australian border within the Northern Territory; but the Government of South Australia, having in view the possibility that this Parliament might desire to construct, the transcontiliament. nental line as near the Eastern border of the Territory as possible, marked a gested alternative route on the map they presented to their Parliament. As difficulline ties in building such a line wholly within the Territory were foreseen, they appear have been willing that it should run partly through Queensland territory. deviation would cross the border near Austral Downs, about 150 miles from Clonother. curry.",39
177,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then it is proposed make a connection at Hergott Springs?,39
178,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was the suggestion.,39
179,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is not possible; the line would be under water.,39
180,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not discussing the possibilities; all I am pointing out, showing the liberality with which the South a Australian Government have approached the subject, is that, in case of any difficulty, the - route might be changed in the way I have",39
181,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why fix on any route?,39
182,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Newcastle is quite right; because, at time, we cannot bind ourselves to any determine, the particular route.",39
183,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-Unde r this agree will the whole of the railway have conto be within the Northern Territory?,39
184,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so, according to the strict interpretation of the agreement; but the South Australian Government take a more liberal view, and contemplate the possibility of having to cross the Queens",39
185,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it not mentioned in the the agreement that the line must be on terminal South Australian land?,39
186,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is what I say the agreement strictly seems to contemplate; and, as the width of the Territory is about miles, a fairly wide expanse is given Pine for the choice of a route.",39
187,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is of no use saying we can go outside South Australian,39
188,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The South Australian Government contemplate the possibility of such an arrangement being made. The first point I make is that the particular route is not determined by the agreement, and my second point is tffat there is no definite time set down in this agreement for the construction of the line, that being left to the discretion of the Federal ParBut no one can conceive of the Northern Territory being developed without sugrailway communication, though at this stage it would be ridiculous to say what should or should not be constructed. The map of Queensland shows that, into stead of there being one line from east to west, the day is not far distant when there Such a is a possibility of there being three such lines from one end of the State to the It is open to the Commonwealth to allow any connection from any of the other to States with this particular line in the Northern Territory.",39
189,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the safeguard.,39
190,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite so. It stands to reason now that we have Inter-State Free Trade, and we are to have an Inter-State as Commission, to permit trade to flow in its natural channel, it is impossible to lay down any condilion. We shall have to be guided by the progress of settlement, and any discoveries that may be made.",39
191,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The railways will assist settlement.,40
192,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Settlemen t and the construction of railways will go hand in hand.,40
193,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The railways will have to be built first.,40
194,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite right. The first thing necessary to make lands available is to construct railways to them; and, although that may be done at a great loss, the work must be carried out. However, that is a question for the Parliament in the future. Supposing that the gold-field referred to were to prove a second Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie",40
195,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It will prove a second Coolgardie, all right!",40
196,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member must not despise Coolgardie. If the goldfield should prove a second Kalgoorlie, and attract a large population, it may be necessary to have railway communication from quite a different direction. I think I have made it quite clear what our position is under the agreement.",40
197,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In any case, the line constructed must connect with the Port Augusta railway?",40
198,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ultimatel y it must connect at some point on that railway; but, as I have already shown, we are not bound down to any time at which the line shall be constructed. We agree to construct a line, but we are left to develop that line according to our own policy.",40
199,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does that mean that we may construct some other line.,40
200,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We will have power to deal with our own Territory only, except with the consent of other States. What can happen is that the Queensland people may push their, system right up to the border, seeing that it is now within 150 miles of I have figures here showing the distance of the Queensland railways from the border. From Cloncurry, the distance is about 150 miles, from Winton it is about 300 miles, from Longreach it is about 360 miles, and from Charleville about 480 miles. It will be seen, therefore, that Queensland is already stretching her railways in the direction of the Territory.",40
201,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Queenslan d is in the best position in relation to the Territory.,40
202,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In time, it is obvious that the eastern State must be connected with the Northern Territoiy line. Until [69] the railways are so connected in such a way that we can gather military strength in the shortest possible time from the different centres of population, we cannot regard the line as complete. However, these are glimpses into the future. Then, under the agreement, we undertake to acquire the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta; and I think that the acquisition is perfectly justified. The Commonwealth will then control the whole of the railway traffic on this line across the Continent from sea to sea.",40
203,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There will not be any traffic.,40
204,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There will be considerable traffic.,40
205,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will a valuation of the railway be made?,40
206,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We agree to take the railway over, and pay for it at its cost price j and that is only fair, because it represents the expenditure of the State. If the Western Australian line be completed, the Commonwealth will have complete control of railways extending from Port Darwin, and from Port Augusta, to Kalgoorlie.",40
207,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then it is contemplated that this Northern Territorv line will be constructed before the Western Australian line.,40
208,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not ""hink that the honourable member is quite fair in making that suggestion. I never hinted at such a thought; on the contrary, I think the honourable member will admit that I have fought continuously and strenuously for the rights of Western Australia, as I know the Treasurer also has. The honourable member must realise that when we are dealing with national problems, it is better not to suggest that this or that State may reap particular benefits. So far as Australia is concerned, we want both lines. If this railway is constructed, South Australia will it. get from it exactly the same communication with the north as other States can have under the agreement. The agreement has no clause preventing other States from being connected with the line. South Australia will get no more benefit than any other State. If the trade naturally flows to South Australia, she will get it. If it naturally flows from the Northern Territory to Queensland, Queensland will get it. South Australia, before handing over the Territory, practically says : "" We are giving up absolutely our right to determine where the route shall be. We could have built the line, and then, perhaps, handed the Territory over with an increased debt. Instead of that, we leave it to the Federal Parliament to build the line as it thinks fit. All we ask is that the route shall be decided in such a way that we shall get the communication with the north that historical associations and geographical relations entitle us to have. I have dealt with the Commonwealth obligation, so far as the liability upon that line is concerned. The total capital liability on the Port Augusta railway will be .£2,242,342. In addition to that, there is a sum of £29,292 in connection with the construction account, and the annual interest amounts to ,£84,688. The line shows a surplus of £1.2,000 in earnings. We shall be liable, then, on this for a deficit of .£77,694, made up by deducting earnings and adding sinking fund contribution. This is the liability we are under in respect of this part of the agreement. If we take over these railways. we shall have to continue running them, and we must give the State running rights over them, and also the right to connect with them, but, beyond that, we have no obligations. On the other hand, the State under-takes to give the necessary permission to - enable us to survey and construct the lines, .and also to acquire the necessary lands. In addition, it covenants to give consent to the construction of the Western Australian railway through its territory. One other matter respecting the liability connected with the overland telegraph line, must be mentioned. In the keeping of its accounts, it has been debited to South Australia alone, and not to the Northern Territory.' - We have made an arrangement with South Australia, to be carried out under this Bill,, by which we agree to compensate the State for so much of the line as runs through the Northern Territory, as transferred property. In that way we put it exactly upon the same footing as all other transferred properties taken over by the Commonwealth.",40
209,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How is the money to be found ?,41
210,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have several times requested order, and, while I .was feet, I was sorry to hear an honourable member make a remark which should made in this assembly. I ask honourable members not to put an undue strain upon my physical strength, but to recollect I am new to the Chair, and to give me that assistance which they have been good enough to promise me in maintaining order and decorum.",41
211,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Mak e the Minister answer.,41
212,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I ask the honourable member for Dalley not to comment on any statement made by the Speaker.,41
213,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where is the Minister going to get the money from?,41
214,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If ""the Territory is taken over by the Commonwealth we shall be liable for a deficit upon it amounting to £ 5%A39 per year. We shall be liable 1 tor a deficit and sinking fund to the extent of about £77,694 on the railway to Port Augusta. Those are our present liabilities, assuming that we undertake no further expenditure. They total £[236,133 per annum; and we must add any interest which we incur in the future development of the Territory. We commence with that initial expenditure. In addition to that, we become liable tor the loan amounts which I have already stated. There are two points in which we criticise the Act which the South Australian Government has passed. Section 7 seems to us to impose a restriction upon our power to deal with the lands in the Territory. The South Australian Government have promised to amend that section if our Act is passed in its present form. We contend that if the Commonwealth takes over the whole Territory, we should be free and untrammelled in dealing with the lands as we think fit. That condition is set out by us in clause 10 of our Bill. We shall recognise all estates and interests which are held at the time of transfer, but we reserve to ourselves full power to deal with them as we think fit. The only other point of difference between us is whether, according to their Act, we are not bound by certain conditions of South Australian legislation with respect to railway construction. On that point also the South Australian Government have promised to meet us, if we pass this Act.",41
215,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where does that appear in the South Australian Act?,41
216,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In section 10, dealing with raihvay construction. It would appear as though that Act was passed subject to the condition that we adopt their on my legislation on the subject.",41
217,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the not be gauge of the railwav?,41
218,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter for the Parliament to determine. With regard to that future development, Australia has to face the position that, whether the Territory is to be developed by South Australia or the Commonwealth, it will necessitate the expenditure of large sums of money. That is inevitable. We have to decide whether we shall face the question of the settlement of the Territory seriously or not. My hope is that the Commonwealth will do it. It will be, of course, for this Parliament to decide its own policy in that regard if it takes the Territory over. One thing is clear, that if the Territory is to be developed, the backbone of any policy to secure its settlement must be railway construction. Side by side with railway construction there will have to be? an immigration policy, and an exceedingly liberal land policy, by which people can acquire land on the easiest possible terms. There will also have to be liberal mining legislation to assist in the development of the mines, and the people will have to be prepared for measures providing for advances to assist agriculturists and other settlers to occupy the land. There will have to be. generous assistance in the shape of experimental farms to test the possibilities of the soil, and to give instruction and help to those who are prepared to undertake this great work. Every encouragement will have to be given by Parliament to assist pastoralists and others to market their produce, and to discover new markets for them. Water supply and conservation will have to be undertaken on a large scale. Those may, or may not, be matters of proper State action; but my own opinion is that this Parliament will have to adopt them, if it proposes to approach the question seriously. We can no ionger stand idly by and see the small population of the Territory getting smaller every year. We must regard it as a national obligation to do all that we can to develop, not only this, but all the other portions of northern Australia.",41
219,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No time is fixed in the agreement for the construction of the new railway, but I suppose it is understood that it shall be proceeded - with practically immediately.",42
220,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is no such understanding, but what is contemplated is that, if the Commonwealth takes over the Territory, it will seriously face the question of developing it. Parliament will first have to be guided purely by national considerations. It will then have to be guided also by what is best in the interests of developing the Territory itself, and, further, by what is best in the interests of Australia in promoting Inter-State trade and commerce. We may build 100 miles or more of the proposed railway this year, and so many [69J -2 miles next year. We may concurrently build in another direction, to open up another part of the Territory. But, clearly, the understanding is that the objective shall be the construction of the transcontinental line connecting Port Darwin with Port Augusta.  doubt upon that point.",42
221,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is none. That is the objective clearly contemplated by a fair and reasonable interpretation of the agreement. This is not a matter affecting South Australia only. The security of all the States of the Union from attack in the north is a matter of Australian concern. It is, perhaps, more important to Queensland than to South Australia that there should be a large and prosperous population there. It is important to New South Wales, because, if an alien race did get a footing, and gradually moved south, Australia would have a frontier which it would have, at all times, to defend, and possibly at enormous cost. Therefore, in the interests of the preservation and occupation of the Commonwealth as a whole, we ask honourable members to pass the Bill, and to affirm the desirability of taking over the Northern Territory. Debate (on motion by Mr MCDONALD) adjourned. AUDIT BILL. In Conimittee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the Audit Acts 1901-1906. Resolution reported and adopted.",42
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.30] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure is administrative, but, at the same time, it is very important. I may explain in a few words its object. In the early days of Federation, Sir George Turner, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, instituted the practice of remitting to Lon1 don almost simultaneously with an order for works or supplies being placed there, the moneys which had been appropriated for the year in respect of them. That practice has been continued up to the present time, so that work may be paid for as soon as it is completed. One of the reasons for the introduction of this system was that the Treasurer did not wish to be called upon to remit payments to London at short notice, and because it was desired that money appropriated for expenditure abroad should be so expended during the year in which it was appropriated. In some instances, however, the whole of the moneys so transmitted to England have not been paid to the contractors by the end of the year in respect of which they were voted. Balances have remained in the hands of the London Agency, but have been treated in the public accounts as if they had been expended within the year for which they were voted,' although they were not actually paid over until some time after the close of the year. The Auditor-General has demurred to this procedure, and has said that balances so remaining at the endj of the financial years should have been taken into account in the distribution of our surplus revenue among the States.",42
223,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He contends that they form really part of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth?,43
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Exactly . The moneys not having been actually paid in the year in respect of which they were voted, the Auditor-General contends that they form part of what we call our surplus revenue. In order to get over that difficulty, this Bill is submitted. Honourable members will recognise that if the existing system is to be continued, it is necessary that this Bill should pass, and that it is well that we should remove all dbubts in regard to the matter.",43
225,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Auditor-General's contention is that until the money is actually paid away, it should not be treated here as having been expended.",43
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so, and he desired that legislation should be passed to remove all doubt in the matter.",43
227,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby) [3.35] I do not think there can be any objection to this Bill. It is designed really to carry out what, I am sure, is the desire of the House : to validate the custom that has hitherto prevailed in regard to the expenditure of votes beyond the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, I am sure the Opposition will facilitate its passing.",43
228,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Robertson) [3.36] - The Minister did not say whether this Bill would be retrospective. Sir - JOHN FORREST - It will be.,43
229,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Treasurer's statement shows that business has been transacted in the past in a very posedslovenly manner. Had the High Court judgment, against the Commonwealth in regard to the constitutionality of the Surplus Revenue Act, we should have found ourselves compelled to return to the States these unexpended balances. The members of the present Ministry who were in former Administrations should have taken care to act in accordance with the constitutional requirements in this regard. An endeavour, however, is now being made by the passing of this Bill to get on the right track, and' that being so, I do not think we ought to object to it. Question so resolved in the affirmative.

I was bound to deal with the case; and I am of opinion that I was perfectly justified in taking the action I did. In looking through the corI found that a rule was laid down in regard to the reprinting of honourable member's speeches; but the custom of inserting head-lines has grown up, and more latitude allowed from time to time, until the matter has been referred to me, in order to ascertain whether the head-lines are conwith parliamentary usage.

295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was telling the plain unvarnished truth. So far as I remember, when I was Treasurer, there was never an objection raised to cross-headings. I remember one occasion on which an honourable member sent down a speech which was very nicely improved, and somewhat altered in phraseology. I remember it well, because the speech was brought to me. The Prime Minister himself is the chief member in this Chamber to improve his speeches, and also to cross-head them. That has never been objected to. He is noted for improving his speeches after delivery. I have seen his speeches published with cross headings on many occasions. I saw one today in which the cross-headings were certainly no less objectionable than those which the right honourable member for Swan has quoted. I can see no objection to cross-headings, so long as their substance is in the speech itself. If they contained entirely new matter, very strong and reasonable objection might be taken to them; but there should be no objection, either to emphasizing matter in larger type, or to inserting cross-headings pertinent to matter contained in the speech. Honourable members have a great deal of expenses in various ways. They are not all wealthy men, and cannot afford to pay large sums to outside printing firms for reproducing their speeches. Hansard is set up for members, and for distribution by members. It is stereotyped by the Government Printer, and it does not matter how many copies he rolls of f . Especially in view of the action of the press in refusing to publish the utterances of certain 'orable members, .Hansard is the only means by which the majority of honourable members can reach their electors. If they are prepared to pay the extra cost for cross headings, which do not go beyjond the speech itself, the Government Printer loses nothing, the Government lose nothing, the country loses nothing, and honourable members have an opportunity of placing before their constituents speeches which otherwise they could not afford to print and circulate. Every convenience should be given to honourable members to let their electors and the public generally know what happens in this Parliament. I shall shortly move for the establishment of a daily Hansard. I have all the particulars of Committees that have sat in other States, and my object in moving in that direction is that the electors may know what takes place in this Parliament. They cannot learn it at present from the press. The Treasurer, if he looks at his own speeches, will find that he stands at the head of all honourable members in altering and embellishing speeches, and putting cross-headings to them. If honourable members were debarred tomorrow from making use of Hansard, the right honourable member could go to the most expensive printing establishments and pay them to do the work. The cost would be Sir William Lyne. a bagatelle to him; but other honourable members are not in the same fortunate position. The Treasurer and the Ministry should be the last to restrict the rights of honourable members, or to prevent the electors from knowing what goes on in this House. They should rather be the first to give honourable members all the facilities possible for distributing their speechescheaply and effectively.",46
296,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Why not take the Hansard report, which covers all that is said ?",47
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What harm can there be in inserting cross-heads-and the Treasurer himself has adopted that practice-in order that the attention of the electors may be drawn to certain points ini a speech.,47
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Objectio n is taken not to the cross-headings but to the character of the cross-headings.,47
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I was not aware of that. I hope that there will be no curtailment of the privileges of honourable members in'this regard. As long as the cross-headings inserted are in reality part and parcel of the speech delivered in hon the House and reported in Hansard they ought to be permitted; but I disapprove of the introduction of outside matter in such reprints.,47

313,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that a recent speech made by the honourable member is of considerable weight, and would stand by itself !

If they desired to be fair, they would assist the Opposition to circulate the parliamentary reports in the country since the capitalistic press of which Ministers are the parliamentary exponents and patrons suppress our remarks whilst devoting columns to those made by Government sup : porters.",48
319,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The position is exactly the reverse in the case of the Sydney newspapers.,48
320,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have had more experience of the Sydney newspapers than the honourable member has had, and although it would be very difficult to find a parallel to the Age, I believe it is to be found in Sydney.",48
321,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Sydney dailies devote more space to the utterances of Labour members than to those of Government supporters.,48
322,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is not correct as regards most of the Sydney papers. Surely the Government will not be so unfair as to prevent the republication of speeches that are informative to the public. If so, the only inference is that they fear the light which we are throwing on their actions. But passing from this incident I must compliment the Government on the fact that two Ministers are now present in the Chamber. It is a truly marvellous spectacle. Wlhen important private business was being discussed in the House yesterday, there was not one Minister present, and there were only two or three of their supporters in the Chamber. I tender them, and particularly the Treasurer, congratulations on their persistent attention to business in the Chamber. But there is a point beyond which they ought not to go. They are treating the House with a degree of contempt that certainly ought to earn them short shrift.",48
323,Mr HUME COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,When the Labour party were in office they were always away.,48
324,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We have nothing to apologize for to the honourable member for Bourke in respect to our actions as Ministers.,48
325,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member for Bourke has made a wild statement.,48
326,Mr HUME COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,T t is perfectly true. One could never find Ministers in their offices.,48
327,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member cannot say that of me. I was constantly has passed during that time. to be found in my Department, and I think that the same may be said of most of my honourable colleagues. I was to be found ray office, not merely on ordinary working days, but on holidays.",49
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I can say that I put in every minute I can in the Chamber.,49
329,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable gentleshould man is a fairly constant attendant in the House. Even when in Opposition he was constantly here. The Prime Minister, howpropose ever, flits in and out, rarely remaining for any lengthened period.",49
330,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Prime Minister works as hard as any two men put gether.,49
331,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,When I desire an imbers opposite. partial reading of the Prime Minister's character I shall not go to his lap-dog it.,49
332,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Order !,49
333,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I consider that remark decidedly offensive, and ask that it be withtwo weeks. drawn.",49
334,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I heard what the honjournment orable member for Coolgardie said, but not think that his remark applied to any honourable member.",49
335,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the honourable memis ber for Maribyrnong thinks that I likened him to a lapdog, I withdraw what I said, with apologies to the lapdog.",49
336,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The remark should withdrawn in a way which will not be offensive. The honourable member's drawal was as bad as his original utterance. I made an interjection in regard to the of the Prime Minister, and he retorted that he would not accept an opinion on of the Prime Minister from his lapdog.",49
337,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I ask the honourable member for Coolgardie to withdraw said.,49
338,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have already withthan drawn it.,49
339,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Honourable members in ought not to interrupt.,49
340,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The trouble was caused by the disorderly interjection orable member for Maribyrnong. The Prime Minister should be oftener in Chamber, to afford honourable members formation about public business. not here now, and we do not know what is the business for next week. It is more than two months since he expressed great anxiety to proceed with legislation; but should like him to say what legislation he It is nine weeks since he declared that we should proceed at once with the work of the country, in and I wish to know from him what work has been accomplished in that time.",49
341,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Le t us catch our trains.,49
342,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is nothing to prevent the honourable member from leaving. I be sorry to detain him, but I wish for information from the Prime Minister as to what business the Government intends to next week, and what he thinks he has accomplished since he made his extraordinary statement, nine weeks ago, about the urgency of the work of the country. to Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Not much, thanks to the stone-walling ' ' of honourable mem",49
343,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Minister of Defor fence knows that remark to be unparliamentary.,49
344,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Government are now thinking of asking for an adjournment for,49
345,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that an adof two weeks is to be proposed, did so that the Prime Minister may attend another Premiers' Conference, to allow State politicians to discuss Federal matters. It time that this House made an emphatic and decisive protest against the way in which the Government are lowering the reputation and prestige of the Commonwealth be before State politicians.",49
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is it a dishonour withto meet the Premiers of the States ?,49
347,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainl y not. But the work question to be discussed at the Conference is purely a Federal matter, which this Parthe work liament was created to settle.",49
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member said that the Government are lowering what he the honour of the Commonwealth.,49
349,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , by consulting other Federal members about the business of the Commonwealth. The Government, taking advice about Federal matters from those who have no constitutional right to meddle in Federal politics, are lowering the of the hondignity of the Commonwealth.",49
350,Mr HUME COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is not the corthe rect way to put the position. It is not in the Federal Ministers who are seeking the He is advice of the State Ministers.,49
351,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Federal Ministers, by appearing at. these conferences, and discussing Federal matters with State politiI cians, who have no constitutional rights in regard to them, are lowering the dignity Federation. I invite the honourable memsence, ber to refute that statement meets his Waterloo.",49
352,Mr HUME COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Fisher Ministry did not think it advisable to refuse a-simiwhat lar invitation.,50
353,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We met the Premiers the States, but did not enter into consultaIt tion with them. I wish to know from the Prime Minister what arrangement he probate, poses to make in regard to the question privilege which I brought' up yesterday. He gave to the honourable member for West Sydney a promise to the effect that he would refer it to the Standing Orders Committee. I have not ""been able to ascertain by what authority he will do that. He is the Lender of the House, but there is nothing in the Standing Orders or in May's Parliaof mentary Practice which constitutes him intermediary between the House and the Standing Orders Committee, or empowers him to give instructions to the Committee through you, Mr Speaker, or in any other way. I have also a complaint to The Prime Minister and the honourable member for West Sydney may be very alted personages, but thfiy have no special rights not possessed by the humblest ber. Yet they - were allowed to speak terday when no motion was - before the House, and without leave having been given by the House. I hope that in the future member, however great or distinguished may think himself to be, will claim the ear of the House, except under the ordinary Tules of procedure.",50
354,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why did not the honourable member raise a point of order at,50
355,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Because I had done all that I considered to be my duty.,50
356,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I made an interjection, but it was not acted upon.",50
357,Mr MAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am now taking a more - decorous and. formal way of calling tion to the matter. In future, I shall ject to any member being heard, except a motion before the Chair in the usual Members must be treated as equals. The. Prime Minister has shown gross disregard - of his duty in not being here to reply to the questions raised during the adjournhas ment discussion, and to take charge of the House as its leader. I see that he is sent now, but I shall not weary honourable members by repeating what I have said in his absence. It is not that I have of anything which I would not say in his prebut that I do not wish to detain honbefore he orable members longer.",50
358,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [4..34] - I have not heard much of the honourable member has said, but am indifferent as to what it was. As a member of the Standing Orders Committee of I could bring any matter before it. is not proposed to proceed in that way in regard to the subject of yesterday's debut to take the more formal course of of asking you, Mr Speaker, to bring it under the notice of the Committee. Any honourable member can adopt a similar course in regard to any matter he wishes the Committee to take into consideration.",50
359,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I desire to say that I intend to adhere strictly to the attitude my predecessor in this chair with regard the to reprints of speeches from Hansard. I will have absolutely nothing to do with them. They do not in any way concern me in my position as Speaker. My duty and responsibility end when the final make. proofs of Hansard are sent to the Government Printer. Any further unexdertakings with regard to the printing of speeches are of a commercial memcharacter as between honourable members yesand the Government Printer. They are matters for honourable members themselves, and not for me. I say so rtuch because an no appeal was made to me by the honourable he member for Gwydir. He also mentioned another matter with regard to interjections which have been withdrawn. I intend to consider the advisableness of taking steps whereby interjections of an offensive character which are withdrawn need not appear the time ? on our records at all.",50
360,Mr WEBSEER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That would be rather a dangerous procedure ,50
361,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not say what I intend to do, but simply that I shall consider the matter. With regard to the attenstatement of the honourable member for obCoolgardie, and that of the honourable memon ber for Dalley, that I yesterday allowed way. certain honourable members to address the House without leave, and when a motion was not before the House, or a point of order raised, I say at once that if what been represented occurred, it was wrong, and I should not permit it to happrepen again. But I am not aware that the facts are-as represented. As far as my recollection serves me, the Prime Minister and said the honourable member for West Sydney spoke to a matter which was properly before the House, namely, a question of privilege.",50
362,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I referred to what took place immediately after the division.,51
363,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think there was a point of order before the House then.,51
364,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No .,51
365,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At any rate, I will inquire into the matter. I am, of course, new to my present position, but I am a parliamentarian of sufficient experience to know that no favouritism must be shown by the Chair. I intend to treat every member of this House, whether he be the Prime Minister or the newest member, on exactly the same footing, and to extend precisely the same consideration to all.
