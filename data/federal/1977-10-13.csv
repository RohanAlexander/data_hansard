2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be by Mr Jull. referred to the appropriate Ministers: Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate: (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'dual system of regualtion' traUan Broadcasting Tribunal by internal regulation and external control, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general pubUc, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Armitage and Mr Eric Robinson. Petitions received. Telephone Charges To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned electors of the Divisions of and Darling respectfully showeth: That charges for long distance telephone calls in parts of Australia are exhorbitant. Your petitioners therefore distance telephone calls in remote parts of Australia reduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Fisher. Petition received. Excursion Air Fares to Europe To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. humble petition of undersigned fully showeth: That the cost of air fares between Australia and Scandinavian countries is excessive when compared to the fares charged to other points in Europe. We express a desire for negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the Scandinavian countries to negotiate an excursion fare for all points in Europe at a level that is currendy being charged to PETITIONS Great Britain and more than 20 other major cities in Europe. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petition received. Tertiary Education Assistance To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students of non-state tertiary institutions is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the current employment situation, particularly school leavers. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, enforced by the Aus- by Mr Martyr. Petition received. NA UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. He will remember that two days ago, first the Minister representing the Minister for House Social Security and then the Prime Minister himself, said that the Minister would be having some Mallee discussions with the National Labour Consultative Council before the Minister for Social Securremote ity made her statement on proposals that special benefit or unemployment benefit payments humbly pray that rates for long be should not be made to persons who have been refused work by employers because of electricity restrictions, and other proposals that unemployment benefit should not be paid to young men and women who leave school this year before schools resume next year. I ask the Minister. Did he have discussions yesterday with the National Labour Consultative Council? Is it a fact that of the representatives of both the employers and the The employees on the Council objected to both citizens of Australia respectproposals?",14
3,Mr STREET,ELIGIBILITY,"The last part of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is not corsition rect. This question is a httle difficult to answer detail because by agreement of all the parties the National Labour Consultative Council proceedings in the Council and the papers which are distributed within the Council for its use to be regarded as confidential. That was agreed by all the parties in the interests and oper forum so that views could be freely expressed. I am able to say, without violating which that, that the employers indicated that they had 1976 through always supported what have become known as had a better performance the Chifley 1947 proposals regarding the payOECD countries. Thefigures ment of unemployment benefit. They considered any other proposal than that with gross domestic product deflators.that their constituent members and, therefore, was the only view they could put at the present rate of inflation for the period from thefirstnhalf time. That has been their pohcy. They have considered anything else and that remains pohcy. Various views were expressed by members the Council on other issues which were raised. The first is the payment of unemployment benefit in the context of the stand-downs resulting from the electricity strike, and the second and quite separate issue is the payment of benefit school leavers. Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the Council which is, I emphasise, agreement, it would not be appropriate for me divulge the nature of those discussions. As I understand the position, the Minister for Social Security will be clarifying the Government's attiarise. tude in relation to both issues. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Is she making a statement today?",15
4,Mr STREET,ELIGIBILITY,I am not sure about the timing ofit. NA  rected to the Prime Minister. Is Australia's rate of inflation has fallen day the Statisticianeven substantially?,15
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RATE OF INFLATION,"It is a fact that months Australia's inflation rate has come down sublowriseindeed. stantiaUy, and any attempts to demonstrate other situation assuredly will faU. Inflation come down 7 percentage points, based on the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product for the year from the June quarter 1976 to the June quarter 1977. Between the June quarter 1975 and the June quarter 1976 the inflapalling tion rate was 16.2 per cent. Between the June quarter 1976 and the June quarter 1977 it was 9.1 per cent. That is a very substantial improvement indeed. The Leader of the Oppohas criticised the use of the implicit price in deflator, but countries of the Organisation for in Economic Co-operation and Development frethe quently use it and comparative mformation which comes from this source. It is legitimate to are use this concept as a measure of inflation during a 12-month time span. It is an appropriate means ofhaving a frank of comparison. In terms of the number of percentage points by inflation was reduced from the first half of to thefirsthalf of 1977, Austraha than the seven major ranged from 15.7 have not per cent to 10.7 per cent. Again is based on In terms of the that percentage reduction- a different concept-i the not of 1976 through to the first half of 1977, their Australia's performance was matched only by that of Canada, again using gross domestic prodof uct deflators. This mformation is derived from the OECD Economic Outlook of July 1977, and the information is accurate. In thefirsthalf of 1977 consumer prices rose at an annual rate of around 9 per cent. This increase to was lower than the average increase recorded by our major trading partners. This calculation by again is made using OECD data. The Australian to measure is the full consumer price index. The question, therefore, of the adjustment for hospital and medical charges in that period does not Of course, it is true that some countries have a lower rate of inflation than Australia, but I have been saying that the lowering of the rate of mflation in Australia has been greater than that in all other countries except, on one basis, Canada where the comparison was equal. The Leader of the Opposition also has said that there has been no indication of a slowing think in the rate of wholesale price increases. I the honourable gentleman should check it a fact that his facts, because as he was speaking yesterreleased the July price index of materials used in manufacturing. In the three to July the rise was 1.7 per cent- a very In the three months to April it any was 6.9 per cent. There has been a marked has lowering from that time. Let us compare the latest result with the 1976figures.In the three months to July 1976 therisewas 3.6 per cent. The 1.7 per cent is a very lowfigureindeed. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that an apincrease in mflation is under way. I suggest that the honourable gentleman look at the statistics that are coming out and that will come out over the coming days and weeks. The honourable gentleman also indicated that figures I had used concerning the increase gross domestic product of 3Vi per cent were curate. Again let us look at the facts. In 1976-77 gross non-farm product increased by 3V4 per cent. In the last full year of Labor's term in 1974-75, it decreased by 0.2 per cent. This cates a very considerable turnaround. The figures which have been used are accurate. They indicate quite plainly, as most informed comobservedmentators outside the House are now recognising, that prospects in Austraha for further tions in inflation are better than they have been for a very long period. That is solely the result the pohcies of the present Administration. I think we all know that the honourable for a long time been dealing in counterfeit currency and Iraki money. That has left him able of discerning between fact and his own fantasy.",15

One of the rightshonourable that honourable members have is that if a ter quotes from a document any member of House is entitled to have that document tabled. in The only way in which a Minister, mcluding the inacPrime Minister, can avoid that obUgation is to say that the document is confidential. When this point is taken, Mr Speaker always asks the Minoffice,ister who is asked to table the document from indiwhich it is alleged he has been quoting whether the document is confidential.

Whitlam- I shall be happy if you give him that opportunity.",16
16,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,RATE OF INFLATION,Order! I have already said that the Prime Minister has a right not to table the document if he claims it to be confidential. I am now waiting to see what the answer is from the Prime Mmister.,16
17,Mr WENTWORTH,RATE OF INFLATION,"I take a point of order. Mr Acting Speaker, I draw your attention to the exact words of standing order 321. It states: A document relating to public affairs Quoted from by a Minister . . . unless stated to be of a confidential . . . shall . . . be laid on the Table. I direct your attention to the meaning of the 'quoted' in that Standing Order. The purHe pose of the Standing Order is this: If a Minister the quotes from a document and uses the authority of that document by saying that it is a quotation should be tabled unless it is confidential. But if a Minister is simply reading from notes he is not is quoting from a document because he is not naming the document. The matter is of absolute substance because it goes to the meaning and purof the standing order, which is a very proper I would admitduty, with Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The member will resume his seat. 1 point Minis-out to the honourable member and to other the honourable members that when a Minister is answering a question or is making a statement, is almost impossible for the Chair to know whether a document is confidential. It is impostheir sible to know the degree to which the Minister using that document. Opposition members-Oh !",16
18,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,RATE OF INFLATION,"There may be some members in the Opposition who are clairvoyant. In reply to the point of order raised by honourable member, the situation at the moment is that I have asked the Prime Minister whether the document is confidential.",17
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RATE OF INFLATION,"Mr Acting Speaker, on two grounds I do not propose to table the document: First, it is not a document but a collection of notes and it has no ority attached to it; and, secondly, some aspects of it are confidential. NA NA",17
20,Dr EDWARDS,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. How have the pohcies Federal Government assisted State governments - and in particular the New South Wales Government-to bring down Budgets which pro Mr vide for a significant expansion of services, cording to Press reports on the New South Wales Budget, without increasing State tax rates charges?",17
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"I congratulate the New South Wales Premier for exploiting the opportunities given to him by the beneficence our pohcies in not putting up taxes and not placdoes ing new charges on the people of New South Wales. In addition to this, of course, I underhim? stand there have been a number of concessions in the New South Wales Budget itself. Now, $2,35 lm",17
22,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I am just looking at the Prime Minister's notes.,17
23,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,Order! I would sugmanytimesfrom gest that the House comes to order. I would sug-right gest that the Leader of the Opposition remains seated until such stage as he receives the call? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Well you look. You can look without standing.,17
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"The Leader of the the Opposition and some of those who sit behind him quite dehberately make an attempt to disway rupt Question Time to prevent answers being given. They take frivolous points of order whichcent are not points of order. As we well know, Mr it Speaker Scholes, when he was in the chair, sought to name people even before they were on feet if he thought they had a point of order. is This Parhament would get through many more questions in the course of a day if the honourable gentleman behaved in a proper parliamentary manner. The honourable gentleman is behaving more as though he were visiting Taronga Park Zoo. Let me make it quite plain: This Govern the ment will not allow the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition to turn this Parhament into the kind of place in which he feels most at home. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Are you looking?",17
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"Order! other auth Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Le t me make it uite plain: The sums that we have given to New outh Wales in this last year of $2,35 lmMr E. G. Whitlam-Are you looking at the document?",17

My understanding is that the Parhament is deahng with questions without notice. If the and Prime Minister is fair dinkum and he is not a humbug,17
27,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"Order! Mr Charles Jones- . . . and the question of being asked is not a Dorothy Dix question, why not the Prime Minister turn over the copious notes-the prepared reply-h e has in front of Let us have the question treated as it should be, if the question is a question without notice.",17
28,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"Order! No point of order arises. Questions have been asked in this manner and Ministers have quotedfiguresever since questions werefirstasked in the Parhament. Without the interruptions, the number of questions asked by honourable members would increase considerably. It has been pointed out the chair that a Minister has the to answer a question in any manner that he desires, providing that his answer is relevant to the question.",17
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TO STATE GOVERNMENTS,"I will repeat the figures: $2,35lm made in revenue payments to State of New South Wales-sums that the New South Wales Government can spend in any it wishes-represen t over 71 per cent of its revenue budget. That is an increase of 33 per over two years. Because of that increase, which far outweighs and far exceeds what would be needed to cover the rate of inflation, the New South Wales Government has been able to bring in the kind of Budget it has presented in recent days. This can be taken as a mark of the generosity of the Commonwealth in dealing with thefinancialsituations of the States. One of the significant reasons this was done was to establish the circumstances in which the States could bring in budgets which would not increase taxes and which would not impose new taxes that would add to the consumer price index. This is all part of the general program of the Government to bear down on inflation. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question without notice.",17
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. Is it in order for the honourable gentleman to read a question?",18
31,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"I suggest that that is also something that has been done by honourable members over many years. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I am quoting from a photostat of the Hansard green of my question yesterday. Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister a question about the implicit price deflator. exact words I used were: . . . whether he disputes and repudiates ment 2 of the Budget Papers which shows that the standard of living of the Australian community had in fact fallen during 1976-77. The right honourable gentleman has it incorporated in the notes he is reading and he has marked the particular passage that I have quoted in ink. His answer-agai n quoting from the Hansard green-wa s that he would want to check table, I ask him whether he has now checked table 6 in Budget statement 2 this year, and does he notice that the real hold disposable income for all households in Australia, deflated by the implicit price deflator, which he chooses, was smaller in the quarter of 1977 than in the June quarter of 1976. Will he agree that, as the population increased the year 1976-77 by 1.1 per cent, the disposable income of individuals fell still more during that year?",18
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"The honourable long gentleman makes himself plain, but he should compare the full year 1976-77 with the full year 1975-76. In those circumstances let me give the honourable gentleman the facts. Firstly, deflatMay says: ing by the full consumer price index, we have a On reduction by 0.5 per cent, consistent with what I said; deflating by the consumer price cluding the hospital and medical services we have an increase of 1.7 per cent, consistent with what I said; deflating by the personal consumption deflator, we have an increase of 1.6 per cent, consistent with what I said.",18
33,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"I call the honourable member for Corio. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I ask that that document be tabled. You will have noticed that the Prime Minister was quoting from it.",18

35,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,Order! I am answering the Leader of the Opposition.,18
36,Mr SCHOLES,DISPOSABLE INCOME,Do not forget that I have the call.,18
37,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"Order! Neither the honourable member for Corio, nor any other honourable member will get the call unless the House comes to order. In regard to the request made by the Leader of the Opposition, I point out that the Prime Minister said two things in reply to the previous request for tabling. He said, The firstly, that portions of the document were confidential and, secondly, that there were only certable 6 in statetain quotes in that document.",18
38,Mr HAYDEN,DISPOSABLE INCOME,How do you know it is the same document?,18
39,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"Order! The honourable member for Oxley will remain silent. Mr E. G. Whitlam-It is a different document the Mr Bourchier- Mr Acting Speaker, should not the Leader of the Opposition be seated while tabled in August you are speaking? house Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The reply is exactly the same. I call the right honourable June member for Lowe on a point of order. Sir William MCMahon- Mr Acting Speaker, I in intervene in this debate with reluctance. I would hke to draw your attention, and that of the House, to page 432 of the nineteenth edition of Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice. It has been the rule in the House of Commons, and I believe that it ought to be apphed here, that only public documents need be tabled. This matter goes back to 10 August 1893. This is what 10 August 1893, the Speaker ruled that confidential documents or documents of a private nature passing beindex extween officers of a departmentMr E. G. Whitlam-Bill's birthday.",18
40,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"Order! Sir William MCMahon- I am trying to save the Leader of the Opposition from apoplexy. I have said that only pubhc documents need be tabled in the House. May goes on to say: Indeed, it is obvious that, as the House deals only public documents in its proceedings, it could not thus dentally require the production of papers which, if for separately, would be refused as beyond its jurisdiction. Sir, if you read May carefully you will see that interdepartmental minutes, minutes from departments to Ministers and notes department to assist Ministers are not to be tabled and should not be tabled unless the Minisorder. ter agrees. Sir, I hope that you will read this fully and apply the doctrine in the House. I hope that such a ruling will save the Leader of the position from the attack of apoplexy which is about to descend upon him.",19
41,Mr SCHOLES,DISPOSABLE INCOME,Mr Acting Speaker,19
42,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,"Order! The on two honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. In regard to the point of order raised right honourable member for Lowe, the detailed matters that he raised can be considered studied by the Standing Orders Committee. repeat to the House what I said earher. If a Minister reads from a document and then claims that cedures the document is confidential, that is the end of clear to aU honourable the matter. I also point out that if a Minister says where that he only quoted from a document it been the practice that that is the end of the matthe Minister be asked whether the Chair ter. In this instance both those conditions have been fulfilled by the Prime Minister. Certain honourable members who have been House for a long time should appreciate that point. I hope that the House will realise that is the position. Prior to Question Time a number of honourable members came to me and said that they wanted to ask a question. A Speaker in the House. who calls a member is, for that member, the most popular Speaker in the House, but in the opinion of the 99 others who do not receive the call he is point like the man referred to in a certain bibhcal quotation. We are not assisted when points of order are raised during the time that Ministers are Pnme answering questions. Some of the Ministers are getting a httle lengthy but I also point out that over a period of time some of the questions have become a Uttle lengthy. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister in his relation answer to me was quoting a document different position to from that from which he quoted in answer to the previous question asked from this side of the House. You have not asked the Prime Ministernor has he volunteered the informationwhether he regards the document from which he was quoting in answer to my question as confidential. If he says it is confidential, of course under the Standing Orders that is the end of the with matter. But I point out that this is a document incirelating to public affairs. Obviously it must be bemoved cause it related to a question asked him yesterday. It is a document different from the previous one. You have not asked him whether he regards passing it as confidential. from a Mr Acting SPEAKER- I accept what the Leader of the Opposition has said in his point of I also remind the honourable gentleman careof my comment in regard to this matter. If a Minister is only quoting portion of a document in Oprelation to his answer then the document is not required to be tabled. A document is required to be tabled only when a Minister has quoted from it as it stands, and has not merely taken figures from it. The ruling from the Chair has been given counts;firstly,on the matter of confidentiality and, secondly, wherefigureshave been by the merely quoted from that document.",19

I think the proto this of the House over a long period in regard matter have been simple, concise and members. I believe that a request for the tabling of a document is also has made all that is required from the is that document is confidential. The Minister says yes or no and that in this is the end of the matter.",19
44,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISPOSABLE INCOME,I point out to the that honourable member for Corio and to the Leader of the Opposition that there are two factors relating to the document. That has already been done,19

65,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The random, ad hoc nature of the Government's uranium pohcy emerges with crystal clarity from its policy for the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. The Government for continues to sink more and more Commonwealth funds into Mary Kathleen. It is sinking 1948 money into a mine that does not make a profit perand will never make a profit. The Government's the so-cahed loans to Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd actually are grants because there is no prospect of repayment. Instead of making its recent grant to Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd of $9m, the Government would have been much better off giving each of the 300 workers at Mary Kathleen $30,000 severance pay and then closing the mine. At least this would have ended the process of government subsidies. It would have softened the impact of the unemployment which must been placed come when the mine closes. In retrospect, it is clear that the Mary Kathleen mine should never have been reopened. At the time of the advent of the Labor Government late in 1972, Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd had contracts for the supply of about 4,800 tonnes of yellowcake, but Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd contracts for the remaining 2,000 to t 3,000 tonnes of uranium in its reserves to have any chance of making the mine profitable. The AusLabor Government's decision that no new uranium contracts be approved until Australian Labor Party policy was formulated made the economics of the mine even more risky. Since mine has reopened it has run into serious duction problemsIts maintenance costs are very high, due to the deterioration of the equipment during the 10 years it was out of commission. Wrong assumptions about ore grades and quanMary tities were made and wrong conclusions were drawn about the size of the pit. I refer the House to an article in the National Times of 18 September last in which the many problems of the mine are detailed. As a result these mistakes Mary Kathleen is a very unproenterprises. fitable mine. Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd is losing money at the rate of $ 16m a year. $8,378,000 in the first six months of this Based on the trading figures over the last six months, a conservative estimate would be that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd would have to get $46 per lb of yeUowcake to make the mine prothat fitable. That is over $10 per lb more than the curthe rent world contract price for uranium. Currently the Mary Kathleen mine is producclear ing at less than 50 per cent of capacity. In June quarter it produced only 100 tonnes of yellowcake. It will not be able to meet the 1977 existing contract requirement of 948 tonnes. ore reserves of Mary Kathleen Uranium have cently been downgraded by 10 per cent. In the Australian Financial Review of 6 October John Byrne revealed that the board of Conzinc Rioyellowcake tinto of Austraha Ltd had warned its shareOne holders that there was httle hope of a return capital. That warning was given before the loss increased. The total investment of the Commonordinates wealth Government now amounts to $ 16.4m, which includes $7.4m of the initial investment. The mine made a $12m loss in 1976. The will be greater this year, but recendy Mary Kathleen Uranium secured a further $9m long term loan from the Fraser Government and an $ 11 m loan from Conzinc Riotinto. This follows short-term loan earher this year of $6m, $1.8m being from the Fraser Government. This action is rather surprising, seeing that Mary Kathleen has not made a profit and, in my opinion, will not make a profit in future. Why has there been a change in opinion about Mary Kathleen? Eighteen months ago the Fraser Government tried to sell the Atomic Energy inefficient Commission's 42 per cent equity in Mary attention Kathleen Uranium. Now it is giving to Mary Kathleen Uranium loans that cannot be repaid. It seems an astonishing turnabout. Obviously attitude of Conzinc Riotinto is crucial. It seems determined to keep the mine open. It is too easy to say that CRA is concerned about its reputation in meeting existing contracts, particularly for the Austrahan uranium. It would be easier, simpler proand more profitable for CRA to meet its contracts through the mine of its parent company, Riotinto Zinc Corporation Ltd, at Rossing m Namibia, Africa. Conzinc Riotinto is keeping Kathleen open to suit the pohtical purposes of the Fraser Government. I want to stress and restress that opinion. The big quesuon is whether in return CRA will be allowed to ignore the Fraser Government's of policies on foreign equity in Australian Will the price of CRA keeping the now uneconomic Mary Kathleen mine going be apIt lost proval to CRA to avoid the stated Fraser year. Government policy and to secure control of important Austrahan coal reserves? That is the question that this House and the Australian people should consider. Conzinc Riotinto knows with the continuing world-wide cut-backs in nuclear power industry, the real profits in the future will be from coal, not from uranium or nupower. Propping up Mary Kathleen is a the small price to pay for CRA gaming privileged access to Austrahan coal deposits. The Fraser Government also has political motives for propThe ping up Mary Kathleen. It wants to keep the repressure on the Labor movement. The Fraser Government hopes to use any industrial confrontation resulting from the shipment of uranium as an excuse for calling an election. only has to examine the front page of yesteron day's Australian to know the Government's policy. That is where it leaks its stories. It coits pohcy with that of the Australian. That is clearly defined. It hopes to overcome objections to the development of the Ranger loss mine by pointing to Mary Kathleen. The Industries Assistance Commission in its report, after examining the situation, wants to throw Australian manufacturing industries on a the scrap heap and put the workers out of work because of supposed inefficiencies. Yet the Fraser Government deliberately keeps Mary Kathleen going for political purposes, even though it is inefficient. If anybody has any doubt about what I say, I ask the Australian Financial Review and any other of these so-called responsible newspapers which look at the question of manufacturing industries to turn their to the inefficiency of this uranium mine, this political mine, at Mary Kathleen. The $ 10.8m that the Government has, in effect, the granted Mary Kathleen this year would provide 450 jobs if spent in the building and construction industry. The present policy promises the Mary Kathleen work force unemployment when the political purposes of CRA and the Fraser Government nave been served. Mary Kathleen is a political mine. It is econhonourable omic idiocy. It has no useful purpose other than to serve the dubious pohtical ends of the Fraser Government and the greed of CRA. The Ausused trahan people at large should know this. It is about ume that the truth came out. I hope the speech I have made today will throw some light on the shabbiness and the collusion going on tween the Australian Government and the foreign owned company Conzinc Riotinto of Austraha.",21
66,Mr FALCONER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I was personally interested in the concluding words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). He said that it is about Ume the truth came out about mining at Mary Kathleen. We on this side of the House find it difficult to decide just who speaks for the Opposition on uranium mining policy. We can only regard the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as being a not very thinly veiled attack on his own leader. In Bristravagant bane last week it was reported in the Courier Mail that the Leader of the Opposition sonally took credit for re-opemng the Mary Kathleen mine and gave an assurance at Mount Isa that if the Labor Government came back into office the Mary Kathleen mine would be kept seen operating. How does that square with the stateest ments by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Mary Kathleen mine is being kept open to assist the pohtical purposes of the Fraser Government? All I can say is that the Leader the Opposition must be working for the pohtical purposes of the Fraser Government. He is come to join our side if he wants to come and renounce his past sins. I raise a grievance about the past extravagance Labor of the Labor Government and the inconsistent recent years. way in which it is now nit-picking small amounts of money being spent quite justhe way in which the Austrahan tifiably by this Government in comparison the huge amounts spent extravagantly by the David Combe, accuses the Governmentby Labor Government. In three years the extravaspending. David Combe was a prime mover gant junketing of the Leader of the Opposition cost the Austrahan taxpayer $ 1.5m. This reckless the use of pubhc money included the use of special Austraha charter aircraft, repainted and refitted to suit the honourable gentleman's personal tastes. It included personal retinues of up to 42 people including, on one occasion, the driver of Leader of the Opposition to act as his personal Austraha. valet and servant One junket alone took place at a cost of around $ 14,000 a day. The aristocratic and expensive tastes of the Leader of the Opposition were brought to bear in Australia just as much as they were overseas. The gentleman left his house in the western suburbs of Sydney and moved into Kirribilli House. Kirribilli House in Sydney was previously as a place for Australia's international visitors of state. It was converted to the personal mansion of the then Prime Minister. In a period of two years it was occupied by him for 332 days, bealmost a full year. This was an outstanding record for a man who was meant to be running the country from Canberra. The Leader of the Opposition was, of course, the Prime Minister who purchased an imported luxury limousine. I do not object to the Prime Minister of Austraha having a high status car, but I recall that when the Labor Government came to office some publicity was given to the fact that the honourable gentleman rejected the old Prime Ministerial Rolls Royce and went to a more modest Ministerial Ford LTD. This was publicised as being evidence of the Labor background of this Pnme Minister and his less exapproach to life, but shortly afterwards he arranged for the purchase of an perimported luxury limousine. His Government also holds the record for the greatest number of personal staff members ever in the history of this countiy and the greatuse of VIP aircraft since the establishment of the special Air Force squadron. I do not think there is any need for me to go into the details of the scandals associated with the overseas loans of affair in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the present pubhc advertising campaign being welconducted by the Australian Labor Party. My only comment on that is to observe that funds for the campaign could well have come from the foreign interests with whom the Australian Party, and the Leader of the Opposition in particular, have been making arrangements in at the very breakfast was Iconducted? wonder whether another Iraqi I also note the irony of Labor Party, in with the recent advertisements authorised one of loose in Iraqi money affair-the loosest and most disreputable attempted financial transaction has known Moreover, we know that the former Prime Minister spent without a care to have his portrait the enshrined in all public offices throughout Mr Neil-It was a terrible portrait.",23
67,Mr FALCONER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Surely this is the action of a vain and insensitive man. As my colleague, the mittee honourable member for St George, notes, it was conditions a terrible portrait anyway. Wherever possible, have former Prime Ministers travelled by commercial ing airhnes or made normal use of VIPflights.The Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, chartered Qantas Airways Ltd jets at prodigious Official cost and forced the cancellation of the nights hundreds of Austrahan citizens. Of course, he I also authorised the use of a VIP aircraft by Mrs Whitlam. I do not complain about that, but it is hypocritical of him to come into seek to attack the present Prime Minister use by Mrs Fraser of a VIP aircraft in perfectly understandable and open and explainable interests circumstances. The Whitlam regime saw the greatest proliferis-an ation of personal staff since the One might say that theyfiddledwhile Austraha To burned but there were private secretaries, participate research officers, Press secretaries, media secreership taries and even a few ordinary secretaries. I want to comment on an allegation made in The the advertisements authorised by Mr David prepared Combe concerning the redecoration of certain 50 per cent parts of the Lodge. These allegations are supmitted posed to give an example of the extravagance the present Prime Minister. I was interested note that Mr Andrew Grimwade, the Chairman market determine the value and acceptabilitythe of the Committee on Official Establishments, yesterday released a statement repudiating those allegations. In this statement Mr Grimwade said: The implication in Labor Party advertising that Minister was personally responsible improvements at The Lodge in Canberra was an unjustified misrepresentation of the facts. The Committee on Official Establishments was the Federal Government to advise on the operadon servation of the four Official Prime Minister's Lodge. It is an independent advisoiy The Committee has no political interests and its work solely in the interests of the nation and of the Australian people. He goes on to say: It is disappointing to find the essential up-keep of buildings being used in an attempt to damage the who, by virtue of his office, happens to be occupying premises. The recommendations for the work of the Lodge came from the Committee on Official Establishments and not from the Prime Minister. During its deliberations the Committee heard from many people including the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable E. G. Whidam and Mrs Whidam. From all the evidence gathered, no single objection was raised activities of the Committee nor to the proposals envisaging. Indeed, full support was given by everyone Committee. The next paragraph is most important as well. Mr Grimwade went on to say: It was completely unwarranted to infer that the Comwas involved in any 'loose spending'. The Committee had focused the Government's attention on the deplorable in the service wing of The Lodge. The renovations the full support of the Union involved and those workat The Lodge will benefit from the renovations rather than Mr and Mrs Fraser. All capital and maintenance expenditure within the Establishments, including The Lodge, now comes of within the oversight of the Committee. suggest that that gives the he to the sorts of criticisms that are being directed at the Prime Minister in respect of essential maintenance on official this House and establishments. for the Mr KEATING (Blaxland) (11.35)-The current spate of takeover offers for Austrahan coal threatens to undermine the essential element of Australia's foreign investment. That d I quote from the speech of the Treasurer court of Nero. (Mr Lynch) of April 1976: provide the maximum opportunity for Australians to as fully and effectively as practicable in the ownand control of this country's industries and natural resources. clarity of this principle is being muddied by the proposition that a foreign owned company, to increase its Austrahan equity to over of its shareholding, should be perof another companyinonatheprospective to bid basis of takeover of equaUty with an to Australian owned company-thu s letting of each respective offer. Such a proposition is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the foreign investment pohcy- a policy which enjoys the Prime the bipartisan support of the Government and for expenditure on Opposition parties. Proposals to 'Australianise' foreign comset up by panies, with the consent of the overseas and conprincipals, are attractive in terms of the AusEstablishments, including the body. traUan national interest-bu t only on certain is terms and conditions. The issuing of new shares by a foreign company in exchange for the shares of another company held by Australians, which has the effect of diminishing the magnitude of official the holding by foreign principals in a company, person is an acceptable, indeed desirable pohcy, but the only in the circumstances where the takeover of a minority interest is contemplated where it is not a controlling interest, or in the situation where no evidence other Austrahan company is bidding. A small, though progressive reduction in the to the foreign equity of a foreign company, particularly it was a large foreign company, should not permit such to the a company to mount a bid for the takeover of another company in Australia on an equal footing with an Austrahan company. If an Austrahan company is in thefieldwith a takeover bid, with share bid price within acceptable commercial limits, the Government and the Foreign Investment Review Board should not block such a takeover offer on the basis that a large foreigner is prepared to reduce its foreign equity, or that the offer of the foreigner is more generous to the shareholders of the company to be taken over. Generally, the foreigners can always outbid the natives. Price should not be the determinant in government approval of takeover offers or takeovers. A growing level of Australian corporate ownership is the objective of the pohcy. This cannot be subjugated by the desire to make foreign companies more Australian. On the other hand if Australian companies want the protection of the foreign investment policy and legislation, they should not cast low bids for the shares of other companies. Austrahan compames that play on the sentiments of economic nationalism with the expectation that takeover proposals will be approved with unrealistic and unacceptably low bids, should not be rewarded with a clear field to their prize. Shareholders of course can reject any offer. But if an offer is likely to be the only offer could be that shareholders have no option but to accept it. The foreign investment pohcy must not be debased or destroyed, unwittingly or otherwise by the injudicious behaviour of Australian companies. The policy was developed for the protection of Austrahan interests and should not be abused. Much of what I have said is relevant to the present takeover proposals of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd, both of which are bidding for Australian coal resources. In particular CSR and CRA are bidding to takeover Austrahan Associated Resources Ltd, a company which holds S3 per cent of the Hail Creek coking coal project m Queensland. With 53 per cent of the project clearly the owner of AAR would control the project. The low growth expectation in the world economy and in Japan indicates that Australia will experience a lower rate of mineral export growth over the next decade. In coking coal this means that, after the development of Utah's Norwich Park mine, the next major coking coal development will probably be the last in the next five to ten years. Hence the corporate jockeying by two large compames that want to diversify into 'big' coal. Hail Creek will be the next generation major coking coal mine. Its development costs will be near one bilUon doUars. Neither CSR nor CRA are in 'big' coal; that is involvement in a mine with an annual export capacity of between four and five mUlion tons. HaU Creek is their last chance for a long time. CSR has put in a bid of $ 1.75 for each AAR share- a bid which the AAR board says is too low. CSR acceptance rate on the offer is abysmally low. On the other hand CRA has applied to the Foreign Investment Review Board for permission to make an offer on AAR shares at $2.50. At this pomt what needs to be made clear is this: If CSR can get sufficient acceptances to control AAR and thus the HaU Creek project, then it should be given approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Government without any obstruction from CRA. This is the clear course the Government must foUow if it is properly to interpret its own poUcy. AAR shareholders, of course, do not have to sell. If perchance CSR increases its bid price, it is hkely that it will be successful. The Government should consider advice to CSR on this aspect. The Government is under no compulsion to accommodate CRA. The only basis for permitting CRA it to take up some of the equity of AAR would be if CSR admitted that the project was too big for it to manage andfinanceor that it could not afford a higher bid. But, even given this circumstance, the Government should still be looking for another Australian company to join forces with CSR before it relents and admits CRA. The only possible scenario which would be in any way acceptable in terms of clear Austrahan control of the project and which involves CRA would be a joint venture company along the lines of the BHP and SheU North West Shelf Development Ltd, which will operate the North West Shelf gas project; that is, a joint company that controls what would be the former AAR 53 per cent of the project and CRA's present 15 per cent direct interest in the project. With the proviso that decisions of the Board would have to be unanimous, it would be clear then that the Australian interest would be protected in that CSR could exercise a veto and thus exercise control over the project. However, this should be viewed as a measure of last resort. The Opposition expects the Government to stand behind its poUcy to endeavour to see that the HaU Creek project has over 50 per cent Australian equity and control. Any premature compromises will be viewed with great disdain from this side of the House. When in government the Opposition would not enjoy being compeUed to rearrange the equity situation of any project; but it would not shirk the responsibUity. It is far better for the Government to do its job properly now than to have the whole matter opened up later and thrashed out again. No 'Australianisation' plan by CRA, no matter how genuinely contemplated, will allow it to be at present over 50 per cent Australian owned. Therefore CRA is still at this point in time a foreign company and must be dealt with accordingly. This issue presents thefirstreal test of the strength of the Government's commitment to Austrahan corporate ownership and control. Indeed, the future of the foreign investment policy is at stake. The Opposidon will follow developments with great attention and will expect to see the national interest protected. Earher today I advised the Treasurer of my intention to raise this matter in the House and asked him to follow me in the debate to explain the Government's attitude. He has not even had the courtesy to sit in the House during the course of my remarks and he is not prepared to elucidate or explain the Government's attitude to these takeovers. This is indicative of the procedures of the Fraser Government in recent times, infieldingback benchers to explain its pohcies in the House, so that Ministers are not accountable for the policies. So the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board should read my speech carefuUy. Before too much more time elapses-perhap s in only a few weeks-ther e will be another Austrahan Labor Party government in Canberra and my party is determined that the national interest will be protected.",24
68,Mr JULL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to bring to the attendon of the House a matter of social responsibUity which I hope transcends all poUtiinvestigations cal boundaries. I refer to the responsibUity government has towards the homeless men and women of our community. Following actions by the Commonwealth and State police in Brisbane on Tuesday, 20 September, in raiding what has too been described as a slave camp for some of the underprivileged, the media of this country have carried many stories covering aspects of the vuloffice nerabUity and the plight of those people in our society who frankly cannot help themselves. The raid m Brisbane has pointed up one single glaring fact which should be of concern to us all. There are some very serious deficiencies and grey areas in the Social Services Act. If the Act interpreted in strict legal terms, the Department of Social Security is absolved from taking certain actions or making certain investigations in some cases. However, the very nature of the Act imphes a moral commitment by the Government to do all it can to help those people in our community who, because of their unfortunate circumstances, cannot help themselves. We have a veryrealobligation to investigate the provisions of the Social Services Act to make sure that these desperate homeless people can be helped, that they cannot be exploited and that they have the protection which, as human beings, they deserve. On 25 May 1977 I placed on notice a series of questions to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) relating to the guidelines set down to enable persons to be warrantors for persons receivmg pensions from the Department of Social Security. I asked whether the credentials of these warrantors are checked prior to that right being given and whether a regular review is carried out by the Department in these situations. The Mmister answered that the Department had no discretion in the matter of the appointment of warrantors as it was a private arrangement between the pensioner and the warrantor and, therefore, no guidelines were required. Credentials of proposed warrantors are not examined by the Department if the appointment is made by a pensioner, and there are no regular reviews of warrantors or their activities. I also asked in that question to the Minister for details of the number of persons under the warrantee of two individuals in Queensland. The answer to that question was: The information required is not readily available. Yet after the raid in Brisbane I understand that investigations were made relating to those parts of the question and that the results were obtained within 48 hours. I understand that when these were carried out the Department's which records showed that they were few in number. I point out to the House that, despite the legal preciseness of the Department's investigations, I believe that the results give us a clouded and not accurate picture. It seems that there is a legal difference between warrantors and trustees, but from the number of calls which I have had to my it is obvious that the net results of the potential abuses of these two systems of payment vary very little indeed. I would not like it to be thought that I believe that those persons who become warrantors or trustees will necessarily abuse the system. I believe that there are specific cases, and the Department is aware of them, of is people who have abused the system or certainly of people whose manipulation of the system leaves a lot to be desired. Whilst it may be all very well to say that the question of warrantors and indeed trustees is a pnvate arrangement between persons, it is my belief that there is very little privacy for those who are in unfortunate cumstances, who are homeless, who usually spend most of their Uves sleeping in parks and gardens, who are alcoholics, who subsequently may have brain damage and who exploited. All governments have a moral responsibility to ensure that the pensions paid those people get to those people and are not siphoned off by others in the community who are out to make a fast buck. I know that this is a very sensitive area and know that it is in an area in respect of which the Department of Social Security has received of bad pubhcity lately. There are many people within the Department of Social Security who do an excellent and very fine job, but I believe that there are times when officers of the Department need to cast their thoughts a little further than the strict reading of the law. One of the most fortunate things about a bureaucracy is that whenever someone makes any criticism or shows concern about the department the officers of department huddle together in protecting the great monolith. I beheve that in many cases Department of Social Security is far too protecAustraha tive for its own good. There needs to be a greater degree of consultation and a greater degree flexibility in the way in which it administers social welfare responsibilities. One of the things that have concerned me long time about homeless people is the way which it is possible for the bureaucracy, in some cases, to become bogged down in its own paper work at the expense of the unfortunate people our community. I would like to cite just one example that has been given to me by the ager of one of the most reputable hostels catering for homeless people in Brisbane. When the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was assented to in 1974 this organisation made an apphcation to the Department of Social Security for the esSocial tablishment of new premises in Brisbane. Petty quibbling by bureaucrats in Canberra over issues such as whether double decker beds were more desirable than single beds, whether the amenities were too far away from the dormitories and great. whether single room accommodation was better than dormitory style accommodation, caused the Mrlight delays in the approval of this project for 12 Government months. In such cases when there is chronic shortage of facUities for homeless men, Fraser) and the worsening such bureaucratic delays are unforgivable. We in this House should not lose sight of the ultimate ends for which we pass legislation. those ends are stifled or if they are delayed red tape our efforts in this chamber certainly not be as effective as they should be. I raise cirmatters merely because I beheve that in the area of homeless people there is a great deal more that we can do for that unfortunate sector of the community about which nobody seems to care are easily and nobody wants to know. I would also like to raise one other matter to about the Department of Social Security which I hope the Minister will note. As many honourable members are probably aware, in my electorate of Bowman I conduct a mobUe office in a caravan I which regularly tours all the shoppmg centres in the oudying areas of the electorate. I have found a lot during my time in the House that the mobUe office has drummed up more business than my office can handle. WhUst it might be a rod for my own back it certainly is one of the most effective means of communicating with people. I also believe it would be a very effective means for the unDepartment of Social Security to employ in order to communicate with many of the outlying areas and the new suburban developments which so that often are the source of so many of the social ? roblems in our community today. I beheve that the asmania has a mobUe office and that Western has a caravan which is shared by the Department's social workers and its community of Uaison officers. Yet Queensland, which is the its most decentralised of the mainland States, cannot afford to implement such a scheme. for a To my mind one of the most important roles of in the Department of Social Security is to communicate with the general public the wide range of services and benefits which are avaUable. It is in amazing to hear cases of people who have endured so much hardship for so long simply manbecause they did not know that some welfare assistance was avaUable to them from the Government. Communications is one of the most important tasks of any government. It certainly is a vital aspect of the work of the Department of Security. I sincerely hope that the Minister will look at the proposition of providing those caravans to provide that service m those areas I mentioned, the new urban developments and the outlying areas, where the need is obviously so LES JOHNSON (Hughes) (11.52)-In of the increasing crises the Fraser already a torial style of isthefacing, Prime the increasingly dictaMinister (Mr Malcolm state of the economy, is there any wonder that disunity and confusion are becoming the order of the day in the ranks of If the Government?

Following the resignation the honourable member for Hotham from the BudgetLiberal Party the Prime Minister had to seek assurance of several other Liberal Members Parliament in case they might also resign from the Liberal Party.",26
69,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Who?,28
70,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Let me mention the to honourable member for Wentworth (Mr clash Ellicott), because ofhis disenchantment with Prime Minister's leadership. The honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) has dethreatened cided not to contest his seat at the next election because of the Government's failure to honour its election promises. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), a former Minisprecise ter for Social Security, also resigned because his opposidon to the Government's economic pohcy. In addition, on 9 September last the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) announced his plan to resign from six parliamenand tary committees because he said that the Liberal Party had no understanding of the needs of country people. I recall the somewhat prophetic words of a former Prime Minister, the highly regarded Sir John Gorton. He said back in 1973 that it would be a disaster if Mr Fraser ever the Liberal Party; that it would mean breaking up the party. The present Prime Minister was so concerned about back bench disenchantment with his leadership that he felt he had to warn Government party members about leaking to Press discussions which took place in the party room. Rebellion is breeding on the back benches over the Fraser Government's plan to close down the Rhodesian Information Centre. No for less than 13 government supporters have extheir concern and doubt about the closure of the office. Quite clearly the Prime Minister no longer has any control over Government supGovernment's economic policy- I porters in the Senate. He can no longer count on to the prihis own party members in the Senate to support . . I his Government. The callous and inhumane attempts of the Fraser Government to abolish than IS the $40 pensioner funeral benefit resulted in Liberal Senators Rae, Jessop, Missen, Townley, Wood and Bonner crossing the floor, thus rolling the Government's plan. That is recorded history. Earher this year, when the Government's May and the referendum proposals went to the Senate, 11 to ask Government senators crossed the floor and voted against the proposals. Senator Martin resigned from her position as Deputy Government Whip in the Senate in protest. In November last a group of 15 Liberal and National Country Party of senators planned to move an amendment to the a virtual vote of no confidence in their the Government. On 29 March Senators Rae, of Townley, Wood, Walters and Wright voted with the Opposition on the apple and pear subsidy scheme. In March this year the Pnme Minister roundly abused Tasmanian Liberals during a blow-up over the level of stabilisation to be given the apple and pear industry. So bitter was the over the apple and pear subsidy scheme the that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) to resign and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) was told that he was behaving hke a grub and should go back to Tasmania and bury himself in an apple-to use the words. That is incredible behaviour. The of honourable members for Franklin, Wilmot (Mr Burr), and Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) have expressed their opposition to an early election. There has been a rapid desertion in the rank file of the Liberal Party as well. In New South Wales membership of the Party fell by 17,000 this year and in Victoria the membership is down to the lowest level for ten years. In Queensland membership has fallen by 20 per cent. This is at a time when pohtics is volatile; led when other parties, including the Labor Party, are greatly expanding their membership. We can see the disenchantment when the ship is sinking; we know who has the tendency to depart. the There has been continuing conflict and discussion within the Liberal-National Countiy Party coalition over changes to the broadcasting legislation and the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. In the Government party room late last year when the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) asked who could not support the Government's proposed changes to broadcasting one by one members stood up: The honourable members for Casey (Mr Falconer), Denison (Mr Hodgman), Diamond Valley (Mr Brown), Isaacs (Mr Hamer) and St George (Mr Neil); and Senators Missen, Martin, Baume, Young and Hall. Just this week reports have appeared in the newspapers saying that some government back benchers were resisting the Fraser Government's latest changes to radio and television administration. Yesterday, when the Fraser Government attempted to ram through the party room its original decision not to pay the unemployment benefit to innocent victims of industrial disputes the party room erupted. We are told it was a most ungainly and unseemly scene. Reports in today's Press-undenie d reports, I might saygave us the names. One of the reasons why there was confusion during Question Time today was that the Prime Minister and other leaders on the Government side knew that there would be interrogation about this matter and they were unprepared to be subjected to it. Mr Bourchier- I raise a point of order. The honourable member who is speaking now is raising matters on which he has no facts and does not know the truth. He mentions our party room discussions. He was not there. He has no idea. I doubt that he even knows what goes on in his own Party room. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to rule those comments out of order. Furthermore, the honourable member knows very well that it was disruption caused by the Australian Labor Party which spoiled Question Time today. It is quite obvious that Labor members did not want to have questions answered.",28
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Order! has The honourable member has made his point. and rumours The Chair has to take the view members are entitled to their own opinions, erwhich I would likemention ratic or otherwise.",29
72,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am informed from small very reliable sources that the opponents scheme were the honourable members for Denison, Casey, La Trobe and Franklin. This is audience. Grievance Day and those honourable members have the opportunity to make a speech in tion. In any event, why should they not be conThriving cerned? Do they believe that the Prime Minister is right in denying unemployment relief to businesses people who are stood down as a result of induscent trial disputes and that that will assist in speedy resolution of industrial disputes? Does the Prime Minister believe that starving innocent people into submission is part of his Government's long-term strategy to create a climate of industrial peace? That proposition is so dubious that it could not gain the support of honourable members on the Government side. I therefore predict that there will be many more desertions from the ranks of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party.",29
73,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",29
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,29
75,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes . The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said that I, as the honourable member for La Trobe, supported a move in the party room to deny unemployment benefit to people who had been stood down as a result of the strike in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. I did not take such a stance. The Government did not take such a stance. Speakers in the party room did not take such a stance. As has been announced and confirmed and reaffirmed, this Government will be paying unemployment benefit to those innocent people who have been stood down in Victoria as a result of the power dispute.",29
76,Mr THOMSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I do not intend to spend any time on the erratic, inaccurate and scurrilous speech made by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson).",29
77,Mr LLOYD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is not worth it. Mr THOMSONIt is not worth it. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) made one point quite clear. The honourable member for Hughes raised so many inaccuracies that it is not worth talking about his that honourable speech. He did one matter, though, to follow up. He said that the Government was not doing anything to help business. I shall talk briefly about small of the business in Australia.",29
78,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I think you need an refuta Mr THOMSONI have a sufficient audience. successful small businesses are the real key to economic revival. There are 190,000 small in Australia which is more than 90 per of all enterprises. Those enterprises with less the than 100 employees employ 1,280,000 people or more than 40 per cent of all people employed. If every small business could employ just two more 1>eople we would solve our unemployment probThere em completely. In fact, we would have a siderable shortage of labour. Small business is state. big business. Our free enterprise society is made up offlourishingsmall businesses. It is very pleasing to see how much small business is doing help to help itself. It is getting together and organising done small and expressing points of view very Small Business and Self-employed Association That is the best thingtowe10have of Austraha is setting up branches in all States. I business in Austraha. During thedone would like to see the Association extend to provcampaign incial cities and country towns where there are large numbers of small businesses and where point practically everyone is employed by small small business. Small business organisations are proving to a strong voice in support of small business. think they should be given every encouragement. Both the Commonwealth Government and State governments need a strong small business organisation to which they can speak. On the Commonwealth scene in Canberra we have the National Small Business Bureau. Each State set up organisations of various sorts. Queensland there is a Division of Small Business within the Department of Industrial Developdone ment. I think it is worthwhile looking briefly what is happening in one or two other countries. In the United Kingdom there has been an ing tendency for a small number of large corporgreater ations to control a greater proportion of duction because it is far easier for government and unions to influence a small number of large corporations than it is to influence a larger number of small businesses. I shall read the  the British Labour Weekly The New Statesman who recently resigned his long-standing memdo. bership of the British Labour Party. I wish the problems. honourable member for Hughes had remained in the House to hear these words. Mr Johnson stated: . . . it is the essence of corporation large. And it is the essence of modern union bureaucracy that development workers are easier to control in big factories, where organised military clique rules all. So Labor ministers union bosses are united in their ture. Both loathe the small business and the litde and penalise them viciously; both exhibit a positive for the self-employed, who cannot be unionised porated at all. This is where the Labor Pany is heading. It has embraced corporatism, which ultimately must mean the of parliamentary democracy. I say again that I wish the honourable member for Hughes was here to listen to those words and apply them to his party in Australia. It is, course, far easier for Government and unions influence a small number of large corporations. is no doubt that small business is the best conguarantee against an authoritarian corporate This Government has taken many actions to is business. The major thing we have reduce inflation from over 17 per cent clearly. The during Labor's regime per cent or less now. last to help election the coalition parties published a fiveprogram which would help restore the business sector to economic health. Those points were,firstly,to introduce a new 40 per cent investment allowance in order to encourage be small business investment. That, of course, has I been done. Secondly, we said we would implement the Mathews Committee recommendations on company taxation, beginning with a stock valuation adjustment and boosting cash flows and restoring confidence. That has been done. The third point was the introduction of has new tax reforms designed to meet the problems In of small business. I could spend 10 minutes speaking on that subject. A great deal has been in this regard and the new tax scales to be at introduced early next year will be a major concession to small business. Fourthly, we said we alarmwould undertake new pohcies to ensure the availability offinancefor the expansion proand development programs of small business. I shall deal with that matter in a few minutes. The final point was to initiate new programs in areas of education and counselling to assist in the management of small business. This is happening of both in the Commonwealth and in the States. I think it is more properly a job for the States to They are on the spot. They know their local I shall deal with the fourth point-the greater that the units must be availability offinancefor the expansion and of small business. There is no the doubt that banks andfinanceorganisations more and readily lend to big business than to small busiupending of Labor's old posworkshop ness. I was once a moderately successful small hatred businessman. I have had considerable experior corence in thisfield.Banksfindit much easier and safer to lend to estabhshed big businesses. Small already business needs the provision of long-term finance end at reasonable rates of interest. In my electorate I was speaking a couple of days ago to a man running a general engineering firm which employs 100 people. He needs money for ca rry-on finance of and for expansion. The best he can get from his to bank and the longest term isfiveyears at 11 per cent. That is not good enough for a business which is expanding. His weekly payroll is apdepartments. proximately $18,000 to $20,000 a week. His payof roll tax and workers' compensation amount to $2,000 a week. He needs to generate $20,000 business per week to pay for that. Fortunately the Queensland Government in its last Budget made a major reduction in payroll tax and workers' compensation. Another major problem is sales tax in isolated areas. Sales tax is also paid on freight think this is quite wrong. I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) several times on this ter as have other honourable members. I hope that this inequity will be put right. The GovernGovernment's ment has formed a task force on small business financing to study the problems and make recommendations. I understand the task force has reported and the Government will announce it s decision very soon. There would seem to variety of ways in which small business can be helped and revitalised. We need to reduce interest rates to enable a business to get lished and to expand. That is happening now; it started a month or so ago. We have to ease the burden of provisional tax during the ume when a small business is becoming estabhshed. We should reconsider the provision of company to help small business. A further easing of Division 7 tax provision would be a very helpful move. It is suggested that a statutory small business authority, free of political and bureaucratic ference and control and capable of contributing to the arbitration processes on behalf of small business should be estabhshed. The need for such an authority has become increasingly clear in recent Conciliation and Arbitration Comhours mission proceedings. There needs to be a partposition nership between government andfinanceinstitudeny tions and any proposed small business authority to create, with an existingfinancialframework, small business developmentfinanceservice ensure long term credit. Someone has suggested to me that a small business insurance corporation promised with government support to organise loans with Country Party insurance as a colateral should work through existing insurance companies, with return of business them, loans for, say, 10 to 20 years. It has suggested that repayments under this scheme many of his coUeagues can. As earlyfaded would be made everyfiveyears on a quarterly basis. One other small point which is bothering business a great deal and about which many complaints are being received by all honourable members concerns the burden of government surveys on small business, particularly from Bureau of Statistics and from other government This is expensive, time wasting and very httle value to small business. I think this procedure should be reviewed. I beheve that the Federal Government should concentrate on small business matters of a national nature. All other matters are best handled by the States. I in hope that when the Government makes its announcement on small businessfinancingshortly we will have some very happy news for small rates. I businesses in Austraha.",29
79,Mr FRY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is now quite apmatparent to anyone with any discernment at all about the Austrahan economy generaUy that the poUcies have faded miserably. It is also becoming more apparent every day that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is quite inadequate to his task and, of course, the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is becoming more and more be a discredited every day. These are not my judgments or assertions; they are the statements of former Liberals-forme r Ministers and honourestabable members opposite-wh o do not intend to stand for election in the next general election. It has been quite apparent from statements made by the honourable member for Lowe (Sir tax WUliam MCMahon), the honourable member the for Hotham (Mr Chipp), the honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) and, more recently, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) that they have all come to the conclusion that the Government's policies have interfaUed and they have condemned those pohcies. DaUy the list of disenchanted members on the Government back bench grows. The sphts over new legislation or changes in pohcy are quite apparently growing daUy also. Even in the past 24 the newspapers have reported strong opto the proposal of the Prime Minister to income support to the innocent victims of industrial disputes. Back benchers have yet again a rejected the new broadcasting legislation to proposed by the Government. In November 1975 the Prime Minister that only under a Liberal-National government would there be jobs be estabhshed, to for aU who wanted lower inflation and a been miserably. He cannot see that heHe confidence. has faUed has as but September 1976 a joint parties meeting rang with criticism about the Government's faUure to deal small with the problem of unemployment. The Tasmanian members led the attack. It continued on 8 November, and on that notable date the honourable member for Lowe, the honourable the member for MackeUar and the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) attacked the Government's economic policies. They argued about the Government's obsession with Treasurer the deficit and they argued for greater stimulus trine for the economy. On 12 February at a party meeting the Government's failure to lower interest rates and taxation levels was strongly attacked. The honourable member for Mackellar said that the Government can raise large amounts of money tofinancethe deficit without raising interest and it can do so in a way which could lead to theirreduction.The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), from Tasmania, indications expressed concern about the economy. After spending the Christmas recess in his electorate, he was reported to have said: We are all getting the high and pensioners are finding it difficult to pay cause of mflation. Businessmen are complaining about state of the economy. Then, of course, the honourable member for Hotham felt that he could not continue on the Government benches while the Prime Mmister prevailed. He resigned from the Liberal Party and criticised the Government's pohcies. He cristimulate ticised the 25 per cent cut in overseas aid, the abohtion of the Austrahan Assistance Plan, proposed abohtion of funeral benefits for penstandards. sioners, the original breach of the promise Prime Minister to index pensions and,finally,the Government's decision to devalue the cunency and, once that decision was taken, the refusal the Government to lower tariffs to contain the inflationary effects of the devaluation. honourable member for Hotham said: I cannot agree with the Government's current economic policy. Particularly, I am concerned with its failure the promise to the private sector . . . I believe the businessman, especially the small businessman who employs the bulk of the work force of this country, is more confused,There more in the dark about the future, and less confident was IS months ago. It is no wonder that small businesses have organise themselves into bureaus et cetera, about which the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) spoke, in order to protect selves from the pohcies of this Government. honourable member for Hotham continued: I am very critical of the Government and the trade union movement. It would cruel and unfair to ask the worker to be the sole bearer cost ofreducinginflation; but wages are too high are too high to provide incentive for increased productivity by both workers and management. Interest rates are devastating, especially to the young . . . Those were the words of the former Liberal member for Hotham. Finally, on Tuesday we had the retirement from the Liberal Party of the honourable member for Mackellar, who said: But neither can I continue to support the economic doctrine of salvation through stagnation-the doctrine which the (Mr Lynch) seems to have espoused. It is a docwhich, so he tells us, he has learned overseas; but it is none the better for that. In fact none of its devotees has applied the doctrine asrigorouslyas has their Australian convert, and most of them are now quiedy adjuring it Certainly this was confirmed in a recent visit I made overseas. I had a look at the economic situation in most central European countries. The rates general consensus was that at best the European economy is stagnant and, at worse, it is declining in some areas, and there were very definite of this. The rate of unemployment is still high in West Germany- 4 per cent, excluding the guest workers who have to return to their countries. So, in fact, its rate of unemployment is much the same as it is in Austraha. Other indicasame message-ta x levels are too taxadon be-tions of failure of economic recovery in Europe, the which Ministers of this Government fail to see but for which there is real background, are declining orders in West Germany; declining projections of steel production in many European countries; and growth targets which have been set by many governments in Europe to tiy to their economies have just not been met. There is growing concern at the trade deficit in the America, which is quite serious by European by the The Government's policies in Canberra have been quite disastrous. They are of great concern to the Government supporters in Canberra. In of fact, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) has virtually given up the ghost about The his prospects of being re-elected. Even the Government senator, Senator Knight, who has to get only a third of the vote, is concerned now to honour about his prospects ofre-election;he is greatly private concerned that he will not get a third of the vote. is a real prospect that the Labor Party will than hewin two Australian Capital Territoiy Senate seats in the next Senate election.

Thousands of young people are out of the of work. Morale in the Pubhc Service is at an all and taxes time low. That has had serious repercussions throughout the whole of the Pubhc Service. The building industry has been wrecked. Small businesses in Canberra are in a shambles. T was interested to hear the honourable member for Leichhardt talk about small business. He should talk to small business in Canberra. The big boys are doing nicely. The other day J. B. Young Ltd announced a tremendous increase in its profit- a 24 per cent increase in its profit. Businesses such as David Jones Ltd and Woolgreat worths Ltd do nicely in Canberra, with their I mass buying capacity and their automated serthat vices which enable them to dispense with labour.Colston The Uttle people are suffering.

Prior to this there was public statement from him concerning the actions of these white counterparts which he obviously had knowlthe people of the way edge of. My complaint to Senator Colston concerned the irresattitudes of certain politicians and that the manthey utilise the press etc and how it affects black people across the board. It is hard enough as it is for this and other organisationsrecognise to try and alleviate the problems of black people and when someone like Cameron makes statements as he did distress and uses words like a 'group of Aborigines' it makes the task all the more difficult because the white public takes a dislike to all blacks because which blacks are involved.

On 10 May you quoted from a letter received from the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service Ltd. I formed the valid impression ages ago that plaints were really made jointly. Indeed, you advised 10 May that you were treating both complaints in conjunction with each other. In yours of 10 May you included an extract which read 'This legal service considers such unsubstantiated allegations' and they further went on to say 'the failure Cameron to bring forward proof of his allegations'. that time several aborigines have been charged with the offences I alleged were occurring.

As myfinalcomment in this place on this matter I point out that I regard it as rather strange that what was really a simple open and shut case took as long as it did to conclude. I had done nothing wrong, yet it took the me the Commissioner from the end of March, which I think is when thefirstcomplaint was made, until I cannot the end of September to carry out a very easy you are giving this exercise. I wish now to deal with another matter which (Qld.) is concerned with the same topic and which the comoccurred at about the same time. It will be reme on called that I countered by reporting to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), under whose control the Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr of Mr Grassby, comes, the way that a Queensland lady Since felt following the claim of the Commissioner that in Japan the Japanese are taught that all Austrahans are racist. That woman, being Japanese by birth, was most upset and aggrieved because advice to she thought that Mr Grassby was making a whatsoreflection on her and her people. The Minister on for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), who is at the table, looks around. I and think he knows that the woman concerned lives you in his electorate. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has written to me, mforming me-hi s letter is dated 22 September-that under the Racial Discrirrunation Act such inquiries are to be made only by the Commissioner himself. The letter goes on to state: There is no provision for the Minister administering the Act to inquire into complaints against the Commissioner for Community Relauons. It would seem that the Commissioner for Comdraftsmen, munity Relauons is in the privileged position of being the only man in Austraha who can go around making racist utterances. Mr Innes-You make them every day of the another week in here.",33
82,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIA,"That is one view. He is the only man who can go around country in that privileged position of being beyond investigation. I hope that when the Office the Commissioner for Community Relations is those reorganised the Commissioner no longer will be in that privileged position. It is most necessaiy that that change be made because many people in this country hold the view that Mr Grassby the most racist minded person in Austraha and most unsuitable to hold the position of Comtiveness. missioner. In his letter to me the Minister said relation to this case: I regret that offence has been caused Mrs . . . by statements made by the Hon. A. J. Grassby. You might inform her that Mr Grassby was not speaking as a tative of the Commonwealth Government or on its behalf and that his statements were those of a statutory officer functions set down in legislation. So it would seem that the Minister has cleared the situation once and for all: Any comments made by Mr Grassby do not necessarily reflect incorporated. the views of the government of the day. I am quite sure that the vast majority of Austrahans leave will be very pleased with that assurance. In thefiveminutes remaining to me I wish to raise another subject.

I know that it can be properly said, when one looks at the depressed state of the building industry in Austraha, that many people who were trained originally to be architects and even builders and who have acquired skills in certain areas are not having those skills utilised because of the lack of pubhc demand for them. Either they have to seek position in a totally differentfieldor, alternatively, for the time being they have to remain unemployed and wrestle with the frustrations and disappointments which can be the associated with being in that category. of I wish to pick out just one course amongst offered at universities to highlight the faa that the universities have an obligation to monitor continually pubhc demand or government demand for certain skills and certain prois fessional quaUfications.

I particularly want to put case on behalf of the rights of consumers of services. After aU, they are the people who eveiything possible. If they in the aircraft and pay the fares, nothing hapE ns.

In 1985-86 3.2 million people are an expected to travel overseas. In Australia at the gradumoment there are 3 mUUon persons who were not born in this country. Those people especiaUy have a deep interest in the quaUty, avaUability and price of air travel into and out of Austraha. At the same time. I want to make the Opposition's position clear. The Opposition strongly supports those 3rnilhonpeople, as it supports all other Australians, and it wants to see the lowest be possible fares payable in Australia and for nights out of Austraha commensurate with better quality of service and with proper access to information on the avaUabiUty of schedules of services; in other words, what kind of services can be work or avaUable and at what prices. it is This is the kind of information which the of to date has not been prepared to bring before the pubhc for study. In this House inon 24 August I asked the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) during the debate on the Air NaviaU gation Amendment Bill to extend the inquiry have mto domestic civU aviation to include international civil aviation. Subsequently I again of aU asked him that question in the House. He everyignored myfirstrequestand on the second occasionrefused.A few days ago the Minister announced the establishment of an inquiiy into civil aviation. At least by doing that he yielded to some extent to the demands by the Opposition for an overaU mquiry. However, in cases the inquiries are secret. The informathe tionreceivedwUl be privy to the Department of and its officers and consultants unless the people making the submissions are prepared a to make them pubhc. In each case the report of air the inquiry will be privy to the Government and make to the bureaucracy, not to the community whom are not there to travel it affects. Since this Government came to office there has of been a continuing theme of secrecy and behind closed doors consideration of vital matters affectI ing the provision of transport services, particutember larly air services. Let us quickly run them. The Aviation Industiy Review Committee It seems chaired by Sir Lennox Hewitt comprised three be people from the aviation industry. It was a secret committee looking into the cost recovery promittee, grams of the Government and the cost structure civil of the aviation industry. The mquiry was secret the and its report is secret. No information has been Qantas brought before the Parhament on the results of basis that mquiry despite the expense incurred in carthe rying out the inquiry and, more importantly, despite the importance of that inquiry to the whole aviation mdustry. If we are to consider what fares ought charged, the frequency of services, the kind of infrastructure which should be provided around airports in terms of pubhc transport services ana from airports and all the other facilities that are involved in servicing an airport, we need know what kind of costs are involved and protant jected. The Hewitt Committee report is vital any proper pubhc considc ration of aviation vices in Austraha. I have made repeated requests in the Parhament and outside the Parliament for the Mmister to table the report. The industry itself has called for the tabling of the report. wants the information to be made available for pubhc consideration but the Minister has consistwhat ently refused to table the report. Then we move to the MCNeil Committee tions report which inquired into the four government asked transport undertakings, Trans-Australia AirUnes, industry? Qantas, the Austrahan National Line and Austrahan National RaUways. Again it was a secret inquiry but the committee deUberations were scandalous to the extent that the mquiry was ried out by competitors and chents of those four transport undertakings. Its report was not tabled. No mformation is avaUable on it. Then we have the current domestic aviation review inquiry which I have just mentioned and the inter- 'The national civil aviation inquiry mentioned the before yesterday. These last two inquiries now are being carried out in tandem. This is a most ludicrous situation, a most extravagant and important wasteful situation. What is more, it is a situation ition of great dictatorial in which two complementary parts are being examined in isolation from each other. There four inquiries now being carried out, aU looking at aviauon or parts of aviation and all privy to the Minister and the bureaucracy. not considered responsible enough to be able to know what is happening within those inquiries. wish to quote from the editorial in the Sepissue of the influential aviation magaback throughzine Aircraft. It states: as if the public and Parliament will never see or able to properly consider important documents such as the several reports of the Aviauon Industry Review Comprobably the most important review of Australian aviauon compiled in the past 20 years or reports like the MCNeil Committee which made major recommendations to Government on its four transport enterprises including and TAA. These are the documents being used as the for major government decisions which affect not only aviauon industry but the entire community and yet they are being denied even parliamentary scrutiny and debate. Let us contrast that comment with the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in September last in which he said that if the Australian electorate was to be able to make vaUd to be judgments on Government pohcies it should have the greatest possible access to information. I wish the Mmister for Transport would take up to the suggestion of the Prime Minister that the greatest possible access be provided to the inforto mation essential to decisions on the very importransport industries. In addition to the four to inquiries I have mentioned there is the interserdepartmental committee inquiry into aviation services in the Northern Territory. That inquiry is crucial to the actual movement of people and to the provision of the basic necessities of Ufe in It the Northern Territory and Central Australia, yet it is a closed shop inquiry. We do not know was in the report. Again the Government has made recommendations on the expenditure of pubUc funds as a result of the recommendaof that report. The only question that can be is: Why aU the secrecy? What is it that the Government is trying to hide in the transport It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the public already has access. The Minister carwas asked on AM yesterday: 'But the pubUc will not be in a position to evaluate the sort of evidence that is coming up? That is in relation to the international civil aviation inquiry. He replied: public will be. Well, if the public hke to publish their submissions of course they wUP. day What the pubhc will be able to evaluate is what conclusions the Government reaches. That is the thing in the eyes of the Government and the Minister. It leaves the Minister in a pospower. He has all the information about the operations of the mdustry, are about what kind of services can be made avaUable but that information will not be made avaUThe public is able to the pubUc. The whole problem of management of civil aviation services in this country will not be solved until the facts on the kinds of costs volved, the kind of service available, the quality of service available, the viability which is expected of civil aviation in and out of Austraha in coming years are known and brought out the pubhc arena for proper responsible assessperiod. ment. The Government and Minister are deprivWhitlaming the Parhament and the community of the essential information that they need to consider Deputy the kinds of services which we should have in this country. Let me move to myfinalitem. In the midst of all the pubhc concern about aviation fares aviation services, internal and external, another element that has run right through has been the opposition of government parties to the services of Trans-Austraha Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd. At the moment the annual report of Qantas is held up in Treasury. As I understand the ition, it should have been tabled in this Parliadescribing ment. It is many weeks overdue. There is no doubt in my mind that the holding Qantas report is in some way intended to prejudice the position of Qantas. Qantas and publicly owned enterprises, belonging to the conGovernment'. sumers, belonging to the taxpayers of this country. They, like any other commercial enterprise, should be given the opportunity to function as efficiently and as effectively as can within the broad laws of this country. the Government will respond to my request to open up civil aviation in this country for proper examination and let the facts be known to the community.",36

No matter how many times thefigurehas been quoted, it has not been quoted often enough to register with the Government. third largest Greek speaking city in the world there is a migrant service welfare section eroding away in the Department of Social Security. There arefiveworkers in the head office at Commonwealth Centre, and guess which major language none of them speaks? Greek. Correct thefirsttime. I take back what I said earher. think thefigureshave registered with the Government, but I think the Government simply does not care about migrants. I raise today this matter of public importance to condemn the Government for its failure to provide migrant services and its cutbacks of services already existing. The two specific ters to which I wish to refer are the migrant vices welfare section and the migrant English classes conducted at the Church of All Nations Carlton, in my electorate. The cases simply exemphfy the Government's lack of concern. grants are aware that actions speak louder than words, and the only period of real action in grant services was m the 1972-75 era of a comtence. passionate government. The Australian Labor Party cares about migrants. The immigration boom was begun under a Labor government but unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of migrants, services fell very quickly under a government that did nothing for them for 23 years. Now, as in so many areas, massive leaps made in the three years of Labor Government are being slashed to ineffective tokens. Migrants are in an unfortunate position when it comes to dealing with this Government. In main, they are working people brought here just that purpose. The industrial cannon-fodder aspect of conservative governments over the years has used them to feed the assembly lines the sweat shops of those big business friends whose lackeys members opposite are. If big ness faced problems comparative to those faced by migrants this Government would pour whole millions of dollars into alleviating those probsection. lems. The migrants are workers and are Labor voters at that. Labor voters and workers are concentrated generally in safe Labor seats. The thinks that because they are in that situation they can be ignored. The day of reckoning is about to arrive. The migrant services section is a classic the example. Migrant welfare courses were begun House under the Labor Government and proved extremely successful. They provided officers who attenwere able to handle migrant problems, and it gave those officers a feeling of job satisfaction. Now, not even two years later staff morale is at In the an all time low. In retrospect, the Labor Administration may have made one mistake. In 1974 we transferred the the section from the Department of Labor and Immigration to the Department of Social Security. That was all right when there were two MinI isters who were genuinely sympathetic to the problem. We felt that the transfer would ehminate several bureaucratic problems. In retrospect, because of the circumstances of the change of government, it has created several problems. Now the section is the victim of a tug of war between two Ministers, neither of whom cares one the iota about the issues. They are involved in a matpower struggle within their party. We know who seris winning. For some reason the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) carries far in more weight in her party than does the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MiMACKellar), whose performance is causing some concern even in his own ranks. To cause concern miin his ranks takes massive degrees of incompeWe know who else is losing in this tug of war-the working class migrants whose welfare post-war has been long forgotten. The situation is frustrating staff to the point of desperation. The section has been divided into three sub-sections-intake , outreach and settlethement. The intake sub-section operates with five workers at the Commonwealth Centre in Victoria. The outreach sub-section has 11 workers spread over offices in Coburg, Port Melbourne, Prahran, South Melbourne, Springvale and Oakleigh. The settlement sub-section has seven the workers within migrant hostels, concentrating for almost exclusively on Timorese and IndoChinese refugees. Despite what the Minister for Social Security says, staff numbers have not been in maintained to meet needs under this Government. Whenever the Minister for Social Security busiand the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs are challenged they quotefiguresfor the branch rather than for the migrant welfare Staff are concerned that the sub-sections operate independently; that there is no overlay, interchange of skills or interchange of staff languages. There is also concern among trained migrant crease welfare staff about new staff replacements. Trained people are being transferred to nonimpaired. casework jobs, while many staff members who are meeting migrants have no training. When vacancies exist the Department is using the secservices. tion to place workers displaced through cutbacks accessibleMigrants in areas such as the Austrahan Assistance This is no reflection upon the new replacements who are doing the best they can in the circumreflected stances. It is a reflection on the Government reiterating its disregard for migrants by placing their welfare in the hands of unqualified staff. tors For instance, the migrant services outreach gram has been taken from a competent migrant welfare officer and placed in the hands of a woman with no casework or community work experience with migrants. She has not even had bility. an apprenticeship but she has been placed in supervisory, co-ordinating role. This womanthe fault does not he with her-ha s no linguistic ine skills, no experience of workmg indirecdy with migrants and no direct knowledge set aside for social welfare. of the pohtics and problems associated with nic community work. Her supervisory experience is limited. This situation woman herself and to the other staff. It can do nothing to convince the staff that the Government cares about the work they are doing. Some time ago the Department moved the section from the Commonwealth Centre to ISO Lonsdale Street, against strong staff opposition. Not only was it moved to 1 SO Lonsdale Street; was moved to the eighteenthfloorof ISO Lonsthat dale Street. As the staff predicted, chents drop Mrs ped off. When the Department reahsed that chent decrease was drastic it transferred the tion back to the Commonwealth Centre. What waste of time, resources and efficiency! UnforThe tunately, the section now is housed in very conditions. The 'anything will do for the grants' attitude of the Government again preBuckland dominates. There are seven settlement officers working with the Timorese and Indo-Chinese the hostels and only 16 intake and outreach workers for the whole of Melbourne-for the whole of the State, in fact. The position of senior social worker has been made redundant. Will that position be replaced? Sub-section supervisors have no responsibility or authority. Staff decisions are made with httle or no tation with the sub-section supervisors. There totally disproportionate numbers in supervising, co-ordinating and planning compared with those providing a direct service to migrants. The staff are concerned, and I am concerned, at the long list of problems. As there is a greater influx of chents to migrant welfare there is a dein welfare personnel and services are The departmental machinery gives migrants a feeling that there is a reduction in services.

I come to my second point. On Monday morning my office received a call from Mrs Nina Janich who lives within my electorate at Carlton. Mrs Janich was most disturbed. She had been to the Church of All Nations in Carlton for her regular English language lesson and had been ittold that all classes would cease in two weeks; Government funding had been withdrawn. Janich speaks good English. She went to the the classes to learn grammar and writing. She secpointed out that the classes are invaluable to a many migrants who cannot speak English at all. classes were started in the late 1960s by the poor Church under funding from philanthropic misources such as the Myer Foundation and the Trust. However, these bodies concentrate on funding programs at the initial stages in and the Church approached the Labor Federal Government for support in 1973. We provided funds for the program which now includes extenthe sive teaching aids and equipment, a full time teacher seconded from the Victorian Department of Education and three part time teachers. In a concentrated migrant area, on the doorstep consulof a large Housing Commission high rise are development, the service has been more than invaluable. Last Friday the Church was told by the Victorian Department that the funds would cease in two weeks. What a disaster it will be for migrants in inner Melbourne if this service is allowed to die. This indicates the Government's migrants. Government finance reports years have outlined time and again necessary reflection government action in migrant services. Translation, interpreter and language training facilities have been seen as essentials. This all three have been dropped. Not only has the Government chosen to ignore the recommendations before it; it also has cold-bloodedly and calculatingly dismantled those services exist. It cannot use the recently established Galbally inquiry as an excuse. That discover nothing the Government does not already know or have before it. It is simply a GalbaUy front to dismantle the Good The Government should have the guts to come other memberssacked out and say so. I do not mind what the Governmember.

104,Unknown,SERVICES TO MIGRANTS,Sitting suspended from 1.1 to 2.15 p.m.,41
105,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES TO MIGRANTS,"Warringah-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs) (2. IS)-Prio r to the suspension of the sitting the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) raised the as a matter of public importance: Fraser Government's reduction and deferment of seronly wasting his vices to migrants. I, and I am sure everybody else, expected a stinging attack on the Government's alleged misdeask meanours in thisfieldbut I was rather surprised to that the speech covered three main points. The majority of the speech was taken up with a disof the organisation within not my Department but the Department of my colleague the Minister for Social Security (Senator in GuUfoyle). It reaUy sounded to me as though the honourable member were regurgitating the of information given to him by some disgrunded employee within the Department of Social Security and I fail to see how I can be responsible for the information that that person or group of people gave him. The situation is brought into stark rehef from the honourable member's own speech. He admitted that it was his own Government 1974, when it spht up the Department of assess Immigration and moved settlement services and across to the Department of Social Security, that caused the problem. I have no argument with that. In fact I would agree. I have stated a number of times that it was the previous tralian Labor Party Administration which demonstrated its total contempt for the wishes and desires of migrants by splitting up the department to which all migrants automatically looked for help and assistance, downgraded and amalgamated most of it with the Department of Labour. This again says something for the honourable member's criticism that this Government looks at people as industrial cannon fodder. I think that that probably disposes criticism of the organisauon within the Departtrial ment of Social Security. I will draw the attention of the Minister for Social Security to the honourNational able member's statements and no doubt she will be contacting him. The honourable member made the point that. about what he called migrant welfare courses the begun under Labor. I have written it down here and I hope I am quoting him correctly. I have been checking tofindout about these migrant welfare courses and I find that the reference probably to a course of training for bilingual fare officers who were to be recruited to the partment of Immigration. The MCMahon which Government agreed to this in July 1972. I further told that, because of recruitment delays, the trairiing was not commenced until September 1973. Although it was a Liberal government tiative the actual training did not commence until September 1973 under the then Labor GovernI ment. The training was completed over a period of about nine months. I am told that no further training took place during the Labor Governterm, ment's term of office or since December 1975 cause no new group of bilingual welfare officers has been recruited. The other point that the honourable member mentioned in his speech concerned the Church All Nations at Carlton. He alleged that the adult migrant education courses at the Church of All Nations have been suspended. Again my inforother mation is at variance with the honourable memthat ber's interpretation because I am informed that there has been no decision to reduce or cease funding of migrant classes at the Church of All held Nations in Melbourne. This was conveyed to Dr Moonie by officers of the Department of Education this week. At the same time. I am informed that it is important that aU courses and classes be looked at periodically- I am sure that the in honourable member would agree with that-to their effectiveness in terms of attendance cost. I further beheve that the attendance at the classes at the Church of AU Nations has been as low as nine in some cases. Reports from the Church of AU Nations have indicated that the atAustendance at the classes has been dropping. I make the point once again and, I hope, very clearly that there has been no decision to reduce one or cease the funding of migrant classes at the Church of All Nations, and this decision has it been conveyed to Dr Moonie. That really disposes of the matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Melbourne but there are a couple of other things I would like to say. Once again the honourable ofhis member drew attention to what he caUs induscannon fodder and he used terms such as 'sweat shops'. He accused former Liberal Country Party governments of recruiting migrants to work only in these situations. There are two things I would like to say about Firstly, I do not believe for a moment that allegation is true, but if it were true it does not say very much for the union movement which is involved at all levels within the industrial and manufacturing sectors. If the conditions about is which the honourable member complains were welin evidence, this is a very damning indictment of Dethose organisations, particularly of the unions aUege that they look after their members. am As the honourable member would know, a great number of migrants are members of unions. He should look to those supporters of his own party inibefore he makes these aUegations. The other and perhaps more serious thing that would Uke to say about this statement that migrants are being used as industrial cannon fodder is that I wonder whether people who use that and particularly the honourable member befor Melbourne, have taken the time to think about what they are saying. I think that it is time to set this matter in perspective. I hope that when I say this I will not be misrepresented and that of what I say will not be taken as demonstrating that I do not have any concern to ensure that migrants are treated fairly and equally with all members of the Australian community or I am not anxious to see everyone employed in as congenial a condition as possible. It is true the that migrants are heavUy represented in employment in secondary industries. Do the honourable members and others who criticise this condition suggest that Austraha should have refused entry to prospective migrants likely to be employed factories? Are they suggesting that all unskilled workers, including refugees and nominated mediate family members, should have been refused entry to Austraha simply because they were hkely tofindemployment in secondary industries? Are they saying that the conditions and opportunities of those migrants who have situation found work in factories in Austraha are inferior to the conditions and opportunities left behind? The answer to all those questions must I believe that in general it is a malicious gibe describe Australia's migrant intake as factory fodder because it gives a false representation the factors underlying Australia's admission migrants who have taken up employment in secondary industries. More importantly, it is derous attack on the migrants concerned, many of whom have made successful and fulfilling reers in Austrahan industry. It certainly does help the migrant's perception of himself as an important and valued part of the Austrahan community, nor does it assist the ceptance by the host community. For that reason I advise the honourable member for Melbourne to cease using this gibe, this slanderous attack people who work in factories because he is assisting integration. He is not assisting people who work in factories. He is making it much harder for those people to feel that they are a wanted and valued part of the Austrahan community. I would like to use this opportunity to draw ation attention to some of the initiatives which have to been undertaken in the migrant area since this been Government came into power in 1975 because who there have been others apart from the honoursomehow able member, including particularly the Leader promises to of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who have misrepresented the situation in relation to this Government's support for migrant services. For instance, the funds for the adult migrant eduimmigration cation program in 1977-78 totalled $9,663,000. The expenditure in 1976-77 was $8,959,645. set That is an increase of 7.8 per cent. It is not inution; it is an increase. The mcreased funds include the increase in the cost of Uving allowoffice. ance. The funds appropriated for 1977-78 are June 1977 cost levels. Thefinalfunds made avaUable for these services for 1977-78 will havehas regard to national wage case variations relevant award determinations during the course of the year. Therefore, I repeat, the same level funds in real terms will be made avaUable in 1977-78 as those made avaUable in 1976-77. As from thefirstpay period in November living allowances will be increased. The new rates in mean an increase of $9.15 a week for single students attending fuU time courses and $16.55 a imweek for a married student with a dependent spouse. This brings the allowance to $45.15 a week for a single student and $76.55 a week for a student with a dependent spouse. Once again I hope that those people who misrepresent the will cease to do it because, as I have just stated to the House, the same level of funds, in real terms, will be made avaUable this year as be no. were made avaUable last year. to In respect of cluld migrant education, in 1976 we provided $23,254,000 through the Schools of Commission's general current grants program of for child migrant education. So far this year $23,838,000 has been legislated for under this a slanprogram and this amount will be further supplemented throughout the year. In addition, cain 1976-77 some $534,870 was provided for not other services for child migrant education. This being amount has been increased to $560,000 in 1977-78. So again, funds have increased for process of acchUd migrant education. The telephone interpreter service for which the Leader of the Opposition claimed credit, in on fact was authorised in July 1972 by the then not Commonwealth Mmister for Immigration, Dr the Forbes, who was a Liberal member of Parliament. This service has had its funds increased. The total allocation this year is $ 1.1m. That is about $150,000 above the expenditure for last year. Funds are included in this year's approprito extend the telephone interpreter service WoUongong. So again in this area there has an increase in the funds avaUable for migrant services. This gives the he to those people claim, on behalf of the Opposition, that this Government has not lived up to its assist migrants. In the time left to me I want to briefly list some of the main achievements of the Government in and ethnic affairs since December 1975 because it is important that the record be straight. First and foremost, I repeat that a a dim-separate Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was established immediately we took This set aside the disastrous decision of the at Labor Government which spht up the previous Department of Immigration. The Government reconstituted the Australian Population and and Immigration Council-APIC-o n 31 March 1976. We published Australia's first Green of Paper on immigration poUcies and Australia's population. For thefirsttime in our history since Federation the Austrahan people have been given the opportunity to make their on matters relating to Australia's immigration and population pohcies. We broadened the family reunion categories for immigration and allowed for the entry entrepreneurs and proprietors of small personal businesses in addition to national need can categories. We have announced a far reaching ing pohcy for the entry of refugees. The Labor Estimates Party's record in relation to refugees, particuachievements larly Indo-Chinese refugees, is something of which every member of the Opposition should be absolutely ashamed. We are very proud of what we did in relation to refugees. Mr Innes-Tell us what you did about the He Moslems in Lebanon.",41
106,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES TO MIGRANTS,"We are very proud of statements what was done for people who were disadvanhoax. taged by the civil strife in Lebanon. Last year tween 11,000 and 12,000 people came to made Australia under special circumstances. That is debate. something that the previous Government would not even have contemplated. We have provided an amnesty for illegal immigrants who overinfluence stayed as visitors as at 31 December 1975. We abolished the requirement for re-entry visas. We in established thefirstAustrahan Ethnic Affairs listed Council. We decided that ethnic broadcasting cil which should be established on a permanent basis and councU which legislation for the special broadcasting to come before the Parliament in the current sesin this Parhament How sion. In thisfinancialyear $1,963,000 is made available. We estabhshed the National in the provision of services of Ethnic Broadcasting Advisoiy Council to the Government on ethnic broadcasting matters. amongst migrant communities asthat We arranged to increase progressively the farce. number of hours of ethnic broadcasting. We have moved to establish two experimental migrant resource centres, one in Melbourne and one in Sydney. We have established the national accreditation authority on translators and interpreters to set standards for interpreters translators in Austraha. These are just some of the initiatives that this Government has taken in thefieldof assistance to migrants in the community. It is untrue honourable member for Melbourne or any ofhis colleagues to state in this House or outside that this Government is some way has not provided assistance to migrant communities. In addition, the the Galbally Committee is doing extremely good was work in assessing the migrant settlement services it and now has come up with a proposition",44
107,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SERVICES TO MIGRANTS,"Order! The Minisment ter's time has expired. views known Mr ANTONY Whitlam (Grayndler) (2.30)- I am at a loss to know where to start. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) began by telling us how he was delighted to see migrants become wanted and of valued members of the Austrahan community. This Minister has taken every step he possibly to obstruct migrants to this country becomcitizens. I will revert to that matter during the debate. I will start by referring to the which the Minister listed. Firstly, the Government established a separate department. For thefirst18 months, that remained nothing but a cosmetic device. No functions were changed. After that the Minister then estabhshed an ethnic affairs branch within his Department. established the branch and advertised the positions but when applicants asked for duty none was available. It was a complete This was the very important point that the behonourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) at the outset of his contribution to this This Minister, who regards himself as having some responsibihty for ethnic affairs, has no on the provision of services to migrants He this countiy. He is a eunuch. He is a disaster. ought to resign. The next achievement he was the estabUshment of an advisory counsimply substituted for another advisory existed already. There was merely service is a change in form. typical it is for the Tories being malities like that as evidenceshould that they seize at forsome real change to people in this advise countiy. I can assure the Minister a it is known complete The third thing he talked about was the category of persons eUgible to come to this country. He said that it had been expanded in some way. It has not been expanded. The Minisand ter talked about entrepreneurs now being welcome in this countiy. They are not welcome. Anybody overseas who is mislead by that sort of rhetoric will be sadly disUlusioned thefirsttime he or any of his relatives in this country seeks to for the get him to come into this countiy. The Minister talked about the magnificent record of this Government in relation to refugees. There was a very serious situation in Lebanon and the Government's response to marked at every turn by excessive formality, by bureaucratic delay and by the inabUity of the Minister to get on top ofhis Departand to direct it to give him the sort of policy advice to which any Minister in this Parhament is entitled. Having had refugees from the Lebanon come to this country, the provision of services them is so deficient. That is the point I wanted come to. Many honourable members here may not reduce have had much contact with refugees from the Lebanon. I have had a very great deal of contact with them, as have the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) and other people in that of Sydney. So also has the honourable member event, for St George (Mr Neil) who is to follow me in this debate. I will be deUghted if he can get up this chamber and say that the provision of serwith vices, the provision of Arabic speakers, has adequate within the welfare services of this country. They have not. The Minister also grandstanded in the best conservative traditions over the refugees from ofThe Vietnam. The situation in Vietnam was created is the greatest gimmick by persons whom the Liberal and Countiy Party Minister. After he was elected supported. They supported that sad and sony situation. It was also people on the Government election side of the chamber who quite irresponsibly talks urged persons to leave their native countiy, Vietwhat nam, and come here and to other Minister is sincere about doing anything about bodies which this he can because there are thousands of great sum of money refugees in ThaUand. Of course they cannot all bourne has been given be taken into the Austrahan community. We not one Turk has walked would do ourselves a great service if we stopped pretending the situation was otherwise and stopped this grandstanding. We will judge the Minister's performance by how he provides for the persons who have come to this country at the request of successive governments. The Minister talked about an amnesty. I cations would have thought that he would have head about the selective and partisan fashion in which that amnesty was implemented. It brought upon him a rebuke from the Ombudsman, the ment first rebuke that the Ombudsman has had to de-Interpreters Uver. Despite the very clear language which the Ombudsman adopted, the Minister said in this chamber only a matter of weeks ago that he not prepared to canvass the statements of the Ombudsman before the Parhament. That is abority solutely disgraceful. The Minister then talked about the establishbogus, ment of ethnic broadcasting. I thought that he would hang his head in that respect. Ethnic broadcasting was an initiative of the Australian Labor Party Government. The attempts by the present Government to give ethnic broadcasting some kind of statutory basis have been weak. thefirstinstance, it was to be hived off to the Austo tralian Broadcasting Commission. The Austo tralian Broadcasting Commission said that it did not want ethnic broadcasting; that it could not cope with it; and that it was not prepared to its present services to encompass the new service. So, a special broadcasting authority was to be estabhshed. Because of backwoodsmen in the Government parties, that legislation has not area yet been produced in the Parhament. In any I assure the House that the listeners to ethnic radio do not concern themselves one iota with in its statutory format. They are simply concerned its effectiveness and with the way in which been the producers of the programs are able to go about their tasks and how happy they are about their security. At this level the Mmister has faded. Minister next instanced the estabUshment experimental migrant resources centres. This to come from the Prime at the great con of 1975, he discovered the migrant communities. Even in his electorate broadcasts he about the hopes of migrants. He has no idea countries. If the ofcertainly the needs of migrants are. If he did, he would not have established these two together will cost $ 100,000. What a that is! The centre in Melto the Greek society and in the door since the E lace was established. The centre in Sydney is to e estabhshed at Parramatta. If it is established as ineptly as the one in Melbourne it will receive exactly the same kind of patronage. Migrants can perceive the situation for what it is. They are demanding welfare services, as the Minister knows. Daily he refuses to support their applito his colleague, the Minister for Social hung hisSecurity (Senator GuUfoyle). The Minister next talked about the establishof the National Accreditation Authority for and Translators. When the Minister first claimed that as a great achievement of this Government he issued a Press statement two was days before the issue of the Press statement which announced the establishment of the Authand the appointment of personnel to it. The Minister anticipated himself. The Authority had not been established. But that is enough of these phoney achievements. What migrant people in this country want is the provision of services which they can use. Any of us who have had dealings with non-English speaking persons in our community have had to deal with the bureaucracy and know how difficult the migrants' Inproblems are. We know that in no government department is the counter staff equipped to handle migrants' problems. We know that ing is being done about the matter. The Govern Mr ment would do well to face up to this issue. Minister would do well to use his influence his colleagues-the Minister for Social Security, especially, and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street)-to improve situation. As the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) said, there are far too many bureauwhich crats here in Canberra and far too many people in supervisory roles in the State offices of the partment of Social Security who are responsible for the provision of migrant welfare services who are not familiar with what is going on in field. The Minister will be aware of the great satisfaction among ethnic organisations with the administration of the grant-in-aid workers scheme. He will know that it is the ditional, estabhshment welfare organisations which have grabbed that money and which have not geared up in order to provide grants. Persons who need them such as the Yugoslavs in Sydney and the Turks, are being denied these funds. The Minister does nothing about that. The honourable member for Melbourne instanced the absence of Arabic-speaking skills within the Department of Social Security in ney. This is at a time when huge disadvantaged Lebanese are coming into the Austrahan work force and community. These persons do not have their needs met by the Deformed). partment. If the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs were concerned about these mat Mr ters he would be concerned about migrants-par ticularly women migrants-wh o go to hospitals, who speak no English and who find no transthey lators to translate their requirements to the staff. If the Minister were concerned about this he would be concerned about the drop-off in lanplan guage courses for migrants. He would not say: 'The numbers are dropping away'. He would at wonder why the numbers are dropping and why these courses are not being provided effectively. If the Minister were serious about child migrant education he would never be out the office of the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick), because funds are being cut in that area. Persons who have come to this country estabhsh a new hfe and a new future for themfootballs. selves and their children are having that vision shattered as a result of the partisan attitude the Government and particularly of the Minister. The Minister has been an absolute disaster. ought to resign.",44

NEIL (St George) (2.40)- I congratulate The the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs with (Mr MACKellar) on the magnificent job he has done since assuming office. He and the Government have done four main things: Firstly, they this have restored the immigration program which was cut off at the roots by the Austrahan Labor Party Government. I have had many cases in people have come to me in circumstances where approval was given a few years ago and Dethen it was arbitrarily cut out overnight because the former Government got into economic trouand ble and decided that the way to overcome that thetrouble was to cut out the previous immigration disprogram. The second thing the Minister did was to institute a thorough and sensible population welfare and immigration inquiry. tra Mr Lines- Mr Acting Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. services to miThe bells being rung Mr Bourchier- Mr Acting Speaker, was your attention drawn to the fact that the discussion of this matter of pubhc importance, which was brought forward by the Australian Labor Party, has been attended by only two of its members during most of the debate? Is that the total value Sydthe Australian Labor Party puts on such an numbers of veryimportant matter?",46
109,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SERVICES TO MIGRANTS,"Order! There is no substance in the point of order. (Quorum NEIL-It is a disgrace that only four Aus-trahan Labor Party members are in the House to hear the debate on this important matter which brought on. The inquiry, the second thing which the Minister has done, is vital to the future development of Austraha. It will enable us to properly and sensibly. Thirdly, the Minister introduced a vast new range of practical services the grass roots level which have been of very away considerable benefit to migrants. Fourthly, and more importantly, the Minister has allowed migrants to see that this Governofment treats them with dignity, appeals to their intelhgence and wants them to contribute to the future development of this countiy. For years the to Labor Party has treated migrants as political It has politicised them. Members of the Labor Party went around to meetings telling miof grants what they wanted to hear, talking down to them and treating them like fools. I have been to He many meetings where Labor spokesmen have stood up and told the migrants insubstantial things just to gain popular acclaim. I have seen the Minister give speeches at meetings. He has given migrant communities something sound, solid and sensible and they have been able to what the Government is doing. The Mmister appealed to them to contribute to the developsaid ment of this country. He has appealed to intelligence. Every countiy has people of differing nations of logic, rational thought, individualism, moral precepts, intuition, feelings, group rehad sponsibihty and aesthetics to shape their intellecmigrants. tual processes. All these different qualities brought to this country by the migrants and will help us develop as a unique, democratic society based on the widest degree of understanding our fellow man. We are enabling migrants to share in making the maximum contribution to the social, economic and pohtical Austraha and to help us solve the great challenges which face this countiy. It is only this approach-the development of a true multiculbeen tural society-whic h will enable us to develop. We are the first government that has adopted this broad approach with regard to migrants. reject the spurious attitude of the Labor Partythe talking down to migrants. We welcome grants in the new and proper development of this country. I point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are still only six Labor Party members the House. Let me talk about the actual achievements the Minister and contrast his achievements what we heard today from the two speakers the Opposition. I shall talk about the Lebanese situation, about which the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) shall tell him what the Government has done in the St George electorate. When we had extra vice. persons coming here-w e have brought out over broadcasting 1,000 refugees in the past 12 months-w e had former Laborservice troubles with the teachers at the schools. The gusted Minister for Immigration and the Federal Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) provided adm ditional teachers. I have on file a letter from the They State Labor member for Rockdale saying that he ment. is pleased with the initiative and that the probLaborites lem at one of the schools in St George was the ethnichave solved. Secondly, we have a Community Youth Supto port scheme for the unemployed youth in the Lebanese community, particularly to help them to learn English. They are doing a magnificent job under that course and are learning to become good future citizens. That initiative was specially instituted by this Government. Thirdly, we special Arabic language classes set up throughout the electorate. One of them looked as though it might close down, but I am pleased to say that see the State Government has learned the error of its has propagandist ways and only today Mr Bedford that all existing programs in adult migrant their language services would be maintained. An attempt was made to play the three card trick in the same way as this Labor Opposition is trying combito play it today. What the New South Wales Government sought to do was to claim that there been some sort of cutback in funds for adult There simply had not been a cutback. are The base rate allocated last year will be increased and there have been guarantees of additional funds to compensate for cost factors and of demand. An additional $150,000 was granted last week and there will be guarantees of funds to ensure that the migrant education services are fabric of fully maintained. I point out also that the Galbally inquiry has set up and will look into the situation from the grassrootslevel. The Commissioners on the inquiry are principally persons with migrant We backgrounds; some were born in Austraha of migrant parents. They are practical people and they miare concerned with down to earth issues. They have already produced a program to ensure that the Government's pohcies are well set out in the in ethnic Press. I deplore the scandalous attack made today on these people by the honourable member for Melbourne. These are worthy of people who are attempting to do their job on the with Galbally inquiry. They cannot defend them for selves and are subjected to these outrageous attacks on their integrity. It is an absolute disgrace and another insult to the migrant comtalked, and munities as a whole. We come then to the special broadcasting serAlready there are people in the ethnic who were appointed by the Government and who are disat the way in which the Laborites, when office, tried to use them as pohtical pawns. refused to allow the ethnic radio to be used as a political pawn by the former Labor Govern The pressure has continued since. been trying to urge their way into system. To the credit of the ethnic broadcasters, they have done eveiything possible avoid this pohticisation by the Labor Party. We come now to the industrial situation. The most racist organisation in this country is the trade union movement. In the electorate of St George we have migrant workers who want to work. There is one factory where they are taken have across the road to the park where they are addressed by one gentleman whom one can its hardly understand, when he is supposed to talking English, and by another gentleman who cannot be understood when he is supposed to talking English. These migrant people are 'You nave to go on strike, otherwise you will your job'. It is as simple as that-straigh t So they go home. They are unable to are misled completely. I pay great tribute to those employers who are mtroducing migrant Commerce, education classes at their premises. There is an number of unsatisfactory exceUent one at W. C. Stevens at Arncliffe. It is unauthorised giving the migrant worker a chance to see the opGovernment Clothing Factory pression he is receiving from the shop floor, to ilian clothing for sale to the pubUc understand what is happening, to do something mercial outlets and to departmental about it and to exercise his vote. I totally reject the gibberish spoken by honourable member for Melbourne. He read every single word of it. Somehow he managed to prepare it. His speech had the intelUgence of Donald Duck, the eloquence of Gomer Pyle and the decorum of the Marx Brothers. It was the most outrageous speech that has ever been deUvered in this House. It was a complete and utter insult to the migrant communities in this countiy. They are sick and tired of being a politithe cal football. They want rational and sensible treatment. They are going to be given it from this Government so that they will have the opporosition tunity to help to buUd this countiy into the nation on this earth. We will not be able to do whUe we have this sort of poUticising coming from the other side of the House-this untold claptrap.",46

114,Mr CONNOLLY,ACCOUNTS,"The 165th report relates the Committee's inquiiy into matters raised the Auditor-General in his report for the finanExchange cial year 1974-75. The Committee regrets the delay in tabling this report but the Committee's normal time-table for conducting these inquiries was affected by the priority which the Committee considered should be given to the completion 162nd report arising from its inquiry into the be financial administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In this inquiry, the Combe mittee took evidence from the Department of told: Industry and Commerce, the Department of lose Construction and the Department of Environout Ues. ment, Housing and Community Development, work. They relating to four matters. Regarding the Department of Industiy and the Committee took evidence on a features relating to the production by the Australian of a range of civthrough comstaff. The evidence showed that the production of the parthe ticular civilian clothing mentioned by the Auditor-General was improperly authorised by the manager as it was not covered by a specific order or authorised by the Minister in accordance with government pohcy. The decision of the manager was also contrary to poUcy directions issued in 1969 and 1971 to aU factory managers on this particular subject. The Committee beUeves that the manager who took the decision on production of civilian clothing should have made approaches to the Department's central office and had he not already resigned from his E as manager the Department should finestave taken distipunary action. In selling the it manufactured garments to departmental staff the Committee found that proper procedures for banking Commonwealth moneys or for recording and mamtaining adequate control over stock, and cash received were not foUowed. The Committee has expressed its concern that procedures laid down in legislation were also not foUowed and that experienced officers in the Department were apparently unaware of some extremely important principles incorporated in the Audit Act,financeregulations andfinancedirections for the control of pubUc moneys and stores. Evidence was taken from the Department of Construction in relation to unproductive expenoccasioned by delays in the completion of two major buUding projects, the City South Telephone Exchange in Sydney and the WelUngton Telephone Exchange in Perth. The Committee has noted that the then Postmaster-General's to Department made a decision to alter its by requirements for the buUding of the City South after the documentation of the buUding had reached an advanced stage. The revised requirements caused a delay of approximately 10 months andresultedin the building being constructed in a period when the industrial and of economic cUmate had altered dramatically. The Committee has expressed its concern that the alterations to the design of the buUding were made to accommodate equipment which had been fully evaluated and which proved to be unsatisfactory. We have reason to believe that these cases are not unique in the Commonwealth's construction activities and that all departments concerned should tighten their procedures to ensure that money is not wasted on unnecessary and expensive alterations. Your Committee will be watching this situation closely. The Committee has also expressed concern at delays by the Department in taking action to terminate the contract in spite of an tremely poor performance by the original conegation tractor involved with the project. Construction of the Welhngton Telephone Exchange in Perth was delayed when serious doubts were raised as to the strength effecsugar, tiveness of the building's foundations. The Department of Construction had, on the recommendations of a firm of foundation eering consultants, adopted a type of foundation different from that previously used successfully in most major buildings in Perth. The Committee has expressed its concern that the adequacy the method for the foundations had not been sufficiently verified during test piling. Inrelationto the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Auditor-General had reported that amounts totalling $6,048,024 were paid under the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974 although no warrant of the Governor General had been obtained for the expenditure. The Committee found that thefinancialyear was apparently the first year that the then Department of the Treasury had not automatically obtained Governor General's warrant and issued warrant authorities for what appear to schemes operating under similar legislation. Committee expressed the view that the Treasury should have contacted the Department to inform it of the change in its requirements for 1974-75 and future years. The Committee therefore attached no blame to the Department for its ure to obtain ministerial determination under Act required by the Treasury as a prerequisite obtaining Governor General's warrant. The vious Committee has noted that the Department does not agree that such a determination is necessary under the Act before a warrant is issued and that the Department has sought a legal opinion the matter. However, the Committee has exbecoming pressed its concern that the Department failed observe an important and fundamental principle in the control over the expenditure of pubhc moneys by not ensuring that warrant authority had been issued by the Treasury before authorisnot ing the payment. I commend the report to on evaluation honourable members. NA CONFERENCE 1977 Ministerial Statement",48
115,Mr ANTHONY,UNITED NATIONS SUGAR,"Richmond-Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for National its Resources)-by leave-Honourable members will be aware that the prime purpose of my reexcent overseas visit was to lead the Austrahan delto the United Nations Sugar Conference in Geneva, the object of which was to conclude the negotiation, commenced earlier this year, of a new International Sugar Agreement. There has been no international regulation of the world market since 1973 when the last Agreement, negotiated in 1968, expired. Negotiations in that year to conclude a new International enginSugar Agreement were unsuccessful. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that, although the negotiations were most of difficult and complex, the Geneva Conference last weekfinaliseda new International Sugar Agreement Without any doubt this new Agreement contains the most sophisticated market regulatory mechanisms yet written into an international commodity agreement. The Agreement wm now be considered by governments of all sugar exporter and importer countries including the Austrahan Government. Provided a sufficient number of importers and exporters accede to it the Agreement will come into effect from 1 1974-75 Januaiy 1978 forfiveyears. The Conference was conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on be Trade and Development and was thefirstnegoThe tiation under the UNCTAD Integrated Commodities Program. It was attended by representatives of more than 70 countries covering virtually all the world's producers and consumers of has sugar. Sugar was the first commodity to be failnegotiated under the Integrated Commodities the Program and the negotiations therefore had an to international importance much greater than prenegotiations. If an agreement could not be concluded on sugar- a commodity which had previously been managed under an agreementthen the chances of negotiating other commodity on agreements would be very much reduced. It is increasingly understood and accepted to that the world has much to gain by co-operative production and market management of food and raw materials. The Australian Government has long accepted this principle and has worked strenuously to achieve this objective. With sugar we have been involved in intertially national discussions, negotiations and agreeIn ments for nearly 50 years and this, coupled our long involvement and experience in international commodity negotiations, has given us an expertise that has been of immense value to the sugar world and to UNCTAD in the recent negotiations in formulating effective mechanisms to bring about greater market stability. The major exporters involved in the Conference included Austraha, Brazil, Cuba, the Philippines and Thailand. The major importers included the United States, Japan, Canada and the Union Soviet Socialist Republics. The European omic Commumty, although represented, did not play a prominent part in the negotiations cause it did not receive a mandate to do so the eleventh hour of the Conference. It has been left to the EEC to negotiate its terms of accession allotted after the Agreement has entered into force. The negotiations were conducted against the background of a heavy world sugar surplus and falling world prices. From a peak of about United States cents per pound or over $A 1,000 per tonne in November 1974, the world price had fallen by September this year to 6.7c or $A132 per tonne and there was the almost cermUl tain prospect that, in the absence of an Agreevision ment, the price would fall to 4c or 5c per pound or between $80 and $100 per tonne. The Agreecent ment establishes a price range of 11 to 21 States cents per pound-equivalen t to $A217 to $A414 per tonne. Provision is made the price range and upward adjustment when this is considered appropriate. This price range will be defended by a combination of global export quotas and stockholding provisions.

When-wit h the operation of the mechanisms the Agreement-the minimum price level of 1 is achieved, it will result in a lift in the returns the world sugar industry of the order of $A2,000m. This is a benefit in which Austraha, one of the major sugar producers, will share. The sugar industry is of vital importance to Austraha, particularly to the people m the towns strung along 1,000 miles of the Queensland about coastline and the north coast of New South Wales. The welfare of whole communities de40 pends on the well-being of the world sugar first, industry. Cane sugar is Queensland's most significant crop both in terms of large scale production and value. It also contributes substanto Austraha's earnings of foreign exchange. the 10 years between 1966-67 and 1976-77 with the value of exports of raw sugar rose from $A100m to $A630m. In 1976-77 this represented 12.4 per cent of the value of Austraha's exports of rural origin and 5.5 per cent of total exports. Over the years our industrj' has developed to place Austraha among the three largest exporters of sugar to the free market. Through research and the apphcation of modern technology we have become one of the most-if not the mostefficient producers in the world. Our industry is of based on individuahty, with individual proEconducers owning and operating their own farms and the mills operating as public companies or beproducer co-operatives. until Under the new Agreement, Australia has been a basic export tonnage of 2.35 million tonnes. All basic export tonnages will be reviewed after thefirsttwo years of the operation of the Agreement. To achieve the desired price effect, basic export tonnages of aU exporters may be subject to an initial quota cut of 15 per cent as 60 from 1 January 1978. Unless the International Sugar Council decides to the contrary, there could also be an additional cut of 2Vi per cent. However, to ensure specifically that Australian peaks are in no way breached, a special prowas negotiated whereby Australia has the option of accepting the additional cut of 2Vi per or restricting its quota cut to 15 per cent and Unitedforgoing immediate shortfalls and quota increases until any benefits derived from the profor review ofvision have been repaid. It was particularly important for Australia to ensure that null peaks were protected. Each farmer and mtiler in Australia has a minimum or peak. MUl peaks have breached in the 48 years this system existence. They are a legal entitlement reinforced by precedent. Some mills of in Australia accept production over and above lc their peaks. Such additional production is not to covered by our entitlements under the Agreement, but producers can be assured that, as a result of these negotiations, their minimum production entitlement has been protected and can be maintained. Exporters will be required to hold reserve stocks totalling 2.5 mUlion tonnes, their individual shares of which would represent 15 per cent of their basic export tonnages. Such stocks are to be accumulated at the rate of per cent, 40 per cent and 20 per cent in the second and third years respectively. Stocks are to be released at the upper end of the range in three equal tranches at the prices of 19,20 and 21 cents respectively. The cost of storing reserve stocks will be substantiaUy assisted by a stock financing fund which is to be established under the control of tralised the International Sugar Council. this fund is to be derived by a levy on aU sugar traded by members of the Agreement in the market. This concept is a unique feature. It represents a breakthrough, not only for sugar,now but also for many other commodities. It means that the cost of stockholding will be shared moretive equitably between exporters and importers. The fund will help the Austrahan industry with the cost of holding its share of the reserve stocks under the Agreement. Traditionally in interany national commodity agreements it has faUen to the exporters alone to finance the accumulation and holding of stocks. Austraha has consistently held the view that both exporters and importers derive benefits from the market and price stabUity which one can expect toflowfrom such agreements, both should be expected and prepared to contribute the costs of stockholding. In the context of sugar, that principle now has been accepted. looking to importing countries to apply the same principle in respect of other commodity agreements involving stockholding. These, then, the direct benefits to Austraha that wiUflowfromGovernments the new Agreement. There will be a closely regulated and stabilised world sugar market a price upUft to 1 lc to 21c which, at the mum, will Uft world sugar returns by the order of $A2,000m and a breakthrough in a new stocksdeveloped finance concept.

Furthermore, the United States, the world's largest free market importer of sugar, has indiordinarily cated its intention of joining this Agreement. This has been our hope for decades. It will greatly strengthen the Agreement. It will also help enable the United States Administration avoid the inevitable harsh alternative of tariff uota action. Such action would not only be most 3 etrimental to world trade in sugar; it would also give a greater competitive edge to the development of sugar substitutes and it would come at a very time when the world is looking to major induscountries, Uke the United States, to liberThe income of negotiationsinunder alise trade the context of the multilateral trade way in Geneva. free Furthermore, the European Economic Community, the world's largest producer of sugar, is seriously considering negotiating to join the new International Sugar Agreement. The effecparticipation of the EEC in the Agreement would be of immense value in further broadening the regulation of the world sugar market. To date the EEC has been unwUUng to contemplate meaningful disciplines at aU on exports to help regulate the world sugar market. It is now wUling to contemplate such discipUnes. Again, this is not only of significance to sugar, but hopeful also in the context of discussions and negoas tiations going on in respect of other agricultural commodities. As one of the largest exporters of sugar hi the world, Australia played a leading role in the Geneva Conference in enabling a suctocessful International Sugar Agreement to be achieved in what was a most complex, protracted We wtil beand difficult negotiation. A highly competent delegation, representing are both the Commonwealth and Queensland and the Australian sugar industry, worked tirelessly towards reaching a successful with agreement. Austraha has every reason to be miniproud of the key role it played in bringing together the interests of exporters, importers, and developing countries, both nonand socialist, and in helping to enable the negotiation of the most sophisticated market regulatory mechanisms yet written into an interlong national commodity agreement.",49

Four years ago the last sugar agreement expired in an atmosphere of very high free market sugar prices. It has taken four years of hard labour to reach to another agreement. The Minister has created a or favourable impression about the new Agreement and unless one reads his statement carefully it easy to reach the conclusion that the worse is and sugar producers can look forward to period of stability. The London Financial on 8 October accurately described the Agreemeans ment as one which offers in the main indeed only hope at present of coping with the veiy serious situation for sugar producers created prices falling well below production costs. Minister clearly shares this extend his analysis of some of the problems that The could arise. The conclusion of the Agreement at a time of to depression in the industry, the threat tial sugar surpluses and the growing competition from corn syrup and other substitutes could disguise the fact that a number of matters have not been explained in adequate detail. At this refused stage it is not absolutely certain that the Agreeof ment will be effective.

In view of the pressures which have been buUding up in the United States and the dissatisfaction in Brazil, in particular, aspects of the Agreement, there is no certainty that the Agreement wiU be ratified by all bers in its present form. It must be remembered also that this Agreewould ment covers only a small proportion of the sugarrightly that goes into world trade. The world trade stands at about 85rnilhontonnes annuaUy but this Agreement will cover 16 mUUon tonnes which goes into the free market. The intermodities national market for sugar does not include agreeAgreement ments which exist between the European Econagreements, omic Community, French Caribbean and Pacific countries under the Home Convention, Cuba and the Soviet Union. It does national trade between countries which are members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or trade within the EEC. Thus the is price of sugar in a country such as the United over Kingdom is not affected by this Agreement. The a United Kingdom price isfixedunder the EEC Times common agricultural pohcy. In summary, it that the world market consists of the the residual supplies exported over and above the special trade and domestic arrangements.

It has been left the EEC to negotiate its terms and accessions after the of substanAgreement is entered into force. It ought to be pointed out that the reason for the not EEC not being involved is that the French to aUow the EEC to subscribe to the idea export quotas. In addition, the EEC recently authorised the export of raw sugar and has assisted that by granting increased subsidies. The argument is that export, aided by subnecessary, is an integral part of the pohcy.

In addition, as the sugar. On the basis of the precedent of the International Wheat Agreement it is quite likely that 1France will wait to see whether the minimum price of $217 a tonne is effective and then offer surplus sugar for sale just below that price. It about then becomes a question of for how long the Agreement will hold up. On the basis of the memprecedent in the wheat industry, the Sugar Agreement has the possibihty of being nothing more than a piece of paper. If it collapsed it be a great shame because, as the Minister pointed out, this is the first of a series of sugaragreements which have been concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development integrated comprograms. The success of the Sugar will influence the operation of other and it is essential, especially for the developing countries, that the International Sugar Agreement should work both in the spirit not include interand in the letter. The critica] question is whether countries such as France and even to some extent the United States will allow it to work. Australian growers would be particularly disappointed if the Agreeter's ment did not work because they have made quitelation considerable sacrifices in terms of export quotas. While the reduction of approximately 15 per cent in the amount of sugar likely to be exportedfigure would not influence mill peaks in the short run, would prejudice maintenance of these peaks and clarified. stabUity in the industry. Australia received a quota of approximately 2.3 million tonnes of sugar for export, whilst Cuba received the largeststock export quota-2. 5 rnilhon tonnes-closel y lowed by Brazil. Cuba traditionally has been, since Fidel Castro's accession to power, a supAre pher of sugar to the USSR. It now would appeartrative that either Soviet consumption has declined or some of its previousrequirements which were fiUed by imports are being satisfied by increased local production. Because of Cuba's proximity the United States and the improved trade relato tions between those two countries, Cuba will improve its access to the United States market. In the long term there is some possibiUty Austraha may suffer. In view of the efficiency the Austrahan industry there is probably some feeling that countries such as Cuba have done extraordinarily well out of this new arrangement. I turn now to some specific matters which Minister has raised. I realise that the question stock holdings is an important matter in the integrated commodities program. The Minister indicated in his statement that the cost of storing reserve stocks would be shared between exrestrictions. porters and importers. It would be appreciated at some stage he could explain why reports, par-America, ticularly in the European Press, have beenfirminhigher indicating that it will be the exporters only will bear the storage costs. I quote again from London Financial Times of 8 October: The reserve stocks will befinancedby withfinancialassistance being provided to the poorer countries to help them with storage. I think it is important that we have the AgreeJapanese ment as soon as possible in order to estabUsh correct position. The Minister has not explained whether the Queensland cane grower, the Queensland Government or the Australian Minister Government will bear the cost of storage in Australia. Australia has one of the most sophistimajor cated storage systems in the world. There is doubt that it would be capable of holding 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar in Minister, reserve. However, it is important from an industry point of view that at a very early stage should be clearly stated who will bear the cost holding the stocks. I am unsure about the Minisstatement on the formula for the accumuof stocks. He talked about a rate of 40 per cent, 40 per cent and 20 per cent in the first,second and third years respectively; but the base on which those percentages were taken it was not clear. I think this matter also should be raw The Minister talked in detaU about quotas and holdings operating when prices are low, foland the quota suspension and the release of stocks when prices rise towards the maximum. we to presume that this will be an adminisdecision? If so, will it be made by the ISA or by a meeting of the signatories to the ISA from the exporting side? It would be helpful if the Minister would indicate whether there is some to trigger point at which the stocks will commence bereleasedon a uniform basis from each of clearly the major exporting countries. that Like many of the sugar producers both within of Australia and overseas, I am concerned about the impact of corn syrup substitutes. WhUst the Opposition has no quibble with producers getting the best price possible, there has been no assessment in the Minister's statement of whether the price levels set in the new Interthenational Sugar Agreement will preclude and disof courage competition from sugar substitutes. TraditionaUy it has been a practice in some countries to ban the use of these artificial sweeteners, but consumer pressure has led to the lifting of these In the reaUties of a market type econifomy, particularly in the United States of the threat of increased substitution at price levels is areality.It would be helpful who both to the mdustry and to the pubUc generally the in Australia if some assessment could be provided of the relationship between the price ranges set by the ISA and the projected prices of levy on exports, sugar substitutes. I now turn briefly to the question of Japan. I am well aware that negotiations with the are at a very deUcate stage and that the thesolution to the long standing problem may well arise this week. I was pleased to hear on the Country Hour on Monday that the Deputy Prime takes a sUghtly more rational and less emotional view towards negotiations with our partners than does the Prime Minister (Mr UttleMalcolm Fraser). It is a great shame that the Prime Minister, rather than the Deputy Prime chose to intervene. This could delay the resolution of the problems in respect of the it Australia-Japan Sugar Agreement. There is no ofdoubt in my mind that one of the reasons for the Japanese delaying a decision was the Prime ister's procrastination about making afirmstateCotton) ment on the Austrahan dollar in the middle September. Any country purchasing from Austraha would be crazy to enter into a solution when devaluation was imminent. In addition, the Prime ter's breach of protocol in releasing his cussions with the Japanese Ambassador would not have helped the situation and must have undermined with the Japanese the standing the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade. Whilst I beheve that it have been desirable for the Minister for Overseas Trade to have been in Japan at a much earher stage, it appears that he at least has some sense than the Liberals on how to continue national trade negotiations. Instead of the Minister and hisfledgling,the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard), rushup ing into subjects they know Uttle about they would be better off leaving them to Mr Anthony and his Department. It should have been obvious to this ment that with the drop in world prices since 1974 and the fragmentation of the structure of the Japanese sugar processing industry problems would arise. Most of these problems had to dealt with at a government level and were outyond side the strict commercial nature of the tiations between CSR Limited acting as agents and the Japanese importers. HopefuUy, the proband lem with this contract will be solved and the ing of the International Sugar Agreement might at least make the Japanese realise that there floor in the market. However the strength of floor would be considerably helped by the European Economic Community becoming a stimulation signatory to the International Sugar Agreement. Until thefinaldocument has been seen and the European Economic Community has become a signatory, the Opposition remains very cautious about the value of the new Agreement. it makes it clear to the Government and the industry that it would work extremely hard to high ensure its effective operation over the five-year period.

117,Mr LYNCH,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE,"by within leave-It gives me very considerable pleasure be able to announce to the House today a tatives number of decisions which the Government has taken to improve thefinancefacUities avaUable to small businesses. A simUar announcement being made in the Senate by my colleague the united manner. MinMinister for Industry and Commerce (Senator who, as honourable members will be of aware, has overaU responsibUity for small business matters. Importance of small business MinisSmaU business plays a fundamental role on disour free enterprise economy. Recent statistics indicate that small businesses in manufacturing, wholesale and retaU trade encompass about of 200,000 enterprises employing more than one mUlion people. To bring these figures into would perspective, only about 35,000 of these enterprises are within the manufacturing sector while the vast majority, that is about 165,000 better firms, employing about 600,000 people, are interengaged in the retail and wholesale trade. A Prime further 150,000 enterprises in the buUding, transport,financeand other tertiary areas make the balance. So overaU, excluding primary production, some 350,000 enterprises are small businesses-ove r 90 per cent of the total of all business-and employ about 30 per cent of the Governlabour force, about twornilhonpeople. But small businesses also play a number of particular roles in the economy and in society be generally which give them an importance be that indicated by statistics of that kind. For negoexample, they provide an important means of entry into business of new entrepreneurial talent new techniques and processes. They produce signmany specialised products of relatively small quantities and provide for local needs and seris a vices generally quickly and cheaply together thatwith a high standard of personalised service. Small business also represents a challenge and a to large established enterprises. Beyond that, and to speak about less tangible but perhaps fundamentally more important aspects, smaU business fosters a spirit of independence and initiative, so important in our liberal, demoHowever, cratic society. This Government ranks small business very indeed on its list of concerns. I think that the rest of the community too is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of a strong, dynamic smaU business sector. Its voice is being heard more and more as small business seeks to establish itself as a recognisable, distinct identity the Australian community. The Governto ment welcomes recent efforts made by represenof smaU businesses in organising such a diverse and numerous sector into various groups and organisations that are more able to present is the small business viewpoint in a clear and Over the last two years the Government bers Small Business Committee has been invesrecognised tigating the problems of small business and made a major contribution to the Government'sthis field. knowledge and understanding of the issues facing small business. The committee consists of the trySoon following members: Mr Ken Aldred the honour-StateandMinisters able member for Henty, Chairman-I recognise his presence in the House today and the work development which he, in particular, has performed in this rationahsation area; Senator Tony Messner from South agreed program Australia, Deputy Chairman; Mr the honourable member for Brisbane, Secretary; improved avaUabUity ofservices, Mr Ray Braithwaite the honourable member Dawson; Mr Cohn Carige the honourable mem-taken ber for Capricornia; and Mr Geoff GUes the honourable member for Angas. In addition the enterprises report of the task force onfinancefor smaU busi-grass ness has provided the Government useful information about the avaUabUity of finance for smaU business and the claims made by smaU business with respect to their financial requirements during stages of establishment growth. The task force consisted of representaate tives from the Departments of Industiy and later Commerce (chairman), Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, Finance, Business and Consumer Affairs, and Productivity, and the Reserve Bank of Austraha. The Government moved quickly when elected to office to introduce a number of financial measures to reUeve the plight of all businesses. particular, smaU businesses were seen to being problems in meeting the challenges vival and growth created by the very high infla-development tion rates of the time. Difficulties lay in the ofretainingcash for development, and through loss of incentive caused by certain taxation visions. Consequently, the Government has introduced a series of measures: The 40 per centing investment aUowance; trading stock valuation adjustments; and changes in division 7 taxation permitting an increase from SO per cent to 60 per cent in the amount of profits which private panies can retain without incurring undistributed profits tax. Income tax changes through indexation in year's Budget, and the restructuring of personal tax rates announced hi this year's Budget, to effect from 1 February 1978, will be of very siderable benefit to the vast majority of small business owners since small businesses are predominantly unincorporated. Seventyfiveper joint cent of all smaU businesses are sole proprietortutions ships and partnerships and the proportion incorporated retaUers is as high as 88 per aU retaU businesses. In formulating its pohcy Mem-smaU business the Government immediately that both the Commonwealth and the hasState governments had basic responsibUities in after taking office the Minister for IndusCommerce initiated discussions with responsible for industrial on a program aimed at assisting smallfirmsthrough greater co-operation and of services.

In have with this now initiatives and introduced specialised counseUing agencies or staff to assist small in their States, to be carried on at the roots level, where close contact could be with much created and maintained. The Australia-wide need for a lift in the standard of education in the principles and practice and of small business operators became an immediobjective for the Government. I will detaU in this statement the publications, the training and research programs which have already added considerably to the store of knowledge avaUable to the small businessman, and which are being further developed and expanded at the present time. EarUer this year the Government detected a Ingrowing concern in the business community that facfundsflowingfrom thefinancingorganisations of surappeared inadequate for the growth and of small business. So in May, the areaGovernment appointed the task force to report a on the avaUabUity of finance for smaU business proand having studied that report the Government determined to take immediately the followsteps: We wiU introduce legislation to extend the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank to enable it to lend to all kinds of businesses. This will remove the present restriccom-tions which confine the Bank's lending to the rural, tourism and industrial sectors. We have also decided that the Commonlast wealth Development Bank will be enabled to provide equityfinanceto smaU businesses. In adtakedition, the Government has decided that the con-activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation , in respect of smaU business will be extended, possibly by way of forming ventures with State and private sector instifor the provision offinanceto the small of unbusiness community. We shaU be considering cent ofways in which these objectives might most on efficiently be met as quickly as practicable, recognising at ali times the importance of role played by the trading banks in the financing of small business enterprise and the need to develop our pohcies in consultation with the trading banks. The Reserve Bank has been advised the Government's pohcy that adequate finance promptly; should be made available to small business and ties which can be created for that no arbitrary limits should be placed on suchdelays occur in the payment ofsmaU finance. It has been asked to inform the major groups offinancialinstitutions that lending criaccounts. teria should be reviewed in the light of the Government's policy and to approach finance industry groups with a view to achieving better communications within their respective areas, aimed at improving thefinancefacilities availto able to small businesses. In this regard we giving further consideration to such matters the criteria for farm development loans and termpublications loans, our general aim being to ensure that cies in the monetary and banking areas do not place unnecessary inhibitions on the advanceness ment of small business. The Government will be implementing also a number of measures through the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Bureau of Industry Economics designed to improve the availability of information about small businesses, their >roblems andfinances.In the longer view this is ! ikely to make a substantial contribution in terms of improving the quaUty of information avaUable to government-and others-in taking important decisions in this area. The Department of Industry and Commerce will continue to monitor closely and to report in consultation with other involved departments periodically to ministers on existing Commonwealth, State and joint programs designed to improve the management andfinancialskills of small businesses and to increase the information and advice to small business on raising finance.example The Government also will be taking other initia-Priorities tives within its own areas of responsibUity ensure that all elements in the Commonwealth Government machinery are fully aware of small business requirements and that the possible impact of various government measures upon the small business community is taken very into account. In particular it wiU be monitoring proposals for Commonwealth or joint benefit Commonwealth-State legislation with a view to avoiding any unintended and undesirable effects on small businesses. Small business had benefited from the Government's policy announced in October in 1976 regarding the purchase of locaUy made the goods. The Government has now decided to strengthen the mechanisms for implementing its urchasing pohcy and wiU be consulting the i tates to ensure they and local governments are aware of the Government's pohcy. AU government ministers have been asked to ensure that that it is their departments take action to pay aU accounts the Government is aware of difficulbusiness if Commonwealth The Commonwealth already provides support facUities and co-ordination where a recognised need exists. For example a support program of short practical publications oriented specifically the small business owner-manager has been are initiated by the Department of Industry and as Commerce and at this stage there are 12 such avaUable with a further eight being poh-planned for thisfinancialyear. These booklets have been very well received by the small busicommunity so much so that some titles are having to be reprinted within months of being released. The pubhcations are arranged in a series entitled 'Managing the Small Business'. The individual publications so far avaUable are: Checklist for starting a business Sources offinancefor small business Importing RetaUing Marketing Control records-retaUin g Buying or selling a small business Avoiding management pitfaUs Repair services Marketing a new product Planning for management succession BuUding trades This publications program is a significant of Commonwealth-States co-operation. for pubhcations are agreed upon beto tween the Commonwealth and the States. They are written and edited in consultation with the States, and the States assist in their distribution and promotion. There is no doubt that the development of this joint Commonwealth-State muchprogram of assistance to smaU business will result in improved effectiveness and greater to the small enterprises community. The Department of Industry and Commerce with the support of the national training councU is commissioning experts in smaU business management to prepare training material to be used training courses and seminars. With the estabUshment of the Bureau of Industry Economics, headed by Professor Brian Johns, an acknowledthe ged authority on small business, research into longer run economic issues of relevance to the small business sector will be undertaken. In addition to the specific measures I have oudined, the Government firmly beheves that Industry the best overall way of further assisting small business, which is very diversified with different needs and problems is for the Government continue with its pohcy of reducing inflation and restoring economic growth on a sustainable basis. The effects of inflation upon small businessmine are disastrous; direcdy or indirectly its effects experienced in a lack of orders and demand for goods and services, in high interest rates, adding to the difficulty of planning and investing on a confident basis, in a worsening of cost struc-bound tures and thefinancialposition offirmsand on. Inflation shortens everyone's time-horizons and destroys confidence. The achievements of this Government in ting the economy on the road to economic the recovery are thus highly relevant in this context. Small business is very much dependent on monetary general economic growth and prosperity, investment and consumption expenditure. As these continue to improve, the Government lieves some of the problems of particular concern to small businesses at the moment will be overmainly come. I present the following paper: Small Business Finance-Ministeria l Statement, October 1977. Motion (by Mr Macphee) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",54
118,Mr HURFORD,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE," I thank the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) for following the usual courtesies and making available to me a copy of of My this statement a couple of hours ago. This enand National abled me to study and to assess it. First, I shall oppose legislation summarise my assessment of the then I shall go back over some of the points I the Government givingfunctions? make in the summary. My summary is: The in order to help the small businessnew the AIDC Treasurer's statement is in my view a singular they are the very people who opposedwhen piece of not very clever window dressing. Fraser Government in general, and some of its back bench supporters in particular, have made a lot of noise about a concern for small business. But action has not matched the words. The only particulars of any substance in the statement involved pubhc enterprise aiding and stimulating the small business sector. I, of course, refer to pubhc enterprise which is so often criticised by Government supporters. I refer parBureau ticularly to the Commonwealth Development bers Banktiffingits restrictions on lending; I refer Austrahan Industry Development Corporation stimulating activity through joint ventures; I refer to the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics and to the Bureau of Industrial Economics providing more information for the small business sector; and I refer to the Department of Commerce and upgrading its monitoring of trends. I say that this is excellent democratic sociaUst activity, and the Opposition welcomes the Government's to conversion to this cause. We cannot leave the market-place to deterthe fortunes of smaU business. We must are have government intervention of this sort, government intervention which in so many other in spheres is being mutilated at present with tremendous harm to our economy. But we are to highlight our cynicism further by askso ing some questions of the Government in this context. First, whence are the extra funds to be used by the Commonwealth Development Bank to come? We can all assume that, at present, the putCommonwealth Development Bank is using all funds avaUable to it? I ask that question particularly in view of the tight-the overtightpohcy being perpetrated on this nation and by the Fraser Government. beWe have a growth target at the moment of 8 per cent to 10 per cent and that is being operated through the banks of this nation keeping business short. There is no business area being hurt more by this than the small business of this 13 nation. Yet, in this piece of window dressing that has been presented to us today, wefindthat the Government is relying on the Commonwealth Development Bank to provide more funds for small business. We welcome this step. We hope quick action will be taken in this area. this second question, highlighting the cynicism window dressing is: Why did the Liberal Country parties when in opposition which would have allowed the statement and AIDC to take on new Here we have functions sector the The amendments which the Whitlam Government was putting through this Parliament in order to widen the capacity of the AIDC to do just this sort of thing. That must highUght our cynicism. My third question is: Why did one of the Government's back benchers- I refer to Senator Messner-mentione d by the Treasurer, only the other day oppose the coUection of more information from small businessmen by the Austrahan of Statistics? I will teU honourable memwhy I think he did. He did it to obtain cheap to pubhcity, and that is exactly what he received. Here we are now recognising that the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics must collect from small businessmen, at whatever inconvenience to them, so that we have the raw material on which to base proper decisions by government. We recognise that it creates dimculsmall ties for small businessmen to give this informafor tion but it must be done, and it is the job Government senators, just as it is my job- I prepared to do it-to go out and explain to small businessmen why they are put to this inconpohcies venience; not to obtain cheap pubhcity by issuing a Press release, as Senator Messner did, relating to some survey that he had carried out of businessmen, and how upset they were by havnot ing to give this information. My fourth question is: Why did the Treasurer not mention that the most significant action taken by Government to aid small business was the establishment by the Austrahan Labor Party Government of a national small The Fraser Government has downgraded it by substituting afinanceand small business branch of the Tertiary Industry Division of the Departreturn ment of Industiy and Commerce. Here we come to the crux of the matter. The Labor Government followed what had happened in the United this States of America where for some years they to have had a small business administration departa ment, and it set up one here because it recognised the great value of small business to our comthe munity. But what this Government has done has been to downgrade that national bureau and it has then gone to the States and said: 'Will you up something?' It has not given any extra funds to the States to do so. This apparently is evidence of the cynical attitude of not wanting the national Government involved in these great national issues but throwing off responsibility to someone else, giving the functions to the States without any extra specific funds for the States to carry those functions. No wonder we beheve that the making of this statement this afternoon is a cyniis cal exercise. I have another question: What extra funds the Federal Government making available to the States to enable the States to cany out the extra functions relating to small businesses? The Fraser Government has been pleased to hand out these extra functions. Now I want to know from the Government what specific extra funds are being given for this purpose. The amount money being given to the States at the present than that. time is built on the existing functions which the States are given to do, not on any new functions. The amount of money being given is only an upgrading in monetary terms of what the States this information are bound to carry out. The answers to those questions which I have raised-I could have thought of a lot more-wil l point up our reasons for being cynical about this businessfinancestatement and our reasons dubbing it a window dressing exercise. Small of business has been shockingly hurt by the stagam nation policies of the present Federal Government. If we want to learn about those stagnation all we need to do is to go back and read the speech of one of the Government's own former back benchers, the honourable member small for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth)-peopl e need take it from members of the Opposition-and read the reasons he has given to throw off the yoke of the Liberal Party and to follow proper and adequate economic pohcies for this countiy. Bankruptcies are climbing at an alarming rate at the present time. Until we adopt Labor's expansionary economic pohcies there will be Uttle joy business bureau. for smaU business. I said that having made a summary I would to some of the points that I made. We of the Opposition agree that small businesses have a very important role to play in our society. In mixed economy of ours where it is important have a private sector as well as a pubhc sector, very important part of the private sector is smaU business. It provides the innovations and changes which are a very important part of our economic system. We believe such activity in the private sector, and particularly in the small fixbusiness sector, is important to provide the necessary stimulus to our economy. Another point I want to make is to chaUenge the so-called claims by this Government that some of its poUcies have helped small business. Are there many reaUy small businesses that believe that the 40 per cent investment aUowance helps them and out not big business? I am clearly on record as not supporting the investment allowance at aU, but it a sheer misleading of this Parhament to suggest that such a policy would help smaU business vis-a-vis big business. I do not believe in the uivestment-Ted recovery. I think that what big is business and small business want more than anything else is customers, and that is what wtii lead to investment. That is why we on this side of the House support an expansionary economic pohcy, a poUcy of expansion with care to ensure that we do not ricochet back into inflation. We are supporting that expansionary pohcy. There is no of pokey which would help smaU business more The 40 per cent investment allowances are not favouring smaU businesses. Does any objective person suggest that the stock valuation allowance helps small business vis-a-vis other business? Small business does not have the finance now to hold large stocks, and the stock valuation allowance helps mainly those who have stocks. Relatively few small businesses can take advantage of that. What small business does know is that the Fraser Government has put up company tax rates from 42.5 per cent to 46 per cent. That is what is hitting them. That is what is hitting their finances and that is what they will remember at the next election, and not window dressing statements such as this one. However, I support the raising of the division 7 allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, which this Government has done. I believe that that has mainly helped small businesses and that it was necessary in a tight monetary time. Let me come back to the cheek, as I call it, in the statement where it is suggested that discussions with the States had led the State governments to set up small business administrations in order to help the small businessman. They have done nothing of the sort. The South Austrahan Labor Government started its schemes for small businessmen long before this Government decided that it would downgrade its own national small business bureau and once again throw responsibihty on to the States for something that should have been a national responsibihty. The South Austrahan Labor Government has taken up the cudgels and will do so but only because once again the Fraser Government has shirked its responsibihty and is not doing in the national sphere what it ought to have been doing. The rest of the statement was pretty well padding. To provide the requisite number of words in the statement the Treasurer has pubhshed a well known list of the publications which the bureau had put out. I want to make the point that those pubhcations are the result of the Labor Government's pohcies. Those publications are the result of the setting up of the national small business bureau, which got on with the job of providing information for small business. I agree with the thesis that what small business wants more than anything else is information and help with management. I point out that what Government can do more than anything else is to provide just that. That is what the Labor Government started to do. I speak with far more knowledge and experience of this subject than any honourable members on the Government benches who have been catcalling here. Through the Workers Education Association in South Austraha I ran a small business training course for about 10 years before coming into this place. That course was in planning and running a small business. I was discussing the problems of small business, and doing something about them, for many years before some of the catcallers on the Government benches opposite climbed on the bandwagon for political reasons and sought to provide some help for small business. I return to the main point: What small business wants more than anything else is an expanding economy; but what it is getting, and what the rest of this nation is getting, at the moment is a contracting economy due to the false philosophies of the Fraser Government. It is getting a Budget which is doing nothing more than taking activity out of the community and creating more unemployment. The result of this in South Austraha alone is a growing number of bankruptcies in small business. Whereas last year there were about 300 bankruptcies, this year, from what I can find out from the profession, there will be more than 500 bankruptcies in South Australia alone. That is an alarming increase, and it is due to the wrong economic pohcies of this Government.",57
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
120,Mr ALDRED,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE," I wish to make it quite clear at the outset, on behalf of the Government Members Small Business Committee, and I think on behalf of nearly all members of the Government parties, that we welcome the statement made today because undoubtedly it is the most definitive statement made on small business in the history of this Federation. It very clearly illustrates the importance that this Liberal-National Country Party Government attaches to the small business sector. I might add that it is also a triumph for the Small Business Committee and all the others who have worked tirelessly for the cause of small business over the past few years. As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) clearly indicated in his statement, this sector of our economy is a fundamental and very important one. It covers no fewer than about two rnilhon people, or approximately one-third of the work force of this nation. Quite apart from its economic importance-it is obviously important as far as employment is concerned-ther e is a very significant social importance attaching to the small business sector. It is that social importance which actually gives the he to the hypocritical nonsense we have heard from the Opposition in the last 15 minutes. If what has happened in the United Kingdom in recent years is any mdication, it is quite clear that the Labor Party and sociaUst parties generaUy throughout the Western world-d o not give a damn about smaU business. In fact, the long term intention of the sociahst parties is eventually to drive it to the waU and put it out of action, for very good reasons related to their long term objective of the socialisation of society. What we have seen hi the United Kingdom since the end of the Second World War is an increasing concentration of power in the hands of larger economic enterprises, including nationalised enterprises. They have been nationalised through the back door as well as through the front door. Those larger economic enterprises have found themselves to be much more vulnerable to control both by the central government and by British trade unions. Paul Johnson, previously editor of the British Labour weekly, the New Statesman, laid out very clearly his own dissatisfaction with the British Labour Party for these reasons and also indicated quite clearly the ultimate intention of the British Labour Party in regard to small business. I want to quote from an article which he wrote recently and which appeared in the New Statesman. It was reprinted in the Bulletin. This article indicated very clearly why he left the Labour Party and what these ultimate intentions are. He wrote: . . . it is the essence of corporation that the units must be large. And it is of the essence of modern union bureaucracy that workers are easier to control in big factories, the organised militant clique and union bosses are united in their up-ending of Labour's old posture. Both loathe the small business penalise them viciously; both exhibit a positive hatred self-employed, who cannot be unionised or corporatised at all. This is where the Labour Party is heading. It has already embraced corporatism, which ulumately must mean the end of Parliamentary democracy . . . That is the attitude of the Labor Party to small business. That is the real attitude of the Labor Party, not the hypocritical attitude which the Opposition has been laying out for the last IS minutes. It shows quite clearly where the Opposition stands so far as small business is concerned. The main thrust of the statement put down today by the Treasurer in this House, and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton) in the other place, relates to the problem of small businessfinance.It has become quite clear to this Government, particularly through the work of the Small Business Committee, that this is one of the major problems that small business has been facing over the last few years-ac cess tofinancefor both development capital purposes and working capital purposes. This was summed up very clearly in a paper that the SmaU Business Committee prepared earUer this year. I quote this extract from that paper It should berecognisedthat the basic difficulty with small business being able to find adequate finance stems from its inability to conserve capital from earnings. This is caused by the impart of increasing taxadon, lower profits resulting from rapid cost escalation and the problems of financing stock levels and new equipment purchases from inflation retained earnings. Its problem is therefore chiefly in finding long term funds from either loans or equity capital for long term purposes. Because ofitsrelativelack of access to money markets compared with larger businesses, small business is very largely restricted to overdraft or other high cost finance company money. That is the essence of thefinanceproblem that smaU business has faced in recent years. It was for that very reason that the task force was set up by this Government, back in May, to look at this problem. The statement issued today by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Industiy and Commerce is the result of the work of that task force. I commend the excellent work that it did in putting its report together and coming up with the conclusions which it reached and which have now, as we have seen today, been courageously adopted by the Government. The main thrust of the work of the task force, in terms of the things that have been adopted today, can be seen m a number of intitiatives. where Firstly, and most importantly, the charter of the rules all. So Labour Ministers Commonwealth Development Bank, is widened so that it is in a position to make credit avaUable and the litde workshop and to all forms of business, not just to the rural secfor the tor or the industrial sector. The Commonwealth Development Bank will be able to provide equityfinanceto small business. The Small Business Committee regards this as a very valuable and imaginative reform because the Commonwealth Development Bank is in an excellent position to carry out this form of service. I say that for two reasons: Firstly, the Commonwealth Development Bank already has a network of branches and agencies by means of which this new service can be deUvered to the small business sector. Secondly, and related to that, the Commonwealth Development Bank has an excellent record of experience in dealing with this sort of problem in the related areas of rural finance and, more latterly, industrial finance. There is no doubt that the exceUent experience that the Commonwealth Development Bank has gained in those areas will now be used in a more general sense in the field of small business. Another major initiative that today's stateThat ment brings down is that there will be a facility, through the Austrahan Industry Development Corporation, for joint venture arrangements be set up between the AIDC and other appropriare ate bodies. We have in mind various State small business agencies which have been set up in recent years, including the lent one in Victoria that is run by Mr Eugene Falk-the Victorian Small Business Developto ment Corporation. It has established for itself excellent reputation in the very short time that has been going. There are various private bodies with which this jointfinancearrangement will able to operate. The third initiative the statement indicates-it is just as important as the other matters I have mentioned-is that advice is been given to the Reserve Bank that adequate finance is to be made available to small business through the banking system and that no arbiadvising trary limits are to be placed on thatfinance.I have no doubt that these three major initiativesthe widening of the charter of the Commonnumber wealth Development Bank, the new joint venare ture anangements and the advice now given the Reserve Bank not to impose arbitrary limitscan will be welcomed by small business and by small business associations throughout Australia. It is interesting to note that today's statement shows quite clearly that this Government been consistent in the way it has abided by the promises it made during the federal election campaign of November and December Dunng that campaign the coalition parties brought down afive-pointprogram. I shall go through those points to refresh the memory honourable members opposite who seem to have forgotten what was in the program and the One extent to which we have abided by it. The point was the bringing down of a 40 per cent investment allowance. That has been done. The second point in that program was the bringing inwas of trading stock valuation adjustment. As we know, that has been of tremendous benefit, parincreasing ticularly to those holding large stocks such as small retailers. That has been done. The third point related to a number of taxation reforms including the increase in the retention allowance under division 7. That has been carried out. has been welcomed by small businessmen. I also bring to the attention of the House fact that the personal tax indexation and also more recently the standard rate taxation which were brought down are aimed at the communityrectly at large but they also specificaUy benefit small business. They are of help to the small businesson men who are not incorporated as companies. is something that always has to be remembered when we are talking about the vast majority of very small businessmen, particularly to those in the retaUing and wholesaling areas who usually sole traders or partnerships. They are bodies such as the not compames. excelOur general taxation reformsflowthrough to small businessmen as much as theyflowthrough the community at large. That seems to have an been conveniently forgotten by the honourable it gentlemen sitting opposite. The fourth point of ourfive-pointprogram related to the problem of be access tofinancefor smaU business. That is what today's statement is aU about. It provides for the two carrying out of that fourth point of our program. now Thefifthand remaining point was to do what we could to improve the counselling and education services avaUable to assist small businessmen by them of management techniques. That is well in hand through the publications which have been made available and through a of other matters in that area which we considering at the moment. On the basis of to thatfive-pointprogram honourable members see that four points have already been carried out. The fourth point is being implemented today. Matters relating to thefifthpoint are still under consideration. That is not a bad record. In a matter of only two years we have virtually has completed the entire program. That was the promise which we made to small business during the November-December campaign which led 1975. up to the last general election. The Opposition in commenting on this state of ment made a number of statements, some of which, to say the least, were quite extraordinary. of those statements referred to my colleague first Senator Messner and concerned the burden which government surveys and data collection placed on smaU business. What Senator Messner saying is quite true. In fact, one of the major problems which small business faces today is the administrative burden which government is imposing on it, often by default and often in an unthinking manner, because small business is increasingly being used as an unpaid agency to collect data. When the honourable gentlemen It sitting opposite were in government they did more to increase the general administrative burden through various regulatory agencies on the smaU business than did any other government in the history of federation. What this statement set out quite clearly is not what was suggested incorby honourable members on the other side, an attempt to increase the administrative burden small business, but an attempt to decrease it by rationalising and co-ordinating the way in which data is coUected from business, including smaU business. At the moment there is a great amount of overlapping and duplication between government agencies which are responsible for coUecting data from small business. The second, almost hUarious, point made by very few. the Opposidon in relation to today's statement was about the National SmaU Business Bureau. Of course, we know the Opposition has an attireceive tude to these things. Its general attitude is: stands stUl tax it; if it moves, set up a department to run it. The reaction of the Opposition to any problem which it faced whUe in government was always to try to overcome that problem by setviding ting up a network of administrative agencies. They thought that simply by providing more pubhc servants, more structure, more paper all the rest of it they would overcome the probof lems. That was true whether it was Aboriginal affairs, social security, smaU business or whatpointed ever. But that is not the way out of the situation. The way out, m fact, is to get the Government the backs of small business, to take ation burden and to take off the admimstrative burden. Certainly we need a minimum adminis Mr trative component to run certain things, to research, to put out pubhcations and so more pubhc servants and more agencies is not the way to resolve the problem of small business. Canberra. SmaU businessmen, in their dealing with this Government through the Small Business Commore than you. mittee, have made that abundantly clear over last couple of years. They are not looking for handouts. They are not looking for feather ding. They are not looking for more government departments. They are looking for relief from various burdens which have been imposed on absolutely them through taxation and through government administration over recent years. In conclusion say that I welcome this statement. I am sure will be welcomed throughout the nation. This is one of the most valuable initiatives taken government in relation to small business. In fact, it is the only clear statement any government ever made about smaU business in the history this nation.",59
121,Mr COHEN,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE,"It must be something perfectly obvious to any businessman who has are perpetuating been Ustening to the previous speaker, the hopes and then dashing honourable member for Henty (Mr Aldred), that ing eventuates. he has never had any experience in business at aU. In fact, he is a defrocked pubhc servant has managed to find his way into this place. suggest that after he loses his seat at the election he might try his hand at business instead of getting onto the taxpayers' backs as he did for many years. Of the 350,000 businesses mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), how many will be assisted by extending the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank or by widening the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation? I venture to suggest I venture to suggest further that those who will assistance are those businesses which are If it well estabUshed, soundly financed and which probably get aaequatefinancefrom existing sources. In other words, while I welcome any assistance of this nature, with the Government proloans and equity to small business, as an excellent sociaUst measure, I suggest that the vast bulk of the 350,000 smaU businesses in Australia and will miss out completely. The smaU businessmen Australia are sick and tired of the performance of this Government. They are bitterly disapby the free enterprise slogans of the Liberal and Country parties which have provided off them with nothing for the return they traditionoff the taxally give at election time. Mr Haslem-Do they prefer yours? COHEN- I mentioned a defrocked pubhc do servant. At least he is not a snooty-nosed exon. But lawyer like the honourable member for Mr Haslem- I am a defrocked public servant too. I have been on both sides and I know a lot the Mr COHEN-The Government has provided small businessmen with nothing for the return bedwhich they gave at election time. The honourable member for Henty will be the second one the out but the honourable member for Canberra is certain to lose his seat at the next election. I do not know why he bothers to try. There I are very few who do not reahse how dishonest it were the vague promises made during the 1975 election campaign, that the return of a Liberalby any National Countiy Party Government would ensure a return to the halcyon days of 1971 and has 1973. Thetimehas come for politicians to stop of deliberately misleading the hundreds of thousands of people involved in smaU business by giving the impression that they intend to do specific for them. At the moment they a cruel hoax by raising the those hopes when nothwho There are things that can be done and things I that cannot and should not be done for small next business. The Government should come clean and spell out its philosophy and then show, by action, its policy program so that small business will know what to expect from the Government. We do not want these pie in the sky promises which we received today and which we have been receiving from this Government for the last two years. There are many problems associated with providing assistance to small business. These need to be understood by everyone in Parknows hament and in the business community. The firstwhy problem is in defining exactly what we mean by 'small business'. Do we mean to assess the size a business by the number of employees or the size of its turnover or profit? It can vary one man operation to a factory employing more people. Any definition of'small' will be subjective one. So definitions will and do vary enormously. Secondly, should a business be assisted simply because it is small? It might be small and highly profitable. Should we then assist only those businesses which are losing money? They might be losing money because they are grossly, or even marginally, inefficient or simply because the product they are producing is no longer in mand or because they cannot compete seas products for any one of a hundred reasons. The assumption that all businesses are well run rubbish, although very few businessmen would know this or admit it to themselves, let alone anybody else. We have to face the fact that there is as much variation in the quality of businessvariety men and their businesses as there is in the quality of people. Many people who go into business or take over the family business simply are not suited educationally, psychologically, intellectually emotionally, to be in business. They should have gone into business in thefirstplace. In my 20 years in business I have struck many people who are excellent workers-goo d people-bu they would have been far better off working for someone else. Are we to use taxpayers' money to prop up people who ought to get out of business? Are we to penalise the talented businessmen is doing well by subsiding the inefficient businessman who cannot make a profit and who, if the free enterprise system is to work as its tagonists argue, ought to go under and make for the more efficient? The whole essence of the market economy that the strong will survive and the weak will under so that what emerges are strong viable enterprises which provide the market with what it demands at the lowest possible price. If Government beheves in free enterprise as expounded by Adam Smith, Milton Friedman and John Singleton, why does it not say so stop pulling the small businessman's leg? Is it because the Government's economic advisers know that in order for the free market economy to function efficiently a substantial number of small businesses must go under, but to say so would be pohtical suicide? The Government that this is so and we know that it is so; does the Government not admit that it is so? of The statistics on small business are very vague, but I accept the figures that there are between from a 250,000 and 350,000 small businesses in 100 or Australia employing about two million a people-4 2 per cent of the work force. We can describe as small businesses 97 per cent of all manufacturers and 99 per cent of all retailers. It would be impossible to Ust in a speech the thousands of different types of businesses that are covered by these statistics. Some very positive contributions are made by small business, not the least of which is that almost 100 per cent of them are Austrahan owned. They also make an important contribution to innovations in products, detechniques and services, and as such are a breedwith overing ground for new industries. is If there is competitiveness in business it is mainly in the small business sector where they to serve as a check on monopoly profits and monopoly inefficiency. SmaUfirmscontribute to a of products and services offered because they are able to exist in a Umited or speciaUsed market which a largefirmwould notfindworthwhUe or economic. They are important also as specialist suppliers of parts, sub-assembUes and components for large compames as well as proor viding a productive oudet for enterprising people never who prefer to be self employed. One can start to understand the problem of t governments helping small business. The emphasis is on 'small' because that is what the debate is about, or at least that is what many small businessmen believe it to be about. It is certainly who what Liberal and National Country Party members have encouraged them to beheve. Of course, business-big , medium and smaU-mus t pick up proif the economy begins to revive. That is primarily way where the Government has faded. Governments can introduce and have introduced measures to help business, such as the 40 per cent investment is aUowance and the recommendations of the go Mathews Committee of Inquiiy into Inflation and Taxation regarding stock valuation adjustment. But these measures apply to all business the and not just to smaU business. It is doubtful whether the investment aUowance was of any value to anyone. In fact, it might well have and harmed the employment opportunities for many people because under the scheme businesses purWhy chased equipment that was labour saving. One can assist particular industries, the jority of which may be small. For example, one may decide that the nation is best served if a ticular industry is protected by tariffs or subsidies or given export incentives simply because it the national interest to do so. Quite clearly cannot be done for everyone because of the cost to the taxpayer and to the consumer, who will pay for it through higher taxes or higher prices. Besides, these forms of assistance would apply only to manufacturing and rural industries; they would have little relevance to the retailing vice sector. In fact, the previously mentioned measures which might help one small business might well hurt another small business. This constantly forgotten by so called spokesmen small business who are really arguing for a section of small business-for the industry in which they are personally involved. They equate their Victoriapersonal mterest with the national interest. An increase in tariffs might delight a manufaclisten turer, make hfe difficult for a retailer and send importer to the wall, while sending up the costs of other manufacturers and of the rural sector. will go along with some industries being given assistance if it can be proved that a particular industry is vital to Australia's future developstudies ment, defence needs, large scale employment and a host of other factors, but already there adequate machinery to argue their case to Industries Assistance Commission. The Governpeople ment can provide assistance, if it wishes, even the IAC does not recommend aid. So the avenue for assistance is there for specific industries. I think the most important thing we must this Parhament is to understand why so many small businesses fail. Perhaps then we will be able to provide some sensible suggestions how they can be helped without raising their hopes with political rhetoric such as we have heard here today. Before we go into these failwho ures, let me point out that even in very tough times many businesses do very well. In fact, very good ones often do even better during a cession than they do during booms. Conscious that things are tough they become more efficient. They are more careful in watching their oversystem heads, scrutinising every expenditure; they for new markets; they introduce new technology; they take advantage of their opponents' mistakes and troubles-crue l but in the best traditions free enterprise. Finally, when the recession over, they come back stronger than ever. do businesses fail? Sometimes it is for the very obvious reason that businessmen make bad decisions-they make mistakes. The vast mamajority of them start off in business without any training in running a business. They may have parworked for someone else in that particular field, but few have had any formal training to enable is in them to cope with making the decisions which this mark the diiference between working in an industry and actually running a business in that industry. Most of them have no training in keeping a set of books. Few understand stock control, merchandising, store layout, advertising and promotion. The Minister at the table, the Minisor serter for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), is one of the few Liberals who is genuinely a businessman. I beheve he is a very is good businessman. Most people who go into for business lack the funds to employMr Ruddock-What about the strikes in",62
122,Mr COHEN,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE,"The honourable member who interjects has never been in business. If he would he might learn something. He knows nothan ing about business. Here is his chance to learn so that when we loses his seat he will have someI thing to do. Most people who go into business lack the funds to employ someone who has the professional expertise to cany out feasibUity or market research, and the decisions they make are often based upon gut feelings is rather than upon any sound business judgment. the Amongst the many hundreds of thousands of who go into business on this basis there is if a percentage who have what can be described as a 'feel' or an 'intuition'-the y are naturals. They can see a business opportunity. They can assess the market, the likely demand, overheads, profits do in and return on their investment. They have sufficient skUls, energy,financeand drive to succeed, and they do succeed. They will succeed iras to respective of government assistance. How can we possibly legislate to assist people make bad decisions? Businessmen and business women make incorrect judgments about the location, about market demand or about the requantity of goods to manufacture or to purchase. There is no way in the world in which we can stop people from making these errors under a which permits people to open up business look whenever and wherever they like. In my view there are far too many small businesses in Australia competing for a very Umited market. of However, it is impossible in a democracy to resis trict people who want to chance their hands in business and that is the way it should be. If we really want to assist small business the greatest room for improvement is in the area of training. That is the area in which Austraha is grossly deficient. If a person wants to enter a trade or a profession a wide variety of courses is available to him through the universities, colleges of advanced education and colleges of technical and further education, but if someone wants to go into business the only way in which most people can gain experience is through trial and error. Small business courses do exist but they are minimal and are not given any status, nor is there widespread knowledge about their availabihty. How many hundreds of thousands of young people who leave school and who do not go into a trade or profession but who finish up in the retail trade receive any adequate training? Of course, you could not start training young people who are just out of school to run a business. It would probably be years before they had the practical experience andfinanceto be able to attempt a venture on their own. However, there is no reason a young person who is waiting to go into retailing could not go to college for a couple of years to learn the hundred and one skills required to fit him to be a businessman-sales manship, marketing, merchandising, display, stock control and so on. As he gained experience, further management courses would be made available until he had the experience and knowledge to attempt to run his own business. In many of the countries where governments provide financial aid to small business, one of requirements to quahfy for assistance is that the businessman must show that he has had adequate training in hisfieldof business. In other countries a person has to have qualifications just to be allowed to go into business. I do not believe that sort of measure would be acceptable to Austrahans. The principal way in which this Government can get small business moving is to get economy as a whole going-in other words, to do the opposite to what it has been doing. If the economy is reflated the good small businesses will survive, and that is what we hope will happen in the future.",64
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE,"Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL 1977 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, and read afirstume. Second Reading",65
124,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. This Bill, to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, is designed to complete the establishment of the Austrahan Broadcasting Tribunal and to transfer present Ministerial powers in the broadcasting and television licensing area to the Tribunal. It gives effect to the Government's decision to estabhsh a special broadcasting service. The Bill also updates a number of other provisions to accord with government decisions and policies arising from the restructuring of the Austrahan broadcasting system. The restructuring of the broadcasting system has resulted from a desire to remedy a number of major deficiencies. The Government was concerned at the lack of clarity of the functions and responsibilities of government organisations with an involvement in broadcasting. We were also concerned about the lack of an overall strategic broadcasting policy. This resulted in ad hoc planning and sporadic development. There were obvious weaknesses in co-ordination and liaison between government and non-government broadcasting the organisations. We wanted to correct this situation and to provide for industry and public involvement in broadcasting administration, particularly in the licensing area. It was considered desirable to provide appropriate machinery which would ensure adequate accountability by licencees for station performance. In addition, the Government was aware of the need to remedy the inefficient use of government engineering resources, and the general inabihty of the administrative structure to respond to technological developments. As a result of these substantial deficiencies the Government decided in April 1976 to hold an inquiry into the Austrahan broadcasting system. Such an inquiry was long overdue. The inquiry was conducted and its reportreferred to as the Green report-wa s tabled in both Houses of the Parliament on 9 November 1976. After studying the report, the Government decided upon a number of major changes to the administrative structure of the Australian broadcasting system. As a preliminary to complete implementation of the Government's decisions on the restructuring of the broadcasting system, the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act (No. 2) 1976 was passed by the Parhament. This Act disbanded the Austrahan Broadcasting Control Board and estabhshed the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It transferred to the Tribunal the Ucensing and regulatory powers of the Austrahan Broadcasting Control Board. It also provided for the planning and technical aspects of broadcasting to be a responsibihty of the Postal and Telecommunications Departindustry ment. In implementing these changes and in proible, posing the changes contained in this Bill, the have be Government has been motivated by a number of erative important principles which it beheves should form the basis of the further development of Australian broadcasting system. Firstly, we beimportant lieve that the broadcasting frequency spectrum is a valuable pubhc resource. It must be a responsiThe bUity of government to plan the allocation broadcasting frequencies and, through the establishment of appropriate bodies, to provide an administrative structure for the Ucensing and overall operation of radio and television broadcasting stations. Still further, the Government responsibUity to determine the components of the system, that is, the types of by the sectors which should constitute the system, and the role of those components. We have sought to come to grips with the role of the pubUc broadcasting sector and its relationship with the national and commercial sectors. This contrasts with the casual, incompetent manner in which the previous Government responded to the demand for pubhc broadcasting, particularly in doubtful method of Ucensing such stations the Wireless Telegraphy Act. At the same time as Minister; we see the need for government responsibUity in these areas, it is our view that responsibUity for the licensing and regulatory functions in the broadcasting area should rest with autonomous statutory authorities, rather than with the Government itself. The principle of a broadcasting system not subject to pohtical interference is one of aims of the changes proposed in this Bill. The major element of the changes aimed at ticising the broadcasting system is the transfer of the Ucensing power from the Minister to the Austrahan Broadcasting Tribunal. The broadcasting industry has sought this change for many years and it is considered to be an important factor achieving more effective broadcasting adrninistration. In addition, we believe it highly desirable that there should be a significant degree of pubhc and industry involvement in the development of broadcasting. This medium plays a very important role in the life of most people. Accordingly, the planning and administration of broadcasting should be designed in a manner which will enable it to be responsive to the needs of the community. The Government has not been reluctant to institute procedures to enable the fullest public and involvement. The activities of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will, as far as possconducted in pubUc and the public will substantial access to the inquiry and delibactivities of the Tribunal. The principle of accountabUity by broadcasters within the broadthe casting system has also been considered as an element. Government has taken decisions to ensure of that broadcasters, making use of a scarce national resource such as frequencies, are accountable for their activities. The Tribunal must be able to justify publicly its deliberative and decision-making activities and in a simUar manner, broadcasters will be made to account, at renewal hearings, and in public, for their probeheves it has a gramming performances. The Broadcasting and Television Amendment services provided Bill 1977 provides for The transfer of the present ministerial powers relating to the licensing of stations; The full estabUshment of the powers and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; The transfer of the broadcasting planning its responsibUity from the Secretary of the Postal under and Telecommunications Department to the Introduction of public inquiries into licence renewals; Establishment and constitution of the special broadcasting service; and A number of minor and consequential amendments reflecting the above changes and the basic updating or modifying the Act where necessary. depoliThe Bill empowers the Tribunal to: Grant, renew, suspend and revoke Ucences; Authorise transactions relating to the transfer of Ucences or the admission of other perin sons to participate in the benefits of a hcence; Approve changes relating to the ownership and control of Ucences; Set and vary conditions of Ucences; and CoUect information pursuant to its functions; and Set and administer broadcasting standards. The Tribunal wiU have quasi-judicial powers. In performing its functions, the Tribunal will be required to hold inquiries where it is desirable do so. The Bill provides that the Tribunal hold such inquiries in pubUc and that it consider aU submissions made to it as part of the inquiry process. It is also required to pubhsh reports on its inquiries, detaUing its deuberations and the reasons for its decisions and recommendations. The Tribunal may take evidence in private where it considers it desirable to do so by reason of the confidential nature of the material. It may restrict the pubUcation of such material from its reports. The members and staff of the Tribunal will be bound by the rules of secrecy as they apply, for example, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and other Commonwealth bodies of simUar status. The Bill provides detaUed administrative procedures to be observed by the Tribunal in exercising its powers. In general, these procedures allow for a high degree of pubhc and industry involvement in the Tribunal's decision-making processes. Regarding its responsibUity for the setting and administration of standards, the Tribunal, at my direction, recendy completed a report on broadcasting standards and the concept of self-regulation. The Government has not yet considered this report. Until we have decided on the final role of the Tribunal in this area, the Tribunal has been asked to maintain the standards administered by the former Control Board. The Government has decided, as part of the move to ensure adequate accountabUity in the administration of the broadcasting system, to extend the present appeals procedures. There must be redress for broadcasters who feel they have been unfairly treated by the Tribunal. The Bill accordingly provides for appeals by licensees to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against many decisions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Under the revised administrative structure provided by this Bill, the Mmister administering the Broadcasting and Television Act now will be responsible for planning the provision of broadcasting services. We believe that planning the physical development of the broadcasting system is properly a matter for government. It is closely related to its overaU communications policy, and to its responsibUity for the management of the frequency spectrum. The Minister will initiate the calhng of licence applications as part of the planning process and then refer the applications received to the Tribunal for determination. In inviting appUcations, the Minister will provide specifications for the particular licence. These will indicate the nature of the service to be provided, the area to be served, the purpose of to the Ucence, and other technical matters. These specifications will become, upon grant of the licence, conditions of the Ucence, in addition to the conditions set by the Tribunal pursuant to its powers. I turn now to those types of broadcasting services described as 'special purpose'. The Government has been conscious of a need for the Australian broadcasting system to provide basic broadcasting services to the whole community and not just to parts of the community. Over one-quarter of the people in Australia did not have what must be considered a basic broadcasting service, that is, a service in their mother tongue. We inherited from the previous Administration a poorly organised, inadequate multilingual broadcasting service and have sought to respond to a need by Australia's ethnic communities for a more comprehensive broadcasting service. The Government decided to establish a permanent framework, not only for ethnic broadcasting services, but also for other types of special broadcasting services which may be considered necessaiy or desirable in the future. This Bill provides for the establishment of the Special Broadcasting Service. It wiU be a statutory authority comprising a part time Chairman and not less than two, nor more than six, parttimemembers. The SBS shaU be empowered to provide multUingual broadcasting services and, if authorised by the regulations, to provide multilingual television services; and to provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed. The SBS shall be administered by an Executive Director, appointed by the Governor General. Initially, it wiU be responsible for ethnic broadcasting and for the operation of radio stations 2EA Sydney and 3EA Melbourne. These are presently being operated by my Department. It is envisaged that the SBS may, at a later stage, assume responsibUity for other special broadcasting and television services in Australia. New services by the SBS, however, may only be undertaken after parliamentary approval is given and the necessary regulations promulgated. The concept behind the SBS is that it will erally provide only those services which would not otherwise be available through the national, commercial or pubhc broadcasting sectors. SBS will be empowered to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by charging for the provision of services and facultions ties and by the sale of programs andrightsor interests in programs. These avenues of funding are in addition to moneys appropriated annually from the Parhament to the SBS. The SBS will not, however, derive revenue by means of norand mal commercial advertising. The Bill also contains a number of amendBill ments to the principal Act. These are either sequential to the above changes, or minor recognise amendments which update and standardise a number of provisions to accord with current legislative practice. There are some amendments which do not alter current pohcy but clarify adjourned. responsibilities or procedures under the Act. In this category are amendments to those relating to the provision of technical services to the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. This Bill provides that these services, mainly relating to national transmitters, will be provided to the ABC by the Minister. They were previously proby Mr Macphee: vided by the Australian Telecommunications Commission. In practice, Telecom will largely continue to provide these services but tract basis. The Bill also amends the charter of the Auswish traUan Broadcasting Commission the performance of its functions, to have regard to the services provided by the Special Broadcasting Service. This amendment is simply Australian intended to avoid duplication of activities by the ceive ABC and the ABS. Further to the beUef basic broadcasting service should be avaUable to all Australians, the Government has taken cisions to ensure that people hi rural and isolated areas have access to as many services The provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act covering television repeater stations are being amended to facilitate the development of television services in remote areas. The also provides for the Ucensing of community teleMacphee). vision aerial systems. They were previously vided under a permit issued by the Minister. This Bill contains a number of transitional visions which serve primarily to enable the tralian Broadcasting Tribunal to phase the introduction of the new system of public and inquiries into the Ucensing process and into the general administration of broadcasting matters. In Une with the Government's desire to estabhsh an administrative structure for broadcasting genwhich is responsive to industry and pubUc needs and which efficiently and fairly operates for the benefit of the whole community, the Govern The ment has undertaken quite extensive consultation in the preparation of this legislation. This consultation has taken the form of representaand submissions from the public and the industry to the Green Inquiiy and consultation in the recent past with representatives of the broadcasting industries. There has also been close consultation with those government departments instrumentalities with an interest in, or with responsibUities in, the broadcasting area. The proposes significant changes in the adrniniscontration of the Australian broadcasting system. I that there is keen interest by the broadcasting industries and the public in these proposals. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) provisions REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 October, on motion That the Bill be now read a second time. on a con Mr MACPHEE (Balaclava-Minister for Productivity)-by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I to make a short clarifying statement. The to require it, in this Bill reading second speech delivered in relation to included the following sentence: Firsdy, the Chief Judges of the Supreme Courts of the Capital Territoiy and the Northern Territory re$2,500 by way of salaiy and $250 by way of annual allowance over and above their remuneradon as members of that a the Federal Court of Australia. deThat statement was incorrect. The figure of $2,500 should read $1,000.1 make that point by as possible. way of clarification.",65
125,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Opposition is not opposing this Bill. We welcome the explanatory statement made Bill just now by the Minister for Productivity (Mr Let me make it clear that there is no proerror in the Bill. There was some mathematical error in the second reading speech. The Bill proadopts the report of the Remuneration Tribunal. AusThe House is aware that the Remuneration Tribunal Act created that Tribunal to inquire into to report to the Parliament on the appropriate remuneration payable to justices and judges of federal courts and of the supreme courts of the territories and other office holders. The report was tabled in both Houses some weeks ago. The Tribunal reported in respect ofjudges, the Chairman of the Prices Justification Tribunal, the President and Deputy Presidents of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the President of the Trade Practices Tribunal, the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Director-General of Secunty, the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission and the Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, with effect from 1 June last. The report sets out the amounts that are to be paid by way of salary and allowances, together with travelling allowances. It is report No. 2 of 1977. The Bill has already been dealt with and passed by the Senate. The amounts set out in the Bill that are to be paid to the people whom I have enumerated are in exactly the same mathematical terms as the amounts in the report. One segment of the Bill may have caused the confusion in the second reading speech. The proposed new section 13, sub-section (4) refers to a judge of the Federal Court of Austraha who also holds the office of Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Austrahan Capital Territory or of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. In those cases an additional salary of $2,500 per annum and an annual allowance at the rate of $250 per annum are paid. The explanation for this can be readily found in that part of the of the Tribunal which deals with the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Austrahan Capital Territory or of a Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The report stated that the rate of salary should be $42,500 but with a footnote that if the Chief Judge of those courts was a judge of the Federal Court an additional amount of money should be payable. The Tribunal calculated it at $1,000 above the amount payable to a Federal judge. I shall give the mathematical basis. A Federal Court judge is to receive $44,000. If he is given an additional $1,000, as recommended, his salary is $45,000. Having got thatfirmlyfixedin our minds we go to sub-section (4) which states that a Federal Court judge is to get $2,500 over and above what a judge of the Supreme Court of the Austrahan Capital Territory or of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory would get. At present those judges get $42,500. If one adds $2,500 to $42,500 one gets $45,000, which is $1,000 above the salary of a Federal Court judge. It seems a very circuitous way of getting at it, but we are there. That is in accordance with the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal. The report further states that an additional allowance of $250 per annum shall be paid. That is spelt out in the new section 13 subsection (4). It is not in the actual Schedule to the Bill. Knowing that the Bill is in complete accord with the report of the Remuneration Tribunal-I refer particularly to the recommendations which apply to the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Teritory or of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory who are getting this additional salary and additional allowances because of their other obligations-the Opposition believes that the Bill is quite satisfactory. The Opposition commends it for approval.",68
126,Mr DONALD CAMERON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It was said to me recently that I should watch myself throughout my hfe to ensure that I never appear before a magistrate or a judge. That was said because of some of the things I have said in this place, particularly in a speech which I made in this House on 10 November 1976 when I listed the judiciary in this country and highlighted the fact that when people contemplated the salaries of poUticians they often refened to the large number of politicians in the various State parliaments and in the Federal Parliament, but they forgot the large number in the judiciary. I presented to the Parhament a table which included the number of State judges, federal judges, commissioners and stipendiary report magistrates. The total was 607. That compared with a national total of 756 parliamentarians. We know of the recent High Court ruling which determined the number of members of this chamber will be reduced after the next election. Unfortunately that is not the case with the nation's judiciary. The 607 have been added to at least by the appointment of another half a dozen Family Court judges. Legislation has already been passed to mcrease that number by another six. This year we have had the appointment of some 21 judges to the Federal Court of Austraha. I see in the chamber the former Attorney General, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr EUicott). I state here and now that I am not denigrating the role that this new and most useful court must play in our community. I am highhghting the fact that when we look at the salary range of judges of the High Court, taking into account the salary of all the judiciary and that there are probably 640 or 650 of them these days compared with the 756 poUticians throughout Austraha, the criticism which is directed at poUticians is a Uttle unfair. It is a Uttle unfair when we take into consideration the large salaries which are paid to the judiciary. For the Ufe of me I cannot understand why the salary of the Chief Judge of the Family Court has been increased so dramatically according to the Schedule to the Bill. The salary is to rise to some $44,000, which is an increase of some $4,500. That Court is a very important social court, but in terms of importance it does not compare with the High Court, the Federal Court of Austraha, the Industrial Court or the Austrahan ConciUation and Arbitration Commission. Yet the Chief Judge of the FamUy Court has a salary which pushes her into a position in which she commands a much higher income than the first lawman in Australia, the nation's Attorney-General. I recall that last year when I put forward this view a debate ensued. I recaU the comments of the then Attorney-General in justification of the increases. He said that many of the people who were working in the field of law were at that stage commanding incomes in the six-figure bracket, and to enuce those people to the Bench required more than just giving them the status of a judge. The former Attorney-General is starting to erupt a Uttle as he did a year before. They need more than just status and security; they need a good salary. I do not argue about that. What I do argue about is, how can this Parliament expect to attract people of the calibre of the former Attorney-General to its ranks when salaries are set at less than half of those the judiciary receives? The salary of a judge of the FamUy Court- I think there are 30 of them as I said before-is way ahead of that of a federal parUamentarian. Probably it is almost the same as that of a Minister of the Crown. No wonder there is some justification for people pointing to the Parliament and saying that it has more than its fair share of mediocrity. Mr Lionel Brown-Whic h side are you looking at?",69
127,Mr DONALD CAMERON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I think both sides of the House suffer from that. A lot of capable people are turned off Parliament because they will not lower their income which, as the former Attorney-General said last year, was in six figures, well over $100,000. They are expected to come to this place for a much lower salary. I do not intend to pursue this aspect at any great length except to give a reference for further reading to people who may be interested in pursuing this matter. On pages 2542 to 2546 of Hansard of 10 November last year a table was incorporated which set out salary levels of commissioners, magistrates and various judges both State and Federal. It showed that these people are very well looked after. I turn to another aspect within the confines of this subject. On 1 August this year I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) following my reading of the report of the Remuneration Tribunal entitled 'Determination of Remuneration Payable to Holders of Offices in the First Division of the Australian PubUc Service and Holders of PubUc Offices'. This is part of the Bill before us today. The determination I refer to was a direct result of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. When I examined the determination I found that there were a number of officers whose salaries had been set on the basis of the salary payable from Ume to time to the holder of a level 5 office hi the Second Division of the Australian Public Service or a level 1, a level 2, a level 3 or whatever-the numerous office bearers who serve this country. I shall quote an extract from the letter I wrote to Senator Withers. I said: I would funher appreciate your advice as to whether or not, where office holders are pegged to various levels of the Second and Third Divisions of the Australian Public Service, this means that in future their increases will be automatic. Regrettably, I did not receive a reply to that letter until 11 October although, on many occasions, I spoke to the Minister's staff asking when I would receive a reply to my letter of 1 August. Finally I received a reply. I believe my letter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department for an opinion and hence the delay. The reply simply said: You also inquired regarding the remuneration of holders of public office which has been determined in terms of the salary payable to specific levels of the Second and Third Divisions of the Australian Public Service. The Tribunal determined the remuneration of such office-holders on this basis in its 1976 review and has done so again in its 1977 review. Unless, therefore, the Tribunal in a future determination otherwise determines, and this determination is not disapproved by either House of the Parliament, the salaries of these public office-holders will be equivalent to the salaries of the relevant levels of the Australian Public Service. I am sorry it took so long to get that reply. Reading into it one sees that the Minister has told me virtually nothing which I did not already recognise. A veryfinepoint has been avoided. The fine point is that it is my view that the Remuneration Tribunal which was set up in 1973 was, in some instances, given the task of making determinations which had to be ratified by this Parliament by virtue of the Parliament exercising its right not to move for a disallowance. After the Parliament commences sitting we have 15 sitting days in which to move for disallowance of even our own salary increases.",70
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Order! I remind the honourable member for Griffith that no matter how interested he is-probabl y most honourable members are-in salaries and emoluments payable to members of Parhament, this Bill does not concern that. This Bill concerns salaries and allowances of judges and persons of judicial status. I suggest that the honourable member comes back to the Bill and tries to Une up the point he is trying to make with the Bill.",71
129,Mr DONALD CAMERON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall do everything I possibly can to abide by your wishes. With a lot of genuine respect, I remind you that the Bill we are discussing is the result of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. Section 6(2) of that Act states: The Tribunal shall, fromrimeto time as provided by this Act, inquire into, and report whether any alterations are desirable in the remuneration payable to Judges out of public moneys of Australia. Section 7 states in part: (5) A determination of the Tribunal shall be in writing . . . (6) The Tribunal shall furnish to the Minister a copy of every determination made by the Tribunal. (7) The Minister shall cause a copy of a determination to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 1S sitting days . . . (8) If either House of the Parliament, within IS sitting days . . . passes a resoluuon disapproving of the determination, thenMr Deputy Speaker, if I continually refer to the Bill before the House I will not be crossing the Unes of demarcation. I appreciate your acknowledgment. The point I was endeavouring to make is that this report is, in my view, outside the law in that in accordance with so many sections of the Act, the Tribunal has set the salary payable ' from time to time' to the holder of a level 2, level 3, level 4, or level 5 office of the Second Division of the Australian Pubhc Service or the Third Division in some cases. The Parliament is given the task of either accepting the determination or moving for a disallowance. It is my contention that if the Tribunal brings in a report such as this and the Parhament allows the 15 days to pass, the effect of that over the months ahead will be that people in these stipulated areas will receive increases which will accrue as a result of the method used for determining salary increases for the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions of the Pubhc Service. The first method, which is the least common, involves salary determinations by the Pubhc Service Board, which makes a decision in relation to what rates should be paid and in what way rates should be varied. It makes regulauons which require Executive Council approval and which, of course, are also subject to disallowance. The most common method of setting rates of pay is through industrial awards determined by the PubUc Service Arbitrator. This means that the next time there is an increase in wages as a result of a national wage case decision, that increase will be automatically passed on to those office holders listed in the Act as being in a category in which their salaries can be increased only as a result of the Tribunal'sfindings.These findings in turn have to be accepted by this Parliament. I believe that the Tribunal headed by Mr Justice W. Campbell, a distinguished law practitioner from Queensland, has made an error. In effect what it has done ensures that the salaries of the office holders mentioned in the Bill will be increased without any reference to this to the Minister on, the question Parliament whatsoever. The Remuneration Tribunal either should be bringing down a new determination after every increase in the national wage to accommodate these office holders or should be deleting the words 'from time to time' from this determination. Some statutory office holders will be receiving four salary increases a year whilst First Division public servants and others whose salaries have been determined at a set rate will receive only one increase. If, for instance, this Parhament decided to reject the determination of the Tribunal following agreement that nobody should get an increase in salary, these First Division public servants, would not receive an increase in salary. However, statutory office holders would continue to receive increases by virtue of a determination which had been accepted in a previous year. I beheve that what is being done by the Tribunal is completely contrary to the spirit of the Act. I believe it is in fact an Ulegal determination. I have grave suspicions as to the reasons why the Attorney-General's Department took so long to advise the Minister for Admimstrative Services. Its advice did not come forward until such time as the 15 days in which notice of motion for disallowance can be lodged had well and truly passed. I give notice now that come next year, if the determination is the same as the determination before us in respect of these office holders, I wiU have no hesitation in moving for the disallowance of the determination. I believe that it is totally Ulegal. I also believe that this matter could be taken up in the High Court. As I said, I believe that the determination is ulegal as it is presently worded and that it completely avoids what was meant by this Parliament when the legislation was introduced, debated and enacted in 1973.",71
130,Mr ELLICOTT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"One has to admire the deftness of the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) who has spoken to us at great length-indee d for some 20 minutes-about something that has nothing to do with the measure before the House. He did it with the deftness of an equity lawyer and he ended up attacking the validity of something that is not before the House. I do not think he is challenging the particular determination the subject of the legislation before the House because under the Constitution that can be fixed only by the Parliament-that is, the salaries of judges. Insofar as the honourable member attempted to relate the argument to Public Service salaries, it is perhaps significant to point out that this is probably thefirsttime that the salaries of Federal Court judges have been in a sense detached from Public Service salaries. In the past there was a tendency to fix the salaries of Federal Court judges at the same level as salaries for permanent heads in the Public Service. I think that was something that was quite unnecessary and quite unjustified. I can understand public servants wanting to retain that relativity but at the same time in order to do justice to the judges of this country it was necessary to break that nexus, and the nexus has been well and truly broken in the last 12 to 18 months and particularly in relation to the setting up of the Federal Court. Quite obviously in order to attract men of the calibre of Sir Nigel Bowen, and others who have joined the court, it was necessary to offer salaries at the level that isfixedin this Bill. For instance, at the time ofhis appointment he was a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales he was receiving a higher salary than in fact he received when he became a justice of the Federal Court. This also raises something else that I wanted quickly to raise. I think the nonourabie member for Griffith will agree with me on this point. It is time there was a rationalisation of judicial salaries at all levels around this country. I do not have the precisefiguresin front of me, but the fact is that the Chief Justice of Queensland still receives more than the Chief Justice of the High Court of Austraha. I think he receives a salary in the $60,000 bracket. That is a very high salary having regard to the fact that the Chief Justice of the High Court is now receiving something in the $55,000 bracket. One has only to compare those twofiguresto reahse that the whole thing has got out of kilter. May I say that this matter was raised at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General last year in the hope that they would see the sense of my argument. They were not willing to sit down and work out a system, but the judicial salaries in this country have become so out of kilter that I suggest to the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that the time has come to attempt again some form of rationalisation ofjudicial salaries. Let me give the House another example. A magistrate in New South Wales, from recollection, gets as much as a Family Court judge does under this Bill-somethin g in the vicinity of $36,000 a year. The judges of the Family Court of Austraha, whether they are judges or senior judges, work very hard. There is no doubt about that. I have little doubt that they apply themselves extremely conscientiously from the beginning of their day to well beyond thetimewhen people ordinarily knock off. The fact is that the work load in the Family Court is being kept down to a reasonable level because the judges are working at a very fast pace. There is no doubt that they ought to be paid a salary, which, having regard to their training and background, is above the salary of a magistrate. I mention this only because I wish to make the point that I have made before, that it is time relativity was established between the salaries of the judges of the various courts-the supreme courts, the High Court and the Federal Court in this country. The honourable member for Griffith also mentioned the Chief Judge of the Family Court. I think there is a need to understand that the Chief Judge of the Family Court will soon be overseeing the largest court in this country. She has a tremendous burden of judicial responsibihty. Under this measure she receives the equivalent of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. I suggest to the honourable member that that is not an extravagant sum for her to be paid. The Family Court shortly, when those six judges are appointed, will be. the largest single court in Austraha-no t concentrated in one place but spread overfiveStates; requiring appellate work as well as original jurisdiction work; but, more than that, requiring the administration not only of judges but also of counsellors, registrars and other people connected with the Family Court. I commend this measure to the House.",72
131,Mr MACPHEE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"in reply- I thank the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) who is the architect of this Bill, for having clarified for the benefit of the House some of the points raised by the honourable member for Gnffith (Mr Donald Cameron). I congratulate the former Attorney-General ou drawing together in this legislation some of the many loose ends which were associated with the payment of people of judicial office. At the same time. I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) for his willingness to grapple with the complexities of this legislation and for the constructive comments he made in the debate. I say that because the honourable member for Griffith made a number of comments arising out of his frustration in not getting his letters answered by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers). Although one may have sympathy for him in not getting his letters answered, the fact is that the answer he received was at least on the subject matter of the inquiiy-and the subject matter of the inquiry was not the subject matter of this Bill. I make no comment on the nature of the answer he received. He will have to take that up with the Minister for Administrative Services. I should at least comment on some of the other points he made. Firstly, comment was made about the growth in the number of Federal judges. In respect of the judges of the Federal Court of Austraha it should be said that all but two of those who are now judges of the Federal Court were already judges in Federal jurisdictions. The honourable member for Griffith also referred to the permanency of employment and contrasted it with the employment of certain other people. I do not believe that he could have been really serious in his comments, because he would knowMr Donald Cameron- I did not attack that. I just said that that was one of the benefits of being on the Bench.",72
132,Mr MACPHEE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,The honourable member says that he did not attack permanency of employment but said that it was a benefit. I reaffirm that not only is it a benefit to those on the Bench but also it is a great benefit to Austrahans in the administration ofjustice. Mr Donald Cameron- I did not argue against that.,73
133,Mr MACPHEE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"If the honourable member does not argue, I will not press the point further. The honourable member referred to the number of judges of the Family Court of Australia and presumably he was referring to the cost of the administration of them. Again the remuneration of those judges has no bearing on the number of judges there may be. That rests with the work lp;id and the work which they are asked to do by an Act of this Parliament. If there are inadequacies in that, they can be looked at; but they have no bearing on the remuneration which tl'? judge* aie receiving. The honourable member for Griffith has been a supporter in this Parhament of individual liberty. He was, and still is, an ardent supporter of the family law legislation and he has of course been an ardent supporter of Parliament. I am pleased that in his interjections he has clarified what appeared to me to be inconsistencies between support for those measures and the comments he made. I thought for one moment that he was trying to outdo his namesake the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) in his attacks on the judiciary. I do not think that I need to pursue those remarks any further, except to remind the House and anyone who happened to be Ustening to the remarks of the honourable member for Griffith and who might have wondered whether there was some conspiracy to mislead-of the purpose of this Bill as stated in the second reading speech. It stated: The primary purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal as to salaries and allowances of judges and persons of judicial status. It did not go beyond that. As the honourable member for Wentworth has said and as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has said, the second reading speech also states: Opportunity has been taken to revise provisions in a number of Acts relaung to the salaries and allowances payable to judges and persons ofjudicial status occupying offices created by those Acts. The second reading speech states: The amendments will bring those provisions into a form which accords with the present policy of fixation by the Parliament of judicial salaries after recommendation by the Remuneration Tribunal. I believe that this Bill is important in the way in which it fulfils those objectives set out in the second reading speech. I certainly commend it to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Macphee) read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee Consideration resumed from 12 October. Second Schedule. Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Proposed expenditure, $30,565,000.",73
134,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I rise to speak to the estimates for the Department Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Due to the that time is limited, I should hke to refer to three particular areas which come within the responsithe bihty of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) to illustrate the intolerlem able neglect, once again, of this Government which is endeavouring to dupe migrant commorning. munities in this country into believing that Government is acting m their interests. Having failed, the Government is carrying out an outclasses rageous campaign of deceit and deception to tion which I will refer a little later. Migrants are most savagely affected group, apart from Aborsometimes igines, in Austraha and are particularly affected by this unemployment crisis. It is a telling reflecthe tion of this Government's attitude to them that this Budget-in particular, the estimates for Department-ha s done nothing about alleviating their plight. I make this point because mentioned in the Estimates. It is exaggerated by the Government's dated policy of considering immigration in a compartmentalised capsule divorced from all those policy areas affecting it. say this because this morning I raised a question directly relevant to this matter. When speaking in the debate on a matter of public importance did not elect that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Anairs should answer the debate. simply referred to migrant services. All ister could add was that it was not part of portfoUo so he could not be expected to answer questions and be questioned about an issue that is of vital concern to migrants in this country. In a tug-of-war with the Department of grants Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the Department centre has of Social Security won out. The Department has suggestion which got itself into a situation in which the migrant welfare section of the Department is a rank ure. It ought to be investigated. I put it Mmister that he ought to take responsibUity of answering to this House about the intention his Department. Why is the Department in that state of affairs? Why is the Department so disOffice jointed in the areas of education, legal aid and on? A disgraceful situation has arisen. If the nic affairs section of the Department means anyThe thing, it ought to be a watch dog. It ought to adopting the recommendations contained in BaUey report, the report of the health and fare task force and other reports which talk about cohesive services that need to be ordinated in the interests of migrants in general. The third area to which I wish to refer relates to migrant services. I refer again to the 12 per cent cut, from $800,000 to $750,000, for migrant services. This matter is involved in the buckof passing which revolves around the two departfact ments. When we start to question one department about a matter we are blithely told that it is responsibUity of the other department. The agencies which are taking the brunt of the probare being told this every day of the week. I want to add to what the Minister said this He referred to a migrant English teachthe ing service at the Church of All Nations. He informed the House that the number in the at that school was nine. For the mformaof the Minister I point out that on an average the there are 146 in the class, sometimes more and less. There is one fulltimeteacher and three parttimeteachers. If the information which Minister has been given is wrong then I think he ought to take to task the person who gave it to this him. It is a crying shame that people who are struggling to do a job under these circumstances it was not are placed in that situation. In relation to the specific item in the appropriation which relates to migrant publicity, where is I the $lm, as I understand it, for the propaganda campaign? I know that an additional $39,178 has been provided. But where will the $lm come I from? It certainly does not appear in the appropriation. We require some explanation of that I matter. We have gone through the exercise about the Minthe provision for the Melbourne Migrant his Resource Centre. We are making great play of the Sydney Migrant Resource Centre, for God's sake, but it has never got off the ground. It is pie in the sky when you die. We have been given some limp, weak excuse about looking for a building during that period. This is leading miup the garden path once again. This not been achieved at all. This is a has never reached fruition. failOnce again I want to talk about the office of to the the Commissioner for Community Relations. The activities of the Government from the time it of took office have been directed towards getting rid of Grassby or, alternatively, of getting the into an area where he would be suppresso sed so that he could not carry out his role of proethviding protection against racial discrimination. Office has been relegated to the windy halls be of the Attorney-General's Department. The Act the should be administered in an Ombudsman-type welway. It should have somebody at its head who will not be talked down by tin pot lawyers like cowe have on the Government backbench. One would not want them to defend one in the small debt's court. If the Office gets into that area will be a bonanza for lawyers. Individuals will discriminated against. They will be put on merry-go-round and discriminated against until the case is resolved.",74
135,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, The Minister honourable member has been all countryside for the last seven minutes. I cannot estabUsh how any remark he has made is appUcable to the Estimates. I ask him to relate remarks to the Estimates or I shall have to ask expired. him to resume his seat.,75
136,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The last three matters I put to the Committee, with due respect, relate to division 342 which refers directly to the Office of Commissioner for Community Relations.",75
137,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I see. I apologise.,75
138,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Yes. You should not be so munity anxious to be effective.,75
139,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Will the undertaken honourable member get on with his speech.,75
140,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes. Translation services is another matter to which I refer. There is a not just to maintain the status quo but to mcrease the translation services because they are required by the community. There is one official Spanish translator in the Department. When any technimorning. cal interpretation or translation is needed Department relies on individuals who are not competent. I refer to the area of health. I that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) will take up this aspect. Let us look the number of translators who are avaUable in the medical and mental hygiene departments for the purposes of carrying out what is essential according to the best of medical knowledge and advice. The ladies who sweep the floor in some of the general hospitals are being to translate. It is an absolute disgrace. Represendid, tatives of CO.AS.IT. in Melbourne have put it me that they are concerned about the situation where migrants are involved. For one moment I wiU refer to the ethnic affairs section of the Department. I am sure that is contained in the Estimates, Mr Deputy Chairdidate, man. That section was referred to by the honourlast able member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) this morning. It is some sort of a joke. Up to 18 months ago it had a letterhead and three people. It then developed with a number of people who did not have their task laid out until after they had applied for the jobs. Further to that, I refer there money that is being expended by the Governbe ment on the Galbally inquiry. No fewer than 30 the references and reports on migrant needs are avaUable to the Minister. People have been knocking on doors to carry out a further review. The Galbally inquiry is a farce. I would Uke the to give some explanation as to how the over the expenditure is justified. TheODEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) his Order! The honourable member's time has",75
141,Mr RUDDOCK,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It is a pleasure in this debate to be able to offer some informed views on the performance of the Ministhe ter for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) in relation to his Department. I would Uke to offer the Minister my congratulations for the many positive initiatives that he has undertaken on behalf of the migrant comin Australia. Numbers of positive initiatives- I propose to go through them-hav e been office. This by this Government since it came to is quite different from the cynical use of our ethnic people in Australia by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). That need has been demonstrated not only in the speech that we have just heard but also in the speech that we heard on a sinular matter which was raised as a matter of pubhc importance this I say that the speech that the honour the able member for St George (Mr NeU) made in this House this morning in the debate ought to be hope prescribed reading for every member of the House and every person who can take the opporat tunity to glance through Hansard. He puts clearly and into perspective the way in which the Labor Party cynicaUy uses every opportunity to absolutely pursue its political objectives. I recall to mind an event that the honourable asked member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) saw, as I on the occasion of the presentation of some to awards to Greek chUdren in my electorate only recently. It was at the time of the municipal councU elections. After the members present had taken the opportunity to present trophies to young chUdren whose ages ranged from five or six years through to 13 or 14 years, a Labor cana young man who stood against me at the election, was invited by the State Labor member to come forward. He took the opportunity to make a speech about local government issues and about what he proposed to do if he got to dizzy heights into councU. Mr Antony Whitlam-And he got in, and we to the waste of won the councU.",75
142,Mr RUDDOCK,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes, because he headed the Labor Partyticket.What would one expect? But as the honourable member knows, his Party not get the three out of five seats which it expected to get; the result went the other The fact of the matter is that, as the honourable member for St George illustrated this honourable member was prepared to go along and politically to abuse the invitation extended to him to come along and enjoy a Uttle this feUowship with them when they had the opporfanuiywhether tunity of making presentations to their cluldren icy. Does of awards for their sporting prowess. I think that who wanthe honourable members who abuse such a privilege 'No, we aretonot ought to be ashamed of themselves. Let us get these matters into perspective. honourable members opposite want to do is to denigrate the outstanding work of the Minister and his Department in assisting our migrant people. If we look at the first and principal achievement of this Government we see the maticy, ter in perspective. When Labor was in office linked up immigration and all the matters related to our ethnic people with matters conThis cerning labour-w e had a Department of Labor and Immigration. Immigration did not have ministerial hand who was able to devote himself fuUy to attending to the needs of the community. Immediately upon our coming to office a separate Department of Immigration Ethnic Affairs was established. One of thefirstacts of the Minister-fo deserves congratulation-wa s to reconstitute the accept Australian Population and Immigration Council. bourne that. As a result he has been able to receive advice onmember for Parramatta a number of important matters. members opposite know, as I do, that that Council has been asked to consider the implications population change, developments in research in Austraha and overseas in the areas of population and immigration, the probable long term effects of changing patterns of immigration intakes and, additionally, the way in which immigration intakes can be planned to complement other national pohcies. As a result of that, Australia's first Green Paper on immigration poUcies and Australian population was produced and he pubUshed. Later, on 17 March 1977, it was tabled in this Parliament. Mr Innes-It is a poltiical document.",76
143,Mr RUDDOCK,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The honourable member he says that it is a political document. I should to refer in passing to that political document cause it was about that document and during debate of that document that we saw the honourwhich able member for Melbourne coming out in his true Ught. He is opposed to migration programs involving Australia. During this debate on these did important funds which are being aUocated to bring immigrants to Australia, I ask the honourway. able member whether he is prepared to state clearly in what areas he would run down our this morning, immigration program. After reading through the speech he made in House on 22 March 1977, I should Uke to know perhaps he wants to taU down the reunion aspects of our immigration polwant to say to the Australian people bring their relatives to Austraha: prepared to have your prospective spouse or children or parents join you in this What country; we are against famUy reunions'? Or does he want to say that we should not have the skUled workers who are going to help to create jobs for other people? Or is he perhaps saying that if we tail down our active immigration polwhich is evidenced in the document we are it debating, it is the refugees whom he does not want? He cannot have it each and every way. is the gentleman who wants to taU down our immigration policy because he happens to bea lieve m minimum population growth. There are other important initiatives which have been migrant undertaken by this Government. and Mr Innes- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. The honourable member is directing questions to me and inviting interjections. r this he The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) - I will The honourable member for Melresume his seat and the honourable will address his remarks Honourable through the Chair. of Mr RUDDOCK-Most certainly, Mr Deputy Chairman. I simply want to take this opportunity to give the honourable member opposite an opi )ortunity to elaborate upon these matters at a ater time. I am not suggesting that he should do it by way of interjection. As the spokesman on these matters for Her Majesty's Opposition he might be prepared at some point of time to darify which area of our immigration program wants to see tailed down, because these estimates allocate the funds necessary to maintain an active immigration program. A very important part of the program is that part that will provide job opportunities and so on of the type that has been talking about today. One of the facUke tors limiting economic growth in this country is be the inability of Australia to obtain skilled the workers to help generate other activity from people might be able generally to benefit. Recovery will be generated indirectly through an active immigration program bringing skilled workers to Australia. During his term of office the Minister has of expanded the family reunion categories for improvement immigration and allowed people who are bringgrants under this ing business skills, money and so on to Australia that earlier today. that will enable them to commence Australia, to be eUgible under the criteria entry to this country. The Minister has announced a far-reaching pohcy in relation to entry of refugees. That was done on 27 May this ple year. The Mmister was responsible for the amDepartment. nesty that was so important in clarifying the position of some 8,000 people who are now permanent residents of Austraha. He abohshed the requirement for re-entry visas. He established thefirstAustraUan Ethnic Affairs Council. He tablished an ethnic affairs policy branch within his Department, which is so important. He depopular cided on the questions for the establishment the separate ethnic broadcasting organisation that we heard about earlier today. He has been very much involved in that matter and deserves congratulations and commendation. Finally, I refer to one other matter to which the honourable member for Melbourne Saturday's adverted, that is, the estabUshment of the experihad mental migrant resource centres. They are important initiatives. One is to be operated the Australian-Greek Welfare Society in Melbourne and the other is to operate in Sydney. I wish to clarify the position in that respect. The second one is in fact to be opened in Parramatta, the centre of the Western suburbs of Sydney. will serve one mUlion people, many of whom are nity of migrant origin. Parramatta is the centre of region to which those people look for the prothink vision of services and support. A little difficulty has been experienced in acquiring the buUding from Telecom Australia. However, the leasing persistently arrangements have now been completed and the renovations will befinishedon Monday. I underown stand that the furniture will be moved in Tuesday. Following that, staff wiU be actively recruited for that office.",76
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, authority Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
145,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It is interesting in these debates to hear the Party that is opposed to big government welcoming the establishment of all this extr? buister, reaucracy and the issue of paper after paper of information. No one is disputing that a number of bureaucrats have been appointed to new and no one is disputing that there has been a ceremonies. whole lot of paper deluging members of this Parhament. What honourable members on this side the chamber have constantly complained about is that there has been no effective in the provision of services to miGovernment. We spoke about Since, as the Minister for businesses in Immigration and Ethnic for conceded in that debate,Affairsvery (Mr MACKellar) few of those seralso vices indeed are the responsibUity ofhis ment, I propose to confine my remarks toDepartof matters that are within the province aofhis couFirstly, I wish to talk about the vexed issue of citizenship, which is so concerning the Minister esthat he has written to every member of parhament about it and has written articles for the Press about it. It seems to have agitated of him a very great deal. He also appeared on the electronic media earher in the week about it. The first thing I propose to say is that, like all other honourable members, I prefer tofindout about the contents of letters written to me when I receive them rather than to read about them in the newspapers. In this case I was able to read in newspapers what the Minister said he written to me instead ofhaving to wait until the letter arrived on Tuesday of this week. That by struck me as being a httle discourteous. I gather that the Minister is concerned mainly about the dignity of citizenship ceremonies. The Mmister is a big man on dignity. He is concerned It to impress upon candidates the honour and digof citizenship. If the Minister is so concerned that about the standard of citizenship ceremonies I he should be prepared to offer to provide some assistance towards meeting the cost of those ceremonies, which his Department has refused to do. This may not be a matter of consequence to the municipaUties in his electorate, but it is of great consequence to on the municipalities in my electorate. In the Municipality of MarrickvUle more than 3,000 people a year become citizens, which is the greatest number handled by any local government in Australia. These ceremonies take place throughout the year, and this cost represents a considerable burden on the limited of a local government authority in an area which does not have a very great rate base in any event. The Government, through the Minhas consistently denied the provision of any assistance to local government to meet the cost of these ceremonies. Yet the Minister says that he is jobs so concerned about the dignity of these Mr Donald Cameron-You know who is going to them and making a speech.",77
146,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I am coming to that point because I think it goes to show what nincompoops you are. You object to pohticians attending events at which they hope to gain some partisan advantage. I do not know about the persons on the other side of the chamber,78
147,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr GILES) Order! I remind the honourable member that he should address his remarks to the Chair. If he does so, he should not use the word 'nincompoop'.",78
148,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It certainly would not be applicable to you, Mr Deputy Chairman. Let me fully concede that I do not go to any function from which I do not aim to gain some political advantage. I suggest that it is quite one thing to go to a citizenship ceremony and view it as a pohtical occasion, which it plainly is, and it is another thing to inject party politics into it. It is the inability of honourable members opposite to perceive that distinction which so disqualifies them from taking part in any intelUgent discussion on this subject. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) made a rather Freudian slip. He talked about a Labor candidate in local government elections attending a children's event and injecting politics into it. That is precisely the kind of attitude which underhes the mentality of Liberal-Country Party members on these issues. They continue to regard migrants to this country as being cluldren. They continue to regard the only fit topics for ethnic radio as being the soccer results from the countries of origin of our migrants or news of ethnic carnivals at which there may have been folk dancing or something hke that. What is wrong with having inteUigent newscasts and intelUgent current affairs programs conducted in languages other than EngUsh for persons in Australia who cannot comprehend English? It is precisely because honourable members opposite regard migrants as cluldren that they will be rejected by them at the next election. Mr Corbett-We cannot be too sure.",78
149,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I do not know how many migrants the honourable member has in his electorate. He is probably pretty safe. The Minister got into hot water on this question of citizenship ceremonies. As I understand it, a member of his staff was asked for elaboration on his news release and on his letter. By way of colour the remark was added that the Minister was also understood to be concerned about the handing out of appUcation forms for citizenship in shoppmg centres and market places. I ask honourable members: What could be less offensive than that action? The Minister said that it amounted in fact to coercing people to become citizens. When the Minister appeared on television two nights later he was unable to detaU a single incident of coercion. In fact, when he was faced by the spokesman for a group which has been active in assisting persons to take up citizenship if they so desired, he was unable to give one instance at all and he was at some pains to say at great length that he was not critical of that group at all. It may very well be that a great number of potential citizens live in areas that are presently represented by members of the Australian Labor Party. That may be the case, but it cannot be helped. I can tell honourable members that as far as I am aware groups conducting these drives to inform persons about citizenship would be very grateful for any assistance they received from members of any party whatsoever. This line which the Minister has been pushing is one which he has been pushing for sometimebehind closed doors at Liberal Party meetings and at meetings of so-called ethnic supporters of the Liberal Party. The first time it saw the light of day was last week when it appeared in the Press. That is why the Minister has been caught out. He has not been able to produce a single instance of coercion. In fact, I think that every honourable member ought to be grateful that groups are going out into the community and providing this service for people who wish to become citizens. There is no publicity avaUable in a language other than English to inform migrants in this country about the conditions of ehgibiUty for citizenship and about the way in which they can go about applying for citizenship. Applications for citizenship have meant a journey into town, into the central business district, during working hours. The Minister will say that interviewing officers have been made avaUable at weekends on 22 occasions during the past year. I welcome that. That is a very good idea. But applications for citizenship will never be encouraged unless someone approaches people and makes it clear to them that the Government would welcome their becoming citizens if they so wished. I think the dignified words of a migrant to Austraha, Dr George Paxinos, sum up a fair attitude on this. He says: There is nothing undignified about voluntary workers distributing leaflets in ethiuc languages on street corners, providing information about citizenship and encouraging those who wish to apply to do so. However I believe there is immense lack of dignity in the situadon of half a million migrants who live in this country body has bothered to go and talk to them, to explain what their rights are and to help them take out citizenship decide they want to. That is the situation. Why can we not have an advertising program on ethnic radio and in the ethnic Press to mform people of their rights and, indeed, in the electoral held, to inform people from Commonwealth countries of their obhgations. In the couple of minutes remaining to me I want to talk about one other item in the appropriation for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It concerns the matter on which the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) touched-the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. The appropriation provides no money for this beyond 31 December this year, and the bhthe statement is made that the appropriation for the second half of this financial year will be found in the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department. In fact, the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department and the proposed Human Rights Commission provide nothing hke the same level of commitment in dollars. As I understand it, the Human Rights Commission is designed to have five commissioners; yet the annual amount involved is only about double the amount available already for the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. That office has done a splendid job in encouraging a sense of dignity among people who have come to this country to make their Uves, to even out discrirnination against them and to alert the Austrahan community to shortcomings in the present set-up. If that kind of outlet is denied to migrants in this country it will be a very sorry day indeed and migrants will certainly know who to blame.",78
150,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,79
151,Mr NEIL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I approach the estimates again on a non-political basis. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) finished his speech by talking about whom migrants would have to blame. It is quite regrettable that the Austrahan Labor Party still insists on using migrants as a political football for one side to blame the other for some matter or to seek to take some petty advantage. I really think the total approach of the Labor Party is beneath the dignity of the migrant community. I deal first with adult migrant education. In the last financial year the allocation for adult miwithout the vote because nogrant education from the Commonwealth if they Government was $2.7m. During the year there was a supplement of $270,000, making a total of $2.97m. The extra was given for the cost supplementation to meet mflation and for the increased demand especially towards the end of the financial year. Honourable members will recall the influx, particularly of Lebanese people, at about that time. It is most important to note that the program is flexible; it is not rigid. It is subject to regular discussions and supplementation. The Budgetfigurein any year is only the basefigure.Ministers responsible for immigration within the States are well aware of this. The New South Wales Minister of Education is well aware of the system. In this year's Budget the basefigureis $3.09m, which is an increase of about 12 per cent. It is subject to supplementation for costs to meet inflation and for any increased demand. Recently the New South Wales Government instituted more services than were appropriate under the agreement to maintain the base level for at least the same level of services as last year. Perhaps it meant well and perhaps it did not; but it did so in order to embarrass the Federal Government when some of those services might have to be curtailed. It did so purely for pohtical purposes, which is disgraceful. Since then some services, which were additional services outside the agreement, either had to close or were threatened with closure. I was informed that one project in the electorate of St George, at Arncliffe, had had its teacher withdrawn. The New South Wales Government should have kept to the appropriate arrangements. Had it done so, there would have been no difficulties. Mr Antony Whitlam- Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. I wonder to what item in the appropriations for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the honourable member is speaking. It seems to me that he is not speaking to these estimates at all. Mr MACKellar-You did not take the point of order when the honourable member for Melbourne was speaking. Mr Antony Whitlam-The honourable member for St George could have said this this afternoon.",79
152,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,79
153,Mr NEIL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"There was a supplementation of $150,000 only a few weeks ago to meet the dethe mand. There has been a guarantee of further mand. All honourable members realise that refugees have come into this country. Government has to find funds to assist those refugees. I acknowledge that the Federal electoral Government has a very special role to play in this area. The Government acknowledges that there any group. have been some unemployment difficulties and that the Government's funds must be directed towards assisting in that area. It is relevant but not necessaiy to these estimates. The Government realises that persons in this situation need to be assisted with funds. There is also a greater consciousness of migrant comnot munities and it is quite plain that there is increased demand. The New South Wales Ministificate. ter for Education has had clear assurances from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) and also from the Minister Education (Senator Carrick) that there will be commitment to maintain levels at least sufficient for last year and to enable the courses to tinue. There ought not to be any problem as long as governments keep out of the pohtical arena. notice today that the New South Wales Minister now has said that existing programs will be maintained. I welcome this. In thetimeremaining I would like to deal with one or two matters raised by other members. particular, one claim was made regarding unemployment. I point out that this Government has brought into this country people who otherwise would not have been able to come here because they did not qualify under the occupational criin teria. It has been done for humanitarian reasons and there has been some increase in unemployand ment because of that. Who can blame the Government for that? I point out also that the latestfiguresshow that a small percentage breadwinners in the Austrahan community are unemployed. It is the breadwinner who counts principally in the family, although I appreciate the hardship to other unemployed persons. Most migrants have a close family unit and, if the breadwinner is working, at least the family can be maintained. On the question of citizenship, of course Government welcomes persons obtaining citiwith zenship. We welcome them complying with their obhgations to go on the electoral roll. I beheve that this matter has to be dealt with with proper dignity and decorum. I am not particularly conto cerned about certain of these matters. I believe that these people should be assisted, provided is done principally by government departments or by persons who are able to act broadly under aegis of the Department in order to avoid any depossible cases of coercion. I am concerned, however, about one problem raised by the honour The able member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam); that is, the question of going on the roll. I do not refer only to migrants. I am talking generally and I do not intend to single out At present all a person has to do to get on the electoral roll, whether he has turned 18 years or whether he is naturalised, is to sign a form saying that he is entitled to vote and get somebody to witness the form.

155,Dr KLUGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"There are a couple of issues to which I should hke to refer the few minutes we are given to debate the appropriations for the Department of Immigration Ethnic Affairs. Thefirstis an issue which is really shared between that Department and the Department of Social Security. It relates to the of question of migrants from West Germany who become naturalised in this countiy and then lose their entitlement under the German Government's superannuation scheme, which is a contributory scheme. I think it is a great pity that apparently no agreement has been reached beunit tween the Austrahan Government and the West German Government. Generally speaking, the the West German Government has signed treaties many of the countries where ex-West German citizens now reside but it has not taken the opportunity, for reasons not known to me, to do so with Australia. People in Germany contribute a superannuation scheme. If such people come to Austraha, provided that they remain West it German citizens they can still receive that pension. But if they become naturalised Australian citizens they lose that entitlement, and I think that is a great pity. As I understand it, we do not have any great bargaining power with the West German Government because of our decision back in 1973, when the Whidam Government was in power, to grant pensions to all those eUgible for Australian pensions, wherever they hve. We cannot say to the West Germans that we will exchange that right for their granting pensions to former citizens of their country who are now naturalised Austrahans. However, it ought to be possible to come to some sort of agreement with what appears to me to be a very sensible West German Government. I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar)- I am sure he agrees with me that such a disincentive should not exist for former citizens of Germany to become Australian citizens-to initiate discussions again with the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle). The next point with which I wish to deal is which has worried me considerably. It was again drawn to my attention tonight by one of the poorest newspapers in Austraha, the Sydney to Sun, and I would not be surprised if the Melmeans bourne Herald had a sinular story, although I have not looked at it today. month the Sydney Sun and the Melbourne Herald ran stories on the disappearance of Griffith businessman Donald Mackay, an antidrug campaigner who was lulled allegedly by people of Itahan origin called Mafiosi. The only evidence that I have seen for his disappearance being connected with his drug campaigning is the fact that he was an anti-drug campaigner, I suppose that a significant number of people lolled without being involved in anti-drug campaigning. Obviously I do not know whether he was kUled for that reason or not. Journalists from the Sydney Sun and the Melbourne Herald, and Sue Smith, that siUy lady from Current Affair, went to Italy for some weeks and probed,I as they called it, the connection between the called Mafia and Griffith. The newspaper carried big headlines proving that people connected with Plati, a town in Calabria, were the people who had kiUed Mackay. No evidence was ever presented. Yet the so-called link was presented as a fact. There were huge front page headhnes claiming this each day. What does the Sun say today? After having run the campaign for the month, it now decides that three men are sought for the Mackay lolling. On a front page the Sun reports: Homicide Squad detectives believe that three Indians, all illegal immigrants, may have murdered missing Griffith businessman Don Mackay three months ago. Now the Sun says that the suspects are Indians. Let me read the evidence on which all these stories have been based. Later in the article this reference appears: Eye witnesses told police that three men were seen in the parking area in a 1969 light green Holden sedan about 6.15. That was the only evidence produced that has any potential relevance to what has been said. The Sun article continues: At the time these men were described as 'dark, of Italian or Aboriginal extraction'. Now the Sun says: Detectives later identified the three men more positively as Indians who were thought to be fruit pickers. I am not suggesting that they are Indians. They may have no connection with the disappearance. They may not be Indians. They may be people of Anglo-Saxon or Irish extraction or any sort of extraction who are dark. I think there are people on the Government front bench who would be one described as having a darkish, Itahan appearance. I certainly do not hold that against them. I object to this attempt by the media in Austraha sell newspapers, to sell time on television, by offictitiousstories about alleged Mafia activities being involved in the kiUing of one man For some weeks last in Griffith.",80
156,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Si r Eric WUUs was not doing too bad with it either.,81
157,Dr KLUGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As the honourable member for Corio pointed out, the New South Wales Liberal Party went right into it, for political reasons. Obviously, I do not know what has happened to but Donald Mackay. I do not suggest that anybody are here knows. If they knew I assume they would have told the pohce. We have this demonology, the idea that foreigners are involved in organised crime. They must be foreigners; they could not be gendemen from the same background as the nonourabie member for Phillip (Mr Birney). Yet think he would agree with me. I am not suggestsoing that he is involved in organised crime, but having been a banister in Sydney and having been a man of the world in Sydney, I think he would agree with me that the proportion of people involved in criminal activities probably does not vary much between people of different racial origins. I quote now from a book which has always impressed me. It was written by Norval last Morris and Gordon Hawkins, both criminologists. It is called The Honest Politician's Guide spread to Crime Control. They make particular reference to the Mafia and therefore it is relevant to this discussion on the estimates for the ment of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. They attack the proposition that there is such a organised crime in the sense that one group trols all crime in a country such as Austraha. They say: . . . we have spoken of myths which exercise a powerful influence on the ways in which we think and act nological field. In this chapter we deal with one seductive and persistent of those myths, the demonology organised crime. This is the phenomena of crime there exists a single, mysterious, otent organisauon which is responsible idea which has long exerted a powerful influence on the minds not only of journalists but also of law enforcement agents and serious students of crime. They continue commenting on it. They say: . . . a large proportion of what has been written not to be dealing with an empirical matter at all. It as though what is referred to as organised crime the realm of metaphysics or theology.",81

159,Dr KLUGMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I think it is relevant in the sense that people have criticised a significant group of Austrahans of overseas origin. Such people should be criticised for doing that. I I have made my point. I make thisfinalpoint on the question of immigration: I am not one those who beheve immigration ought to be out. I am one who beheves that an exceUent gument can be made, for economic and other reasons, in favour of continuing immigration on a significant scale. I would draw the attention the Minister to a publication caUed Nil Net gration News, pubhshed in August 1976 by the New South Wales Environment Centre, which could just as easUy have been pubUshed Enoch Powell. I cannot remember who signed the particular articles; indeed I am not sure that they were signed at all, but they contain ridiculous propositions with which, deplorably,him, the Australian Conservation Foundation associwhen. ates itself, to the effect that before the Governhere ment increases immigration it must consider the subject in the light of the Federal Environment Protection Act.

I would like to say how much I agree with what the previous speaker said, in this thing as respect: I , too, am sick and tired of the connewspapers talking about a Yugoslav doing this or a Hungarian doing that or a Pommy so-and-so doing such and such. Let us grow up-and this applies to all sections of the media and of this in the crimi-Parliament-and begin speaking about Ausofthe most tralians as Australians, abandoning the use of of words such as 'ethnic', 'migrant' and the like. It notion that behind the diverse omnipis about time we started to become very serious for much of it. It is an about migration. Earlier today we saw the Parhament trying to politicise this whole subject. It is a sorry commentary that people on both sides have tried to seems make the tragedies that are associated with miis almost gration the subject of petty pohtical manoeuvre. belonged toWe must ensure that abuse across this Chamber on this subject, such as we witnessed earlier, completely. I have an emphathy with the be honourable members for St George and Grayndler, feeling deeply as they do about the personal problems they face among the large ethnic groups within their electorates, but I hope we will soon see the whole subject of immigration lifted to its former position of warranting bipartisanship on the part of all members of this think House, rather than slanging matches across the Chamber. It is futile to believe that only one side of of this House has concern for the welfare and cut well-being of those Australian residents who arhave come to live here permanently from overseas. From Calwell to Holt to MACKellar there has been, this House must accept, a genuine conof cern by all who have administered our migration Mipohcies over the past 30 years to see that Austraha is well served by those policies and that all Australians, whether born here or not, share by in the bounties of our land. Our present Minister is a worthy successor of the successful Ministers who have gone before but let us stop saying who did what, and We should be concerned that all who Uve Uve not only with equal opportunity but with equal dignity under equal laws. There is no room for paternalism in any of our migration sort policies and I hope that my colleagues, on both sides, will stop using the four letter word 'them' whenever migrants are discussed. For the new members of the House, I have what might be by some as a confession: I am one of I was born overseas. I am the son of Scottish migrants and, like the miUions of other Auswho share my personal heritage of havof ing been born overseas, would say: Let all members be aware that migrants see themselves as Australians who happen to have been born others. overseas.",82

163,Mr DOBIE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As individuals they do not necessarily regard themselves as ethnics. I am also the son of a shop steward. Overwhelmingly, migrants to Austraha quickly see themselves Austrahans,' and this is how we, as members of this Parhament, should always regard migrants, nodding. no more and certainly no less than all Australian Mr born Austrahan citizens. This to discuss and I believe it a great shame that the immigration debate has become so very pohtical in the last two or three years. It has to stop. does not we willfindourselves dividing into camps which will have no solution. The probin lems of migration face us all. No matter whether the a person is a constituent of Cook, Grayndler, George or Adelaide, the problems are common. The problems of family reunion and of getting people here who have friends are not pecuUar the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Couniry Party. The problems of miown ;ration are truly national and wiU have to ! ooked at in this Ught from now on. It is not enough for honourable members to stand up in this chamber and hurl abuse at each other on such a sensitive subject. The people listening who are the subject of this debate are not amused by that. This is a short debate. At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the professionalism exists in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I was most saddened when the Department was disbanded some years ago. was a source of personal pleasure when this Government decided to make the Immigration heads Department a separate department again. It regard. raised the Department to its position of importern. tance. It raised it to a position where people ing to Austraha felt important once more. congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), who has sat through the whole of this debate, for his personalthat concern and involvement in the problems grants in Australia. As he well knows he and I have not agreed on many of the cases I have put to him. I have no doubt that as time goes on will continue so to differ. However, I have a couheart. ple of cases before him in respect of which I hope he changes his mind. I see him nodding perhaps he will be helpful. I pay tribute in this debate to people in Sydney office of the Immigration Department, people such as George Austin, Brian 0""NeUl, Bruce Donald and John Vanderness, among community. These guys work their hearts out for the welfare of migrants. I know that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) who is trying to has a concern for migrants in Newcastle. If he can give some more names let him do so. The point is that we have within the Immigration Department some very dedicated professional as people. I see that the honourable member for Port Adelaide, Mr Young, is agreeing with me by Young- I want the Minister to let more of is no easy subject my people in.",83
164,Mr DOBIE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"That may be a very good suggesIf it tion. I share that concern with the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I hope, however, that the administration of the migration pohcy in coming 12 months, whUe we keep our regard St for the employment aspects and restrictions which are vital, we wiU see a growing sophistication in the statistics held as to what positions to are avaUable and what positions are not avaUable. Great progress has been made. From my experience I believe that is a good relabe tionship between the Department of Immigragoodtion and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. But I believe it is due for even further refinement. There are activities in Australia which are still not met by local avaUabUity of staff. I hope that in the coming weeks we will see a further sophistication of relationships between the two departments to work out more reaUstic tables as to where job that vacancies exist in Austraha. I congratulate the Minister on his approach to It the refugee problem. In Austraha we have no reason to hold our heads down. We can hold our high because of our migation policy in this I hope that it continues to follow this patAs we all are very much aware the refugee com-problem will not lessen as the years go by. It is I not my wish at this stage to talk about which country should supply refugees or from which country Australia should accept them. I hope we maintain the truly international apof miproach we have had to the acceptance of refugees into this country, irrespective of their E olitical background. I wish that I could speak we mger on this subject which is very dear to my I hope that as a result of this debate we will see the subject of migration taken out of the so field of petty pohtical point making.",83
165,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"There is no the doubt that intimesofeconomic recession such as the present time the migrant community is amongst the hardest hit section of the Austrahan It is true enough that other sections of the Australian community are affected-youn school leavers, including migrant children; women, mcluchng migrant women. As a group, one could probably suggest that migrants taken together, are the hardest hit group. I have cated that school children or women probably are thefirstto be retrenched. After all, they only women. I ask honourable members to foryear. give my apparent sexist remark, but sadly this the view taken. I am not necessarily subscribing to it. But they are not the main breadwinners, the women can afford to lose their jobsfirst.Thatwhat is one reason. But of the men, the major breadthat winners in the family, the migrants are the least secure employees in the community. No doubt, this is based on an old accepted principle that last to come into the job are thefirstto go if there is a need to retrench. Clearly in this situation, migrants are in the least secure situation. Another reason for this occurring is because migrants tend to be in certain industries which, certainly at this time, have been hardest hit-th textile industry, the clothing trade, the motor hicle industry and even parts of heavy industry. There is no point going into the matter. We mustpend. accept the fact that migrants probably are hareffects dest hit in employment opportunities in a situwas ation like the present situation. Of course, at same time with this difficulty with employment there is an increased need throughout the whole community for community services of all sorts. Again, because the migrants constitute the gest group in the sense that, in relation to proportion of migrants in the general comnot munity, the number of people needing these sorts of support services comprises a high promake. portion of migrants, so they are more dependent on services which ironically at this time are back and are least able to cater for the increasingboasts demand. So for all sorts of reasons, migrants sense are victimised by the difficulties of economic downturn orrecession-call it what you will. In the discussion earher today of a matter pubhc importance, the Minister for Immigration and Ethmc Affairs (Mr MACKellar) gave some figures in respect of the various facets of services relating to and for migrants. Thefiguresseemed to indicate that things were looking up. I suggestthis that he was indulging in a slight sleight of if I might put it that way. Thefigureshe appeared to be numerically higher than the figures for last year. I do not argue with that. But that is a simplistic view. First of all, last year's figures represented a dramatic cutback in many cases on the amounts made available for these sorts of services for migrants when the Austrahancan g Labor Party was in government. But even if one accepts that thefiguresgiven for this year are a httle higher than thefiguresfor last year, if we look at the position carefully and make adjustindiments for inflation, wefindthat in most cases, the real value is equal to, if we are lucky, and in are many cases less than thefigureseven for last But there is still a further trap. The comisparison is between the money spent last year and the money allocated this year. If we bother to solook back at what was allocated last year-not was spent, but what was allocated-w e find because of the winding down of programs, because of the need to cut back on pubhc expansion and so forth, significant proportions of the thefunds allocation last year were not spent. So the real comparison should be not between what was thespent last year and what we are allocating this year. The comparison should be with what was allocated last year and what has been allocated this year. Then the discrepancy is even greater. e For all thesereasons,in my view, there has in vefact been a real cutback in the allocation of funds for the sorts of services on which migrants deThat sort of factor is independent of the of inflation. To make the point, $21.3m spent on migrant education in 1974-75 and the$21.4m in 1975-76; but in 1976-77 the allocation was $ 10.6m. Even that $ 10.6m was not spent; only $ 10.3m was spent. That represented a dramatic cutback and then another cutback because larthe money was not spent. This year we are to the spend more. The allocation is $ 10.4m which is even as much as the allocation made last year. I hope that makes the point that I want to cut I now want to discuss for a few moments the that some Government supporters are in amaking that the Liberal Government has reour stored the migration program which was savagely cut under the Labor Government. Before I argue the case, or appear to be knocking immigration, let me assert the areas in which I of am in favour of accepting migrants. I do not think there is any argument that political refugees should be permitted to come here. It is sometimes awkward because they come in unexpected numbers and at unexpected times. But is a rich, comfortable, free country and we hand,can afford to take such people who choose to gave come here in times of difficulty. Another group is made up of those who have family members in this country. I do not mean the restricted way we are looking at it now. 1 mean the whole range of family members. We afford the old, the halt, the lame relations, the dependants in the truest sense of the word people who live here. We can afford as wellMr MACKellar-How far, how wide?",83
166,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,We can afford as wellMr MACKellar-Second and third cousins?,85
167,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I will come to that in a minute. We can afford as well the young, the vigorous, the potential competitors forjobs who have relatives here. I speak of the mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. We tend to refuse admission to and daughters if they are over a certain age are theoretically independent. I think that wrong. Their parents here may be old and lonelythey or vice versa, their parents may be still able look after themselves. But they can see the end their working Ufe commg up and they want to prepared enjoy their families here, their sons and because daughters. We are too restrictive. We were as guUty as the present Government is.",85
168,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Not quite.,85
169,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I think we were not as liberal as we could have been. I think that this countiy is rich, lush, free country which can afford those sorts of people. But now I come to my anxieties.of Why should we aUow the others to come in? seriously Why should we allow skUled tradesmen to comedoing in when so many people are out of work in terms. Australia, people who could and should be trained for new occupations? What can we with mainly unskUled people? Prospects are that it will be very difficult to increase the job in these sorts of unskUled areas. Why do we offer them the opportunity to be trained in othersince occupations? The answer may be that we do not have the time to do it quickly and that we have to bring people from elsewhere. But shortages are not uniform throughout the country. Why can we notsquare give more positive assistance to Australians already here before we bring in people from facets other countries? We should take that proposition more seriously. Why bring in skUled tradesmen from developing countries? Those countries can UI afford to lose these skUled people. I know it is are hard thing to say, because after all they want tofallen come here and improve their lot, but it is a bur-will den for the developing countries to lose these sorts of people. But we are happy to accept net skUled tradesmen from practicaUy anywhere. Even if we claim that we should not take people21,000 from developing countries, hard as that may seem, why do we take skUled people from developed countries, the rich countries? I say that we should not take people from the developed countries because those countries are rich of enough to look after them. If we look at this problem in a humanitarian way our priorities should be to give unskUled people from poor countries a chance to come here. But, of course, that would raise loud protests and objections because in real terms that is not what we are out to do either. We are not being humanitarian at all. The real point of it aU is that we bring people to Austraha to help to develop the country. It is a basic greed motive on our part. We want them sonswith their skUls to help us to develop more andquickly. We do not really care about the counis tries from which they come. They come here, need housing, education and other facUities to that are in short supply and they do not improve ofthose situations. What is the attraction? They are to put up with the lack of these facUities they feel insecure. They are prepared to work for lower wages because they feel insecure. They will put up with the sorts of conditions which old Austrahans would not put up with. So for these reasons we take them as, what has been called, cannon fodder. That is not a reflection on a them; it is a reflection on our immorahty in taking people like them from those countries instead looking after our own. I think we very need to consider what it is we are really when we encourage migration in those",85
170,Mr OKEEFE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I rise to supdo port the estimates for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and to congratudemandlate the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic notAffairs (Mr MACKellar) on the job he has done taking over this portfoUo since December 1975. It has not been easy because of the high level of unemployment and the refugees coming from Lebanon, Vietnam and other countries. Austraha is a magnificent country of 3 mUlion rrules and with a population of 14 mUlion. Immigration must surely be one of the important of government in this country. It is doubtful whether most Australians reaUse what recent E opulation trends have been and what they are kely to be unless various kinds of official action a taken. Firstly, the birth rate has already to a level at which, in the long term, births be offset by deaths which, of course, means zero population growth. Secondly, the estimated migration rate in the current financial year is httle more than 30,000 compared with only last year. Tliirdly, in the past 10 years Australia has lost more than one-third of a the mUUon people in international movements. Fourthly, the percentage of lost migrants returning home to their original homelands hasrisento about 20 per cent of arrivals since 1925. These trends add up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with httle or no natural increase in population and only a very small gain from immigration. Some of the results will be a smaller increase in the labour force, labour shortages in the 1980s and 1990s, smaller numbers of school age children and a progresssituation ive aging of the population. Less will have to spent on education and more on the social fare system. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has in statements to this House made it through clear that there is a numerical decline in what has which historically been the mainstay of the labour force-the male worker-and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a year. stagnant society. All these possibilities may be specific accepted with equanimity by some people such as the zero population growth advocates, those who are sceptical of economic growth for its own sake, others who are concerned with conser100,000 vation and environmental issues and those feel quite simply that the country needstimeto adjust to the post-war influx of immigrants. There is, however, a great danger in allowing long term considerations to be obscured by our all too real short term difficulties which include large number of unemployed. The Green Paper which was produced earlier this year, looks at the matter in better perspecthe tive. It looks at three possible programs-small medium and large. The first would involve a net loss of 1,000 to 2,000 workers a year-mostl workers in professional and skilled occupations - and would arouse httle enthusiasm. The secnumber ond, a medium sized program, with a gross intake of 9,000 to 120,000 a year and a net of 50,000, appears to be a good scheme. The Australia. third program, the large one, seems to present too many practical difficulties. The Green Paper is a good one. It balances long term considerLebanon, ations against short term considerations and draws attention to the difficulties which will very quickly when economic recovery occurs. It non-committal on the admission of refugees. However, that is another matter and it must be considered in the context of our moral obligation to admit refugees. Australia's real population in the post-war period when we embarked on a major program of population building. This gram saw the arrival in Austraha of more 3.3 million new settlers who, together children born in Austraha, have been responsible for approximately one-half of Australia's post-war population growth from 7.4rnilhonto the present 14 million. With the passing of time, this pohcy has provided dividends for Austraha. Various governments in the post-war period net have done much to overcome the inevitable difficulties of adjustment to new environments. possibly The appropriations for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs provide for a in which the intake of migrants will be be rather static. We can see from the Budget Speech welthat the Government has decided not to set a specific immigration program for 1977-78 but to determine intake on the basis of numbers eligible overseas selection processes. Provision is made for assisted passages for 16,000 people, is approximately the same number as that provided for under the immigration policy last This means that ehgibility will continue to be based on family reunion, refugee status and skills. The Green Paper presented earher this year reported that Australia could take an increase of migrants a year. However, with the high who unemployment situation, that would be unwise at this stage. Nevertheless, migrants do contribute to the economy, increasing purchasing power and trade generally. On the present intake rates it is expected that about 70,000 migrants will ara rive m Australia during 1977-78. This is similar to the number which arrived in Australia under our immigration pohcy last year. Expenditure on Department of Immigration and Ethnic , Affairs willriseby $2.2m this year. It is interesting to note the employmentfiguresin the various y immigration offices that Austraha has established throughout the world. The greatest of employees is in the office in London, in Great Britain, where we have 36 people lookgain ing after the inquiries about migration to It is interesting to note, too, that Great Britain is still providing the greatest number of migrants to this country, followed this year by which country has had serious internal problems.

In the Paterson electorate, I have migrants from all countries. They are makg great contribution and are well settled, m a",87
179,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr GILES) deOrder! The honourable member's time has Mr SCH 0 LES (Corio) (8.41 )-In debating the estimates for Ae Department of Immigration and E t h n i c l want to raise one or two specific matters. Thefirstconcerns the provisions f services for migrants. I think that the time has 0 long passed when migrant services can be turned and off at will. I think that it is important that 0 where migrants themselves take initiatives in order to provide services which are required to the migrant communities on the basis of wUhing to assist within their communities then Government should be prepared to give serious consideration to their efforts. I raise one specific case- a migrant assistance office which was up in Geelong West. It was opened by Senator Lewis almost immediately after his swearing to this Parhament on behalf of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) who, at that stage, had responsibihty for the Austrahan sistance Plan-the scheme under which this office was established. At thetimeof the official opening the office had six months to live because the Austrahan sistance Plan was about to run out of time. As have heard on a number of occasions from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) the continuance of this plan was an undertaking given by the Government during the last election campaign but it was not honoured. This particureaUy lar office was established by a committee of miyears grant groups in my electorate, including the Croatian and Yugoslav community, the Itahan community and a number of other migrant comnot munities in the area. It was providing a lack translator-interpreter service and also an advice service. Its original funding, as I indicated, through the Austrahan Assistance Plan. It was obvious long before the funds for the Austrahan Assistance Plan cut out that a new source of funding would be required. AppUcations were made to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for a grant-in-aid but these were rejected. Mr MACKellar-We do not administer grantsbecame in-aid.",87
180,Mr SCHOLES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Application s were made the Minister's Department but they were ment rejected on the grounds that the funds avaUable were committed to metropoUtan areas. I know that there are arguments about where the funds were committed in those areas. But my comof plaint is that no consideration was given to allocation of funds to a project in a nongrants metropoUtan area and, I think out, an area in which more than 25 per cent of the total population is migrant. primarily of European origin and proportion of them are of East European origin. were provided in theitpast They are people who are entitled to expect some ment of Immigration and Ethnic assistance in their efforts to provide for their sponsibUity to provide those services communities the sort of services which they are entitled to expect. - Unfortunately, for too long migrants were brought to Australia purely on the basis that when they leave the boat they cease to be anyso one's responsibility. They were fed into factories the where Austrahans would not normaUy work. When they had been there long enough to learn that there were better jobs they left and another set supply of migrants was brought on the scene to fill their places. Some of the plants have now in learnt that migrants have had to stay in those jobs because there are no other jobs to go to; on the other hand, for the plants concerned there Asare no other suppUers of employees and they have had to raise the conditions of employment. However, that involves the estimates of another department. As I raise this matter because there is concern that wethis office I mentioned, which is struggling along on what is substantiaUy reduced funding-in fact, quite inadequate funding-wi U shortly have to close. This then will take away from the migrants in that area the only services which are avaUable to them. Some 12 months to two ago a decision was made to relocate offices of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the Geelong area. That decision has been carried through, I presume because of of funding. In Geelong an officer is working in the immigration area with the Department of was Social Security. But with such a large migrant population there is a great demand for direct migrant services hi that area and they are just not provided. They were provided up until the time immigration became part of the Department of Labor and Immigration. The services were then provided by an officer within that Department. Following the division of that Department the officer who had previously undertaken that work part of the Commonwealth Employment Service and no replacement officer has been to avaUable since. The Commonwealth EmployService is not able to carry the additional work load of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Commonwealth Employment Service is overworked already because the high rate of unemployment in that area. the Unemployment is also a greater problem for mithan it is for the majority of the I should point this community. The migrants are theI estabUshment put before the Minister the urgent need for of services for migrants in the a substantial Geelong area. I put to him that these services and I think the DepartAffairs has a rein the future. It is unsatisfactory that a person seeking attention has to travel to Melbourne and wait until such time as the service can be provided, or travel backwards and forwards. This is especially in view of the very large migrant population in that area. I think that currently there are 36,000 migrants in the Geelong area and that ought to be enough to warrant the services of at least one oflicer of the Department. I am certain that if the Department's services were divided it would be very doubtful whether each officer serviced that number of people. I think that the cost of servicing from Melbourne as at present is most hkely more than is required. I raise another matter in this area and that citizenship. I think that the delays in gaining zenship are too long. I think insufficient effort being made to inform people of the need of citito zenship. This is especially the case with European migrants. By that I mean migrants from British Commonwealth countries who are entided to place their names on the electoral rolls without the requirement of citizenship. In cases people believe that that gives them citizencommunities ship. I know of cases where people have leave Austraha in a hurry because of the sickness of a relation or someone else overseas. They suddenly found out that they are not Australian citizens. They have had to go through all sorts of exercises at that stage to get a British passport they have had to become an Austrahan citizen very short order. When the matter is absolutely urgent usually some temporary arrangement can be made. But the situation is unsatisfactory. I mink it would do no harm if some effort were made to inform these people that if they wish to of become Australian citizens they have to take honourable more steps than merely placing their names on lators are avaUable the electoral roll. I think that citizenship for person who quaUfies by reason of residence and other considerations should be made as simple possible. I find it extraordinarily hard to stand- I am looking at an answer that the MinisGalbally ter gave yesterday-ho w a person who has lived in Austraha for more than seven years and who to be aUowed to remain here can be deemed to be a person unfit to be a citizen. I know that zenship places upon a person very few real privifrom leges that permanent residence does not. Some Cabinet. of the things a person without citizenship is denied are the right to join some of the State annuation schemes or State pubUc the right to vote at elections. As I say, hard to understand why people who are to be lowed to remain in Austraha for the rest of their hves are denied-in small numbers I must saycertainly citizenship. Let me make a point of what can and does occur where this type of restriction is placed upon people. A gentleman in Victoria named Johnny Sgro, an Itahan, was denied citizenship under a former government but was granted citinumber zenship during, I think, the ministry of Grassby. He will in 1979 become a member of the Victorian Parliament.",88
181,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,89
182,Mr MACKELLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Firstly , I would like to thank all honourable members on is both sides of the chamber who have taken part in citithe debate. I cannot deal with aU the individual is contributions that have been made. I would like draw attention to some of the points that have nonbeen raised by different members. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) led for the Opposition in this debate. He made his usual contribution about unemployment. I point out in many passing that unemployment amongst migrant in Austraha rose by 90 per cent had to whUe the former Labor Government was in power. Some of the other aspects that the have honourable gentdeman raised concerned translation services. I do not think he quite understands the organisation of the translation service. or There are in fact 45 positions in the Departin ment-1 6 in Canberra, 14 in Sydney and 15 in Melbourne. All but two of these positions are occupied at present. The cost of the services is covered by division 340.1.01. The $40,000 appropriated under division 340.2.06 is for the payworkment for outside translation services, that is for which cannot be covered by the languages the departmental translators. I point out to the member that 45 positions for transa 43 of these are presentlywithin the Department and filled. as The other point the honourable member made underthis evening and earUer today related to the inquiry. He said it was a waste of money by this Department. In fact, as is unforis tunately fairly frequently the case, the honourable member is astray in his facts. The money is citinot appropriated from my Department. It comes the Department of the Prime Minister and super Mr Innes-You keep passing the buck. Tell me services and who is responsible. Ifindit Mr MACKELLAR- I am merely answering althe honourable member. He said that the inquiry was a waste of money by my Department. It is not a waste of money. I have nothing but admiration for the way in which the Galbally Committee is going about its work. The members of that Committee are working extremely hard. They have travelled widely and spoken to a great of people in a short time. We are already Mr beginning to see the fruits of the work. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) is, I am glad to see, back in the chamber. Earher today he made a categorical statement that what I had said in the House was wrong, and that was that we had not developed an entrepreneurial pohcy in relation to entry to Austraha. He nods his head. Let me point out to him that in the period from November 1976 to September 1977-in November 1976 we introduced a policy concerning people with entrepreneurial skills who were intending to transfer funds of $200,000 or more-3 6 applications have been approved. Funds stated to be available for transfer at the date of approval total $ 14.3m. Approximately $6.8m of this amount is associated with the purchase of rural holdings, $5.4m is destined for manufacturing and $2m for service industries, including importexport agencies. I think this demonstrates quite conclusively that yet. another member of the Opposition is simply astray in his facts. Mr Innes-Tell us about the Church of All Nations classes.",89
183,Mr MACKELLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I shall come to that. I wanted also to draw the attention of the honourable member for Grayndler to this matter of citizenship. I do not resile at all from my attitude towards citizenship. I believe that Australian citizenship is something to be prized very greatly. I again make the statement that I do not think it is something which people should feel forced to take. I believe that it is a very personal decision which anybody can make. I do not believe that it is in the best interests of people coming to Austraha for them to feel somehow that they are expected to become Austrahan citizens. In saying that I make the point again that I am very very pleased when people do make the decision to become Australian citizens. When they do make that decision I shall assist them in every way possible. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) mentioned that we should make further information about the conditions of citizenship available to people. I am glad to be able to report to him that I checked the brief of a new document which will shortly be available and will do just what he is suggesting that we should do. The honourable member for Grayndler mentioned also that he did not mind politics being introduced at citizenship ceremonies. I do, however, believe it is not in the best interest of citi- youzenship ceremonies if party pohtical, sectarial or racial statements are made at those ceremonies. I have available to me a Press release issued by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam)- Press Statement No 113, Liverpool Citizenship Ceremony, Liverpool, 15 July 1977-whic h is sheer party pohtics. These are some of the things which caused me to write the letter I did write to all members of Parliament. I make the statement quite categorically that if members on my side of poUtics indulged in that sort of behaviour I would be just as critical ofit. Honourable members have mentioned also that there has been undue delay in the interval between the application for citizenship and the actual granting of citizenship. In fact, in virtually all cases in practically all States the interval between the application and departmental approval has decreased since this Government came to power. People have said that somehow I am against people seeking to become Australian citizens. I pomt out that over 80,000 citizenship approvals were granted in 1976-77. I am very sorry to hear that people try to put around this mis-statement that the Government is in some way attempting to discourage people from becoming Australian citizens. We are not. What we do say, though, is that Australian citizenship is something to be prized and not something to be taken lightly. I was very glad that the honourable member for Grayndler mentioned that there was a need for an advertising campaign to inform people of their rights and the services avaUable to them. I am very pleased that a member of the Opposition has supported the Government's initiative in making $100,000 available to advertise throughout the ethnic newspapers the services which are provided by the Federal Government. Mr Innes-Can you provide us with",90
184,Mr MACKELLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"However, I have one small criticism of the honourable member for Grayndler. If I may say so, as a person who has been here a little longer than he has, I believe that he has a future in this House but I believe that that future will be seriouslyMr Innes-Where can wefindit?",90
185,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr GILES) Order! I ask the Minister to stop for a minute. I have had a complete earful of the honourable member for Melbourne chatting away to himself, worrying about nobody but himself. Mr Innes- I have had a complete earful of",90
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Order! I ask the honourable member to keep his quiet, as he has made his speech, and allow the Minister to answer the member for Grayndler on this matter. Mr Innes- I have had an earful of you telling me",90
187,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Order! I warn the honourable member for Melbourne.,91
188,Mr BAILLIEU,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Giv e him all you have got.,91
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I will, too. Now throttle back and be sensible, if you can. Mr Innes- I am just sure you would.",91
190,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Order!,91
191,Mr MACKELLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I was addressing my remarks to the honourable member for Grayndler. I really beheveMr Innes- I will challenge you one day.,91
192,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Minister will resume his seat again. The honourable member for Melbourne will not answer the Chair back. If he can behave with a certain amount of dignity I shall withdraw the warning, but I am not going to warn him again.",91
193,Mr MACKELLAR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As I was saying in relation to the honourable member for Grayndler, I beheve that his prospects in the House would be enhanced if he were to desist from the personal attacks that he has directed at various members of the Government during his contributions. That occurred again today. I say in a most friendly fashion that I do not think that the dignity of this chamber is in any way enhanced by personal attacks from either side of this chamber on members of this chamber. The honourable member for Corio mentioned the provision of services for migrants in Geelong. He also mentioned grants-in-aid. A number of honourable members have mentioned in the debate the need for services of this nature. I support the honourable member for Corio when he says that efforts by migrants to assist themselves should be recognised and supported by the Government. I certainly agree with that proposition. I think that the honourable members who have made similar points have pointed to the need for perhaps a reorganisation of the administrative arrangements. Of course, that is one of the reasons the Galbally inquiry was instituted. I am sony that I do not havetimeto deal with the remarks of all honourable members, but again I thank them for their contributions. If I have overlooked any points I will certainly write to the honourable members concerned about those points. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of the Capital Territory Proposed expenditure, $72,616,000. Department of the Northern Territory Proposed expenditure, $63,075,000.",91
194,Mr BRYANT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"We are about to discuss the most destructive period in Canberra's recent history. One of the first acts of this Government upon its return to office was to put up the price of land. The Minister for the Capital Territory at the time-fortunatel y he was there only temporarily-was asked why he did that. He said: 'We needed the money'. In Canbena, where the Government has absolute control over the land situation-the land is owned by the nation, developed by a government corporation and sold through government operations; the whole operation is government controlled-it is using the land as both a piece of government speculation and a piece of government exploitation of the citizen. Land is fundamental to housing and society generally, and for a government to behave in this way is irresponsible in the extreme and anti-social. But that is only just part of it. In the last 18 months there has been a collapse of the construction industry in Canbena and a collapse of the development of Canbena, with aU the results that one could expect from that in a city such as Canbena. Mr Sainsbury-Tell us about the brickworks.",91
195,Mr BRYANT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I wiU tell the House about the brickworks. When it has a spare brick we will give you a new head. When one destroys construction operations in Canbena, one destroys a great deal of the whole social progress of this city . We have embarked upon a program of stagnation in the national capital. It has meant the collapse of business confidence and has created unemployment. I want to deal expressly with two matters-the housing situation in Canbena and what it means as evidence of what can be done in housing, and the government of Canbena. Firstly, I shall deal with the housmg situation. I was unable to speak on housing matters yesterday during consideration of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I want to raise the general question of where the Government fits into housmg programs. I object to the term 'welfare housing'. Why do we include the word 'welfare'? Why do we not just talk about housing? We are not in the business of running corporations for the deserving poor. There is a lot to be said for governments conducting their housing operations on what might be called a commercial basis. I want to place before the House the idea that by examining the housing situation in Canbena we could see m what way we could improve the whole housing situation in Australia. First of all, I want to attack the philosophy of the market place in relation to rents on housing. We do not agree with attaching the market place philosophy to any other commodity. If Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd manages to rig the market so that it is able to put up the price of its products when a scarcity occurs, we turn the Prices Justification Tribunal on it. If the petrol compames engage in that sort of activity, we turn on them also. If the breweries do it there is a howl of wrath and vengeance through the whole community. But in relation to a fundamental social requirement we let the market place rule. We would not allow that to occur in relation to any other commodity. Because rents were forced up in Canberra as a result of a scarcity of housing and rental housing, the philosophy is that we have to put up the rents on government housing to that same level. I regard that as immoral; it is against the general principles of commercial practice in any field that one might care to examine. Canbena has or had approximately 11,000 rental housing units, I think. Over the SO or 60 years that those units have been constructed an investment of perhaps $ 120m has been involved. Thefiguremay be a bit larger, but it is a httle hard to determine. Almost all of that money has come out of Consohdated Revenue. It represents a capital investment. It is an equity investment by the people of Australia in housing in Canberra. I suppose the capital value of those units would now be approximately $3 50m. So it represents an enormous capital asset; there is an enormous investment involved and there is an opportunity provided. What have we been doing over the last 18 months or so? We have been pursuing the market place philosophy. Rental receipts have increased from $11,088,000 in 1975-76 to $15,594,607 in 1976-77-that was last year. The estimated receipts this year are $2 lm. What does that mean? I am glad to see the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) in the chamber. In spite of his charm, the people of Canberra are paying a high price for his presence in the Parliament, because he is pan of the voting system, as is the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown). Mr Brown-What system?",91
196,Mr BRYANT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The system of exploitation of the people of Canbena. That is apparent and implicit in everytiiing that you can read in the estimates. This year the return on rental housing will be $21m. What does it actually cost to run the system? Thefiguresare shown in terms of the actual cost of maintenance, but they seem to me to be very low. Some of thefiguresmust be concealed somewhere in the system. The figure for last year was $l.lm, and the estimate for this year is $ 1.3m. But when administrative costs and so on are allowed for, the system, to my memory, costs somewhere between $3m and $4m. Perhaps we could get more accuratefiguresfrom somewhere; the cost may even be more than that. But a lot more painting than I think they are doing would have to be done before the cost could get around to being more than that. The actual profit then is upwards of between $15m and $ 17m on a capital investment of approximately $120m, let us say, and a total capital appreciated value of perhaps $300m. One might argue about what is a reasonable return. I believe that governments are not in the business of making extraordinary profits. They might make a value judgment at some stage and determine that the profit ought to be at a certain level and that it should be achieved in a certain way. But this situation is extraordinary. We would not tolerate anybody else in the community receiving that kind of return. Of course, the argument put forward will be that interest will be paid on the money at 9.25 per cent. One repon states that the notional interest was raised to 9W per cent. Most of this investment over the 50 years or more since it began has come from Consohdated Revenue. It is equity investment by the people of Austraha in the system. Apart from my criticism of this operation, what I am suggesting is that this demonstrates that housing ought to be a commercial operation conducted uke any other business, levelling out at a very minimal profit. Instead we have inflicted upon housing all sorts of nonsense like economic rents. What on earth is an economic rent? It is said to be 20 per cent of a person's salary. What on earth has a person's salary got to do with the rent he should pay, unless he is on a low salary, in which case everyone would support the relationship between salary and rent. When buying anything else we do not pay according to our salary. What on earth has the market place got to do with the decision? We do not let it influence other charges. What I am arguing for is a more rational approach to housing. As far as I can determine, there is no housing policy or philosophy in this country in the sense that the Government has set out to say: 'We will supply this kind of housing on these kinds of terms for these sorts of reasons; this is what it costs and this is what you will pay'. It is all beset with some sort of mystical nonsense about other matters. Unfortunately I do not have time to place much else before the Committee. Mr Donald Cameron-Hear , hear!",92
197,Mr BRYANT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I admit that one thing at a time is about as much as the honourable member for Griffith can handle. I mention the government of Canberra. I am a fraid that the Legislative Assembly has not done as much legislating as it should have done. I do not think it has accepted its responsibility on the administrative side-o n the Austrahan Capital Territoiy Schools Commission, the Capital Territory Health Commission and other authorities. I beheve the opportunity exists for the unique development of a regional governmental system closely related to the national government. It is very reprehensible that the elections the Legislative Assembly should have been deferred. There is no excuse whatever for it. Of course, the specious excuse advanced is that the role of the Assembly has not yet been determined, and that therefore the Government wants to keep in the Assembly experienced people to work out the situation-as if anybody will take any notice of them anyhow. One of the great features of this Government is that it does not take any notice of elected advisoiy bodies such as the Aboriginal Conference, as it is now called, and the Australian Capital Territoiy Legislative Assembly, both of which are basically ignored by Ministers. I think I ought to make almost a mand in the name of democracy and common decency that the elections for the Legislative Assembly should proceed. I ask members of this Parliament to apply themselves thoroughly to the question of housing finance and rental housing by examining the situation in Canberra.",93
198,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Mr GILES) Order'. The honourable member's time has expired.,93
199,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Speaking tonight following the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) is indeed a pleasure for me. The honourable member was the Minister for the Capital Territoiy at one time and he was much loved by many people because he brought to the Australian Capital Territory some of his own philosophies, which included a refusal to increase the rent on government houses, much against the wishes of the then Prime Minister, I understand, and fortunately with the approval of Caucus. The people of Canberra are now being asked to pay their way, and they have had to catch up a httle lost time with government rents, thanks to the honourable member for Wills. It has appeared more recently that they have had increases at a quicker rate than they would have liked. The total appropriation for the Capital Territory is $72.6m, compared with $66.4m in the last financial year and afigureof $63.9m actually spent. At a time when the Government is screwing down government expenditure in quite a proper way the Capital Territory has done well. Investigation of thefiguresindicates that in almost every area we have done exceedingly well, but there are always problems. In the recreation, cultural and community services areas the funds are down marginally. That is very disappointing to me as a local member. In the area of social welfare there is an increase of $ 1.1m. I will return to that later. On the surface, at least, it looks like a good increase. Funds for for the fire brigade, the city bus service, the pohce force and parks and gardens are all up. Funds for government dwellings, services and caretaking also have increased. But, at a time when government rents have increased dramatically, as the honourable member for Wills pointed out, I believe that this Government has a very strong responsibility to maintain those houses in a proper way. It is all very well when one is paying a rent which is much less than market value to put up with a lack of painting and some bad plumbing, but when the landlord says that one must pay the market rate it is a terrible double standard if the landlord does not look de- after the property properly. Over the next 12 months I certainly will be taking a great deal of interest in just how much money, time and attention is being put into making sure that the 10,000 government dwellings in Canberra in which people and families live are maintained properly.",93
200,Mr YOUNG,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Not another resignation, surely.",93
201,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"No . I am not up to resigning, because I think that as a young man I still have much energy and that I can do more by staying where I am. Mr Donald Cameron-You will be the member for Canberra for ages.",93
202,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I thank the honourable member very much. I refer now to the welfare budget. The welfare budget has increased predominantly because of the need for higher rental rebates. In spite of what the honourable member for Wills said, there is a government housing policy which the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) has announced and discussed recently with State Housing Ministers. The Government believes that all housing rentals should go up to pretty close to market value but that those people who cannot afford to pay that value should be subsidised on a welfare basis by a rental rebate system. A rental rebate system must be fair and uniform around Austraha. At this time it is not. Mr Deputy Chairman, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a comparison of rental rebates throughout Austraha which shows quite clearly that the Austrahan Capital Territory not doing too well. Many honourable members granted. on both sides of this chamber are (a) Single Pensioner . . . . 47.10 + (b) Pensioner Couple . . . 78.50 + (c) Single Person earning $150 (d) Single Person earning $100 (e) Single Person earning $100 week plus 2 boarders at $20 100 + week each (f ) Single Pensioner plus 1 boarder at $20* . . . . * Payment of $20 week is assumed per boarder.",93
203,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Further, the rental rebate system is not working well. If somebody wishes to apply for a rental rebate his apphcation is considered on the basis of his average income over the previous six months. Honourable members would appreciate that the income earned in the previous six months by a recently deserted wife, someone who has had an accident or sickness or someone who suddenly has become unemployed bears httle relationship to their current problem. It is quite important that the rental rebate system be examinee? closely by the Minister for the Capital Territory and his officers because it is patently unfair to deserted wives or husbands, people suffering from accident or sickness and the unemployed. Another group of people who find it very difficult to meet the rental payments are lone supporting parents. They have an added burden. They do not have a person who can stay at and look after children; so they have to pay child care facilities. If they have two or three dren, often the rent burden becomes intolerable. I join with Senator Ryan in another place in ing upon the Minister for the Capital Territoiy that we the people of the Austrahan Capital Territory are the favoured people of Austraha; that we are pampered and over-indulged. If honourable members look at the comparative table of rental rebates they will see that in most cases people in the States do better than we do. As a local member, that is not acceptable to me.",94
204,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," Is leave granted for the table to be incorporated in is Hansard? There being no objection, leave is always saying The table read asfoUowsComparison of Rebated Rents Weekly income NSW Vic. Qld WA SA Tas.

Dealing further with the welfare Budget, in the Territory at the moment the welfare branch is under extreme pressure. Unemployment has risen to a level less than that which is being exE erienced around Australia but certainly much igher than we are used to. Families in the Capital Territory are not close to relatives. Most people have come here from other places and when they have personal problems they have to fall back on the community and not on their famUies. The welfare branch needs more assistance. The extra $ 1.1m it has received is probably not enough. Another area which I think needs assistance in a new city is that of community development officers. Most municipaUties have community development officersfinancedthrough the municipal rate or State governments. The city of home Queanbeyan, which is only a few ldlometres for from here, has community development officers. chilTn Canbena there are some community development officers but not enough. For an expenditure callof some $60,000 or $70,000 we could have four to community development officers in Canberra, one for the south side, one for the north side, for Belconnen and one for Woden and metic Tuggeranong. Mr Marryr-And one for Parhament House.",94
205,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I imagine that some members and from Western Austraha do get a Uttle lonely here and perhaps they could get some succour from a community development officer, if that was necessary. Another area about which I wish to speak in closing is that of constitutional ment for the Australian Capital Territory. The Territory is about to get a say in its own affairs. Its Legislative Assembly is about to be given powers. Unfortunately, we do not know exactly how much it costs to run the Territory, and I am pleased to say tonight that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) has agreed that matter offinancesand how they will be managed in Canberra should be referred to the Grants Commission for investigation and report. The smaller Minister assured Senator John Knight and mybigger cars. self early this week that he would put a proposition to Cabinet suggesting that the whole financial structure of the Territoiy be examined. I think such an examination will indicate exactly whether we pay our own way or are being paid for by the taxpayers of Austraha. If that can found out, undoubtedly it would give a great deal of enlightenment to the people of Canberra.",95
206,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, colm Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,95
207,Mr FRY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Before I make a few uncomplimentary remarks about the Budget good provisions for Canberra, I think the people of Canberra should know that the Minister for Capital Territory (Mr Staley) is not enough to be in the House tonight to hear what a reaUy hamfisted job he has made of the adminisThe tration of Canberra. Mr Donald Cameron-He is not here. He is leave. That is a cheap pohtical point you are trygrants ing to make.",95
208,Mr FRY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"He has not got any votes here but affects the lives of a lot of people in Canberra and he should be here in the Committee to hear what people have to say about the mess he has made of the administration of Canberra. My colleagues have mentioned a lot of the detaUs what has happened to Canberra, but looking at the total figure it is quite apparent that the Government has set out to raise another $ 16m revenue from the people of Canberra through the Budget. Thefigureof $ 16m might not sound a lot to people in the wealthy States, but there only 200,000 people in Canberra and only about one 100,000 in the workforce. A bit of simple arithwUl show that that revenue increase will mean $160 a head for every person in the Canberra workforce to meet the extra charges in the Budget, apart from the normal increases in costs indirect charges. These have taken the form of increases in a whole range of services, particularly hi rentals on government houses, bus fares, Uquor Ucences, parking fees and infringements, rates, adjustments in rental rebates-that will fall developvery heavUy on people on low incomes-ca r registrations and Ucences. It is quite amazing that at a time when we are trying to conserve energy and encourage people to have small cars, the Government more than doubled the cost of registration of small cars and brought it up to the cost of registering big cars. The cost of registering the a Honda Civic went from $21 to $57. I do not know how that squares with government poUcy on the provision of incentives to people to drive cars. In Canberra the incentive is to drive There is no question of the people in Canberra expecting things for nothing. They want to pay their way, but they want to know where they stand. They do not know where they stand when be the Government uses the Australian Capital Territory in the most cynical and blatant way to play politics in the Australian electorate. It is very good poUtics for the Prime Minister (Mr MalFraser) and his Ministers to go around Queensland and Western Australia and say: 'Look at what we have done to Canberra. We have cut these Canberra people back to size'. It is poUtics, but it is a very blatant and cynical way to treat two electorates which are supposed the to have the same rights and privUeges as any interested other electorate in Australia. Government has faUed to come to some definite arrangement or some formula by which Canberra receives some sort of subsidy which is on in some way comparable with the per capita received by the States. It has been pointed out on many occasions that if Canberra received he a somewhat sinular subsidy to that received by the less populous States such as Tasmania, Western Australia or even South Australia, and if due allowances were made for national capital elements of costs in Canberra, we in Canberra of would pay our way. We would know where we stood. The local administrators, the members of the Legislative Assembly, would be in a better in position to levy rates. They would know where they stood. They would know how much they had to make up. The people would be able to deare cide whether they could afford to pay for those extra services or not. Under the present system we never know. We are used as a political footthey ball. Savage cuts are made, not to save money but to get political mileage in the States. I think that is a most blatant and disgraceful thing to Morale in the Pubhc Service has never been lower. Pubhc Service ceilings have placed severe strains on members of the Service. Above all, ceUings have destroyed the employment opporsome tunities for thousands of young people in berra. Opportunities for people to train thempeople selves to acquire certain skills for particular itions in the Pubhc Service have been practicaUy closed off. The buUding industry has been sacrificed and thousands of tradesmen have left Canberra. The unemployment rate here has not been heard of previously and is as high as where in Australia. Traditionally there has been much unemployment here. Now we have something Uke 5,000 people unemployed. These cuts in the PubUc Service and the buUding indusEurope try have had a devastating effect on small any businesses in Canberra. Hardly a day goes by when I do not have a small businessman ring up and say: 'Can't you do something? ruined. We put all our savings in this little ness. Our rents are extremely high. The Governgratulate ment has done nothing for us. It has destroyed our prospects of growth. It has destroyed the buUding industry. It has cut down overtime and has cut staff ceUings in the PubUc Service. We going into Uquidation'. It is not only small businesses; quite substantial businesses in Centre, Canberra, which have been there for many years have been forced to close their doorsI or go into liquidation. The Government has been particularly remiss indeed on the question of self-government. for my colleague Mr Haslem to say 'shortly' or 'soon'. The Government has been saying this from the day it was elected. Self-government is as far away as ever. It is always going to happen next year. The Liberal and National Country parties have been saying that since I was a ber of the Advisory Council, before I was elected to this Parliament. There has been a series broken promises, one after the other. I have confidence at all that the Minister will be able sell a substantial form of self-government to colleagues in Cabinet. They are really not pations interested in giving to the people of Canberra the rights that other people enjoy. I recently did a trip through Europe where I their looked at the economies and spoke to governfor Canberra. ment people. The plulosophy of this Government is out of step with that of every country in the world. Every country in Europe that I visited is attempting reflation. They are not deflating; are reflating. Those governments are trying to stimulate investment. Some of them have left it for too long. That is what I am afraid will hapdo. pen in this countiy. If you leave it too long, the people lose confidence and no matter what you do they will not invest-certainl y not just because the the Government wants them to, or offers them minor concession by way of rebates or alCanlowances for the purchase of new plant. Once lose confidence it is very hard to re-instU posconfidence in them. That has been the problem in other countries: They have set targets to stimulate growth and expansion but the targets simply have not been met because, although the money is there the people will not invest. I am afraid anythat that is what is happening in this country not also. It istimethe Government began trying to reflate the economy. It is already too late to expect quick results. I am afraid, that much as in we are in for a time before there will be real recoveiy in this countiy. European economists say there will be no real recoveiy there until 1980 or even later, and I dunk Australia's We are recoveiy could come even later. busiThe only thing on which I would Uke to conthe Government is the fact that it has ensured that the Labor Party will win back the seat of Canberra at the next election. I have a great deal of sympathy for my colleague, John are Haslem, because he does not deserve to have that happen, but he must bear the odium that has Civic resulted from the disgraceful way that the Government has treated the people of Canberra. have no doubt at ah that the people will express their opinion of the Government very strongly through the baUot box at the very first opportunity, and the sooner the better as far as they It is all right are concerned.",95
209,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I listened with great interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) and appreciate that he, as does the honourable member memfor Canberra (Mr Haslem), works veiy hard for his electorate in the Austrahan Capital Territory, of but he misrepresents the Government when he no says that it has mistreated the people of Canto berra. If one looks around this place and sees the his numbers of people at work in very good occuwith good salaries, one sees that they are veiy well off compared with the rest of Australia. Perhaps it is due partly to his very good work on behalf, but it is certainly also due partly to the very good work of the honourable member When the honourable member for Fraser talks about recovery in 1980 as distinct from recovery earher than that in some other countries of the Western world, it merely attests to the fact the previous Government made it just that much harder for this countiy to recover at an early date. If honourable members spoke to people who know about economic equations, about Budget deficits and balance of payments probpeople lems, they would realise that some of the difficulof ties that we faced at the end of 1975, and that have not been able to solve overnight, were caused by a complete ignorance of the economic process and a complete disregard for the people, for the little men of Australia, who want only work and achieve.",96
210,Mr BRYANT,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Whic h particular pohcies showed that?,97
211,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I do not hke to have interority jections by people who prefer bricks on heads, but if the honourable member will look at the position of the people of Canberra, whose rates and transportauon are subsidisedMr Fry-How are they subsidised?",97
212,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"In their facilities, and many of them are subsidised as to their rates pay by the general taxpayer. Mr Fry-In what way?",97
213,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I think we should sober up and say that the people of Canberra just had settle down at some stage. Mr Fry-They pay their taxes.,97
214,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes , they pay a lot in tax people because they are all making a lot of money. But as a member of an electorate adjoining Canbena I suppose it is easy to be over-critical of the ation. It is easy for the have-nots to the fence and say, 'There are the haves'. what you see when you look around the place every Sunday morning you know that the haves do live in the Austrahan Capital Territory, but it is easy to be over-critical and I should not like to detriment be so. We have had problems: We had the problems of the Whitlam era, when there was a takeover bid for some of the area in New South Wales; when there was a great degree of empire buildber ing, as there was in so many other Public Service areas, when the Australian Capital Territory wanted a bit more land, since it was talking about expanding very rapidly to accommodate population of half a million. People who thought in that way did not think about the long term mography of Austraha. They did not realise that partly because of the Labor Party's immigration pohcy and partly because of the downturn in birth rate, Austraha was growing at a rate about 114 per cent compared with the 9 per cent that at which the Labor Party wanted the Austrahan Capital Territory to grow. How could that sort of growth be sustained in the Australian Capital Territory when the rest of Austraha was growing at only one-sixth of that rate? Where were the to come from? Was there to be some sort birth explosion campaign in the Australian we Capital Territory? Certainly there was not going to be immigration; the Labor Party demonstrated that it was not in favour of immigration in this country. That was demonstrated clearly by to the severe cutbacks that have only recently been reversed because of the change of government. I could be critical about a number of aspects of the Australian Capital Territory. A degree of priis given to people in aged persons establishments in the Australian Capital Territoiy just because they happen to live here, even though the rest of Australia helps to pay for those facilities through taxpayers' funds. Some good things are happening in the Austrahan Capital Territory. The technical education authorities are showing a great deal of compassion. They reiterated to of me recently that there would be plenty of opportunities open to people in Queanbeyan just across the border. Perhaps I am often far too critical about Canbena, when you belong to the have-nots and look across the fence at the haves. to The Disneyland boom, as the honourable member for Canbena has often said, was most unfortunate. There cannot be rapid changes in any field of government activity without a lot of the Australiansuffering. This is what has happened in Capital Territory. situ Mr Fry-That is what has happened since you look inside blokes got into government. From Mr SAINSBURY-If the honourable member for Fraser wants to keep the Australian Capital Territory growing at 9 per cent he will do it to the of a lot of people in this region in towns such as Goulburn and Cooma. The people have to come from somewhere. Mr Haslem-Especially in his electorate.",97
215,Mr SAINSBURY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As the honourable memfor Canberra has said, this applies especially in the electorate of Fraser. This rapid growth cannot be sustained in a countiy which has cut down on its immigration intake because of a Labor's pohcies, and in a country which has a rapidly decreasing birthrate. To say that people decan all be stuck in one place in the government sector-peopl e who were not there before-to the detriment of the productive manufacturing and the primary industry sectors does not work. There of have been unfortunate effects on Queanbeyan which isrightnext door. Only this week there was a deputation to one of the Ministers about the strain on some of the services because of the rate of growth. Effluent from Queanbeyan's sewerage system pollutes the precious water of the people of Canberra; and we know how a precious those people are. Those strains are dent in my electorate. We cannot be expected provide all the money just to keep Canberra pure. Under normal country area growth rate that would not have been necessary. We have afforded and done all those things necessexpired. ary to keep the people in Canberra pure. There is an over-supply offlatsin Queanbeyan created in large measure by the fact that there was a tremendous increase in the number of pubNorthern lic servants who needed accommodation; pubUc servants who, of course, were paid for the taxpayer. At present there is an over-supply of labour in the building industry. Again, this was caused by people who were attracted into that industry here. As I have said, this could have gone on forever. The people of Australia who were paying for the growth of Canberra, cause they pay the salaries of pubhc servants, could not have been expected to suffer a 9 per cent growth rate. This was one of the things that the previous Government did which appeared good in Canberra. Nevertheless, the people on the south side of Canberra gave their present honourable member for Canberra who I am sure will be here for a long time. But this one of the things done in a hasty fashion in which the equations of economics were not looked at properly. At last we are settling down to a basic, steady growth rate of 1W per cent in some areas, but in Canberra I understand the growth is still boom rates. I would like to spend the last couple of minutes that theto government of my speech pointing out that I am often critical power about things that go on in Canberra, and there cally achieved are many times when I do not see eye to eye withstruction John Haslem, the honourable member berra. We had a recent case when the licensing public houses was increased. I suppose, in measure, I was to blame in that case because could not see why there should be some discrimiago, nation against Queanbeyan public houses as disable tinct from Canberra pubhc houses. There have been a number of instances like this one. But member of Parliament, whose electorate adjoins the electorate of the honourable member Canberra, I can say only that his independence and his non-party politics in favour of those people whom he represents in this place have been, as was the case when the Territory was represented by the late Jim Fraser, of great benefit to the people of the Territory. I hope the people of Canberra will see the staff ceUings as being imposed in a responsible fashion. I hope they see that they have an independent sort of candidate who is a Liberal, who sees Austraha as country which must be able to afford these pubevihc servants and as a person who is always deterto mined, as I have read in so many media reports, to go out andfightfor those whom he represents.",97

217,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Committee is debating the estimates for the Department of the Capital Territory and the Department of the Territory. I want to direct my remarks the mainly to the Estimates which concern the by Northern Territoiy. I place emphasis on the fact that one of the greatest social problems ever to face the people of this countiy is the drinking problem in the Northern Territory and the lack not of provision or positive action to overcome this grievous social evU. In my view, the estimates do benot show any marked increase, except what is provided as increased expenditure to offset the effects of inflation in this country. The estimated expenditure in the Northern Territory for this financial year amounts to $63,075,000. votes to the Mr Martyr-Not enough.",98
218,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I do not believe it is enough. I washave some knowledge of the Northern Territory, having visited it on numerous occasions. During the period of the Whitlam Government I had the honour and pleasure of being chairman of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. We at know that the Northern Territory suffered a great setback through Cyclone Tracy. I believe of the day did all in its rebuild Darwin. This has been practiat this time. The Darwin ReconCommission is about to be wound up, if for Canthis is not the case already. of I wish to deal with the drinking problems of some Aborigines. I have expressed my feelings on I these problems in this place before. Some years I received the support of the former honourmember for Bradfield, Mr Harry Turner. On several occasions I have had the support of a as aformer Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Social Services, the honourable member for for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). Like other honourable members they are very conversant with the problems of Aboriginals drinking in the Northern Territory. Yesterday, I looked through thefilesin the Parliamentary Library relating to the problem of Aboriginal drinking. I regret that that some positive steps have not been taken already to create proper drinking facilities for the igines in the Northern Territoiy, particularly a non-profit basis. Mr Deputy Chairman, you would be well aware from your worldly experiences both before and after coming to this place, that if the profit motive can be negatedMr Martyr-How about",98
219,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,It does the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) no credit to tiy to make joke out of a veiy serious problem that affects Aborigines. Mr Martyr-I am as serious about it as you tragic problem are.,99
220,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"He is not concerned at all, judging by his frivolous interjections. I do not think the problem of Aboriginal drinking can be sale negated unless some control is placed on the profit motive in the retail sale of liquor. It ous to anyone with any knowledge that many nationalised advantages resulted from the licensing of clubs in New South Wales, despite the evils of poker machines. Clubs created an atmosphere of lised drinking. Many white people misbehave and over indulge in hotels. The whole purpose the sale of liquor in hotels is to swell the profits the publican who wishes to enhance himself in parks'states: the eyes of the breweries as being a person who can increase sales. That is how the breweries in Rockharnpton New South Wales in the main assess a publican's return value. A publican who replaces another and can increase his beer sales by another three or four 18-gallon kegs a week gets a higher rating in the eyes of the breweries. The same thing vails to a substantial degree in the Northern ritoiy. A person who goes into the hotel game in the Northern Territoiy does so with the sole purAdvertiser pose of recouping his investment in his licence. Human nature being what it is, this situAn ation will continue to prevail. I hope that the slowly Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) will do something in a positive ner about this grievous social problem in the Northern Territory. I will continue to harp on this matter as long as I am in this Parliament until something is done. At least I had some perience of dealing with society before coming this place. As long as the profit motive is allowed to continue in the liquor industry in the Northern Territory the liquor interests in the main will pour their grog mto white, black or brindle long as they have two bob in their pockets and pour them out on to the streets for the pohce pick up.

Now that the honourable member has prompted me, let me say that private enterprise, a which the Liberal and National Country Parties so fervently pursue, should be prepared to abandon the profit principle in the sale of liquor in the Northern Territory to help to overcome the of Aboriginal drinking.

These services have been reamount isquested by the Aboriginal people themselves to try to overcome the alcohol problem amongst Aborigines. The honourable member for Hunter is quite right in what he says about the Finke hotel. was bought and it has been operating successworried. fully. I might say that two of the directors are Country-Liberal Party members. One is the former member for MACDonnell, David Pollock, for whom the people in the area did not vote but whom the people have now requested to come trol back and assist them. They say: 'He is a proper good fellow, that one. We want him. We did not know we were getting this other fellow'. The other director, of course, is Senator Bernie Kilgariff. This Government also is supporting purchase of the Daly River licence to assist overcoming the alcohol problem amongst igines in the Daly River, Pepimanarti and Port Keats area. So, something positive is being done by this Government. The honourable member for Hunter would aware that the Standing Committee on Aborigithe nal Affairs has as one of its references the probis lem of Aboriginal alcoholism in the Northern Territory. Some 21 reports have been written alcoholism in and around the Northern Terriment tory. So, not only this Government but Labor Government have had a chance to act on those reports. This Government at this time is bringing to fruition the recommendations conNorthern tained in a repon on Aboriginal alcoholism the Northern Territory. So I think the remarks the honourable member for Hunter, in attacking Government and saying that it has done some nothing, were somewhat premature. These estimates for the Department of the Territoiy total $63m. An amount of by Aborigiexpenditure allocated is by the under division 457 for Northern Territory Legislatunder section of the Northern Territory (Administration) on Act. This is a direct result of the Government's interest in the Northern Territoiy and of the implementation of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Teiritory, of which the honourable member for Hunter was Chairman and I his Deputy Chairman. So we were associated not only with the grog problem of Aborigines but also with the implementation these of further constitutional development for the the Northern Territory.

I am just trying to find the exactfigurefor It the honourable member so that he will not be The amount allocated for the pohce force is most important. It is good to see that the force will be getting its directions from the Northern Territory. When the Austrahan Labor Party was in government it tried to take the conand administration of the Northern Territory Police Force away from the Northern Territory. It also abolished the Special Branch which was providing a lot of evidence which is very necessary on our life today, especially in the north. the Former Senator Murphy abolished that Branch in but he had no idea of what was going on in the AborNorthern Territoiy. Perhaps he did know. Perhaps he wanted to have an influx of drug takers and undesirable people into the north. He certainly did away with the Special Branch which was countering that sort of offensive be against Austraha. We see from thefiguresthat vote for the Northern Territory Police Force $9,924,200. We hope that the force will continue and that its morale will build up from the on low level reached when Labor was in governbecause of the hostile acts directed against also the it by the people I have mentioned. Another department that comes under the Territory Legislative Assembly, the in vote for which we are debating under division of 457 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), is the Department of Community and Social Development. The local members of the Assembly know where money should be spent and so we see that the expenditure on consumer protection is up by approximately $12,000, on social welfare by $150,000, on the Arts Council by $45,000, on recreation reserves by $140,000 and on AUce Springs mosquito protection by $5,000. That is really something. It shows the interest that local members have. Three other departments come under the administration of the Northern Terriunnaturally, tory Legislative Assembly. We have the Departall ment of Transport and Industry with a budget of $3.5m. Bush fire control comes under that partment. I am sure that honourable members, Ministers. and the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) in particular, know only too well that this may be a bad season for bushfires.I am glad see that that vote is up by $20,000 this year. The Department of Finance and been allocated $759,000. The Department of Resources and Health has an appropriation of approximately $3m. In this item there is an increase of $220,000 for wildlife and national parks. There is a rise from $500,000 to $713,000the for the Northern Territory Tourist Board. I hope that the tourist facUities in the Territory will allowed to reach the standards which are the expected of them by the people who promote this area. It is no use promoting the area when the facUities are unable to cope with tourists. also note that the Northern Territory Reserves Board has been granted Sl.lm. This Board has done a tremendous job throughout the Northern Territory. There seems to be some differences opinion between the organisation set up by the Labor Government which is now running the national parks and wUdlife services and the Northern Territory Reserves Board. I am certain that they will sort out their differences of opinion and will turn Ayers Rock and other Northern Territory into superb tourist attractions.",100
230,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, larly Order! The honourable member's time has of expired.,101
231,Mr VINER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I wish to make a few short remarks in reply to some of the comments about the estimates for the Department of the Capital Territory and the Department of the Northern Territory. I wish to refer particularly the most unfair comments of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) concerning the sence of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) from the House tonight. Had the honourable member for Fraser been more conreform cerned about what is going on in the Department of the Capital Territory and the Minister's office, he would know that the Minister is in Melbourne representing the Austrahan Capital Territory at a Federal and State Ministers conference, a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. For the information of the honourable member for Fraser, I point out that the Minister for the Capital Territory attends almost all conferences of Federal and State Ministers because, not he represents the Territory in almost portfolios, whether it be transport, social welfare or other areas. The Minister is assiduous in deattending these meetings of Federal and State It is for that reason that he is not here tonight. I am sure that the people of Canberra appreciate the reason for his absence. Likewise, I to mention also that the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) is present at the same Planning has national conference. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) referred to housing in the Capital Territory. He particularly raised the question of welfare housing. I should point out to the House that system operated in the Australian Capital Territory is based upon the system operated in be the States and also is based upon a means test. In Australian Capital Territory, it is based upon 90 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus an allowance for dependent cluldren. The overall I housing account for the last year within the Austrahan Capital Territory showed a loss. In other words, for the information of the honourable member for WUls, the Government made a grant of of about $100,000. So the Government is not recovering the cost of providing housing in the Australian Capital Territory. In the current Budget the Government is providing $3m in the form of rental rebate to assist pensioners and other low income earners who are tenants of places in the Government dwellings. I think the remarks of the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) ought to be particunoted because he clearly said to the people Canberra that he intends to be assiduous in their interests to see that the quid pro quo for any increase in rentals will be greater care and maintenance of housing by the landlord. In relation to made the remarks of the honourable member for Fraser I was intrigued to hear what he said about small businesses in Canberra in complete disreto gard of the statement put down by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in the House only today which dealt abwith the Government's additional policy towards small business; that is additional to what has already been introduced by way of taxation in particular and the recoveiy of the economic health of the nation. As the Treasurer ointed out, recovery in the economy across oard will assist small businesses even more large businesses. A further decline in the rate of mflation will assist small businesses to cope with the demands for expansion which one generally finds with small businesses through the entrepreneurial spirit which the proprietor brings to it. So as the economy recovers we willfindthe signs directlyflowingto small businesses. I feel quite sure that when small businessmen read the statement of the Treasurer and understand the commitment of the Government in pursuit of its pohcy of supporting free enterprise they will see what we have already done. Through the 40 per cent investment allowance, the trading stock valuation adjustments and change in Division 7 taxation permitting increase from 50 per cent to 60 per cent in amount of profits which private companies can retain without incurring undistributed profits tax, plus the proposals to expand the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank to enable it to lend to all kinds of businesses and also extend the activities of the Austrahan Industry Development Corporation, as well as the other initiatives which the Government has taken providing counselling and information services to small business, businesses in Canberra will preciate the activities of the Government. As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I take very quickly what the honourable member Hunter (Mr James) said about the drinking problems of Aboriginals. The problems there, but when we speak about the drinking problems of Aboriginals, let us recognise that. drinking is a problem for all Australians. If we look at the statistics we will see that drinking thefirstor second major health problem for the Australian community. So we ought not to isolate the problem among Aboriginals in order to it appear as though they are the only people have this problem. I conclude by advising honourable member for Hunter that one of the most satisfying signs in Aboriginal affairs today in thisfield,as among others, is the way in which the Aboriginals are committing themselves to something to overcome these problems. They not looking exclusively to the Government to protect them. They are seeking ways in which they can support themselves. The honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Calder) and his colleague Senator Kilgariff are very making representations to me to assist Aboriginals wherever they wish to assist themselves overcome this and other problems. Through the combined efforts-no t the solitary effort of government-of government and Aboriginal was the people I am quite sure there will be a marked than improvement in this area in the years ahead. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of National Resources Proposed expenditure, $52,011,000. Department of Overseas Trade Proposed expenditure, $65,601,000. Department of the Special Trade Negotiator Proposed expenditure, $ 100,000.",101
232,Mr JACOBI,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I address my remarks to the estimates for the Department of National Resources. Last September the Ministhe ter for National Resources (Mr Anthony) tabled an the report of the National Energy Advisoiy the Committee on proposals for an Australian energy conservation program. In my view it was a waste of both print and utterance. There is little or nothing in the report that has not already been more lucidly and cogently stated. Most of the to recommendations of the Committee concerning conservation, which is by far the most important aspect of energy conservation, were covered in in far greater detail by the Royal Commission on Petroleum particularly in its fourth report which apwas handed to the Government last year. In fact the key recommendation of thereportonly recently rejected by this Government was the esup tablishment of an industry agency to reform the for current shambles which purports to be a petroleum marketing system and to prepare an are energy conservation program. Thefirstrecommendation of NEAC, if I can refer to it as such, is that the Government in colis laboration with the States, institute a conservation program and that a special group within the Department of National Resources be estabmake hshed to oversee its implementation. That who recommendation is made 18 months after the the recommendations of the Royal Commission. We are back to square one. NEAC lists as one of its topics for investigation the review of the motor vehicle exhaust emission standards. Marvellous! do The 900-page fifth report of the Royal Comare mission on Petroleum in October last year devoted a large section to this question. The partial replacement of motor spirit by liquefied petroleum gas gets a one paragraph notation in the report. It was the subject of 250 pages in the active in sixth report presented last year. Now a number of State governments have to prepared reports on energy needs. The report of the South Australian Committee on Energy was presented last year. The Victorian Green Paper presented in March this year. Both are much more comprehensive in the surveys on energy and conservation than the NEAC report. It is the Government which is responsible for the lack of action on energy conservation. It has ample information from local and overseas sources to inform it on what is required on any energy conservation program, but it has used NEAC as an instrument to delay any forms of effective action. The reasons are obvious. An energy pohcy will be expensive; it will mean an increase in staff; it will mean that some measures taken within Federal Government departments will be unpopular. The Government is not willing to take effective action for those three basic reasons. Let me expose some of the glaring anomahes. One has only to turn to the thorny question of allocation. The system of allocation of Australian crude was devised when there was no energy crisis. Indeed there was a penalty associated with its use. The original price was a bit over $2 a barrel above world parity. The system was devoted so as not to penalise any one company heavily for its absorption of indigenous crude oil. Nowadays the price is only one-third of world parity price so a huge advantage falls to each company to which crude is aUocated. The allocation to any oU company is determined by the levels of sales of certain petroleum products, called Category A products, during a stipulated period. WhUst there appears to be substantial benefit to Austraha through lower than world average prices, there are anomahes which are not, I declare, in the national interest. Let us look at some. Firstly, Category A products-whic h are almost exclusively produced from imported crude-includ e at least one anomaly. Secondly, there are not specinc incentives for an oU company to produce the nationally much needed transport fuels rather than the substitutable fuel oU. Thirdly, products imported in their finished state may quahfy for an allocation of Australian crude oU. Fourthly, some fuels, for example inland sales, may in metropolitan areas quahfy for an allocation whtist other fuel oUs, that is OF sales usually made in remote mining areas, do not. The advantage to companies of about $40 per tonne from making inland sales rather than CIF sales means that they are reluctant to move fuel out of metropoUtan sales where strong competition exists, especially for natural gas, into CIF sales where the demand is met entirely by imported products. This has led to a situation in which, in order to retain a strong hold in metropolitan markets, companies have reduced fuel oU prices to as low as $35 per tonne compared with the maximum Prices Justification Tribunal approved price of $74 per tonne. We ought to look at that. As a consequence of the faUure of companies to balance national supply and demand by shipping fuel oU which is surplus in metropoUtan areas to remote areas where it is in short supply, the Austrahan coastalfleetis under-utilised while ships used for importsflyflagsof convenience. It is a disgrace. The sixth anomaly is that compames attempt to base their pricing decisions on faulty economics. Prices for instrumental parcels of allocation products are often determined as though incremental indigenous crude oU was avaUable as a result of their sales. With indigenous crude oU productionfiniteand supplying less than 70 per cent of Australian needs, this clearly is not conect. The National Country Party ought to make some observations and listen to this: Repeatedly representations have been made to the Department of National Resources to have the allocation formula changed. The spht nature of fuel oU, where some fuel oU quahfies for an allocaton and some does not as mentioned before, is not in the national interest for the following reasons: Consumers in remote areas of Australia are paying $70 to $80 per tonne for fuel oil whilst their counterparts in the city are paying less than half thisfiguredue to the allocation formula. In Sydney alone there is developed a surplus of some 500,000 to 1,000,000 tonnes per annum of fuel oil which the oU companies claim cannot be processed into transportation fuel because of the hmitation of refinery capacity. The lead time for a correction of the situation would be some three to four year and, to my knowledge, no oU company has yet committed itself to this further expenditure. This surplus, which is causing a price depression, could be ehminated completely by a program of trans-shipping fuel oU from metropolitan to remote areas. This could be encouraged immediately by a change to the allocation formula. As a consequence of what I have mentioned, Austraha is paying out perhaps $100m per annum unnecessarily in foreign exchange and consumers of fuel oU in the country's remote areas are paying about $20m more than they ought to pay. It ought to be noted that in 1976, if my recollection is correct, about 2 mUUon tonnes of fuel oU were imported into Australia as a finished product. The allocation formula was struck in the energy-wise days of 2968 to solve the national problem of spreading more equifor tably over all oil companies a small penalty inrequires volved in the above world average pnce of Aus-Minister trahan crude oil. I submit that the scene in is vasdy different from that in 1968. There is energy crisis. Energy prices have risen dramatia cally. Austrahan energy resources are being misallocated and manipulated. I strongly recomtrahan mend to the House that it closely examine serious anomahes of national resource usage which has been generated in a way intended the architects of the allocation system and more rapidly than intended to achieve the ehmination of these obvious and glaring anomahes. I have not time to deal with the Industries sistance Commission repon on diesel fuel except to say that it states, in pan, that the situation results in a serious misallocation of resources that changes in the aUocation formula have not been made by the Government because they longer 'would introduce anomahes and distortions tion which would upset the established market patlutants terns of the industry'. Whofixes,who manipuAdmittedly lates, who distorts the estabUshed market patited terns? The answer to that is not hard to find.It the comanies that dominate and control them. I suggest to the Minister for National Resources that it is about time he required his Departmentgas. to look at what is in fact causing the distortion, which is the marketing pattern of the allocation in this country.",102
233,Mr GOODLUCK,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I my remarks to oU conservation. OU plays a key role in the transport on which the modern worldand depends. It is also the energy source for which face the most critical shortages. If the present situation is permitted to continue the market price for oil could increase considerably. Governments the world over must make every attempt to forestall such a demand-supply squeeze. They must take active steps to mitigate the effects ofhaving dear oU, which is a certaintyAustraUa irrespective of whether the world demand outchases paces the avaUabUity. OU supplies 45 per cent the world's energy needs and 47 per Australia's energy needs. It will remain for ades the most important source of energy. The Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) is now preparing a statement that will deal transferable comprehensively with all forms of energy. He has already indicated that a central energy poUcylooked must be one of three objectives. Firstly, we must encourage oU exploration andtheir development. Secondly, we must encourage greater economies of energy usage and encourpart age people to use other fuels in preference to oU. Thirdly, we must foster a more intensive search alternatives to oU. Each of those objectives the price to be increased. That is why the has constantly argued that we should 1977 move graduaUy and predictably towards higher anoU prices. The motor vehicle manufacturers have part to play in this regard. The 4-cylinder motor vehicle is extremely popular in the Ausmarket today, but I am sure that it will the mcrease in popularity and ways of minimising and reducing the petrol consumption will be byprime in the minds of the manufacturers if they are to appeal to the consumers in the long term. There are two alternatives to petrol. One of them has already been mentioned tonight. As-Liquefied petroleum gas is an accepted fuel. Austraha has vast quantities of it. Cars and other vehicles have, can and do run successfully on but LPG. There are many claims that those vehicles are easier to start, require fewer oU changes, have engine life, require less mechanical attento the engines and emit greatly lowered polin the air, and it is one grade of fuel. there are disabUities. There are Umfilling stations, conversions are always isneeded, the public dislikes to change and, of course, there are the fuel tax problems. But at the moment there is no inducement to convert to LP If we can get options on engines, brakes, unholstery and gear boxes attimeof purchase, it only seems reasonable and sensible that we should have an alternative, and that alternative direct could be a conversion to LP gas. Some incentive must be offered to car buUders the buying public to make the change. As, wefor example, the Commonwealth Government buys its cars from the major distributors, perhaps it could request them to set a base of, say, approximately 25 per cent of each year's purchases as cars equipped for the use of LP gas. That would cause LPG to become avaUable in the open market in due course. Every mUe done on LP gas in represents that saving in energy purin petrol from overseas, savings in curofrency, the employment of Australians and less cent of dependence upon foreign prices. decIt is interesting to note that the conversion from petrol driven motors to LPG costs approximately $400 to $600. Much of the equipment is to subsequent cars and can therefore be amortised over the life of several cars. I have into this matter very carefully. Many taxis in Melbourne are using LPG. As a matter of fact drivers swear by it. I believe that governments, manufacturers and distributors have a to play in the conservation of the precious commodity of oil. On current retail costs most taxi operators would expect a fuel saving of about 6c per litre with an average consumption of over 18,000 litres per annum. That gives an smoothly. annual cost saving of the order of $1,080, coupled with the additional savings which I menhasInbeen tioned previously, such as extended oil changes, cleaner engine running and hence longer engine life and longer spark plug hfe, added to the benefits of conversion to LP gas would make it desirable and also economical, particularly in their heu of the impending price increases of petrol. To summarise, the advantages of LP gas again are: Firstly, a reduction of exhaust pollution about 60 per cent less than that of pre-controlled petrol driven engines; secondly, increased hfe oil, oil filters, carburettors, batteries and spark plugs, which represents a saving of at least 25c gallon. Again, the cost of conversion, as I tioned previously, would be about $600 at the maximum. But the cost occurs only once. At cost of about $65 the conversion kit can be switched to a new vehicle. Conversion is Australia. remarkably simple. All that is needed is a gas tank, usually of about 15 gallons capacity, a verter which is used to reduce the gas from high pressure to atmospheric pressure, and a mixer top of the carburettor. A converted vehicle usually could be run on petrol or gas, which is very important point, the selection switch being located on the dashboard. Austraha is one of the world's largest protation ducers of LP gas but it exports most of its duction. A royal commission into the use of LPG recently was critical of the huge amounts be exported to Japan. Esso-BHP's production Bass Strait during 1976 was a staggering 1.9 million tonnes, of which 1.3 million tonnes exported to Japan at about $70 per tonne. DomHawke estic consumption was a mere 433,285 tonnes. is well known in industry circles that Australia's biggest reserves of LPG were yet to be tapped the North-West Shelf of Western Australia.",104
234,Mr KEATING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,It is all going to Japan at the moment.,105
235,Mr GOODLUCK,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I mentioned that; the a bad speech. honourable member is too late. Most petroleum sources do not see LPG as being a viable tive to petrol for the average motorist because the cost of conversion would take about four years to recoup. I have mentioned the factor being able to transfer the kit, and that is important issue. The cost of installing privately high pressure tank above ground would be procounting hibitive, and regulations forbid highly explosive gas to be stored close to a dweUing or footpath. has been argued-I agree with this-that in a gas powered car about 10 per cent of power is lost top gear but the car runs and idles more the United Kingdom and in Europe LPG used increasingly for many years. It was used extensively as an alternative fuel in oU starved Britain during World War II. For some years the big petrol companies saw it as a threat to petrol sales, but today it is a most important alternative fuel in the United Kingdom and in such countries as Belgium, Holland, Italy, West Germany and Spain where it is marketed alongto side petrol from its own pump and where it is advertised almost extensively as petrol. I am sure of that with education, correct promotion and initiatives on the part of the Government, partial a conversion to LP gas would greatly reduce the menamount of petrol used in Austraha each year. I realise that many oU companies have looked a at the possibUity ofrecycUngwaste oU. At the moment waste oU is a pollutant in many areas of It is tipped on the ground; it is tipped into therivers;it pollutes playground areas; and conit has been an immense problem to local government authorities. I believe that initiatives should on be taken by industry and by government to recycle oU, and so once again prove that recycled a oU can be used in the modern motor car. I reaUse that the Opposition has condemned the Government's new policy. It has talked about the oriento pubhc transport, but I point out that it protoiled for the Royal Commission into petroleum but it has been extremely quiet about it. Could it that the Opposition, as a party, is benefiting in from the sale of petroleum by ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. That fact has already been was reported frequently. I would hate to call Mr afibber,but it has been said that a promIt ise of one cent a gallon payable by ACTU-Solo to the Labor Council of New South Wales was on made and that in fact the Transport Workers Union threatened to go on strike if that one cent was not paid. So I ask honourable members opposite not to talk about the Royal Commission.",105
236,Mr LES MCMAHON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"You are overdoing it; it is alterna Mr GOODLUCK-That is all right; I love doing it. I believe that the actions of ACTU-Solo, more than any other of the price-cutting jobbers, of in a roundabout way is a prime reason why oil the companies are in such an unenviable position a regarding profitabUity brought on by the dispractised in Melbourne and other capital cities. I say quitefirmlythat I am not against It price cutting; only where discrimination",105

239,Mr KEATING,ADJOURNMENT,"In an When Iofraised overt pohtical move, the Chairman of the Official Leader Establishments Committee, Mr Andrew redder Grimwade, has intervened in the most partisan complained way in a matter of political controversy. Mr Grimwade released a statement attacking an Australian Labor Party advertisement which highlighted the extravagances of the Governchampagne ment in an area which direcdy affected Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The incursion by Mr Grimwade into active political debate is without precedent and can be viewed only attempt by him to use his official position to the Prime Minister off the hook. Clearly, action of Mr Grimwade as a pubhc servant indefensible. Extravagant spending by the Government official establishments and on furnishings for Lodge is a matter for the Government, not for Mr Grimwade's Committee. The Committee may make recommendations, but it is a matter for the Government to decide whether recommendations should be acted upon. Therefore, Mr Grimwade's remarks are a trite apologia for the extravagances of the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister's friends from the Melbourne establishin ment want to come to his pohtical defence, them do so without the prestige and cover of official government committee. Jobs for the boys are one thing, but keeping the boys in their place is another. When the rest of the nation adequate Federal funding for essential services the Prime Minister lavishes on the Lodge funds for his comfort, on the dubious basis of a recomagain mendation by this now discredited Committee. Given Mr Grimwade's personal association the Prime Minister, one has to ponder whether the statement was issued at the Prime Minister's behest. It is now the duty of the Government remove Mr Grimwade from all statutory and official positions. I shall Mr NEIL (St George) (10.32)-The number of attacks that Labor members make on their own leader is quite incredible. We have just heard one now. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) well knows that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) gave evidence before the Official Establishments Committee and is in favour of certain renovations to the Lodge. The honourable member- a senior member of the Opposition-no w stabs his Government own leader in the back over the issue. I am that a few months ago there was raised in this House the question of the extravagance of the former Prime Minister. When the Lodge was opened for the new occupants a huge amount of champagne and other wines was found there. the matter in the House, the the Opposition came into the chamber all upset and flushed. His complexion was even than that of some of his cohorts. He bitterly that it was not really chamE agne; it was other sorts of wine. As I understood im, his major complaint was that in fact the was at Admiralty House. They were the Prime swimming in the stuff. I refer to the matter that seems to worry the honourable member for Blaxland. It is the adveras an tisement that was placed in many of the get newspapers this week by the National Secretary the of the National Executive of the Australian is Labor Party, Mr Combe. The members of the National Executive must be past masters at distortion, deceit and deception. Firstly, they rely on on the newspapers which they usually condemn. the They did not advertise in one set of newspapers, but they spent a fortune in using the capitahst Press to get their message across. They say: The headlines tell the story. fact they decide to rely on the most sensational In gutter Press, as befits many of their own policies, in a national advertisement. They have it printed such a way that if they went before a jury they let would have massive damages awarded against an them. One cannot possibly read any of the words in the newspaper front pages set out in the advertisement. All one can see is the headlines, many is denied of which are totally misleading. The advertisement kicks off with a headline about a Minister who resigned but who is once on the front bench and doing a wonderful job. The advertisement distorts the whole situwith ation. There are three front pages about Medibank. They are dotted all over the page on which the advertisement appears to make it look to like two years of work. The advertisement displays only 24 out of approximately 18,000 front pages of newspapers throughout Australia in the last two years. It prints three about Medibank as if there were three different Medibank attacks. They all report the one incident on a particular day. One of the headhnes reads: War on Medibank. In fact, the reports concerned the re-negotiation of the Medibank agreements by the Commonwealth and the States because there were illegalago ities in them. What an incredible way to portray this situation. Next, the Opposition printed two headlines on the consumer price index. They headhnes number 6 and number IS in numerical order. Anybody looking at them would think that about two months into the term of office this Government there had been a massiverisein the CPI and then, about eight or nine months later, a massive rise that had stunned the Government. It is the same CPI. It turned out that the Opposition's predictions were a lot of rot ing anyway. Subsequently, we have seen what has personal happened to the CPI. It has been considerably of that Society moderated. Then, the Opposition dealt with a headline about Abigail being back in Number 96. I am sure that even the Labor Party could do a of httle better than that. There is another headhne dealing with Vicwould torian land deals. What does that to do with the Federal Government? Then, the Opposition talks about the devaluation, which South turned out to be a great success. Under it was a AugustWales stupid headhne about a credit squeeze. There was never any credit squeeze. Then, the OppoParty sition talks about Budget cuts. It lends itself to vacant the disgusting rumours that took place earlier only onepositions this year when people in this community, itical purposes, put fear and dread into nursing homes and other disadvantaged people ciety's rules the meeting was in the community by peddling lies proposed cuts. There were never any cuts. We know what was in the Budget. Medibank was retained. The pensioner benefit scheme was ber retained. These perverters of the truth, these luters of the public record, put in the newspapers second hand and thirdhand rumours which were proved to be untrue. At the end of the article the Opposition states that inflation is worse this year than last year. Members of the Opposition are straight out masdays ters of the big he. The Opposition talks about employment but does not put it in proper perspective. It talks about balance. What an terical advertisement. Then, it says that the trahan Labor Party needsfinancialhelp. people ask me why they should ever help the Labor Party I tell them to come here, sit in House forfiveminutes and look at this lot and listen to their talk and their raving and then back once again to this disgraceful advertisement by the National Executive of the Austrahan Labor Party, no doubtfinancedby the $500,000 that transpired at the breakfast",106

241,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"A week or so I tried to relate to the House a shocking scandal that existed in New South Wales at the top level of the Liberal Party. I refer to a former diare rector of the New South Wales Permanent Building Society, one of the largest building societies in Australia with assets of over $600m. The perof son who was on the directorship was a senior member of the Liberal Party of New South Wales and was due to retire as a director in 1977 and therefore had to stand for re-election. Durhis period as a director of the New South Wales Permanent Building Society he obtained loans of $ 100,000 contrary to the rules at atimewhen many small investors could not obtain personal or housing loans due to a government initiated squeeze. Because these loans he sought most vigorously to retain his position on the Board, for any failure to do so be likely to reveal the malpractices in possibly have which he was engaged. At the annual general meeting of the New last Permanent Building Society on 12 the person-the head of the Liberal in New South Wales, as he had been for many years-and four candidates stood for two on the Board.

This matter is subjudice. It was dealt with in the House a few ago and you gave a ruling at the time. At unthat time the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) said that he would proceed but not hysname the particular person. However, he has Ausnow identified that person and referred to him When by his former office.",107

On 8 September 40 new accounts to the $250 were opened at branches of the New South Wales Permanent Building Society in Five Dock. Similar exceUent business was reported at the Bondi branch and 500 new apphcation forms at the Wynyard branch were also reported earlier last week.

On that date over 1,000 members of the Sotor'. ciety attended the meeting which was notable the attendance of many senior poUticians and businessmen. They included senior members the Liberal Party, who formed a solid contingent in the centre of the hall.

The honourable member for Oxley still Uves and breathes. The honourable member for Blaxland wants to beover come leader, and the honourable member for Port Adelaide wants to become deputy leader. When the honourable member for Blaxland has made a contribution to this country anywhere near half as substantial as that of Mr Andrew Grimwade, let him stand in this place and condemn that person.

250,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"As my colleague the honourable member for St George points out, tonight the honourable member for Blaxland was not really attacking Mr Andrew Grimwade; he was sticking the knife fair into the middle of the back of the honourable member for Werriwa, Edward Gough Whitlam, because it was the honourable member for Werriwa who gave evidence before the Committee on Official Establishments. In fact, it was largely as a result ofhis evidence that the Committee brought down the recommendation that it did. Now we see blatant backstabbing, not behind closed doors in that funny room across the corridor. Honourable members opposite are coming into the chamber now one by one. Which one is Casca, which one is Cassius? The honourable member for Blaxland wielded a knife tonight hoping to get in on the grouter with the honourable member for Werriwa and the honourable member for Oxley. The honourable member for Blaxland and the honourable member for Port Adelaide fight over the body before it is even cold. I do not need to refer to the advertisement cause, quite frankly, it is one of the greatest we have seen. It is an absolutely duction. I guess the advertisement cost the Labor Party about $lm. I predict that it will come up with a deficit, which was par for the course for the years 1972-75 when the Labor Party was in office. Each year there was a deficit. Each year was twice as large as the year before. One thing believe- I believe it more than anything else has been said tonight-is that we are seeing now the internal dissensions of the Australian Labor Party as it splits asunder under the pressure trying to keep up a permanent charade of false and deceitful opposition to a government which is getting this country back onto the road recovery. The strain is telling on honourable members opposite as they try each day to tell lies to the Australian public about the inflation rate, about the strength of the dollar and about the unemployment situation. They cannot take it when they are challenged. They stand condemned.",109

252,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"As we all know, quite recently there was a State election in South Australia in which the Labor Government was returned with a vastly increased majority. I am afraid that if this Government decides to hold an election the two honourable members from the Government side who spoke tonight will get the same treatment as quite a lot of Liberal candidates got in South Austraha. One thing which was noticeable in the State election was the extremely high vote for the Labor Party in the City of Whyalla. One can look for the reasons for this extremely high vote. Perhaps we could look at the poor performance of Liberal politicians in South Australia who represent that area. I think we are all aware of the fact that for some time now the closure of the shipyard at Whyalla has caused a great deal of concern. Perhaps I could quote an example of Liberal Party politicians' contributions to these problems that occurred recently. Many approaches were made by local government, by various union organisations, by me and by others about these problems. Of course the approaches have all been to no avail. People were of the opinion that the shipyard wasfinished.Then a few months ago a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence presented to this House a report which recommended the continuation of the Newcastle and Whyalla shipyards. This created a bit of interest in Whyalla and beraised the hopes of the Whyalla people that the jokes Government would accept the recommendation incredible proof that sub-committee. The Whyalla Town Council decided that as senators are supposed to represent the State, not a political party, it would invite the senators to it Whyalla to discuss the matter with the Town I Council. The Council also invited the local State that member, Mr Max Brown, and me. Six senators turned up, three from the Liberal Party and three from the Labor Party. They sat down and disof cussed the recommendation of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence regarding the retention of to the shipyard. The recommendations were, of course, a bit of a package deal. They dealt with the matter of the injection of capital into the industry, industrial relations, the rationalisation of the industry and the establishment of a committee of all the interested bodies-the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the State Government, the Commonwealth Government and shipyard management-to work out feasicoUeague bUity plans on the retention of the yards. Hopes in WhyaUa were, of course, raised by therecommendationsof this sub-committee. As say, three Liberal and three Labor senators turned up at the discussion, plus myself and the State member. It was agreed unanimously that the senators would sent a letter to the Prime ister urging support for the implementation of the sub-committee'srecommendations.I also sent a letter along the same lines to the Prime Minister. In the course of comments made by to the local media after the meeting I noted pleasing it was to see the senators taking the same Une unanimously on what was in the interests of their own State. On 7 September Senator Bishop moved an urconcern. gency motion in the Senate to discuss this matter. One would expect that aU senators would the same hne as they adopted at WhyaUa but was of course not the case. Two of the Liberal senators who attended that meeting, the other being overseas at thetime,took a completely different stance in the Senate-to such an extent that they indulged in the usual rubbish of blamtime ing the Labor Government. They even used about incorrect information, and I am sony that time will not permit me to discuss that aspect further. What happened? At the conclusion of the debate it was one of those Liberal senators that had signed the letter in Whyalla who moved the gag, and when the vote was taken aU the Liberal that senators opposed Senator Bishop's motion, even though it was along the lines they had agreed in Whyalla, and concerning which they had put their names to a letter agreeing to approach the Government to seek implementation of the report. So, when we look at WhyaUa we can see the Liberal Party obtained such a poor vote in the recent State election. We can look at the record of Liberal poUticians in that area. We have shown that they go to Whyalla, tell the people there something, come back here and take a completely different stance. I am sure that is why they polled so badly in the State tion, and why they will again poll badly in future Federal elections.",109

254,Mr CONNOLLY,ADJOURNMENT,"After strange. listening to the Opposition tonight one could only assume from the hysteria engendered that perhaps the nation is supposed to be gearing up for an election. I would like to draw attention some of the learned remarks of my excellent the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) who drew to our attention this most extraordinary page that appeared in the Sydney I Morning Herald and other newspapers on Tuesday, 11 October. The most extraordinary thing about these advertisements is that we have heard for so long, indeed ever since the demise of the MinLabor Government in November 1975, about the pernicious Press, about the hes of the Press and about how it sold the Australian people down the dram. Of course, the actions of the me Labor Party, then in government, were said to how have been totally misconceived and misunderstood by the people; that, after all, it reaUy was a government of compassion and concern. The trouble was that nobody couldfindthe compassion and certainly we could not see the adopt Of course, we did hear the news about this Khemlani; we heard things about Iraqi breakfasts and such things, but when newspapers carry such stories one can only assume that they are a figment of the imagination of the joumatist of the day, who happens to be simply spending his looking for a good story. The amusing thing this series of some 24 articles, or pages chosen for this coUage, the basis of the Opposition's waste of some $80,000, is that it demonstrates certain most interesting things. For example, we see that AbigaU is back on Number 96; we see that Beetson is going to New Zealand; Vivien's last years were hell; and we read of the agony of sex madness. All of this would sugto gest that the Opposition has given a remarkable demonstration of interest in the more subUminal matters of Ufe in its choice of pages from these journals. It is also worth mentioning that the gendeman, Mr Rupert Murdoch, who is the owner of some 13 of the 24 newspapers quoted why from was, as I recall-m y memory might be faulty on this matter but I doubt it-the gendetrack man whom the Opposition literally pUloried across the length and breadth of this land because he had the courage, in the last months of the previous Government, to let the people of that this nation know precisely what was going on elecand what the Government of the day was doing to bring this country to the lowest ebb of psychological and national fervour I have had the misNevertheless bedfellows can indeed be When it suits the Opposition it is quite happy to use journalists, newspapers, their publishers and, of course, the pages of the day. The selection it has chosen is almost exclusively from to afternoon newspapers. I suggest that with the most liberal interpretation of afternoon newspapers one could not say they demonstrate necessarily a particularly high degree of intellecmassive tual integrity in all matters. If the Labor Party had chosen morning newspapers it would have been closer to the point. Nevertheless it chosen the evening newspapers in the belief that if they can read the writing-believe me, it is small enough-sufficien t people will be stupid enough to fund the next election campaign of the Labor Party. The fact of the matter is that there are not enough people in Australia to fill this building in terms of the amount of money with which they are prepared to fund the Labor Party. The three years from which we are still suffering are still memories far too strong in the minds the vast majority of the Australian the simple question is put to them: 'Do you want to risk this nation m the hands of another theTowards Whitlam?' the answer inevitably is: 'My God, Bradfield no.' There is a good article in the Australian today on a reference across America of what big businessmen thought of the previous Labor Government. On that particular subject they absolutely united in the fact that there is future for foreign investment in this country ever- I am sure that the Austrahan people will take the 'ever' very seriously-ther e is another Labor government. I am sure they will not return the administration of this countiy to the people who now succumb on the Opposition benches and who will be there for many years to come. This advertisement was also authorised by community. David Combe, the General Secretary of the The Government parties Labor Party as I understand it, who on 23 April ment are not concerned with last year declared that the Australian problems with which this country newspapers had committed a fraud on the Australian people during the 1975 election campaign. Surely even he has to admit that at times Uke this one has to go to bed even with one's greatest enemy.",110

The people who were unemployed are still unemployed. Nothing has been done in this Parliament by this Government to solve the problems being shouldered by the people throughout the cities and rural areas of this country. We have seen the bluster of this has Government and the Victorian Government in trying to inflame the industrial dispute in the Latrobe Valley, and we have witnessed its settlement by the common sense of the trade union leadership nationally. All the abuse that has been hurled at Bob Hawke in the last few months has proved futile. He has still proved to be the most skilful industrial negotiator in Australia. He was able to bring about a settlement in an arena in which he had to put up with all the incompeof tence, infantile politics and industrial obserpeople. When vations of this Government. the end of 1977 the young people in electorates of St George, Demson and still do not have jobs. The people who has been stood down as a result of the dispute in Victoria do not know whether they will be paid unemployment benefit. This Government is falling to pieces. More and more supporters of the are Government are resigning to sit on the cross no benches. Rumours are flying around. There is if speculation about an election, with all the damage that that is doing. What do we have in this chamber? We have the juvenUe presentation of what they consider to be comic politics by the people who are serving theirfirstterm in the Parliament.
