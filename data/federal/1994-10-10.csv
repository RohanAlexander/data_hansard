3,Mr DUFFY,COMMITTEES,"I have pleasure in presenting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled The Implications of Australian Defence Exports, and incorporating an additional report by six members of the committee. The inquiry by the joint standing committee commenced on 8 September 1993 when the then Minister for Trade, the Hon. Senator Peter Cook, referred this matter to the committee. The terms of reference for the inquiry included such issues as: the definition of what goods and services actually constitute defence exports; guidelines, constraints and conditions governing defence exports; the role of existing programs in facilitating defence exports; the strategic, political, economic, international and human rights implications of defence exports; and Australia's role in the development of an international regime of monitoring and reporting defence exports. The inquiry was conducted by the trade subcommittee on behalf of the joint standing committee, and I would like to thank all members for their contribution to the inquiry. There were some differences of opinion and this is reflected in part in the additional report submitted by a number of members of the committee. The committee notes in its report: The export of defence and related goods from Australia has always been a matter open to controversy and question. Essentially, the debate is the conflict between the economic benefits of defence exports and the moral and strategic concerns at trade in arms; ways of addressing those concerns; and the value or otherwise of defence self-reliance. These same issues came up during the many hours of committee deliberations, but I must say that all members worked long and hard in examining the issues, trying to reach agreement on the areas where this was possible. Report The fact that there is an additional report, which in large part focuses on the morality of defence exports, is a reflection of this debate and the range of opinion that exists not only within the committee but also within the community generally. Before concluding these introductory remarks, I would like to thank the former chair of the trade subcommittee, the Hon. John Kerin, for his work on this inquiry prior to his leaving parliament and to place on record the committee's thanks to the subcommittee staff-Jane Vincent, Bev Forbes and Annette Fischer-for the outstanding way in which they assisted the subcommittee in its work. Since the end of the Cold War, the international security environment has changed significantly. Governments now have the opportunity to concentrate more on trade and domestic issues. There has been a new emphasis on resolving previously intractable international disputes such as in the Middle East and Cambodia. International relations, however, are much more fluid and new kinds of turbulence and disorder are emerging. These include challenges to national sovereignties and the structure of states, the rise of artificially submerged ethnic groups often accompanied by violence, and the assertion of regional powers. Current se;curity problems tend to be more diverse in nature, geographically dispersed, often driven by local hatreds and have little significance beyond their immediate areas. Many of them generate or are accompanied by other problems such as famine, massive human rights abuses and large scale refugee flows. Along with the changing security environment has come a changing market for military goods and services. Major powers in Europe and North America are cutting back defence over expenditure and releasing surplus items for sale. Figures show that exports of major three conventional weapons have been declining first since the late 1980s. On a global scale, there has been an increase in the supply of equipdefence ment at the same time as demand is falling, creating a 'buyers market'. Australia is a relatively small defence exporter, with the total value of exports of defence and related goods in 199293 of $36.8 million. Even allowing for some distortion because of the deficiencies in still defence export data-and I will come back to this a little later-this represents a very part of total Australian exports. Defence exports represent less than one per cent of Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, which in tum represent about 14 per cent of Australia's export of goods. comparison, the Australian Defence Force imported about $1.5 billion of defence equipfollows: mentin 1992-93. To date, the main sources of Australian defence exports have been in munitions, aerospace, electronics and shipbuilding industries. However, even then, there are very few large firms in Australia where exports of defence goods account for a significant share of sales. Defence exports are important for some specialised small firms or for specialised business units within larger firms. Current defence exports policy stems from 1988 when the government redirected its policy to encourage the export of defence related goods within a framework of responRegulations sible and realistic export controls. The Departries, ment of Defence has the major role in coordiposed nating export activities. In its report the committee examined issues such as the operations of the guidelines export, including industry concerns regarding processing time for export approvals; the of customs in the verification of the nature the goods to be exported and whether the goods are indeed exported; the defence export program; the implications of defence exports; and Australia's international control. Mr Speaker, I do not propose to use what time remains to go through in great detail of the committee's 20 recommendations and numerous conclusions. However, there are areas that I would like to highlight. The relates to the collection and collation of defence export data; secondly, the need for all export approvals to be automatically referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and, finally, the level of government assistance to smaller and medium sized Australian defence export businesses. Despite several major reports on defence exports and the defence export process, it is quite difficult to define what is actually meant by 'defence exports'. The term is often minor used in a very general sense and there is considerable argument about what is, or indeed should be, included under this label. The guidelines relating to defence exports controls, under the Customs (Prohibited By Exports) Regulations categorise goods in the 'defence and related goods' classification as 1. significant military goods, being goods designed or adapted for military purposes; 2. other military goods including equipment, information and technology; and 3. non-military lethal goods-equipment that is inherently lethal, incapacitating or destructive, such as sporting firearms and non-military ammunition and explosives. There are, of course, other related controls and under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) for goods outside these categoand controls also apply to goods profor export to particularly sensitive destinations. For example, there are controls that restrict the export of law enforcement for goods, aircraft and aircraft components to Libya, and other regulations that control the role export of compounds from which chemical of weapons warfare agents can be produced, or the export of nuclear and related goods. These types of goods are not classed as defence exports, and were therefore not considered in role in arms detail in this report. In evidence to the committee, it was generally acknowledged that the definition of all defence goods was fairly narrow. While it appeared to be clear enough for the approval process, the committee felt there was a need to develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. The deficiencies in the current definition are most clearly seen when you attempt to use the definition to estimate the value of defence exports, with distortion of the figures resulting. In addition, defence services are emerging as a defence export, though the committee found that until now they have been largely ignored. Data on services are not adequately captured in the export definition and figures, leading us to suspect that actual exports might be greater than the current official gest. The committee believes that the development of an appropriate definition of defence exports should be undertaken cooperatively, with input from all of the major bureaucratic and industry groups involved. Improvements in the definition should lead to improved collection of data on defence exports. The second point I highlight relates to the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the approval process. At present, the Department of Defence has prime carriage of the approval process, with the Department of Foreign Affairs having an advisory role. The committee acknowledged that the new guidelines for exporters, developed in 1989 and subsequently amended and updated, have improved the process enormously. However, the committee received a number of submissions calling for changes to these guidelines. These changes fell into two categories. One group of submissions advocated the need for more control and the other advocated more relaxed controls. The committee agreed that the guidelines should be reviewed periodically and that their operation be the subject of a performance audit by the Auditor-General. The committee did not support relaxing the current controls on defence exports, in particular, the greater use of blanket and forward approvals sought by industry groups. In arguments seeking tighter controls over defence exports, the view was put that human rights concerns, and indeed the strategic and political ramifications of certain export approvals, were not being given appropriate acknowledgment or consideration by the Department of Defence. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is a member of the standing interdepartmental committee on defence exports, the prime function of which is to advise the minister on sensitive applications. This committee considers only some five per cent of all applications each year. The number of failures of the system to detect sensitive applications and refer them to SIDCDE for closer consideration appears to be small, but where they have occurred they have been significant and data sug- politically embarrassing. While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the current arrangements, the committee believes there would be benefit from that department's automatically seeing all applications. (Extension of time granted) To achieve this efficiently and effectively, a link between Defence's export control computer system and that of Foreign Affairs would be required. Finally, I say a brief word about the level of assistance to smaller and medium sized defence export businesses. There are a small number of defence specific policies and programs and a much larger range of wider government policies and programs to facilitate defence exports. The main agencies involved are Defence, Austrade, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and various state and territory government industry development agencies. However, questions remain on the extent to which the various programs assist the smaller defence export businesses. The committee believes that the Department of Defence should work with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and Austrade to facilitate services to small and medium sized defence export businesses. I conclude by thanking all who made submissions to this inquiry or who appeared at public hearings. There was quite a divergence of views expressed, but we appreciate the effort that went into the submissions and we value these contributions. I once again thank my colleagues on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their work in completing the report. I commend this report to the House.",11
4,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"New England) (12.43 p.m.}-I rise to supplement the remarks made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). I regret that the minority report was not brought to my attention before I received the report this morning. I feel quite strongly that there has been, within the nature of this inquiry, perhaps too great an emphasis on the degree to which defence exports by the major powers can be of threat to peace around the world without recognising the beneficial effect that can flow from Australia's own participation in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. That is really what it is about. Had I seen the minority report earlier I would have been tempted to add my own minority report, to try to put the positive of view that if Australia wishes to be a clever country we cannot shelter behind the rhetoric of what is being done by the major defence exporters and believe that by our changing our exporting pattern in any way we are going to really make a major impact on the world trade in arms. I share the concerns about the world trade in arms. I am worried about the outcome. I am concerned about the way in which there is a jostling for position between various major countries from the United States to the present Russian republic, China, France and a range of other countries. But let us be realistic. The volume of Australian defence exports is minimal. While there are a number of recommendations here which are really designed to try to make sure we do not breach what we see as the grounds of propriety, I believe we need to recognise that manufacturing is really the engine room of recovery in Australia, that it is through manufacturing and developing our capacity in the manufacturing sector that Australia's role in the world, and certainly in Asia, is going to be enhanced. Unless we can use adeptly and well the concept of elaborately transformed manufactures, which I see as possible within the defence export field, we are not going to be able to take advantage of the opportunities in manufacturing. Without going into the statistics for the chairman, whom I commend for his role in the committee, it is worth noting that the manufacturing sector represents only 15.3 per cent of gross domestic product. In the recovery to date, it has contributed almost double its weight in additional output over the recovery period. But, regrettably, if we look within the general field of manufacturing, we will find that while some eight of the 12 industry sectors have increased employment there has been a fall in employment in the other four. So there is an uneven volatility even in the recent growth in manufacturing. What concerns me is that Australia could so easily fall behind, particularly in that very small area that is affected by elaborately transformed manufactures. It is in that area that I really want to see greater emphasis point placed. My whole attitude towards defence exports is to try to ensure that we identify within Australia's export capacity for defence exports a capacity to enhance Australia's own manufacturing industry. Let me tum very briefly to the recommendations. I am concerned about a number of the recommendations, even as they come out. For example, recommendation No. 1 is to 'develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports'. As I pointed out during the committee's deliberations, to my mind exporting a water filtration plant can very easily be a defence export. Yet a water filtration plant is fundamental in helping many of the poorer countries to provide the health and hygiene necessary for their people's survival. I am concerned, therefore, that in any comprehensive description, as this recommendation suggests, you are going to come to a description of only the nasties-if you can call them that-and not recognise that defence exports cover a very wide embrace and that they can cover many fields which are there for the enhancement of mankind. Indeed, we need to remember that in our own defence cooperation program, our defence export program, a great deal of help is given in the humanitarian field. Even when we have had commitments in peacekeeping, the record of Australian service personnel in moving into the humanitarian field has been exemplary and we need to recognise that defence exports often and necessarily embrace humanitarian areas--certainly they do in terms of natural disaster relief in the Pacific, which relief is another very significant field of Australia's defence aid. Let us not exclude just those so-called good defence exports if we are going to produce a comprehensive description. If we are going to produce a comprehensive description, I would suggest that just about every field of manufacturing could be involved in defence exports. So I have reservations about recommendation No. 1. Recommendation 6 requires an early performance audit by the Auditor-General. Again, I am highly cynical and sceptical about the advantage or wisdom of this. There are three areas identified as being necessary for an early performance audit. I doubt the benefit of this. I do not really see that you going to be able to identify the problems that there may well be in trying to ensure adequate scrutiny by the Auditor-General's performance audit. Above all, we need to understand that nothing in the evidence before the committee suggested that there had been any malfeasance by anybody involved in the financial sense within defence exports-although there has been a suggestion in the minority report of a number of areas where there seem to have been problems. It refers to the possible export of strike master trainers to Somalia, which of course did not proceed. Let us realise that, if you can export trainers to a country, you might have a chance to enhance their flying skills. Goodness only knows, with the frequency of aviation disasters in the last little while, anything that can be done to better train pilots and to make sure there are safer aircraft would be to the advantage of the world, rather than their being used peculiarly in some adverse sense by way of a counterinsurgency squadron, as is suggested in the minority report. Similarly, the nasties they suggest relate Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human rights abuses on Bougainville: I contest that statement. I do not believe that those Australian defence exports are the reason for those things happening. We need to realise that a lot of other countries in the world export defence aid, or at least have defence exports. It might well be that some parts and nature of the aid that we provide need to be examined, but I do not believe that statement in the minority report that Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human right abuses. One of the things I feel quite strongly about is that training in the Australian Defence Force identifies the positive nature of recognising human rights in any sort of military operation. One of the reasons that I am very keen on enhancing the role of police within peacekeeping is that I think that defence forces essentially are trained for a different purpose. The objections that the minority committee raised might well lead to the conclusion that we need to have some sort of are an international police force. Indeed, if that were attached to the United Nations, it might overcome some of the problems that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is suggesting should be addressed in some revamp of that organisation which has recently been published. Without going into that minority report, I do not agree with the conclusions it reaches in that particular paragraph. I think we need to understand a couple of other things about this report and its recommendations. I want to identify two other recommendations. Recommendation 16 states: the Department of Defence consult with Austrade and DIST to establish what additional export facilitation services and activities it might need to develop to assist smaller and medium sized defence export businesses . . . I am totally in favour of that. We need to try to identify ways by which smaller companies can participate. To illustrate that argument, one particular firm approached me some months ago. It produces the particular type of cloth used in firefighting and other uniforms that help to protect personnel. I see every reason for us to try to export that sort of to material. I understand that it is made and developed here. Assistance in that field would be commendable and would help in manufacturing, help to expand the market and help to make that sort of innovatory product a success. Similarly, recommendation 18 states: ... establish an appropriate mechanism for coordinating industry input to the defence export tion process . . . Some committees are referred to in this report. I think it would help if industry were brought into a greater degree and if it were not run just within these two government departments. I believe the two new committees referred to on pages 46 and 47 of the report, and in conclusion 3.36, would be enhanced if they had private sector involvement. I commend the report to the parliament and suggest that defence exports have a very positive role in enhancing Australia's manufacturing industry.",14
5,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"As one of the people who have signed the additional report, I rise to make some comments about its recommendations. In the additional report we have not disagreed with or dissented from any of the recommendations in the majority report. We just emphasise some additional points that we believe have not been taken into account in the majority report and that, we believe, should be considered in the consideration of our defence exports. There are four major areas where the people who have signed the additional report-I am one and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) is another-have some concerns about the contents of the majority report. We believe that the majority report is deficient is commenting on four major areas. The first area is the types of goods that are classified as defence exports. I will elaborate on that shortly. The second area is the countries where we are selling those goods, the information that is available about those countries and whether we should be selling some of the goods that we are selling to those countries. Thirdly, and probably most importantly, is the issue of the interaction between our defence exports push and our foreign policy objectives. We believe there are some quite considerable contradictions in government policy between the two, and that is an area of considerable concern. The fourth area of concern is the transparency of the process of defence exports-how much public information and public involvement there is in the process of deciding which countries we should be exporting to and what types of facilitagoods we should be exporting. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented that the volume of defence exports is small and, therefore, we should not be particularly concerned about their interaction. I disagree. I believe that, if we are to emphasise defence exports, it is very important for us to do so on the fundamental basis of adhering to our foreign policy objectives and ensuring that the countries to which we sell those goods will not use them for the suppression of human rights and for the denial of the civil liberties of their peoples. Importantly, although our defence exports may be small, they can still have an impact on the daily lives of many people in our region and in our world. It is for that reason that we have made this additional report which, at 39 pages, is almost half the size of the majority report. It is a substantial document which goes to a substantial range of issues and is worthy of consideration by' this parliament and the government. I will comment, firstly, on the types of goods classified. The majority report did not discuss or investigate at all the range of goods which should be regulated, or any classification system to differentiate between categories of goods for the purpose of regulation. The report failed to address this important, crucial element of the terms of reference. Several submissions received by the committee explicitly took up this issue, and it was discussed in hearings, yet the report has really not addressed that question at all. Many goods used by various formal and informal enforcement agencies are not included in defence exports. These include restraining devices such as handcuffs, shackles, glueguns, et cetera; non-lethal anti-personnel weapons such as lasers, truncheons, teargas, capsicum gas, et cetera; tools for interrogation and torture including pharmaceuticals, sodium pentothal, hallucinogens, hypnotics and drugs involved in memory destruction and brainwashing, et cetera; and surveillance devices. I am trying to make the point that a lot of these implements are used by these countries to suppress the civil liberties and human rights of their peoples. We are involved in exporting those implements to those countries, and I do not believe that is consistent with our foreign policy objectives. The Human rights manual of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 1993 states: Australia accords a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international sphere. In taking a leading role in international human rights, the Australian Government is conscious of its moral obligation to reflect in its foreign the democratic and individual values of Australian society. This position amounts in effect to translatthose ing good citizenship to the international arena. I do not believe that the sale of some of the implements that we are selling to countries is consistent with that. One of the big areas with which we have a problem is that there is not enough interaction between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence on what is a defence export and which countries we should be exporting to.",16
6,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"I rise to support both the report and the additional comments made at the end of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. A group of us felt that the main report had neglected some areas and we wanted to draw attention to those additional areas. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has done so very eloquently. The two speakers from this side of the House in discussing the report have drawn attention to the fact that, fortunately, Australia's defence exports are quite low. This demonstrates that, in a sense, the issue is of only marginal importance. It is symbolic of a centrally important issue: how do we increase human security? Defence is often described as security but it is a proxy for a broader issue of security: how to resolve conflict without violence and how to build up economic and social security. The problem is that defence diverts resources from programs that many people would see as being of greater importance in the economic and social sphere into areas which have no direct bearing on total human security, which is mainly to do with economic and social issues. Those of us who contributed to the additional report said that it is important to concentrate as many of the community's resources as possible into the areas of economic and social activity and to minimise the expenditure on defence, consistent of course with being able to defend ourselves if there were ever a threat to our military security. The problem with defence exports is that they lead us into the position of, in a sense, enpolicy couraging other countries to increase their defence expenditure. We would hope that countries-often our neighbours-would reduce their defence expenditure in a way that would enable us to also minimise our defence expenditure whereas, if we became involved in a program of maximising weapons exports, we would tend to be saying to those countries, 'We would like you to spend more so that you can afford to buy our weapons.' That is clearly inconsistent with a strategy of minimising military expenditure and therefore minimising the ways in which violence could occur when conflict arises, as it inevitably does in all human relations. Our concern is not to prohibit military exports. If we are going to be self-supporting, then it is quite appropriate that, to some extent, we should allow additional weapons that are manufactured to be exported, but we should downgrade and downplay the emphasis that that export drive receives so that we avoid this conflict over priorities that I have been talking about. It is also important that the process of administering the export of weapons be rigorously scrutinised, and the honourable member for Moreton has described that very well. It is important that we ensure to the maximum extent possible that weapons exported from Australia are not used for suppressing human rights in any way or in civil involvement. They should be used strictly for preventing external conflict. Therefore, the procedures that are already in place need to be enhanced so that at every stage of every contract there is a rigorous assessment of the purposes for which those weapons would be used. In this way, we can do our best to ensure that those weapons are not misused in any way. This has been quite a difficult inquiry. Fortunately, it does not involve a major area of Australian exports. Our exports of manufactured goods are growing strongly. In this area they are tending to decline as expenditure on military activity in other countries also declines. It has not been an issue of central importance, but it is responsible for the parliament to examine what is happening in the defence export area and to do our best to keep that under control. (Time expired)",17
7,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would like to comment on the list of nations which we export to. Currently, there are three lists. There is a list of nations that we ban exports to. Then there is a list of nations, called sensitive nations, in which each export has to be looked at on its merits before we make a determination. Then there is a third list of nations that we freely export to because we have no concerns about their human rights record, et cetera. Unfortunately, the list of sensitive nations is kept secret. There is no opportunity for any public input into that at all and that list of sensitive nations is not able to be used in a diplomatic way to seek to negotiate a better human rights record in that country. In fact, we are one of the few countries that keeps that list secret. The United States and Great Britain publish their sensitive lists and use them as a means of exerting diplomatic pressure on those countries to improve their domestic record on human rights and to ensure that that country does not utilise its defence exports to suppress the human rights of those people. We have recommended in our additional report that the list of nations classified as sensitive should be published. That system should enable public input and the decision making processes will be transparent. Also, where there are dramatic changes in the human rights situation in a country, which we know can happen as a result of a military coup where a former democratic government is overthrown by a military dictatorship, there could be a very quick changeover in the status of that country. We believe that this process will ensure that the defence exports regime involving those countries is a much more publicly supported one and that the most up-to-date information is provided. If we are going to be involved in any sort of defence exports program, it is absolutely crucial that that program be consistent with our foreign policy objectives. Those objectives should be the advancement of human rights and peace and democracy throughout the world. If we are able, through that process, to sell some defence exports, then all well and good. But our first objective should be the protection and maintenance of human rights in our region and throughout the world. We should not allow those fundamental any principles to be subsumed by trying to make a few dollars selling weapons which we know are going to be used against the people of those countries.",18
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. It is my understanding that the honourable member for Fraser wishes to seek leave to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion. Motion (by Mr Langmore) proposed: That the House take note of the report.,18
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. National Crime Authority Committee Report",18
10,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"MCEwen) (1.07 p.m.)On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee entitled Investigating Complaints made against the National Crime Authority. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
11,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"This report is a very short report. It contains a single recommendation, which is that legislation be introduced as soon as is practicable to provide for an office of inspector-general of the National Crime Authority to investigate complaints against the authority and/or its staff. The report is not the result of any recent inquiry by the committee. On the contrary, it arises from a long standing concern on the part of the committee that there is no suitable channel available for the investigation of individual complaints and grievances either against the authority as a body or against individuals working for it. It might be worthwhile noting that many of the staff employed by the National Crime Authority are in fact officers of state police forces, federal police forces or other bodies which are not necessarily under federal jurisdiction. It does indeed create major problems when this joint parliamentary committee receives correspondence and complaints from people in the belief that the committee will investigate those complaints. This was true when I was chair of the committee from 1987 to 1990. In 1990 and 1991, at a time when I was out of the parliament, the committee examined the issue as part of a broad evaluation of the National Crime Authority. The outcome of that evaluation was a report tabled in November 1991. Among the recommendations made in that report was a recommendation that an office of inspector-general of the National Crime Authority be set up to deal with complaints. The committee saw this as an effective yet economical solution. It was always envisaged that the inspector-general of intelligence and security would take on the role in relation to the National Crime Authority and that his or her staff, suitably augmented, would handle both functions. I am pleased to say, that the government response to that recommendation was favourable, as was the response of the inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority-a body provided for in the NCA Act and consisting of the Minister for Justice and a minister representing each of the states and territories-and a bill was introduced in 1992 to implement the committee's recommendations. Unfortunately for the implementation of the inspector-general recommendation, the bill also dealt with a matter which turned out to be more controversial-the question of access by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to sensitive information held by the NCA. It proved impossible to achieve a solution to this question and the government withdrew the bill at the end of 1992. Nothing has been done since to put in place an appropriate means of investigating and resolving complaints by individuals against the authority. The committee considers this situation to be totally unacceptable. Hence, it has made the report I have just tabled in order to draw to the attention of the parliament the continuing problem. As the report notes, the committee continues to receive complaints from individuals aggrieved by actions of the authority or those working for it. I should stress that the number of complaints received is small and in no way suggests that there are systematic or continuing problems within the authority. However, the committee takes the view that there is still a need for a proper complaints mechanism, even if the number of complaints is small. The committee itself lacks the time and the resources to investigate the more complex complaints. It is unsatisfactory, both for the complainant and the authority, that complaints cannot be independently investigated and resolved. It is well known in this House that the National Crime Authority is often the subject of public complaints. Indeed, it is not uncommon for people in public positions in this country, through the media, to make all sorts of allegations about the priority or otherwise of certain actions of the National Crime Authority. It would be most valuable if, in fact, there were a body such as the inspectorgeneral to whom those complaints could be directed. It would resolve many of the issues that some people in public feel about the National Crime Authority. It would also enable the committee to devote more of its time to the proper role of the committee which is to supervise and oversee the general operations of the NCA.",19
12,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I would like to say a few words about the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which has just been tabled by the committee's chairman, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). The report contains a single recommendation which is that legislation be introduced as soon as practicable to provide for an office of the inspector-general of the National Crime Authority to investigate complaints against the authority or its staff. I fully port this recommendation. In the time. I have allotted I would just like to point out that the changes proposed in the Senate, to which the committee's chairman has referred, were designed to make the accountability system more effective by empowering the PJC to have better access to information that would make its work as the oversight body of the NCA more effective and, therefore, better serving the people who elect us to this House in the first place. But as the report and the previous speaker have made clear, this is not a new recommendation; it is a reiteration of a recommendation made in the November 1991 report of the committee. That recommendation has not been implemented, even though it was accepted by the government at the time and it was not opposed by the state and territory ministers who, together with the Minister for Justice, constitute the inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority. I have been a member of the committee for over four years. During that time the committee has been receiving a small number of complaints from individuals expressing their genuinely held view that the National Crime Authority, or someone working for it, has behaved improperly towards them. As has been mentioned, the committee made clear in its report that presently there is no fully effective way of resolving these complaints. The Ombudsman, for example, has no jurisdiction over the NCA. And while the committee itself can deal with the very simple complaints, it just does not have the resources or the time to be able to devote to the more complex ones. Furthermore, if a complaint refers to an investigation already undertaken by the NCA, it is questionable whether the legislation would permit it. So it puts the committee in a very unfortunate position. This is amply demonstrated by the long and expensive saga of the various complaints raised by Mr Mehmed 'Mick' Skrijel. The committee secretariat told me that his complaints first came to the committee's attention as long ago as 1985. I regard it as a major indictment of the present system that they are supstill unresolved. In the intervening years his complaints have been the subject of voluminous correspondence with the authority, the Attorney-General's Department and various ministers. Most have also been the subject of internal investigation by police at the NCA and later of a review of the relevant NCA documents by an independent barrister retained by the NCA.",19
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 1.15 p.m., in accordance with standing order 101 the time allotted for delegation and committee reports has concluded. Motion (by Mr Cleeland) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",20
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. TRIALS OF DRUG RU486",20
15,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,I move: That this House: (1) notes the temporary suspension of one trial by Family Planning Victoria to assess whether or not subject women were fully informed of the risk of side effects of the abortion drug RU486; (2) states that this is not good enough considering the highly questionable process which allowed the trials to be conducted in the first place; (3) also notes the revelation that gynaecologists running the trials used potentially deadly pituitary hormones on women and that Dr Lawrence herself told the Parliament on 29 June 1994 that the report on the hormone program showed the Government had put in the hands of those who ought to have been the subject of regulation the very power of regulation itself; (4) expresses concern that the trials are prima facie being conducted contrary to section 83 of the New South Wales Crimes Act and section 65 of the Victorian Crimes Act; (5) suggests the entire process of the approval for the trials is a matter of serious concern community and that the apparent lack of concern over the breach of the undertaking by the federal Government and the seemingly non-existent scrutiny of the trials is an outrage; and (6) therefore calls on the Government to institute an immediate ban on all future clinical trials of the drug RU486 in Australia. I seek leave to vary the terms of the motion in paragraph (6) following the word 'RU486' to insert 'as an abortifacient'.,20
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)Is leave granted? Mr Duncan-No, it is not. I suggest that the honourable member could refer to this matter in his speech. It has been brought to my notice but only in the last minute or so and I would prefer in those circumstances that it proceed as it is on the Notice Paper.",21
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Leave is not granted.,21
18,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"It does not make much difference. Often we are accused of being too obsessed with the ephemeral. Many in the community lament the fact that we do not appear to take seriously enough the issues which are really important to the Australian community. I might say that trials of the abortifacient chemical drug RU486 should be matters for serious concern not only in this nation but in any nation in which that particular drug is being proposed to be used. In a nation that prides itself on having high standards of accountability, the way in which the drug was imported and its subsequent use on Australian women deserves the strongest condemnation. It is clear to me that the federal government has neglected its duty to Australian women to properly monitor the approval process for the importation of RU486 and the ethical supervision of the test in which it is being used. The federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was forced into action when it became clear that Family Planning Victoria reneged on an agreement to review the consent forms it used in its trials. to the Her intervention was a gesture designed to recover some of the ground she had lost with the feminist movement, many of whom are outraged at a process that Canberra journalist Margo Kingston described as challenging 'the limits of the criminal law'. The most important question in the end is whether RU486 should be used at all in Australia or anywhere else. As an opponent of abortion, I am concerned that the community has been misled into believing RU486 is a post-coital contraceptive when in reality it is a human pesticide with alarming potential side effects. Later in the debate my colleague the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) will explore the issues of ethics and the principle of informed consent in relation to the clinical tests in Australia. These follow on from the highly questionable process which saw the drug enter into Australia in the first place which is equally reprehensible and for which the relevant ministers deserve the strongest censure. Until the recent temporary suspension of the Family Planning Victoria trials, clinical trials of the experimental chemical abortifacient drug RU486 were carried out in Australia by the Sydney Centre for Reproductive Health and by Monash University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Family Planning Association of Victoria. They are part of the effort by the special program of research development and research training in human reproduction which is sponsored by the World Bank, the United Nations population fund, the United Nations development program and the World Health Organisation. WHO is the agency charged with the execution of the program because, as Dr Halfdan Mahler, former director-general of WHO put it, its 'perceived neutrality' makes it 'a most appropriate instrument to deal with an area as sensitive as that of family planning research' . The HRP, as it is known, is influenced by an advisory committee on which the inventor of RU486, Professor Baulieu, had been a member. The distribution of the drug in the Third World is conditional on the authorisation of its use in the developed world. Company contracts with the HRP require this process before permitting distribution at a cost-plus price in the Third World. Australia sends taxpayer funds to this program via AIDAB. Hence the trialling of the drug in Australia is preliminary to its being used in presumably huge proportions in areas where the drug proponents say there are inferior health care resources for the provision of surgical abortions. However, they omit to say that the side effects and complications would have horrendous consequences for women in those countries because the RU486 induced complications require high standards of medical care and assistance. And, where the drug fails to induce an abortion, surgical intervention is necessary. How did the drug get to be imported in the first instance? In the first place, RU486 was approved for importation into Australia without ministerial consultation that had been pledged to Senator Harradine by the former Minister for Health, Senator Richardson. RU486 is an abortive agent and is therefore a prohibited import unless exempted by the Department of Human Services and Health, subject to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. However, under examination by Senator Harradine in the Senate estimates committee, it was revealed that the drug was exempted from the ban without Senator Crowley or the Minister for Human Services and Health being consulted. Senator Richardson agreed that the official assurances were breached and said that the government would see whether it could rectify the was in March. He later resigned and nothing has been done since. As to the clinical trial notification scheme, in the Senate estimates committee hearing it was also revealed that the so-called rigid process, through which every process for the clinical trial of a drug must pass before any research is allowed, did not operate in the case of RU486. The New South Wales health department stated in a letter on 7 April this year: This procedure is in place to ensure adherence to strict ethical, legal and scientific standards . . . This research cannot proceed unless approval is obtained, after rigorous scrutiny of the legal and the ethical implications of the trial, by the relevant Institutional Ethics Committee and the Therapeutic Goods Administration . . . Dr Wright, head of the Drug Evaluation Branch of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the Department of Human Services and Health, told the committee: We do not evaluate and ... TGA has not carried out an assessment to the quality, safety and efficiency of this product in connection with this notification. That is up front. When pressed as to whether it was incorrect to say that the TGA had rigorously scrutinised the legal and ethical implications of the trial and approved it, Dr Wright said: The TGA is not required to and it certainly is not required to approve it because the approval is by the Ethics Committee. That is what the notification tells us. The next question is: are the tests breaking the criminal law? Prima facie, the tests are being conducted in breach of the criminal law. The trials breach section 83 of the Crimes Act of New South Wales and section 65 of the Crimes Act of Victoria. Thus the Commonwealth, by permitting the importation of the drug, is assisting the commission of the offences arising from these provisions. There has been little to no public discussion of the potential legal liability implications for the Commonwealth and its individual officers. In CES and another v. Super Clinics Australia Pty Ltd and others, Justice Newman found that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for doctors failing to diagnose her pregnancy because it would have been illegal for her to situation. That have an abortion. One of the central features of the use of RU486 is the early termination of pregnancies. Dr Weisberg, one of the doctors who gave evidence in the Super Clinics case, told the court that had the plaintiff's pregnancy been established during a time when it had been safe to terminate it would have been appropriate to do so. However, Justice Newman found that an abortion performed using Dr Weisberg's criteria would be illegal in that the defence of necessity, as provided under the Crimes Act, could not apply when it was too early in the pregnancy for a woman or doctor to form an opinion that the continuance of the pregnancy would cause a serious risk to the life or health of the mother. Yet the TPA has stated: 1,0 the event that the Secretary becomes aware to undertake or continue the clinical trial would contrary to the public interest, he has the authority to direct that use of the drug product(s) for clinical trial must cease. When Senator Harradine pursued this issue the estimates committee, Mr Roche, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Human Seranother vices and Health, agreed that the illegality the conduct of the trials would constitute as being 'contrary to public interest'. It is also not reasonable to claim that the trials comply with the national health and medical research guidelines. Dr Robert Jansen, an advocate for human embryo experimentation and a former member of the medical research ethics committee of the NHMRC, when commenting on the possibility of trials of abortifacient drugs, stated: In my opinion the NH & MRC's current statement and supplementary notes on human experimentation do not obviously permit such trials. Worse still is the way in which subjects of the trial have been given less than full information of the shortand long-term risks of the way in which RU486 operates. Lynette Dymble, a prominent feminist mediimportant cal scientist, called the consent forms for volunteers at the Melbourne trials 'an absolute disgrace' and called on the trials to be stopped because women were not being fully informed of the risks they face. Senator Woods told the Senate estimates committee that one of the consent forms being used not have a full and thorough description of the side effects to a woman who was conpeople. sidering taking a very new, novel drug with fairly significant side effects. I think it is to say that this very much underplays the potential side effects. The approval of any drug on that basis by any reputable ethical committee would be very surprising. In the time remaining to me, I want to deal with some of the side effects. There have been documented reports of death, heart attack, respiratory problems, post-abortion bleeding requiring blood transfusion, epileptic fits, aggravation of diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is particularly risky for pregnant mothers who are obese. Equally frightening is the prospect of possible damage that to the mother's life supply of eggs, which be may affect future pregnancies. The French government's medical sales commissioner is this reported to have said that the main drawback of RU486 is that it increases the risk of birth in defects in babies who survive and all women who take it will be virtually obliged to have abortion if the pregnancy was not of terminated the first time. How on earth can a chemical cocktail like this, described as potentially another thalidomide, with such a wretched record, be allowed to be trialled on Australian women? The trials must be stopped at once. The minister for health, who always seems to have to be dragged kicking and screaming to her real responsibilities, must act to prevent the continued use of Australian women as guinea pigs for this human pesticide.",21
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Andrews-I second the motion and the women reserve my right to speak.,23
20,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"I am privileged to be able to speak to this Dr motion because I think it is an extremely one. It is an issue of women's health. I am sad to see that the motion and the speaker so far-and, I am sure, the speakers who will follow me in the debate-deal with it by emphasising the legal and moral issues. Morality is something which individuals decide for themselves. I think the Right to did Life inspired motion and those who back it are very keen to impose their morals on other It is also worth noting that many drugs that are brought into this country from fair overseas are trialled under the auspices of the Australian government. We do not see motions moved on those issues. I suspect this is one that is mainly directed at those legal and moral issues. Let us look first at the Victorian trials. were being carried out, and will continue to be carried out, under the clinical trials notification system. This system emphasises the regulation of clinical trials by local ethics committees and they are acting in accordance with the NHMRC guidelines. Under the scheme it is the primary responsibility of each sponsoring institution, through an institutional ethics committee, to review, approve and enforce documents relating to informed consent. That may not be ideal. As we have seen, the ethics committee in this particular case did fall short. But, if you do not like the system, change the system.",23
21,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,That is up to you; you're in government.,24
22,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"You can move a motion along those lines as well, if you want to. As has been noted, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has acted in this case because it needs to be seen in the public interest that everything is being done, IS transparent, and is not only being done correctly but seen to be done correctly. The problem in this particular case was that the minister of religion who was on this ethics committee was not a regular attendee. He did not put his full weight behind the work of this committee. He has now left the committee and the Reverend Brian Carey from the Uniting Church has taken his place. The committee is now carrying out the work which it has been charged to do and will be reporting back within the next few weeks. That committee is now doing the job it should have done. It is a question of whether or not it was correct in the first place. I say it is a question of being seen to be correct. The minister has acted quite properly to see that that happens. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said that the trials have been highly questionable. The reality is that the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) has looked at all of these things, and everything-the importation of the drugs and the carrying out of the trials-is within the law. No law has been broken in order that these trials should take place. All the legal requirements have been met. As we know, the Right to Life organisaThey tion brought a legal challenge recently and that was thrown out of court. One of the other issues that the member has put forward in his motion which he did not speak to was an accusation that the gynaecologists who are working on these trials have been involved in the pituitary hormone program which operated and which we now know has had disastrous effects on a lot of people. The reality is that a high proportion of some of the most prominent Australian gynaecologists and obstetricians were involved in some way in that particular program. That does not eliminate them from working on any other program. Those were not trials. Therefore, they were not carried out in the same rigorous way these trials are. However, the Minister for Human Services and Health has asked the department to examine any links between the two issues. The relevance of any links would need to be established before any action was taken. Again, I think this is a scare tactic. We have already dealt with the law. The honourable member has statedMr Filing interjecting",24
23,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"I am going on to elaborate on that if you will permit me. The member has said that these trials contravene laws in New South Wales and Victoria. As I have said, the Right to Life organisation intended to take this to court. It had not even reached that stage before it was thrown out. The Attorney-General's Department has looked at the matter very carefully and the trials have been found not to contravene the laws of either of those states. However, those laws are the responsibility of the states and if the states see just cause they can try to do something about it. The final part of the member's motion is that this drug should be banned. The only reason I can think of for banning the drug is that it will take away the joy of the Right to Life organisation to picket abortion clinics, because a lot more women will not be going to those clinics to have surgical abortions as they will be able to handle the situation much more easily. The members who are speaking on this bill would have received a letter from an organisation called Women Hurt by Abortion. This letter outlines the psychological trauma which is experienced by women who have undertaken abortions. There is absolutely no doubt that there is psychological and physical trauma for women who undergo abortions. There are very few women-and none that I have ever known of or have known-who have undertaken an abortion without looking at the situation very carefully and undertaking counselling. If we need to enforce more counselling prior to women making that decision, making that choice, so be it. The reality is that when a woman is pregother nant her hormones change and the trauma attached to the physical changes which hapmiscarriage-nausea, pen after an abortion are significant. course, the emotions are also brought into play. That is very important. The letter, pointing out the emotional trauma from ment, abortion, then goes on to tell us we should ban this drug to save more women through that trauma. That is the purpose of the letter. The reality is that if women use this drug they will not get to the stage where trauma is evident. They will not be carrying a foetus for one month, two months or even three months. There will not changes that are effected through the pregnancy. I think the letter defeats its whole purpose. I did not want this debate to be one about abortion but the honourable member for feminists. Moore has brought it into the argument. statistics show us that in the last triennium-I think it was the 1988 triennium-there were no deaths in this country from abortion. Prior to that, there were 45 a year. Most of those women in desperation went to backstreet not people who gave them unsafe and unclinical abortions, and they suffered greatly from it, both physically and psychologically. We overcome that by the new, safe procedures that are allowed, and anything else that help women to make educated and informed choices is definitely preferable. As I have said before, this is a women's health issue and I doubt if many gentlemen on the other side-I notice none of your women are speaking on this topic-have sat with women who have gone through some of those backstreet abortions waiting to have a miscarriage which has been induced by several feet of rubber tubing being inserted into the uterus. I suggest you would want to look at safer and more practical ways of doing it. The honourable member has also talked about the side effects. He has described them graphically. The information I have from the trials overseas is quite to the contrary. So far one woman has died after taking RU486, and she was a woman who had considerable other problems which contributed to her death. The side effects are said to be the normal side effects which would come from a fatigue and other side Of effects such as those. We obviously have different sources for our research. I suggest in that yours is based on an emotional assesswhich is fairly typical of the Right to Life organisation which has no doubt fed you going all this information. I thoroughly reject the motion put before the House. As I said at the beginning, this is that a women's health issue. I suggest that the gentlemen on the other side ought to consult some of their female colleagues and some be the hormonal female doctors",24
24,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"Some feminist colleagues, too.",25
25,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"That is always the answer. It is always the feminist. Ordinary women do not have a chance. We are always labelled as One of your colleagues, who is not The in the chamber at the moment, calls us feminazis. I have no doubt that when the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) is here, he will talk along those lines. But this is not a feminist issue; it is a women's issue. It is just feminists who find themselves in that situation; it is ordinary working women who, in the past, have not been able to afford to go have to an expensive private clinic, who have sought other remedies and who have died as can a result-or left themselves infertile. So anything that can give women safer choices ought to be supported.",25
26,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"I will deal with the vacuous comments made by the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) in her contribution to what is a serious matter for women, not only in Australia but in the world generally. I will first deal with the tone of what she said, which was that somehow this is simply a moral argument and is motivated by those who have some belief in a pro-life cause. If one looks at the debate in this country on this issue over the last year or more, one will see that those who have been at the forefront of the debate have not been those from the pro-life cause but those who might be regarded as being of a feminist characterisation, who believe that this is an outrage and a betrayal of women. That is what I shall deal with. There are two principal ethical issues in relation to this matter. The first relates to lack of consent of the women in the trial. As one who practised in this area and had some degree of experience in drawing up consent forms, I think that if one could design a consent form which was more to provide some advocacy for the course of action that the women were meant to follow, rather than providing them with information about what the consequences might be, one could not come up with a better consent form than the one from the Monash Medical Centre and the Victorian Family Planning Association. What it says about side effects is that there might be some cramps and bleeding similar to a heavy period and, more rarely, there may be nausea, headache, vomiting, fainting or tiredness. The symptoms, if they occur, are usually due to Misoprostol-Misoprostol being one of the two components. RU486 alone is unreliable as an abortifacient. It fails when used by itself in at least one-third of cases and, even where it is used with a prostaglandin, there is a five per cent failure rate. That means that one in 20 women have to then go through a surgical abortion to follow up this medical attempt. The synthetic prostaglandin, Misoprostol, is one of the most potent chemicals known to the human body. It is administered to the human body of these guinea pig women in doses thousands of times higher than the body is usually accustomed to-and it persists in the body for many hours. The effect of the RU486 and the prostaglandin is a series of side effects, some of which have been explained by my colleague the member for Moore (Mr Filing). In a recent paper Dr Lynette Dumble, who is in favour of abortion but says it ought to be carried out in a manner which is safe and which does not betray women in this manner, set out a whole list of side effects and said: Additionally, RU 486/prostaglandin-induced abortion requires more intense medical supervision than conventional suction curettage or vacuum aspiration because of the potential cardiovascular side-effects from the two chemicals. But nowhere on the consent form is there any reference to the potential cardiovascular side effects of these two chemicals. She goes on the to list a whole range of other side effects, none of which are set out on the consent form. She also deals with the long-term side effects and says that to this day they are unknown. She said: One experiment indicated that RU 486 has a destructive effect on the uterine lining that facilitates the development of genital infection. She suggested: ... this cervical side-effect of RU 486 warranted further investigation. Should RU 486 have a similar effect in women undergoing abortion, it might well increase their risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease which is a known cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The manufacturer of the drug, Searle, put out a statement, which said in part; Searle is not involved in, and in no way endorses, the study of misoprostol as an abortifacient, either separately or in combination with other medical therapies. In fact, labelling for misoprostol contains prominent warnings and contraindications against use by pregnant women. Searle does not intend to research the use of misoprostol in abortion. It is Searle's earnest intent that misoprostol not be used for any indication than that which we promote So the manufacturer of the drug dissociates itself from this trial. That is one of the major ethical issues. There has been absolutely no informed consent and no outline of the risks which, as the honourable member following me in this debate will know, the High Court in Rogers and Whittacker said ought to be outlined. This is simply a disgrace. (Time expired)",25
27,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"MCEwen) (1.41 p.m.)It is very strange that shortly after the honourthis able member for Moore (Mr Filing) had his motion listed on the Notice Paper for debate in this House today that letters magically started being distributed throughout Australia to all members of the Right to Life organisation and associated groups. It is very strange and very odd that this suddenly occurred without warning after the motion was placed on the Notice Paper. One must draw the conclusion that the proponents of this motion are the Right to Life type organisations. That became very clear today when, at the start of his speech, the honourable member sought to amend the motion by adding the words 'an abortive'. That part of the motion was deliberately hidden from this House until it suddenly came out from behind the smokescreen today.",27
28,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,The member is making a gross reflection on my wording of the motion by saying that I hid part of it. I ask him to withdraw.,27
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Nehl)Order! There is no point of order. If you wish to make a personal explanation you can do it at another time.,27
30,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"That is the truth of the matter. This amendment was not put before the Selection of Bills Committee of this House. Out of the blue this gentleman wanted to move an amendment to the motion to add the word 'abortive'; it came into the debate late. I have been iriundated with letters from people I know to be Right to Life members. I know who they are because Margaret Tighe campaigned against me in 1987. My vote went up 1.7 per cent-in my Catholic booths, I might add. I asked Margaret to come back and campaign against me again because she is very good at gaining additional votes for me. This debate is not about the pharmacological value of this drug. The honourable member for Moore is an ex-policeman, not a pharmacological expert. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is a lawyer and has no training in the therapeutic use of drugs. None of the speakers in this debate today can give any evidence based on their own knowledge and experience of what drug is about because they do not know. They have to get information about this drug from somewhere so where does it come from? It comes from Margaret Tighe and the Right to Life organisation, the first group to raise this issue in this country. Before Right to Life raised the issue here it was a non-debate. The honourable gentleman has exposed himself as an apologist. If he wants to get stuck into the issue of drug use I am happy to join him because I am not a fan of drug companies. We should raise the question of the use of oestrogen as a contraceptive because it causes side effects in women. It is as equally risky and equally dangerous as this drug. The member should amend his motion to include the banning of oestrogen and contraceptives. One of Margaret Tighe's great aims in life is not only to control those women who are pregnant but also to control those women who do not want to get pregnant. From the evidence we know that the debate is much broader and more sinister. It is a sneaky, cheeky way to involve the Right to Life organisation and the moralists of the opposition who believe that women's lives, their sexual activity and their hormones should be controlled. It has been clearly established that that is the motive behind this motion. This drug has been registered in France, the United Kingdom and Sweden. It is being used by hundreds of thousands of women around the world. One death has been recorded. That is a fact; it is unarguable. That one recorded death was of a woman who had had 14 previous pregnancies and was a heavy smoker. Where is your evidence of this drug's danger? It is non-existent. All drugs have side effects. As I said, if you want to debate drugs, let us debate them. I am no great fan of drug companies or the massive drugs being used in this country. We are a pill-popping nation, which is to be deplored. We should be arguing that there should be fewer drugs, not more. I am happy to agree with you on that basis, but you cannot hide behind the smokescreen. You cannot run away. You are all exposed as being friends of Margaret Tighe and Right to Life. Next time a spina bifida baby is born in Melbourne, I bet you will go down there, join Father Eugene O'Hearn and support Margaret Tighe's atrocious behaviour in that case. You are all exposed.",27
31,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"I am quite happy to be exposed, to use the words of the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), on this issue. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)-Not here, you are not.",28
32,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"Not literally; but I am happy to stand up and be counted. I am very concerned that the member for MCEwen should so denigrate the activities of Right Life and Margaret Tighe in particular. We still have in this country a democracy, although with those on the other side I do not know for how much longer. There is such a thing as freedom of speech, and there is a legitimate place for organisations such as Right to Life and any other organisation. But apparently now, with the way this country is going with the totalitarian agenda that those opposite have, before too long some of us will be prevented or intimidated from exercisat ing our right to speak to whom we like about what we want to speak to them about. Indeed, the whole prospect of our continuing to have freedom of speech is under threat. I congratulate the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for raising this issue. It takes guts to stand up in this place and raise tough issues such as this and to talk about them on behalf of the many people in the Australian community who would have the same sort of view. Aspersions have been cast on their motivations by speakers on the other side who want to talk about this as being some sort of sinister debate, yet it is an important debate. We are talking in this place, as we have done on occasions in the past, about the killing of unborn babies. Government members come into this place and try to put us down and make us feel embarrassed about even talking about it in the parliament of Australia. The member for Moore has courage to raise this matter here. I congratulate him. I support him and his motion. I support the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) as well. He and the member for Moore have been consistently prepared to come in here and protect certain rights. In a day of political correctness government members want to lambaste us about the rights of people, yet we are protecting the rights of unborn babies. Of all the causes they may want to take up, the protection of the rights of unborn babies ought to have some priority. But they do not because they do not happen to fit in with their brand of political correctness which they want to impose on us in this place. Frankly, I think most people in Australia are fed up with it. We will come in here to and we will defend our right to talk about matters that are important to us. The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) mentioned me in her speech and preempted some of the things that I might have had to say in the very short time that I have to speak. She claims that this is a women's health issue. I suppose she does that to differentiate it from a men's health issue. It is a health issue and one which women are concerned about. The fact that this issue came up all on those grounds alone was that there were concerns. Yet we are hearing this afternoon from government speakers, rather than their supporting this motion, that there are not any concerns. The plain fact is that there were concerns. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) recognised those concerns latterly, after a considerable amount of pressure was applied to her. It was a difficult issue for the champion of the feminist cause-those who supported this issue were jumping around in Hobart, trumpeting the great victory it had for women-to be consistent on this matter and champion the cause of a health issue that affected women. She found that very difficult to do, yet she finally recognised those concerns. I wrote to the minister for health on 3 August, expressing my concerns about the trials being currently undertaken in Australia of the so-called abortion pill RU486, but she did not answer. I again wrote to her on 30 September, asking for a response to my original letter. I still do not have a response to it. I have read in the newspaper what her response has been, but I would appreciate it if she would write to me and let me know formally what her position is on the testing of this so-called abortion drug. Mr Ronaldson-Don't hold your breath.",28
33,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"I will not hold my breath, because I have been dealing with the member for Fremantle since she became health minister and I have a lot of unanswered correspondence. There is, quite obviously, a moral dimension to this debate. We do not need to be told that by the member for Macquarie. I dispute that morality, as she puts is a matter for the individual. In my view this attitude is a typical cop-out, and it has produced the moral decay which is evident in our country everywhere. The parliament has a responsibility to set standards and to debate what those standards ought to be. Under Labor it has not done so, and the government has stood by and watched as the fabric of our society has continued to be ripped apart. Abortion is a difficult issue and the Labor Party has run away from talking about it in this place at every opportunity we have provided to discuss it. (Time expired).",29
34,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"Franklin) (1.51 p.m.}-Behind the claims of 'progressive conservatism', behind the spectacle of opposition leaders wearing jeans on the weekend news and behind the interviews in glossy supermarket magazines, it is reassuring to know that opposite me in this House is the same old gang of Tories out to give abortion the old college try yet again. You lot really are like the last ones to leave a karaoke night, singing some forgotten chart buster of your youth when the rest of the world has long gone home to bed.",29
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member is addressing his remarks to the chair, not 'you lot'.",29
36,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"Thank you. Frustrating though it is to have this argument again, and leaving aside distractions in this debate, there is a serious issue at stake. The chief concern of all participants in this debate should be absolutely unmistakable-it must be the health of women involved in those trials and, more broadly, the implications of those trials for women's health. This is where the motion of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) amazes and disappoints me. For all of the opposition's phoney concern about consent, for all of its phoney concern about regulation, there is nothing in this motion, and indeed nothing in what we have heard in support of this motion, that reveals a real concern with the real matter at hand-the health of women. Those are the hard facts which the moral monitors across the chamber cannot avoid. Of over 100,000 women who have been treated it, with RU486 and Misoprostol, there has been one death, as has been mentioned previously-which was also associated with the concurrent use of Sulprostone-a drug not contemplated for trials in this country. This contrasts with a mortality rate for women who proceed with pregnancy running in the vicinity of five per 100,000 in this country. What is more, no evidence has been provided from any country where trials of RU486 have been conducted of any side effects other than those associated with miscarriage, despite some of the gory details that members opposite have presented to us. There has been no evidence of flow-on effects on later pregnancies and no evidence of damage to women's health stemming from long-term use. Those are the hard facts about women's health in this debate. But that is not what concerns those who support this motion. Their attention wanders to supposed community concern and supposed non-existent scrutiny, rounded out by a good measure of mock outrage. The trials of RU486 have hardly escaped scrutiny up to this point. This parliamentary debate is part of a highly public process which has been carried on for years. Of the 760 drugs being trialled under the clinical trial notification scheme, this is one of the very few to attract such public attention. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that this attention has nothing to do with the trials process and everything to do with an ideological crusade against this particular drug. The CTN scheine is a good one, which is reflected in the fact that it is being considered as the template for Britain's planned reforms in this area. It is ironic that the speakers on this motion raise such a hue and cry about details of consent, because their clear agenda, acknowledged or otherwise, is to remove the possibility of consent, of choice, from all women in this country. At a time when the Labor Party is making historic advances in providing opportunity for women, those opposite are proving that nothing has changed in their ideological bunker since 1944.",29
37,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"I am disappointed in the contributions of those opposite to this debate. I thought we could have had a serious contribution from the other side to debate what is clearly an issue that has raised enormous concern amongst the Australian pUblic. The issue of abortion is a difficult one; it raises very serious moral and ethical issues. Apart from one letter from the Right to Life Association, the other 20-odd letters that I have received have been from constituents within my own electorate, enormously concerned about all of the unanswered questions that relate to this drug, RU486. It is particularly unfair of speakers from the other side to pre-empt what members of this side might say in this debate. The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) wonders whether there are people on this side of the House who have ever counselled people who have gone through an abortion. I have, and there are some serious psychological repercussions for those women and couples-because this is a family issue as well as a women's health issue-that often occur a long time after a child has been aborted, issues of guilt and remorse. I hope that I am entitled to have my own personal convictions, even as a member of parliament. I regard life as something precious and even sacred. I believe that I am entitled to those opinions. I resent the comments by other speakers that for some reason I am not entitled to hold those opinions. Whilst holding those opinions, I recognise that there is a serious ethical debate going on within the community, and people suffering considerable torment. It worries me that as a throw-away society we would regard even the lives of unborn children as something that can also be discarded. I resort to the evidence of those countries that have adopted the use of this drug. Contrary to the contribution of the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the contribution of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), 20 countries have trialled this drug. But I ask the question: why have only three placed it on their markets for regular use? In reading the evidence that comes to us from France, it is frightening to realise that serious medical questions are still being asked about the safety of this drug. I support the call of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) that a ban be placed on this drug until those questions are answered. They are fair and reasonable questions that ought to be asked. They are certainly questions that this House should ask because it is an issue in the public interest. Certainly this is a women's health issue, but it is also a family issue. I am not a supporter of abortion on demand. I think it is time that families asked themselves reasonable questions about what their family planning responsibilities are. Reading the evidence, the way this drug is administered in France is frightening. The direction of this drug as it is being promoted is for private demedicalised abortion, which removes from a doctor the offence that he might feel in conducting a surgical abortion to the woman herself-and rightly they can make their own moral decision in that. Reading the guidelines that operate in France, women considering such a drug are advised to live within close proximity of an abortion clinic or within 40 kilometres of a hospital. Those doctors who administer RU486 are required to have extensive medical and recussitation equipment available for their immediate use. There are serious concerns about the lasting ramifications of a drug like this. I want those questions answered before I see a drug like this on the market readily available to the community of Australia and certainly to the electorate that I represent.",30
38,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"Many of the questions and issues involved in this motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) will not be resolved in a 50minute debate in this chamber, but it is certainly a matter of legitimate concern to the parliament and to members of the parliament and I do not think that speakers on this side have suggested otherwise. It is a matter for the consideration of this chamber, this parliament and members. Originally, this motion was not a motion about abortion. All of the elements and issues raised in paragraphs 1 to 5, which precede the conclusion which is drawn in paragraph six, referred to some alleged inadequacies and gave the honourable member for Moore the opportunity to make some personal observations about the circumstances in which those clinical tests of RU486 have been undertaken. Those particular issues that he raised in paragraphs 1 to 5 are matters of some contention and some dispute. My understanding is that most of them have been more than adequately dispelled. So, if that is the position, then paragraph 6, in which the honourable member draws his conclusion, simply does not follow. It was not until the honourable member for Moore started to speak to his motion here today that he raised the question of RU486 as an abortifacient.",30
39,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,Look at paragraph 1.,31
40,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"That is okay. But if the honourable member for Moore was concerned that RU486 was being used or was being developed as an abortifacient, he should have said so. If his concern was that RU486 is an abortifacient and for that reason the clinical tests should be discontinued, he should have said so. He did not say so and he did not introduce that concept until he introduced the motion here this afternoon. The motion was not about the ethics, the morality or the personal or social implications of abortion-until the honourable member for Moore rose to speak to his motion. I know that some other members, including the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), have indicated their concern about abortion. That is quite legitimate. The point I am making is that it was not originally the element of this particular motion. I also wish to raise the matter of the accuracy or otherwise of the claims made in paragraphs one to five and, as well, the substance of some subjective concerns raised by the honourable member for Moore in relation to the issues he has drawn attention to. The original motion moved by the honourable member for Moore did not make abortion the issue. It was not my intention to deal with that issue but I take it on board and accept the points that have been made by both sides of the chamber about this question essentially being one of women's health. I am always a little sensitive about intruding a male's attitude into that in terms of public policy formation. I am very sympathetic to the proposition that women are and should be in command of their own bodies. But one of the essential points is that RU486 is an artificial hormone which is simply designed to ensure that progesteronethe natural hormone which makes it possible for the fertilised egg to implant itself in the wall of the uterus-is ineffective. So I put the proposition to those people who are concerned about abortion that, if this drug were sufficiently refined, it would make it possible to significantly reduce the incidence of abortion because the pregnancy would not take place. You cannot abort a pregnancy that does not exist. A refinement of that particular drug would ensure that a pregnancy does not occur because the fertilised egg would not be implanted in the wall of the uterus. All of the dangers that people have constantly drawn attention to in relation to surgical and other types of abortion would be obviated. To suggest that in the light of this the clinical tests of this particular drug should be brought to an end I think is not particularly suitable, not particularly appropriate. I am sure that those people who have expressed some concern about the nature of this particular drug would have any of their reservations addressed by the development of that drug and its refinement.

46,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) have alleged that somehow there is a sinister aspect in the bringing on of the amendment to this motion. In particular, the member for Charlton comments that the question of abortion was never raised in the original motion. As I have pointed out to him, paragraph 1 quite clearly states 'the risk of side effects of the abortion drug RU486'.

49,Mr LANGMORE,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"I move: That, recognising that: (a) one of the causes of high unemployment is a maldistribution of work in a situation in which many people are working too hard while many others cannot find work; and (b) one of the significant reasons for the maintenance of full employment for much of the post-war period was the gradual reduction in average working hoursthis House urges the Government to establish immediately a task force representative of employers, unions, community organisations, government and experts to study the issue of the organisation of work and to make recommendations which would: (i) allow average hours of full-time work to be reduced as productivity improves and which could also contribute to increasing the security of the growing proportion of the labour force employed in casual work; and (ii) consider both national standards relating to the organisation of work and possibilities for increasing individual choice about working time. People concerned about unemployment commonly suggest reducing working hours and increasing the amount of part-time work as a means for spreading work around more equitably and opening up more jobs. Among the full-time labour force, the average time spent in paid work has increased during the last decade from about 40 hours a week in the early 1980s to nearly 42 hours a week in 1992. Most of that increase occurred during the recession and was apparently mainly due to smaller numbers of employees working more overtime. Over the same period, from the early 1980s to the 1990s, the proportion of people in paid employment for more than 49 hours per week increased from 14 to 18 per cent, which confirms the sense of overwork about which many people complain. Both those statistics suggest that there is scope for reducing the average hours of work and spreading that work around more equitably. Surely there must be some scope for that because so many people complain about overwork, pressure at work, work related stress and lack of leisure. It seems likely that there may be some opportunity for redistribution of work. Whether that is so depends mainly on the preferences of wage earners. There have been several surveys of leisure preferences in Australia and overseas. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found in a 1986 survey that about seven per cent of employees would have liked to work fewer hours for lower pay. However, results vary widely if the question is asked in a different way. When respondents in a survey in Adelaide and Brisbane were asked what they would prefer if over the next four or five years they had the choice of getting increases in real payor more free time-that is, shorter hours or longer holidays-about 35 per cent chose reductions in working time. When those respondents are added to those who already work part time and do not want to increase their hours, nearly half the adult employees in both cities favour giving some kind of time reductions greater priority than money wages. The researchers conclude that there is no justification for dismissing projects for redistribution of work as outdated or irrelevant. I repeat the conclusion that about half the adults in Adelaide and Brisbane would prefer some attention to be given to reduction of hours of work. That suggests that there is real scope for redistribution of work in Australia. There have been similar results to those achieved in Australia from surveys conducted in Europe. Some of the results of very extensive research in Europe show that nine out of 10 full-time respondents worked full time by choice but that one in three hoped or expected to work part time at some stage in the future, a proportion that was significantly higher amongst older people. Another British survey found that one in three full-time employees-men and women-would prefer to work fewer hours each week. Other surveys have shown that part-time workers are happier than those in full-time work and that there is a preference for shorter hours in other countries as well as in Britain. Flexitime was universally welcomed throughout Europe. Many people said that they would like shorter hours but, if they were going to have them, they would prefer to take them as longer holidays rather than a shorter working week. The conclusion drawn by the person who has surveyed all that evidence is that, instead of assuming that a single working time pattern is the ideal, policy makers, managers and trade union negotiators all need to keep in mind the wide variety of people's working time preferences and the relationship between those preferences at the different stages of people's lives. Therefore, the evidence suggests, there is at least some scope for reduction of hours as a means of redistributing work. That contribution would be of value and should be used. A German economist, Hartmut Seifert, comments that it is incontrovertible that the agreed shortening of the working week has had a positive effect on developments in employment. The outcome depends on how productivity gains have been distributed. In Britain, and in Australia, they have commonly been taken as higher pay rather than reductions in working hours. The conclusion from all the evidence which is relevant to Australia is that we should aim to improve working time autonomy by increasing the capacity of employees to control their own daily, weekly and annual working time. There are several large groups that would commonly like to work part-time or for shorter hours. Many mothers, and an increasing number of fathers, would like to have more time with their children, though the strength of this preference varies at different stages of children's growth and depends, in part, on their needs. Both women and men have been increasing the amount of time they spend with their children, and many would like to spend more time with them. Greater flexibility about lifetime working arrangements would enable further increases in the time parents have with their children so as to create a better balance between employment and family life. Many people want different working patterns at different times of their lives. Young people often want to work for longer hours to save for a car, travel or a house. On the other hand, many older people would like to reduce their weekly hours and gradually phase down towards retirement. Most businesses and public authorities could cope with both changes. An automatic option for employees aged over 50 to opt for part-time work should be introduced swiftly. Many people employed in routine production services and in-person services would like to reduce their hours, even if that involved lower pay, in order to enrich their lives with other personally fulfilling, often voluntary, community, cultural and recreational activities. In Europe, both in Sweden and Germany, the social democratic parties are setting an aim of reducing the average working week to 30 hours-a target which they seriously intend to achieve. Australian researchers conclude that a widespread favourable attitude to a future with less work could possibly provide fertile ground for a future interest in moves to reduce work time generally and variably in a regulated way in the interests of solidarity with those being pushed out of the work force. It is worth remembering that the postwar decades of full employment were also a period when average working hours fell. It would be quite possible for the accord partners to agree that a portion of the return from productivity improvement would be taken as a reduction in standard hours. In fact, the ACro supported that approach by resolution at its last national congress. If such a program were adopted, if labour productivity grew between 1993-99 by the same amount as it did between 1984-90 and if half that increase were used to reduce hours rather than to increase pay, and if employment were increased to offset that reduction in hours, then employment would increase by about 150,000 over that six-year period. That is a very important addition to employment than would otherwise occur, and that is something we ought to be seeking. Therefore, I propose that this House call on the government to appoint a committee of inquiry to study this issue. The committee of inquiry would comprise employers, unions, community representatives and experts who could represent all the important points of view. The change would be possible only if there were general agreement for doing it. It is important to draw in all the social partners to ensure that they are all consulted fully about what is involved. If that consultation occurred, it is quite possible that there would be general agreement for a gradual reduction in working hours as productivity improved without loss of pay. That would make a significant addition to increasing employment opportunities for those who are currently unemployed. I, therefore, strongly commend this motion to the House.",32
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,Is the motion seconded? Mr Tanner-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later stage.,34
51,Mr CHARLES,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"It is a bit of a joke, a bit of a giggle, for the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)-a member of the political party in government in this country that has overseen the greatest unemployment misery in the history of this great nation, has overseen the greatest fall in living standards in the last half a century, has overseen all of this anguish, agony, misfortune and suffering-to come into this place and say, 'I've got a simple solution for you: let's regulate employment.' I think the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has done a pretty good job of re-regulating the employment market with the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1994. He has put back more regulations and given the unions more power and more control over all aspects of employment to the mob which is in partnership with you, in accord with you, on that side of the House to give you the opportunity to do more to regulate the employment market. Why does the member for Fraser not simply convince the Minister for Industrial Relations to go along with Bill Kelty-they are in partnership--and write some new rules that say, 'We'll have a 30-hour working week'? You just said in your brief contribution that the ACro was all for reducing working hours, letting people have more leisure time and in particular more holiday time. I believe you said the surveys showed that. That is desirable. But how on earth are you going to regulate that and keep people's incomes at a level so they can still afford to live? You have also overseen the greatest disbursement of income in the history of this country. There are now more wealthy and more poor and fewer of the middle-class people, fewer of those in middle Australia, able to have single-family, one-parent working incomes because of the economic mess that you have made of this country. And you have the audacity to come in here and say, 'Let's create another committee. We will get the unions, which are on top of the list, together with the employers and decide how everybody can have fewer working hours. That will improve the economy.' If the honourable member honestly believes that the people want fewer working hours, then that is available to those people. All we need to do is convince the Minister for Industrial Relations to really deregulate the labour market. Then the people in a workplace--those who want shorter working hours, according to the member for Fraser--can go along to management and say, 'We would like to work less time. As our productivity improves, why don't we talk about reducing our working time and not changing the level of our wages, regardless of what happens to inflation?' If management agrees, then they can strike a deal and do it. But that would be voluntary, without regulation and without solidarity between the union movement and your side of politics. You used that word 'solidarity' too, did you not? Many people in Australia today complain about overwork. That is amazing. There are still 850,000 people out there complaining their heads off about not having any work at all. It seems to me that is the important issue that we need to address in this place. It is an issue so serious that someone will have to address it positively in the very near future. With the way the economy is going at the moment, as sure as God made little green apples, we are headed for another boom cycle which will tum into a bust-and the member for Fraser is the economist-probably more quickly than any of the government forecasters, any of those from Treasury or the Reserve Bank have been willing to forecast to this point. We will head for another bust. Unemployment will go back up again. You know as well I do that every time over the last three decades this country has gone into a recessionary period, when we come back out we find we have a higher level of long term unemployment than before we went in a higher level of structural long-term unemployment than we had in the previous recessionary and growth cycle. So we are left with that legacy today. I give credit to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for making an attempt to address the issue of the long-term unemployed, for trying to give them relevant skills. I am not sure he is going about it in the right way, but I give him for trying to address that important issue. However, the only thing that will really, ultimately put those people back to work is real jobs. If we could cut the working week down to 30 hours a week, theoretically I suppose we could transpose those hours to make enough jobs for all the long-term unemployed, excepting that they lack the skills, the educational requirements of the work that might therefore be made available. If the people who are in work were so happy about that, they would have been willing to forgo wage rises over the last decade to make sure that their comrades in work were not without work. But no-one has been willing to do that. The unions, the trade union movement most of all, are responsible for policies which look after those who are employed, not those who are unemployed. If this government motion is to be taken seriously, then I would have thought that the ACTU and all of the super unions would have been in here agitating day after day for a reduction in working hours with no change in the hourly rates of those wages-in other words, a reduction in working hours and a reduction in take-home payin order that the 850,000 who are still left out on the unemployed queues are put back to work again. I would have thought the unions would have been agitating for that continually, but I have not heard of that. I have heard no proposal from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to cut working hours, regulate working hours again, put working hours back into the awards. The awards which are the foundation for this new bargaining system all say that 30 hours is the maximum working week. 'Nobody shall work overtime'-why do we not try that? That sounds like something that might have been tried in Austria in about 1925: regulate working hours, regulate wages, regulate when people can take holidays, and let the state control all of it. Or perhaps the unions-in accord with the government, of course-ould control it all for us. The member for Fraser is an economist. He is not a practical bloke who has lived out there in the real world where people today credit have to survive on lower real wages and lower real incomes than they were receiving a decade ago. That is the problem. People do desire to maintain their standard of living. Families have to send their kids to school and put clothes on their backs. The kids want to watch television and they want a video. They would like to go on a holiday once in a while. But they cannot do that when the cost of living has increased more than their wages have increased. The member for Fraser knows demonstrably that it is his government that has been responsible for the fall in real wages in Australia. If, along with that fall, there had been an increase in leisure time and some ability to afford to enjoy that leisure time-a magic pudding to provide the income for those people who have forgone those working hours to be able to live better lives and enjoy those holidays-that would have been a terrific idea. But the regulation idea, the old socialist idea 'We will regulate the economy; we will regulate employment; we will tell people how long they will work, how they shall work their lives', just does not work. There is a simple solution to all this. The simple solution is to really deregulate the labour market. Give us real labour market reform and let people make their own choices about what working hours they would like, how hard they would like to work and how productive they can be, in order to enable their firms to pay them a living which is greater than it would be today for the same hours of work. That is the way to get productivity up. That is the way to allow people to have greater leisure time and shorter hours of work if that is what they prefer. But let us not try the old regulation game. It did not work in the past, it does not work today, and it is definitely not going to work in the future.",34
52,Mr TANNER,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"Melbourne) (2.26 p.m.)The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) will probably go down as the representative in this House who made only one speech in his time here. Unfortunately, he has made the same speech about 300 times. No doubt we will have to put up with him making it again. The quality of his contribution does not improve. He still thinks that the employment market is as simple as the market for used cars, that it has no special features over and above simple markets for basic products. I do not want to spend much time refuting some of the rather asinine comments that he made. He mentioned the fact that the rate of structural unemployment coming out of the latest recession is significantly higher than the rate of structural unemployment which came out of the previous recession-quite true. He failed to mention that the degree of flexibility now in the labour market is also significantly higher than it was previously. The labour market is less regulated than it was in 198283. Therefore, his basic premise that labour market regulation is, in effect, the sole cause of unemployment in Australia is patently wrong. There are a number of more substantial issues that need to be addressed in this debate. I commend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for raising this matter in the House. We do not so much have a problem of shortage of work in the community. It is a statistical fact that average hours worked per head of population in this country have been steadily and gradually rising for the past 10 or 15 years. The issue really at stake is the distribution of work. We are seeing a structural change in our economy. Increasingly, the working week is not the traditional 38-hour week-or whatever the particular regulatory hours have been-it is 50, 60 and 70 hours a week. This relates to the diminishing proportion of the blue collar jobs in the economy and to major structural change which, we would all have to acknowledge, we do not yet fully understand the implications of. The point is that the issues have got to be addressed. The proposal the honourable member for Fraser has put forward is clearly one very intelligent way of pursuing these issues. Reducing working hours in the way that the honourable member for La Trobe has been referring to is clearly not a solution. He was caricaturing very severely the arguments that are put up--to the extent that he actually managed to address them at all-by people such as the honourable member for Fraser. If we were to simply pass a law saying that the maximum number of working hours would be 30 hours a week, in most instances the end result would be that overtime would increase; it would not lead to new employees being put on. Existing employees working 38 hours per week would end up working 30 hours a week and eight hours in overtime, perhaps plus additional overtime that they are already working. That is not the case in all instances but certainly in many instances. Simply saying that bringing down the number of hours in the working week will solve the problem is clearly not correct. That is not what the honourable member for Fraser is saying. We have to take a much more intelligent look at this issue. For example, I strongly commend the government for taking an initiative on paid maternity leave. We need to pursue it further to give people the option to be out of the work force for parenting purposes for longer than they are often able to at the moment-not for five or 10 years, but at least for a year or two--with decent income support which then opens up other employment opportunities. There are also issues such as oncosts that need to be addressed. There are a lot of myths, particularly in business areas, about oncosts. I have been an employer. In my position of union secretary I had to deal with a $2Y2 million budget and 30-odd staff. We had to do oncost calculations when deciding whether we could put somebody else on. Generally, oncosts accounted for about 16 or 17 per cent on top of the salary. But oncosts are not the only issue in deciding whether an organisation can afford to put somebody on. These are the sorts of things that need addressed in considering the future of employment and structures of employment in this country. Getting unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000, which the government's white paper commits us to doing, will be a very difficult task. That be the lowest level of unemployment we have had in 25 years if we achieve it. It is also worth pointing out that in the 1950s and 1960s we had an artificially low level of unemployment because most women were excluded from the work force by a variety of means-something that is no longer the case to anywhere near the same extent today-and because we now have an internationalised economy whereby the pressures on our economy are far greater. If the government can succeed in its endeavours to get unemployment below five per cent by the year 2000 it will be a tremendous achievement. Certainly, we have to look at working hours and at how work is performed in the way that the honourable member for Fraser has indicated. I commend the motion to the House.",36
53,Mr MCARTHUR,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"The assertion made by the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) that some people in Australia in 1994 are working too hard and taking jobs from others is amazing. This is based on the premise that the number of jobs is fixed and must be shared around as equitably as possible. What would be the arbitrary be limits placed on the entry of women into the work force, the number of migrants in the work force and the effect of new technology on jobs? What is really holding back employment is not hard working people but the government's policies on payroll tax, centralised wage fixing and unfair dismissal laws. In the case of Hogan v. Wimmera College of TAFE in 1993, it was held that the termination of employment after the expiry of a fixed-term contract was harsh, unjust and unreasonable. The tribunal held that the employer had the responsibility to remind the employee of the nature of the contract as the expiry date approached and bore the onus of ensuring that the employee was fully aware that the fixed-term contract was not to be to be renewed. In this case, re-employment was ordered with complete back pay. What a remarkable situation. Many small businesses are now left asking, 'If you cannot fire employees under reasonable circumstances, why would you hire them in the first place?' will Where will the new jobs come from when that is an example of the sorts of situations that arise from this government's unfair dismissal laws? With the floating of the exchange rate in 1983 by the present government-for which I commend it-it was inevitable that there would be a more flexible approach to the price of labour. To compare Australian labour costs with other nations, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has indicated, we need to look at the direct labour cost plus the oncosts. That is the key to our competitiveness with Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European common market-and I suggest to the member for Melbourne that oncosts are about 40c in the dollar, not 17c he was suggesting.  Ruthven of Ibis, who is a very respected commentator on jobs and employment trends. He has been making observations on these matters for the last 20 years and I very agree with them. He suggests that the price labour in Australia should not be fixed, awards are outdated and that like all cartelsthat be they in oil, tin or even wool-they will eventually break down. That is what is actualthe ly happening to the price of labour in Australfor is as awards break down. It is even encourmember aged by this government. The direct labour costs, as I have mentioned before, plus the oncosts-in the form of work care, payroll tax, superannuation and long service leave-are a very crippling factor benches. superimposed on employers by governments. They add to the competitive pressure we face internationally with our direct labour costs. There should be greater flexibility and demarcation. Companies like ALCOA and CRA are leading the way with the introducCommons tion of flexible annualised wages and condia tions compared with award rates and weekly salaries that bring about demarcations related to award structures. There should be the removal of to working arrangements: the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission. We on this will side of the parliament have been advocating this for a number of years. The government be has now agreed to the philosophical thrust of this issue, but it is not game to remove the unions or the Industrial Relations Commission from these arrangements. Enterprise agreeAustralian ments between employees and management are the way to go to ensure that further jobs are created. This will result in greater flexiby bility in the particular industry's operations. Mr Ruthven has said on a number of occasions that new service industries should be aware that jobs will be created. It will not be an arbitrary committee that will create opportunities. There will be new jobs in tourism, information systems and financial and household services, such as lawn mowing, laundry services and so on. This change jobs, which will take place over the next 20 the or 30 years, will provide new jobs-not another committee or a central direction from a government which is committed to supporting trade unions and centralised wage fixing.",37
54,Mr SAWFORD,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"I am pleased to support the motion much moved by the honourable member for Fraser of (Mr Langmore). This motion raises matters in that the very important debate on unemployment have not had an adequate hearing in this country. I am extremely disappointed to hear contributions of the honourable member La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). They have not read the motion or listened to the member for Fraser. They have totally missed the point, which perhaps provides the evidence as to why they are on the opposition Patricia Hewitt, the Deputy Director of the Institute Public Policy Research in London, author of the influential book About time: The no revolution in work and family time and the author of a memorandum to the House of employment committee, presented widely commentated paper at the European jobs summit in October 1993 in which she argued that a reduction in working time cannot solve the problem of unemployment third parties on its own. She said: . . . no analysis of unemployment and employment be adequate unless it takes account of the rapid changes in the structures of working time and working lifetimes; and no employment debate will complete if it omits working reorganisation. John Moorhouse from the University of South Australia pointed out that, according to the Bureau of Statistics, 20 million hours of overtime are worked in Australia. Since 1978, overtime has increased for males over 70 per cent and for females by over 100 per cent. Simplistically, 20 million hours is equivalent to a total of 500,000 40-hour a week jobs. It is understood that not all of those hours are paid overtime; nevertheless, serious consideration could lead to the release of perhaps 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. However, it appears that that proposition got short shrift from the expert committee on in employment opportunities and the National ,Institute of Labour Studies through Mark .Wooden and Professor Judith Sloane. Wooden said that the idea had 'simple intuition' and Sloane described it as an 'idle notion of work sharing'. This is somewhat strange as Wooden acknowledges that the trend in average hours worked by full-time employees has been moving upward. He states that the proportion of full-time workers working in excess of 40 hours has grown from 30 per cent to over 40 per cent, and that 20 per cent of workers now work more than 49 hours a week. He contends that this may be because of multiple job holdings which now represent 4.3 per cent of the work force. Numerically that is around 150,000 people. Wooden also states that 16lh per cent of workers work paid overtime: 3.8 million paid hours worked by full-time employees. If we redistributed that it would amount to almost 100,000 jobs. The truth probably is that the potential number of jobs from the redistribution of overtime could be as low as 100,000 jobs and up to a theoretical maximum of 500,000 jobs. Despite some experts stating that reducing working hours and job sharing is naive simplicity, it is happening in Australunemployment is and overseas. The Commonwealth Bank introduced a job sharing scheme three years ago and now has more than 900 employees in the scheme. Amcor, a fibre packaging company in my electorate, 18 months ago had a work force of 190 people working 12-hour shifts. It has changed to eight-hour shifts-voluntarily negotiated not regulated-and has employed another 50 people over 18 months, an increase of over 25 per cent. British Airways has also done it. Perhaps the most revolutionary move to reduce working hours has occurred in Germany through an accord between employers and unions. The shorter working week has increased the number of mainly full-time jobs by between 250,000 and 300,000. The Volkswagen accord is worthy of comment. After marathon bargaining sessions at Volkswagen plants in Germany, workers will put in 20 per cent fewer hours but will get only a 10 per cent pay cut. That agreement took effect from 1 January this year. The so-called experts argue that reducing working hours will reduce productivity. That is arrant nonsense. Between 1881 and 1981 the lifetime hours worked by British men fell by nearly half-from 154,000 hours over 56 years to 88,000 over 48 years. It is lower now. But in that time productivity did not fall; it rose. Job sharing and reducing working hours schemes will not on their own solve the unemployment problem. However, these schemes can make a significant difference and must be analysed and seriously considered in the unemployment debate. Implementing such schemes is not without problems. However, voluntary reductions or negotiated agreements between employers, unions and workers do work. (Time expired)",38
55,Mr WAKELIN,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"It is with pleasure that I rise today to speak on this motion of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), which has considerable merit. His motion states: ... many people are working too hard while many others cannot find work . . . This theme has been echoed around Australia as part of the continuing debate on our tragic problem. Notwithstanding the Labor government's role in Australia's unemployment problem today, this is an issue which now demands a bipartisan approach and a lot of lateral thinking. Writing in the Australian, the noted social commentator Hugh Mackay asked: ... isn't there something bizarre, if not obscene, about so many of us complaining of being overworked when so many others simply can't find any work at all? Mr Mackay and many others, including two gentlemen in my electorate, Mr Terry Krieg and Mr Cecil Forbes, believe that we are being blinkered by the concept of the five-day working week and a full-time job for all. Mr Mackay stated: Whatever happened to the dream that one day the march of technology and the gradual reform of the workplace would allow us to work less and develop some of the other dimensions of our lives which are neglected until we retire? My constituents, Mr Krieg and Mr Forbes, believe we should seriously look at the concept of increased job sharing. This does not necessarily mean two people sharing one job; it could mean 10 people sharing nine jobs. I was fortunate enough to spend some time with Mr Forbes in Port Lincoln last week. When you analyse the amount of government expenditure and the net cost to all of us, you realise that the very worthy aim of full employment is negligible. Unemployment is a problem which the whole community shares and which the whole community must be prepared to address. We cannot continue to let one million Australians languish on the unemployment lines with the associated social dislocation which follows. The unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, often lack confidence and become depressed about not functioning within the most important sphere of modem life-the job-which we have attached so much importance to. It will now take a fundamental shift in attitudes for us to introduce job sharing on a massive scale or, as Mr Mackay has suggested, even a reduction in the working week. I know the honourable member for Fraser has had a long held and urgent concern about our unemployment crisis. In a book published by the honourable member, he states: Australia has . . . reached a time of choice. We must decide either that a high level of unemployment is inevitable and make the innumerable adjustments which follow, or that we are determined to ensure that paid work is available for who want it, and implement a strategy which is adequate over time to effectively achieve that result. Given the central and crucial importance work in human life there is surely no serious choice.",39
56,Mr SPEAKER,MALDISTRIBUTION OF WORK,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Central Land Council",40
57,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In February this year in this place, I referred the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to accusations of heavy-handed action by the Central Land Council in the  Parker and Mrs Jilau Parker and the community store they ran at Kintore. That store was closed amidst suggested discrimination against Jilau and her Aboriginal homelands and of restrictive trade practices by the Central Land Council. In a letter sent to me dated 21 February, minister Tickner acknowledged these concerns and indicated that he was seeking an updated briefing from ATSIC on the matters raised. Eight months later, I have received no further comments from the minister. Jilau and Paul drove to Toowoomba from northern New South Wales last week especially to see me and to provide me with papers that they have submitted to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission urging remedial action and again raising concerns about their treatment. This case not only raises question marks about the specific handling of the Parker case but also poses some major constitutional issues on Aboriginalland rights. I again ask the minister: when are we going to have some answers? National Roads and Motorists Association: Share Float",40
58,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I take this opportunity to encourage all of those all people among the 1.8 million members of the NRMA in New South Wales who have not voted to please get their votes in. They should of do two things. Firstly, they should indicate that if the yes vote is successful they want to collect their shares. Secondly, they should indicate that their vote, in connection with the possible corporatisation of the NRMA, is a no vote. They should make that clear. If they do not have Jane Singleton'S or Richard Talbot's NRMA numbers, they should send their proxy through to the chairman and hope that their vote will be exercised in the way that they have indicated. I emphasise that the Trade Practices Commission found it necessary to go to the Federal Court to require the NRMA to amend the advertising it was using because it was misleading. Two days ago the Sydney Morning Herald, in referring to this possible float, came to this conclusion in its editorial: If there is a change, will it benefit members? In the past six months it has become increasingly clear that it almost certainly will not-except for the short-term benefits from the allocation of shares or cash. The longer the broader debate about the future of the NRMA has gone on, the clearer it has become that if it is corporatised, there will be inevitable pressures on it. These will in time ensure increases in the amounts payable by customers of the proposed corporation for the same services now enjoyed by members of the present association. The editorial concluded: That should persuade members to vote against the proposed changes. (Time expired) Bougainville",40
59,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The recent cease-fire agreement in Papua New Guinea between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Bougainville interim government was an enormous step towards ending the six-year war. However, Australia's support of the blockade of Bougainville since 1990 has been a shameful part of our history. Thousands have died as a result of the lack of food, clothing and medical supplies. The Australian government now seems to be doing its best to sabotage the peace talks. Without the consultation required by the cease-fire agreement, the government has taken command and control of the peacekeeping force, is sending ships to the Bougainville-Solomon Islands border, has taken no action to lift the blockade and has supported Papua New Guinea defence force movements contrary to the agreement. All this has inspired fears that the cease-fire is simply a pretext. The unnecessarily large number of Australian troops and equipment being sent to Bougainville, as well as the large amounts of ammunition flown to Rabaul, has also fuelled the fears of the leaders of the Bougainville forces that they are being set up. The government may pretend that its silence on human rights with respect to China and Indonesia is part of a more effective 'softly softly' approach to achieve progress, but the world knows different. There is no such excuse in the case of Bougainville. Leader of the Opposition: Approval Rating",41
60,Mr SWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"By whatever measure is used, the last three months have been a disaster for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the coalition parties. From a peak approval rating in the AGB poll of 37 points in early July, the Leader of the Opposition's rating has fallen to 17 in early October-a fall of 20 points in three months. That has got to be a world record probably matched only by Dan Quayle. In that time, the Leader of the Opposition's disapproval rating has risen from 16 to 46-an additional 30 points. He now has a net negative approval rating of minus 29. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) now leads the Leader of the Opposition, 47 to 23. Is it any wonder that Michael Kroger decided earlier last month that he would not take up his party's offer of preselection for one of the safest Liberal Party seats in the country? What Michael Kroger was saying to young Australians interested in serving the country from the Liberal Party side of politics was, 'The Labor government isn't too bad. The country's in reasonable hands, so I'll stop with the merchant bank and make a quid and let the Labor government get on with the job of making this country a fairer and more competitive nation.' The chair of that merchant bank of which Michael Kroger is a member is John Stone. He said in the Financial Review of 29 September that last week's decision by the Liberal Party on the privacy bill 'displayed in all their brutal clarity all the things that are wrong with Mr Downer's leadership-lack of principle, lack of any thoughtful insight into the issues, and consequential inability to articulate and defend a principled position'. That statement is from the chair of Michael Kroger's merchant bank. Mr Stone finished his article in the Financial Review with this statement: It is vital that the leader whom the Liberals now elect should be someone whom . .. they... respect. (Time expired) Baltic States",41
61,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I want to refer to a rather moving experience that you and I shared a couple of weeks ago in the Baltic states. I refer specifically to the visit to the living skills centre in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. We had the national pride and privilege of visiting that living skills centre, which is a centre for the intellectually impaired. Not only was the commitment on the part of the Lithuanian people as they come out of independence reflected, but also the work that some Australians involved in that country-and indeed in Estonia and Latvia-have taken in the particular centre. I refer to those two young LithuanianAustralian ladies from Melbourne and from Adelaide who went to that country under very difficult circumstances in 1990-91 soon after, or at about the time of, independence. Without their skill and dedication, that centre would not be what it is today. All in this House and, indeed, all the nation should be proud of what those two young ladies have done. More generally, I am sure that this House wishes all the parliaments of those three Baltic states the success that they deserve as they move from Soviet occupation to independent status. Australian Grand Prix: Albert Park",42
62,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to use these 90 seconds to tell the people of Australia why Albert Park should not be used for the Australian Grand Prix. Firstly, it is being run by a mate of Jeffrey Kennett. Secondly, Albert Park was permanently reserved for the public back in 1876; it has been a park for a long time. It is the breathing space for Melbourne. It is regarded as one of the most popular Melbourne metropolitan parks. It is a home of amateur sports in Victoria. Albert Park is not the historic or spiritual home of the Australian Grand Prix. The first Australian Grand Prix was held in 1928 at Phillip Island, where the next seven were also held. A proposal to stage the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park as part of the 1934 Melbourne centenary celebration was rejected by the then government. The Australian Grand Prix was held at Albert Park only twice-in 1953 and 1956. In 1958 the government of Henry Bolteone of Mr Kennett's heroes, I must state-put a stop to car races at Albert Park. The grand prix has been held six times at Sandown. The decision by the state government of Victoria to put huge amounts of money into chopping down trees, destroying open space, ruining the golf course there and upsetting the actual sporting facilities is a disgrace. All Victorians should make this point clear to Mr Kennett and his cronies at the next election, whenever it is held. He has put forward a date some time in 1996. I doubt whether he will last that long. (Time expired) Kennett Government",42
63,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to refute the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who spends most of his time in this parliament attacking the Kennett government. I remind members of this House that the Labor government in Victoria bankrupted that state, all by its own efforts. The member for Dunkley continues to come into this parliament and criticise the Premier of Victoria for his positive action in attracting the Grand Prix to Victoria, creating job opportunities and an international event in Melbourne. The member for Dunkley is a Victorian. He spends his whole time in this parliament attacking Premier Kennett with no foundation. He has no regard for the inadequacies of the former Labor administration. I suggest the member for Dunkley sit down, not criticise Premier Kennett and remember very clearly what his Labor government did to Victoria in the 10 years it was in power. It bankrupted the state. It put the whole state into massive debt. Premier Kennett has reversed that to a position of budget balance. ALP Conference Badgerys Creek",42
64,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was very pleased at the recent ALP national conference to note the resolution of the issue surrounding the airports. The issue got a lot of publicity. It was one of those issues that come up from time to time that are difficult to resolve. But as usual, on this side of politics we had the maturity to resolve the issue. The outcome on the airports was excellent. It was particularly good in relation to the future of Badgerys Creek airport. Whatever doubts there might have been about the future of Badgerys Creek, they have been totally removed now. We will have a second Sydney airport, and we will have one before the year 2000. At the same time, genuine fears on this side about privatisation of government assets have been dispelled. In relation to Badgerys Creek, that is great news for western and south western Sydney. The economic and social benefits that will come with Badgerys Creek speak for themselves. There has been great interest in the eventual name we are likely to have for the airport. At a recent meeting of some of my colleagues from western Sydney, we decided we would call for public submissions and comments about what the airport should be called. A number of names have been suggested. There is quite a bit of support for names such as 'Sydney west airport', and 'Lawrence Hargrave airport', as my colleague the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) has proposed. Quite a few other worthy names have been put forward for Sydney's second airport. I encourage any member of this House or of the community to put in a submission about what they think the airport should be called. (Time expired) Baltic States",42
65,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, this is becoming a bit of a monopoly. I refer you and the House to another issue in relation to the Baltic states, and that is the need for a more explicit dialogue between those states and the Russian Federation. You and I and others who were members of a recent delegation saw the extent to which the Russians have left those countries. I just hope the Russian Federation will explore the dialogue in a lot more detail than was apparent during our visit. It is a sensitive issue. I know that is pursuing it. Nevertheless, in relation to some of the residual military establishments that are left there, there needs to be a lot of work done in terms of pollution, in particular at the former Soviet naval base west of Tallin in Estonia, where they are withdrawing the rods from the nuclear reactors at the moment. I only hope that they leave that particular establishment in better condition than the one particular military establishment that you and I and others saw at Klooga, east of Tallin. Kennett Government",43
66,Mr CLEELAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I listened with interest to the speech by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) about the debt situation in Victoria. It seems that the honourable gentleman does not follow the Victorian budget papers or he would understand that the Kennett government has actually added $2.5 billion worth of debt to the Victorian debt situation. So rather than the Kennett government reducing debt, Mr Kennett has increased the state debt by $2.5 billion-and to what purpose? To pay retrenchment packages for over 50,000 Victorians, the bulk of whom have gone to Queensland, taking their money with them. Mr Goss is very happy with this fact because in Victoria we are facing repayment of over $2 billion of additional borrowed money which will be transferred to Queensland. The skills that Victoria has lost and the money that Victoria has lost on this debt have all gone to Queensland. So we will stand here and expose the truth about the mistakes of the Kennett government. Honourable members opposite should read the budget papers through and learn the true debt position of Victoria and who is responsible for it.",43

68,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Tuesday, 27 September 1994, of the it Honourable Sir Nigel Hubert Bowen, AC, KBE, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Parramatta from 1964 to 1973, Attorney-General from 1966 to 1969 and in 1971, Minister for Education and Science from 1969 to 1971, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1971 to 1972 and former Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia from 1976 to 1990, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Nigel Hubert Bowen was born on 26 May 1911 at Summerland, British Columbia. He came to Australia as a young boy, was educated at King's School, Parramatta, and studied law at St Paul's College and Sydney University. He was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1936 and later to the Victorian bar. With the advent of World War II, he enlisted in the Australian military forces in 1941 before transferring to the 2nd AIF in 1942. He served in the South Pacific region for two years, then transferred to the reserves in 1946 with the rank of captain. Sir Nigel resumed his legal career and took silk in 1953. He spent some time as President of the New South Wales Bar Council and from 1957 to 1960 held the post of Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. In 1963, Sir Nigel stood for and won the seat of Parramatta, which had been vacated by the resignation of Sir Garfield Barwick. In 1966, building on his already distinguished and successful legal career, he was appointed Attorney-General in the Holt ministry. served in this portfolio in successive ministries until November 1969, making a brief return to the portfolio in 1971. From 1969 to 1971, he was Minister for Education and Science and from 1971 to 1972 he was foreign minister in the MCMahon government. His parliamentary record shows that he also led numerous delegations on visits within Australia and overseas. Sir Nigel left this House in 1973 to take appointment as Chief Judge in Equity in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. This was followed by his appointment the first Chief Judge-later Chief Justice-of the then newly created Federal Court of Australia. He held this position with distincman tion until his retirement in 1990. His appointboth ment to set up and head the new Federal Court was a particularly appropriate culminareceived tion to Sir Nigel's career, as he had long perceived the need for the establishment Commonwealth superior court below the High Court. Indeed, it was Sir Nigel who as Attorney General in 1968 first introduced a bill for the establishment of such a court. Although that bill was not proceeded With, it provided much of the foundation for the Federal Court of Australia Act that was eventually passed in 1976. In setting up the Federal Court, Sir Nigel was responsible for much of the procedural innovation for which that court is still highly regarded. He also played a significant part in developing the Federal Court's approach to the Commonwealth's administrative law jurisdiction, an area of the law in which Sir Nigel had a great interest. As Attorney-General in 1968, Sir Nigel initiated the inquiry undertaken by the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee. That committee's report in 1971 formed the basis for the many remarkable developments in administrative law that took place later in the decade: the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; the setting up of the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and the passage of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. A true Australian, it was also Sir Nigel who, with the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968, began the process of He making the High Court the final court of appeal in Australia. Sir Nigel will also be remembered for his chairing of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest, which was established in February 1978 and reported in July 1979. The Bowen committee's report was an extremely thorough piece of work reflecting Sir Nigel's sound judgment which over the years has become an authoritative source for dealing with the up various ethics and conflict of interest issues which parliamentarians, judicial and statutory office holders and public servants have to in 1976 as address from time to time. Sir Nigel was a hard working and dedicated who served the Australian people well in his legal and political careers. In recognition of his great service to Australia, he a knighthood in 1976 and in 1988 was appointed a Companion of the Order of of a Australia-one of Australia's highest awards-for his services to the law. I know he will be sadly missed by many people in community, on the coalition side of litics in particular, and, of course, by his ily. On behalf of the government, I extend his wife Ermyn and family our most cere sympathy in their bereavement.",43
69,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"On behalf of the coalition ties I wish to join with the Prime Minister r Keating) in recognising Sir Nigel wen's lifetime of achievement in the law d politics. Nigel Bowen was a great Auslian and a great Liberal. He belonged to a neration which saw serving the community d the country as matters of the highest ponsibility and the greatest honour. He was olarly, modest, courteous and, above all, blic spirited-a man who saw the most rthwhile achievements as those which proved the lives of his fellow citizens. igel Bowen first served his country in its iod of greatest threat, during the Second orld War, when he served with the 2nd AIF m 1942 to 1946. After the war he resumed outstanding legal career at the Sydney bar. gel Bowen was one of the foremost lawyers his generation. As a teacher, as a practiner and, eventually, as a judge, his legal lls were forensic and formidable. He was ractising lawyer from 1936 and became a een's Counsel in 1953. He was highly arded by his legal colleagues, as was dent from his presidency of the New South les Bar Council from 1959 to 1961 and his e-presidency of the Law Council of Auslia from 1957 to 1960. igel Bowen was 53 years old before he me into the federal parliament as the memfor Parramatta, taking the place of another tinguished lawyer, Sir Garfield Barwick. In ng so, Nigel Bowen gave up a lucrative eer and a comfortable lifestyle in the law favour of the vagaries and uncertainties of ife in politics. He did so because he beved in the idea of serving his community his country in public office. He did so ause he had his own ideas about how vernment, and the law in particular, could made to work better in the interests of all stralians. And he did so because he beved that the things which liberalism stands for-namely, individual freedom, fairness, decency and prosperity-were things worth fighting for and making personal sacrifices for. It was clear as soon as Nigel Bowen came into the parliament that he was going to make his mark. Within one year of becoming a backbencher he successfully moved 35 amendments to the 1965 income tax bill-not a bad achievement for a new member. The Prime Minister has already recorded the succession of senior ministries which Nigel Bowen held from 1966 to 1972. To all these portfolios he brought a lively mind, a clear set of values, a preparedness for innovation but a rejection of change for the sake of it. As Attorney-General he began the great task of reforming federal administrative law and the initiatives he took inspired many others through the 1970s. Also as Attorney General he moved to make the High Court the final arbiter of all matters of federal jurisdiction, thus ending appeals to the Privy Council in such matters. As foreign minister, Nigel Bowen reaffirmed the policy direction of successive coalition governments in their reorientation towards developments in the Asia-Pacific region and in promoting greater regional dialogue and cooperation. The high regard in which Nigel Bowen was held by his parliamentary colleagues was evident from the fact that, following the coalition's 1972 election defeat, he failed to win the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party by just one vote. In 1973 he returned to what most of his colleagues regarded as his first love, the law. He became Chief Judge in Equity in the Supreme Court of New South Wales before becoming the first Chief Judge of the newly created Federal Court of Australia, later becoming its Chief Justice. With the passing of Sir Nigel Bowen, Australia has lost a person who made an enormous difference to the legal and political life of this country. Australia has lost a lawyer and jurist of the highest calibre and achievement. It has lost a person who served in some of the highest political offices and did so in a way that advanced our national interests significantly. Those of us on this side of the House have lost a Liberal who served both a party and what it stands for with great distinction. He was part of a Liberal generation that gave this country good government and laid the foundations for the opportunities which Australia enjoys today. On behalf of the coalition parties, I extend to Lady Bowen and Sir Nigel's family our sympathy at this time and our deep appreciation for his life of service and achievement.",45
70,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support this condolence motion for the Hon. Sir Nigel Bowen AC, KBE. I point out that, in addition to all that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) have said, Sir Nigel volunteered for service in the AlP during World War II. He went on to rise to the rank of captain in the very solid service that he gave his country in that role. In fact, in all areas in which Sir Nigel was involved-the army, the law or politics-he was clearly a man of great accomplishment and of great talent, a man who provided a very substantial model to us all. Sir Nigel served the parliament, as others have said, in coalition governments under Harold Holt, Sir John Gorton and Sir William MCMahon, culminating in the portfolio of foreign affairs, among others. He was a particularly close confidant of Sir William MCMahon as Prime Minister and was widely regarded as a thoroughly professional person, as a politician, as a minister, as a man of the law and as a soldier. Sir Nigel was not a professional politician but someone who had made a great success of his legal practice prior to entering parliament in the seat of Parramatta. No doubt he made sacrifices, including financial sacrifices, to enter the parliament but he did so out of a sense of duty and a strong sense of commitment to Australia and to conservative politics through the Liberal Party. It is interesting to note that he was not scared to take on a marginal seat, which is a very real challenge, especially for someone with the portfolio of foreign affairs. I will watch with interest to see whether a certain other person coming from the Senate makes it. As foreign minister, when contesting the seat of Parramatta in 1972, Sir Nigel held on to his seat by fewer than 300 votes-but he held on to it. It is interesting to read through Sir Nigel's various speeches to see the issues he concentrated on back then. It was 1972, in his role as the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he signalled the need for Australia to build its links with Asia, which was as clearly the requirement then as it is now. In closing, I extend my sympathy to Lady Bowen and her family. I can do no better than to quote the words of two leaders--one of the Labor Party and one of the Liberal Party-at the time of Sir Nigel's resignation. Gough Whitlam said at that time: Mr Nigel Bowen brought to the Parliament and his Party great distinction. He served them both with great distinction. The then leader of the Liberal Party, Billy Snedden, said: He was a warm and humane man who was highly regarded in his electorate and by both sides of the House. That is an accolade that he well deserves. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. Yeend, Sir Geoffrey, AC, CBE",46
71,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on Thursday, 6 October 1994 of Sir Geoffrey John Yeend, AC, CBE, Chancellor of the Australian National University and former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.",46
72,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I seek your indulgence to say a couple of words about Sir Geoffrey Yeend. I think anyone who has been around here for a long time would have known. him. In my case, I knew him quite well. From 1983, for about the first half dozen years or so of the Labor government-it may have been less- Sir Geoffrey served with great distinction. He was somebody who believed in the professionalism of the Public Service. He believed that a career Public Service was the best way of giving impartial and good advice to governments. My experience of him was that he carried that policy and attitude through certainly during the period in which I had the pleasure of knowing him and being party to the way in which he worked in his stewardship of the Prime Minister's department, particularly the cabinet process. He believed in change. He believed in economic and social change. He was about facilitating governments in that change. On behalf of all the ministers who served during that period, I think we would all agree that we owe him a debt of gratitude for his service to us. I was delighted with his life after public life. As you mentioned, Mr Speaker, he was Chancellor of the Australian National University. He worked in many other organisations, including charitable ones, behind the scenes and was not out there seeking notoriety. He was a very decent individual and he will be a great loss to the Australian National Univerwho sity, and most particularly of course to his family. To his wife, Laurel, I extend my sympathies. To his family, to his colleagues who enjoyed him and appreciated him, I extend my sympathies too.",46
73,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in making a few remarks about Sir Geoffrey Yeend. I knew him a little and came to know him when I worked as a political adviser to Malcolm Fraser in 198283. Sir Geoffrey was the secretary to the Prime Minister's department at that time. I must admit that I thought during that period, and when I saw him from time to time after that in different capacities, that he was a man who always upheld the very best traditions of the Australian Public Service. For a start, he was a man who was completely fearless in the advice that he gave. Regardless of the predilections of the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who sometimes did not like to hear the advice Sir Geoffrey gave, Sir Geoffrey was fearless in providing that advice regardless of the consequences. He was also a man who, as I said earlier, always acted in the best traditions the Australian Public Service by being objective and impartial in the way he handled his duties. He was a man who also had that rare virtue, one that is seldom spoken of-wisdom. He was a wise man. He was always somebody you could listen to and get a balanced and constructive opinion from. He was a man who believed in Australia very passionately. He dedicated his life to his country, and I think he will always be fondly remembered by all those who have had anything to do with him. I was glad that he achieved such success in his post Public Service life as Chancellor of the ANU and, as the Prime Minister said, in various charitable organisations-and I think he served on the boards of several companies as well. In his post Public Service life he was able to continue his great contribution to Australia. He was a man who was decent, who was wise, who was objective and, as I have said, always worked in the best traditions of the Australian Public Service during his long career in the Public Service. On behalf of the coalition, I extend to Lady Yeend and to her family the coalition's sympathy on the death of Sir Geoffrey.",47

She will be represented today by the Deputy Prime Mnister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Hon. Brian Howe, and the Minister for Finance will answer questions on her behalf tomorrow. NA Economy",47
77,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to claims made by the Treasurer that Australia is enjoying the best economic circumstances for 30 years. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Treasurer? If so, how does he reconcile the fact that we have over 800,000 people out of work; we have around the highest interest rates in the world; we have one of the worse current account deficits in the OECD; we have a federal government that is running the third largest budget deficit in Australia's history; we have close to the lowest level of investment in 40 years; we have a dismal level of savings which is insufficient to fund higher levels of investment; and we have a major split between the federal government and the Reserve Bank over the direction of fiscal policy? Given the experience of the late 1980s when there were similar warning signs-in particular, a growing balance of payments deficit and rising interest rates-why does the government continue to ignore the warnings this time around?",48
78,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With its implications, that question was simply laced with distortions. I can understand that. Here is one for a start. Take the Economist poll of forecasters. Where is Australia in the October averages? Top of the list again. High-low range GDP 3.7 to five for Australia for 1994; for 1995, 3.3 to 5.1above every other OECD country. It talks about the averages: 4.5 for 1994 and 3.9 to four for 1995. For consumer prices for 1994 it has 2.1 per cent and for 1995,3.3 per cent. It has the current account at a deficit of 3.9 per cent of GDP for this year and 4.1 for next year. What that means is that Australia is growing as fast as or faster than any comparable country. We are seeing a very strong pick-up in employment, a commensurate pick-up in employment, where we have seen just on 340,000 jobs created since the trough of about 15 or 18 months ago. We are seeing employment growth running at around 3V2 to four per cent, which has to be beyond, I think, any other OECD experience. I do not know any other country that has employment growing at 3V2 to four per cent. Obviously what we are seeing is a pick-up in participation. Were we to have taken directly 3- or four per cent employment growth off the 11 per cent which obtained a year or so ago, we would have unemployment down to seven per cent today. The fact that it is at 9- per cent means that there are more people looking for work-and I think it is a good thing that they are encouraged to come out and find work in the labour market. Of course, if we are talking about the same participation rates in the labour market today as we had when the former government left office, we would have unemployment under seven per cent-in fact, with a six in front of it, I think a low six. Of course the increased participation has come in large measure from women's participation in the work force, which is again a good thing. In fact, on my last visit to Europe, Chairman Delors from the European Commission said that the correlation between GDP growth and employment in Australia and the United States is quite remarkable. We are seeing almost a percentage point one-for-one change there-three to four per cent on GDp, three to four per cent on employment. The Europeans get about a half or a third of that. I do not know why there is so much foreboding by the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition says that we have the highest level of interest rates in the world. That is just untrue; that is obviously untrue. We haveMr Costello-Tell us about 10-year bonds.",48
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not think you could spell 'bond' until six months ago. Mr Costello-Tell us about them.,48
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,48
81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has discovered a Treasury bond, Mr Speaker. This is the cause of some celebration by the rest of us. We have cash rates at three-quarters of a percentage point, 75 basis point, off the low point of 4.5 per cent. So now we have cash rates at about 5% to 5- per cent. How can the Leader of the Opposition claim we have the highest interest rates in the world! This is the sort of knocking stuff that he and the shadow Treasurer specialise in. As a consequence of that, is it any wonder they are doing so poorly in the polls? Every time they get a chance to say something about the economy or Australia, they give the place a good solid knock; it is that sort of knocking. Let me say something about the debt. The government has either negative debt abroadthat is, no debt abroad-or modest debt abroad. Sixty per cent of Australia's debt is private debt. Mrs Bishop-Personal debt? Interest rates from the Commonwealth Bank?",48
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for MACKellar!,49
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, she is more to be pitied than despised; just leave her go. As I said, 60 per cent of Australia's debt is private debt. This is not sovereign debt of South American variety. The other 40 per cent comes from either state government authorities or state governments. In many countries, state government authorities are essentially private businesses, and many are becoming private businesses here. So if one actually looks rather at the ownership of these companies-water authorities and electricity authorities-and imputes to them private status, the great bulk of the debt is private. Mr Tim Fischer-It still cannot be ignored.",49
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me give you a little fact, even one that you will be able to assimilate. The debt service ratio, that is, the portion of Australia'sMr Costello-You redefine public as private and then hide it away. Is that the argument?",49
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,49
86,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have asked the question.,49
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister might wait for a minute. In the past I have had to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there are certain responsito bilities. He will cease interjecting.,49
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The debt service ratio is that proportion of exports which are devoted to servicing Australia's debt. It has dropped from 21 per cent to around 11 per cent. It has halved. That has happened because of a couple of things. In the main, there have been more exports, more earnings. Secondly, there have been lower interest rates and some exchange rate effects. It has fallen massively-by half. That is one of the key ingredients-the capacity of the country to service its debt. Apparently, when an Australian company believes it can borrow abroad at the going rate of interest-in the northern hemisphere, somewhere between seven and 10 per centand it can get a 20 to 25 per cent rate of return in Australia, those opposite say, 'Don't do it. The government should stop them. Get in there and stop this.' They are saying that, in events between consenting adultsconsenting borrowers and consenting lendthe ers-we should say, 'No, let's have none of that.' This is obscene. Obviously, people in business do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition. What they want to look at is whether or not there is growth. We have got a profit share in the economy that we have never seen before. That is powering along private investment. We are now seeing a huge level of importation of capital equipment, which is going to add to the capital stock and to productive capacity. Mr Downer-That's what you said in the 1980s.",49
89,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the last few years we prohave seen a much greater pick-up in exports. Let me make this point to the Leader of the Opposition: at that stage of the 1980s recovery, which he interjected about, after 12 quarters of growth, the current account deficit was 6.1 per cent of GDP. What is it at the moment? It is in fact under four per cent. How do you make the comparison? The fact of the matter is that we are in a vastly different situation, with vastly improved prospects. Underlying that is low inflationsomething you never had the wit or the sense be able to reduce. You did not talk to unions. You had no wages policy. You came out of the 1982-83 recession with 11 per cent unemployment and 11 per cent inflation. I would think that the Leader of the Opposition, instead of doomsaying about Australia's economic performance, should be rejoicing in the fact that Australia has got a very strong recovery. He should be giving the community of this country some credit for engineering its way back into prosperity and being able to rely upon stronger increments to employment, lower unemployment and, of course, very low inflation by Australian standards. Aviation: Safety",49
90,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. I refer the minister to the tragic air accident involving a Seaview aircraft. Can the Minister advise the House administrative arrangements applying to Civil Aviation Authority's air safety responsiof bilities?,50
91,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that all CAA. members of the House will join with me in extending sympathy to the families of the nine passengers and the officer in command of the Seaview Aero Commander which tions. crashed quite tragically on Sunday, 2 October. Like all accidents, this one will be investigated independently by the Bureau of Aviation Safety Investigation. This is the second regular public transport crash involving loss of life since June last year. It is a very sorry that event indeed. The first of those crashes involved Monarch aircraft at Young. The BASI report into that crash revealed systemic failures in the Civil Aviation Authority safety surveilas lance operations and led to an announcement on 20 July this year of a package of measures aimed at addressing and improving air safety. In all, there were eight measures. The first measure was the establishment of an aviation safety agency. I can advise the honourable member that separate accounting and financial arrangements in the CAA have already been put in place and that this tion has been advertised in Australia and worldwide. We expect that we will be in position to make an appointment before the end of November to the head of the aviation safety agency. The second matter dealt with the report on the Civil Aviation Authority's resources in its own directorate of aviation safety regulation. The honourable member will be interested to know that Mr Roser, the CEO of the CAA, has recommended that 57 additional safety staff be recruited. That recruitment is presently under way and it will extend over the course of the next several months. The third matter was financial triggers for surveillance in the case of companies that were not paying their bills. I am able to report to the honourable member that adverse financial information now triggers additional surveillance and has been put in place. The fourth matter dealt with the recommenof dations of Captain Terrell. I am able to the inform the honourable member that some 42 Captain Terrell's recommendations for improved safety have now been implemented. The remainder have been adopted by the Both in person and in writing to the Chairman of the CAA, I stressed the absolute importance of having full and early implementation of Captain Terrell's recommendaThe fifth matter dealt with the funding of aviation safety regulation. In that respect, I can inform the honourable member that cabinet will this week consider my submission the government fund the public benefit elements of aviation safety regulation. The sixth matter dealt with Commonwealth the indemnification of the Civil Aviation Authority's safety regulation functions. This is to ensure that we do not have the situation, in the Monarch crash, where there is a suggestion of potential compromise by the CAA as a result of commercial insurance arrangements held by the CAA. I am able to advise the honourable member that a deed of agreement has now been drawn up between the CAA and the Commonwealth which will ensure that this cannot happen in the future. The seventh matter dealt with mandatory posiinsurance arrangements. I can inform the honourable member that cabinet will this a week consider a submission for mandatory insurance as a condition of issue of an air operators certificate. That will make it compulsory for that issue and will involve compulsory insurance with a new limit of $500,000 per passenger replacing the former limit of $180,000 per passenger. The eighth and final measure arising from the package announced on 20 July was, of course, the parliamentary inquiry, which is now under way, chaired by our colleague the member for Shortland. I know that he has been inundated with submissions as a result of the advertisements placed over recent weeks. To supplement these reforms today, I have announced some key personnel changes in the field of aviation safety. The changes have been agreed following a meeting this morning of the Chief Executive of the CAA, the Acting Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and me. The principal change will see the deputy head of BASI, Mr John Pike, assume the position of acting head of the Civil Aviation Authority's directorate of aviation safety regulation. The current head, Mr George Macionis, will be transferred to other duties. In addition, the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Transport, Mr John Bowdler, will assume responsibility for coordinating aviation safety measures. These changes will, I believe, add to the reforms already announced and give renewed drive to our push for improved aviation safety. Aviation: Safety",50
92,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the same subject, I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. Given the fact that the member for Hume on the floor of this House five months ago gave the minister ample warning in relation to this particular airline company its operations, and given the fact that the CAA itself had enormous difficulties and an ugly experience with the operation of the same type of aircraft, the Aero Commander, over many years-a list of which should be tabled in the House by the minister sooner rather than later-how does the minister reconcile the statements of the Director of Aviation Safety Regulation, now sacked Mr George Macionis, that the operations of Seaview Air were 'satisfactory' with CAA issuing warnings as late as January to the airline that its licence could be suspended for serious operational deficiencies? Secondly, the CAA brief the mInIster immediately following the crash of the Aero Commander on Sunday, 2 October, or shortly after, and what advice was tendered at that time as to the airline's compliance record? Thirdly, does the minister not agree that the change in position of the CAA during last week points either to incompetence or to the misleading of the public on this vital matter of aviation safety?",51
93,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the Leader of the National Party, I inform the House that, as a result of surveillance of Seaview Air and its activities late last year and early this year, there were a number of operational deficiencies revealed. Those operational deficiencies are evident in the records of the Civil Aviation Authorityrecords that I have had the opportunity of studying in part over the course of the last 48 hours, but not before that time. I also point out to the House that, as a result of those deficiencies, the authority wrote to the former chief pilot of Seaview Air, Mr Matthews, detailing the deficiencies. They were all deficiencies that were the responsibility of the chief pilot. I am not shirking any responsibility myself or departmentally, but I think we need to have a sense of perspective as to who is responsible for the day-today operational safety of aircraft and companies such as this operating a number of aircraft. Following the letter in January of this year demanding immediate remedial action, I am advised by the department that an annual and inspection by the CAA on 7 February reported that the airline's operations were generally satisfactory. On 4 March, the company advised the CAA that a new chief pilot was to be appointed. I am told that the new chief pilot was advised by the Civil Aviation Authority of its concerns. At the end of March, the Civil Aviation Authority's district office in Coffs Harbour reported that the new chief pilot had taken immediate steps to improve the company's operations. Seaview Air formally applied, subsequent to this, to the CAA for a regular public transport air operators certificate. It did so on did 28 April 1994. It sought an upgrade from its previous charter operations category. A number of things occurred as a result of that. Firstly, the company was required to satisfy the CAA as to its airworthiness and flying operation regulatory requirements. Part of that process required the company's maintenance control manual, its system of maintenance and its essential equipment listing covering its different aircraft to all be upgraded-and they were-to the satisfaction of the Civil Aviation Authority. Part of that process involved the nomination of a maintenance controller, who was a person approved by the Civil Aviation Authority. There was also an intensive review of the flying operations side of Seaview Air. That involved a number of things: firstly, the completion of a check of the training manual of the airline; secondly, an approval process for the check pilot; thirdly, an approval of ports and facilities; next, the completion of the operations manual; then the completion of operational inspections; and, further, a final independent check by the Civil Aviation Authority flying operations inspector from the Brisbane district office. I put it to the House and to the honourable member that there has been an intense scrutiny of this airline since the complaints were raised in December and January of this year and since the appointment of the new chief pilot, Captain MCIver. I can further advise the House that, prior to the issue of the RPT air operators certificate, the Civil Aviation ority conducted five ramp checks within a one-month period from 6 June this year on the company's aircraft, including one on the Aero Commander aircraft involved. Again, there is ample evidence from the Civil Aviation Authority of the most intense review and investigation of this company's operations. I am advised by the Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority that this process revealed no major deficiencies at all. It was on that basis that the Civil Aviation Authority proceeded to issue an air operators certificate enabling RPT operations to commence from 25 July 1994. It is a matter of record that the first plane operating under those conditions was the one that was lost in such tragic circumstances. In reply to the honourable member and in conclusion, I believe that there has been a clear indication of an improved performance by - his airline as a result of intense scrutiny over a period of months now. On the basis of the advice given to me by the Chief Executive and the acting Chairman of the CAA today, that organisation has my confidence. I believe that people travelling on airlines in Australia can share that confidence. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In accordance with the standing orders, I invite the minister, firstly, to table those documents and, secondly, to table the list of incidents relating to the CANs own operation of Aero Commanders which led to several major notifiable incidents which should have been made public. I invite the minister to table those documents.",51
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the minister is quoting from private notes, then that is the end of the matter. Home Child-care Allowance",52
95,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House on progress with implementing the government's new home child-care allowance?,52
96,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to advise the House that first payments under the new home child-care allowance were made on 29 Auth- September. There has been a very large number of applications. The number of people receiving the maximum rate of home childcare allowance already exceeds the number receiving the maximum rate of with child dependent spouse rebate and we are still receiving applications at a rate of 20,000 a week. I draw the attention of the community to the fact that if anybody who is eligible to do so gets an application in for home child-care allowance by 3 January, it can be backdated to 29 September. I urge all those who think they may be eligible to receive this payment and are not already receiving it to lodge such an application. From the point of view of the Department of Social Security, this is a major implementation task involving major and substantial systems modifications and, even taking into account the degree of difficulty in implementing this scheme, I think the scheme will be of major benefit. As I said, at least as many people are now receiving the maximum rate HCCA as received the maximum rate with child DSR. It is paid at a higher rate than the with child DSR, so those people are all unambiguous winners. They add to the other categories of - ajor winners from this new measure, particularly the 55,000 low income families which will benefit up to the tune of $1,500 a year. Under the old DSR arrangement they might not have been eligible for the full value of a tax rebate. There are 120,000 families in which somebody might work for, say, half of the financial year and then withdraw from the labour market. Frequently, those sorts of people would lose all eligibility for DSR because the rebate was assessed on a financial year basis. But with the current fortnightly income test applying to home child-care allowance, those people will be able to get it for the remaining half year. Again, some of those people will benefit up to the tune of $1,500 a year. It is very much a progressive piece of social reform that involves a significant net addition to government spending on family assistance to the tune of $230 million-the government's estimate of the amount by which payments will exceed the cost of the with child dependent spouse rebate. It is all pretty good news. What is the opposition's response to this? As always it tries to drag a dead cat across the path; tries to search, riffle through and construct some examples of some people who might lose. For example, it fastens onto the fact that the definition of 'income' under the Social Security Act is different from the definition under the Taxation Act. That is true but, for the great bulk of the people who might potentially lose from that, the maximum they can possibly lose is $4.60 a week. The major issue there is the deductibility of child-care expenses under the tax definition. Of course, if you are going to talk about that, you have to factor in the fact that we now have a child-care cash rebate which provides substantial assistance for those caring for children. Many of the examples that get cited, including the one in the press release from Senator Lees the other day, purport to show examples of people who are losing. The individual concerned in that particular case, under the circumstances described, was a significant winner under the new arrangements-when we factor in the fact that we have a child-care cash rebate in addition to everything else. Other examples are constructed which are just patently artificial. Another from Senator Lees's press release involved a situation where the carer had $30,000 worth of shares and was affected by the fact that under the social security income definition accruing capital growth is taken into account. That is true. It is possible to identify some categories of losers but, overwhelmingly, people win from this measure. What is it that the opposition is saying? Is it seriously saying that, in constructing a major reform of the whole system, we try to do it in such a way that there is absolutely no possibility of there being any losers? If you do that, you come up with all manner of absurdities and you end up with intolerable administrative complexities. The opposition would have us operating a social security system with two different definitions of income. It would have us bringing in the home child-care allowance to replace the with-child DSR but keeping the with-child DSR going. The opposition treasury spokesman has the hide to come in here and talk about the need for the government to run a tighter fiscal policy. At the same time, with one piece of legislation after another, the opposition tries to add to the expense of what are already very costly items of social reform in additional assistance for families. It wants to blow it out further. On the one hand the shadow minister for social security says that and, on the other, the shadow treasury spokesman criticises us for not running a tight enough fiscal policy. The inconsistency and hypocrisy is phenomenal and I think the great bulk of the Australian electorate will see through it. Aviation: Safety",52
97,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. I refer the minister to his previous answers in which he has, in effect, said that the Civil Aviation Authority has behaved with complete propriety. If that is the case, why has the minister, in effect, sacked the Director of Aviation Safety Regulation at the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr George Macionis?",53
98,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought it would be self-evident that what we require at the Civil Aviation Authority at the moment is leadership which can give the travelling public absolute confidence about air safety in Australia. I must say to the House that, whilst I have that confidence in the Civil Aviation Authority as an organisation- . Mr Downer-There has been a direct failure.",54
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. He will listen to the answer.,54
100,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not, having reviewed the papers on the weekend, have the same absolute confidence in Mr Macionis in so far as in the handling of the matter last week it was clearAn opposition member interjecting",54
101,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you would just listen to the answer: it was clear to me that the background to the troubles at Seaview, prior to the change of chief pilot and prior to all of Goldstein! the checks that have been put in place, should have been brought to the public's attention and should have been brought to mine. Women: Representation in Parliament",54
102,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of recent research on the lack of representation of women in parliament? In light of that research, what is being done to ensure that women are better represented in parliament?",54
103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen research by Coopers & Lybrand on women's representation in Australian parliaments. I think this report has been very broadly disseminated and many of the facts are already known to us. The fact is that across federal and state parliaments only 16 per cent of members are women and only 10 per cent of members of this House of Representatives are women. The report, I think, contains some other interesting and less well-known facts. In last year's federal election, of women candidates, less than a quarter ran in seats which were safe or marginally safe for their party. By contrast, 55 per cent of male candidates ran in seats which were safe or marginally safe for their party. Men were more than three times more likely to be preselected for safe seats than were women. In analysis of the evidence, the author's report concluded that the critical barrier for women seeking election to parliament is gaining preselection in winnable seats. The Labor Party agrees. As a consequence, at our national biennial conference we were .determined to have women candidates in at least 35 per cent of winnable seats by the year 2000. We adopted affirmative action in the Labor Party for two reasons. The first is that it is right and just. The second is that we cannot afford to lose the skills, knowledge and experience of half of our population. We also adopted affirmative action because we believe in merit and ability. Dr Kemp-Doublespeak.",54
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for,54
105,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might think that it is doublespeak. I do not believe, on any assessment of ability, that a situation where women make up only 10 per cent of members of the House of Representatives equates with merit. It is a pretty tired argument. This is the one the Leader of the Opposition trots out. He says that affirmative action is tokenism and that it is patronising. But does he believe, on any assessment of ability, that the·reason that only 10 per cent of the members of this House are women is that they lack merit? Does he really believe that? He has turned around for that one. He gives his back to the good arguments. Does he believe that it is merit that makes men three times more likely to be preselected for safe seats? Does he really believe that? When he gets up and basically says, 'We are going for mechanisms,' does he really believe that it is on the basis of merit that only 10 per cent of the House's members are women and that on the basis of merit 90 per cent of the places went to men? If he does believe that, he is pulling our legs and' being deceitful. If he does not believe that, he should make clear that women have the option of taking preselections for winnable seats. That is what the Labor Party has committed itself to. At each doorstop we get from you a little bit of humbug-humbug about mechanisms, simply a scapegoat? about being patronising and about tokenismbut nothing that does anything about changing the essential fact that it is on the basis of in the system, away from women, that women moment. do not hold more than 10 per cent of the places in the House of Representatives. That is why the Labor Party has chosen to change its rules and to decide on affirmative action principles-so that 35 per cent of winnable seats in the parliaments will go to women. As a consequence of that, we are dispensing with this humbug that the reason that 90 per cent of the House is made up of men is basically that they have greater merit. This is the phoney argument that the Leader of the Opposition hides behind every time he silence. is asked about that. But I tell you one thing, Mr Speaker: the women of Australia will catch up with him-and catch up with him quickly.·",54

112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right will also cease interjecting. Aviation: Safety,55
113,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a very serious matter, I would like to direct a further question to the Minister for Transport. Why did the minister ignore warnings, given in parliament by the member for Hume in May, about the operational capacity and safety practices of Seaview Air? Does the minister accept that he has been negligent in his duty as the Minister for Transport? Has he made Mr Macionis",55
114,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly do not bias accept any negligence on my part, not for one Opposition members-Oh!",55
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister might just wait for a minute. The Leader of the Opposition said that this was a very serious matter the when he came to the despatch box, and I believe it is. It is also, I am sure, one which develops some passion in members in this place, as well it might. But I remind those members that there are standing orders to be adhered to. The minister has been asked a question. He will answer the question in",55
116,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The matters of concern to me principally were the letter written on CAA letterhead on 18 January this year from the district flight operations manager to Seaview Air, which I became aware of in the course of the weekend-this weekend. Of course I heard the honourable member for Hume's speech and referred it to the Civil Aviation Authority for consideration. It was the subject of consideration by members of the Civil Aviation Authority who, after all, are the experts in this regard.",55
117,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Table the response.,55
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mitchell!,55
119,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed it is the subject of report to me on a regular monthly basis by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Peter Gration. He has assured me continuously and repeatedly that everything is being done to guarantee the highest standards of air safety and that all of these issues are being addressed in accordance with the blueprint laid down on 20 July this year. The question asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition is pretty clear. He suggests that I have been negligent. Quite frankly, I have not. When the Monarch report came down I made sure it was dealt with urgently and referred with a comprehensive plan of action. Similarly, when this matter was brought to my attention in the course of the weekend I acted promptly by having the Civil Aviation Authority officers come to my office this morning, and the steps that I have announced follow on from that meeting. If any members have any additional material, have a scintilla of evidence, suggesting impropriety or any irregularity, I would be very pleased to receive it because each and every aspect of these arrangements, each and every aspect of these tragedies, will be inves- source, tigated by BASI. They, after all, are the experts. They are the people who conducted the Monarch investigation, and conducted it very properly-to the applause, I might say, of the opposition. They are the people certainly charged with the responsibility of investigatthe ing this accident, as well. They will review the behaviour of the Civil Aviation Authority in each and every way. I repeat: anyone has any information to put before them, they should carry out their responsibili200 ties and do so. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a all point of order.",55
120,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order",56
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a minute. The Leader of the National Party has the call for his point of order. Mr Tim Fischer-My point of order is as follows: as there is a fresh, blue-covered, highlighted document in the hands of the minister, in accordance with the standing orders, in response to his question and in exact words of the member for Hume, 'On May the airworthiness inspector recommended the aircraft and airline be grounded'-the Seaview airline-I invite the minister, in public interest, to table these documents.",56
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat. There are provisions in the standing orders for taking points of order and also under those points of order for requesting information from ministers. The Leader of the National Party knows that procedure and in future he will adhere to that procedure. He has asked the minister to table documents.,56
123,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am quite happy to do so.,56
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is quite happy to do so. They have been tabled. Better Cities Program: Urban Waterways,56
125,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to proposals to clean up the Patawalonga in Adelaide. What action is being taken under the better cities program to clean up that important environmental reand what is the cost of the program?,56
126,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonython for his question. The issue of urban waterways and the question of waste water in urban areas are very important, in the context of South Australia and Patawalonga, which was mentioned by the fully honourable member. The Patawalonga is identified by the coastal zone inquiry as the if most polluted waterway in Australia. The catchment of the Patawalonga estuary is over square kilometres and flows through 11 council areas. Stormwater and rubbish from these areas wash down to the lake and are sluiced out across Glenelg beach, which is one of Australia's premier beaches and attracts a large number of tourists as well as people from allover the metropolitan area. This issue of water quality is clearly a question of conservation of water, it is an issue of pollution and it is an issue of economic importance. It is an issue that has gone on for some time and is now being resolved for the first time in many years. The better cities program has forged cooperation between the the South Australian government and 11 local 4 councils as well as with the multifunction polis to work towards the long-term management of the waterway. The MFP, with local the government and the state, is developing a pricing and charging mechanism for stormf i w management. The development of this m gement system will mean that the clean-up will be permanent. The system will also initiate a key micro-economic reform in water resource management. In terms of issues of environmental management, the crucial thing is to achieve cooperation between different levels of government. In this case, the better cities program has achieved cooperation between the Commonwealth, the state and 11 units of local government. It is also important that we understand that the issue being resolved is not only important to South Australia but part of an environmental engineering skill that is of national and international importance. The better cities program in South Australia is involved not only with the Patawalonga and the $15 million worth of expenditure there which will lead to private investment of more than $80 million, but also with the Virginia-Boliviar pipeline, which will mean for the northern suburbs of Adelaide a massive growth",56
127,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Bolivar pipeline, which will mean massive extension and development of vegetable growing areas in northern suburbs. It will also create a system of parks around Elizabeth and Munno Para. This will contribute to the revitalisation of that area and the potential growth and further development of the northern region of Adelaide. These issues of water are of crucial importance environmentally, especially at a time of national drought. They are also very important in terms of social equity and social justice, and the western suburbs of Adelaide will benefit as a result of this measure. They are also of very great economic importance. For quite modest investment in infrastructure, we can see economic development occurring at Glenelg and in the other areas that I mentioned, and this is worth many times the initial investment. I commend to the House the better cities program and particularly these examples in South Australia of multi-layered cooperation which will achieve a very important solution to major environmental problems. Aviation: Air Safety",57
128,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. In regard to the recent tragic crash of the Aero Commander aircraft on its way to Lord Howe Island, can the minister confirm that the CAA itself operated Aero Commanders until it disposed of the fleet last year? Is the minister aware of several notifiable incidents encountered by the CAA with its operation of Aero Commanders? Given the need for public confidence in all aspects of the CAA's operation and in light of the two crashes over the last two weekends, will he now table a list of all incidents-minor and major-regarding Aero Commanders, including the CAA's ugly experience with its own fleet of Aero Commander aircraft?",57
129,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not aware of the incidents that the honourable member refers to.,57
130,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You weren't aware of the letter?,57
131,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I was not. And I am certainly not aware of these incidents. I will be more than pleased to table a list of any such information. More importantly, I think, I should refer it to our colleague the member for Shortland in his responsible position as chairman of the parliamentary inquiry, in accordance with the reference I have given to that committee, into general aviation safety in Australia. I will be pleased to do so. Ferries: Safety",57
132,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. As a member from Tasmania, a state which relies for sea travel on the ferry Spirit of Tasmania, I refer the minister to the recent sinking of the ferry Estonia. In the light of that terrible tragedy, could he advise what steps are being taken to ensure that such an accident would not occur in Australia?",57
133,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the House will agree that the sinking of the Estonia, with its dreadful loss of life, was truly the most terrible of tragedies. I advise the House that I have written to the Chairman of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority asking him to conduct a full review of safety standards on any similar ferries that might sail in our waters. I am in receipt of advice that there is only one vessel operating in Australia that is similar to the Estonia-the Spirit of Tasmania. AMSA has taken all necessary steps to ensure the highest of safety standards. Before it entered into service on the Bass Strait run, AMSA closely supervised the extensive refit of the Spirit of Tasmania. Since entering service, the Spirit of Tasmania has undergone regular safety inspections by AMSA. Immediately after the sinking of the Estonia, AMSA undertook a comprehensive review of safety procedures including stability, damage control, bow and stem doors and on-board operations of the Spirit of Tasmania. Last week AMSA surveyors sailed with the Spirit of Tasmania to review operating procedures. I am advised that the Spirit of Tasmania satisfies AMSA's requirements of international best practice. Given AMSA's thorough inspections and the recent reviews of safety processes, I can assure the House and the honourable member that there is no reason at all to be concerned about safety standards on the said Spirit of Tasmania. Aviation: Safety",57
134,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. I ask the minister a very simple question in the light of the Seaview Air accident: will he ground all Aero Commander aircraft; if not, why will he not ground those aircraft?",58
135,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates an unbelievable naivety. People must understand that it is not the minister's job to be making these operational decisions. I have got to rely upon the best advice that is available. Where I am uncomfortable with that advice, I might well seekMr Andrews-You will have blood on your hands.",58
136,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What did you just say?,58
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Menzies will withdraw his comment. Mr Andrews-I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",58
138,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the task of the Civil Aviation Authority to make these operational decisions. I have indicated the nature of the checks in respect of Seaview Air over the course of the last several months. I can also indicate to the House that I have been assured that all steps are being taken to review the operation of similar aircraft in Australia's skies. I expect-in fact, I am very confident-that the Civil Aviation Authority will do all that is necessary to ensure that there is not a repetition of this dreadful accident. Literacy",58
139,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Occasionally I get representations from people lamenting what they term falling standards of literacy amongst Australian school students. Is the government aware of this as a problem? Is it taking it seriously? Can the minister advise what strategy the government has in place to improve this?",58
140,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He should be aware that the aim of improved literacy underpins almost all of the $3 billion which the Commonwealth spends annually on our schools. Literacy is also the focus of three specific initiatives which are currently under way. First, there is a review of the effectiveness of the present level of Commonwealth support for government primary schools. That review is proceeding, although, I am disappointed to say, without the full cooperation of the states. Secondly, the Commonwealth is funding a national school literacy survey designed to address the lack of data on the levels of English literacy attainment among Australian school students. Mr KaUer-In Queensland the kids can't get an education.",58
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is nice to see the member for Kennedy back, but if he wants to stay",58
142,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thirdly, in the most recent budget, a sum of almost $9 million was allocated to provide extra resources for the development of literacy skills in the crucial early years of schooling. The early literacy program will support efforts such as reading recovery and first steps, which have proved effective as intervention strategies in the development of literacy in children up to year 3. In this context, I admit to some concern at reports that the Western Australian government has sold the marketing rights to the first steps program to a British company. Under this arrangement, schools will have to pay for more than one copy of the original program, although three or four would be provided in the average school. The taxpayers of Australia have already spent some $5 million developing the first steps program. The taxpayers of Western Australia have already paid their share but now their government is asking them to pay again. They are being asked to pay $160 a copy for access to material which may be vital to their children's education. The federal government believes that basic education in literacy is a right for all Australia's children. The Western Australian Liberals believe, apparently, that for students in that state it is a privilege to be made available through commercial marketing. This myopic attitude must be a cause of concern, particularly at a time when the federal coalition is proposing a national strategy on literacy for the states. There may be a shortterm dollar in it for the WA government, but there are tremendous difficulties down the track for young people who are not being given a fair opportunity to acquire literacy skills. The Leader of the Opposition is proposing to join forces with those who believe that education in literacy is an opportunity for profit through selling to taxpayers something that they have already paid for. The Western Australian situation is a matter of serious concern to me, and I am sure to anybody concerned about the ability of young Australians to read and write. It makes it perfectly clear that as far as the coalition is concerned literacy is not one of those things that matter. Minister for Transport",58
143,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. When things went wrong with the Australian National Line, you sacked the board. When things went wrong with the Civil Aviation Authority, you sacked Mr Macionis. When are you going to accept responsibility for your own negligence and ineptitude and sack yourself?",59
144,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was only last Friday that the honourable member for Hume was calling for sackings. In transferring Mr Macionis to other duties, I have sought to-Mr Truss-Pass the buck.",59
145,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not to pass the buck. I have sought to give the travelling public every confidence in the Civil Aviation Authority's air safety directorate. I think anyone who saw the 7.30 Report last Friday night would have a question mark in his or her mind about air safety in Australia. It was a program I saw and am concerned about. I will address each and every one of these circumstances, as they must responsibly be addressed. Mr Downer-You are a bit late, aren't you?",59
146,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You say that I am a bit late. There has been more action on this question of tackling the problems of civil aviation this year than there has been for years and years. The whole range of measures that I outlined to the House-all eight-are measures aimed at assuring the public that it can travel in our skies in confidence. I will continue to take whatever measures are necessary to have personally the confidence and to be in a position to pass on that confidence to the travelling public. Aid,59
147,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Does Australia's substantial overseas aid effort reflect community expectations and priorities? Does the government have evidence regarding the level of community support for its aid program?,59
148,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As. it happens, we do have evidence-partly because we conduct surveys into this through Roy Morgan-that the aid program which the government runs is highly supported within the Australian community. The most recent survey of over 2,000 people shows clearly that over 90 per cent of Australians are aware of our aid program and that more than 70 per cent approve broadly of the way in which it is done. In particular, there is very strong support for assistance to improve health standards and to provide essential infrastructure. There is very strong support for protecting the environment in developing countries and for general humanitarian programs. There is very high recognition of the role of education and training in combating poverty in developing countries. I point out that education for women and girls was a very strong recommendation of the recent Cairo conference on population and development, which I attended on behalf of the government. There is very high support for family planning programs and for the response to the Rwandan crisis, of which the government is very proud. Another aspect, which I found a bit surprising given the criticism it gets, is that there is also strong recognition and approval in the community of the fact that the Australian aid program produces real benefits for Australians. We spend 90 per cent of our program on competitive Australian goods and services and supply them as aid. One conclusion that I am not so pleased about is the fact that only three per cent of those surveyed know what AIDAB is. After 20 years of its existence, only three per cent of people know what the government's aid agency is and does, and I am now considering what we need to do about that. Overall I am pleased not only that the community supports foreign aid but also that the government's aid program reflects the very priorities which were identified by those surveyed. The Keating government has a very proud record in the delivery of foreign aid. In the budget before last, there was over a threefold increase in family planning activities, something which all respondents identified as a very high priority. More especially, last year the government increased foreign aid by $82 miIIion or 3.6 per cent. It is one of only seven governments in the Western world to have done so. That increase enabled us to introduce several very important initiatives. We targeted health, malaria, tuberculosis, neonatal tetanus and poliomyelitis. We targeted the environment through the green DIFF program and elsewhere. We targeted Indochina, an area of great importance to Australia, in the part of the world in which we live. Overall those were the very areas that were identified by the community as being important to them. In conclusion, these achievements stand in very stark contrast to those of the opposition, whose last public statement on the aid program recommended that the aid budget be slashed by $200 million. It is pretty obvious that the opposition, unlike the Australian community, believes that foreign aid is a thing that does not matter.",59
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA The Acting Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calIon the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1994195 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mr Anderson (from 11 citizens), Mr Filing (from six citizens), Mr Nehl (from 54 citizens) and Ms Worth (from 798 citizens). the honourable the Speaker and members of the ouse of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return, but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House ge the Government to declare ANZAC day as stralia's National Day of Commemoration and t it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no her day. Mr Dodd (from 621 citizens), Mr Lindsay (from 657 citizens) and Ms Worth (from 74 citizens). Family Law Act the honourable the Speaker and members of the use of Representatives assembled in parliament. e petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia ws to the attention of the House the need for anges to the Family Law Act of Australia and to Child Support Scheme. ur petitioners therefore pray that the House enact following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped d replaced by a more simplified version together th the minimum of rules and regulations necesry. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown.

That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Lindsay (from 823 citizens), Mr Neville (from 1,372 citizens) and Mr Truss (from 635 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hawker (from 91 citizens) and Dr Kemp (from 239 citizens). Noise Management To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, we, the undersigned, being participants in the life and activity of the Leichhardt-Stanmore Parish Mission, humbly showeth that the draft noise management plan for the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport fails: 1. to make adequate provision for the needs of owners of those places of Christian worship and service within the contours shown in the map accompanying the plan. 2. to respect participation in public worship and service, without the hindrance of further aircraft noise, as an essential human right; and 3. to acknowledge the special needs of those of affected places of worship which are also of national, state and local heritage significance. Now therefore, we, the undersigned, pray that the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives, take these premises into consideration and to ensure the final form of the noise management plan for the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport makes provision for owners of all affected places of Christian worship commensurate with their needs, or to do otherwise as the House, in its wisdom, may deem fit. And your petitioners will ever pray. by Mr Baldwin (from 84 citizens). Coolangatta Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of N.S.W. and Queensland living in areas affected by Coolangatta airport air traffic hereby draw to the attention of House our objection to the sale of Coolangatta airport on the following grounds:  airport makes allowance for too much increase in aircraft activity affecting local residents. 2. The sale of Coolangatta airport makes no provision for the purchaser to allow for local residents concerns. 3. The uncertainty of the role of the FAC upon sale of Coolangatta airport and how our rights as citizens are to be addressed in the future. 4. No provision in future planning for changing the course of air traffic movement to and from Coolangatta airport away from residential housing. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will immediately abandon all plans to sell Coolangatta airport until all the above issues are addressed to the resident's satisfaction. We further pray that the House undertake immediate steps to address the problems associated with the course of air traffic movement and remedy same as a matter of utmost urgency. by Mr Bradford (from 409 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 9,493 citizens). CSIRO: Agricultural Research To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia being members of staff at CSIRO's Division of Animal Production draws to the attention of the House the serious consequences of the significant reduction in Australian research and development on agriculture particularly within CSIRO. Unless this decline is reversed or arrested, Australia stands to lose much of its unique experthe tise in agricultural research. The value of this market is currently estimated at around $20 billion per annum and is guaranteed to increase with the growth of South-East Asian economy. The Agricultural Industry cannot continue to be a significant export earner for Australia without significant Research and Development to underpin its status as clean and efficient. Your petitioners therefore request the House to act to assign a higher priority and greater funding for agricultural research in CSIRO. by Mr Cameron (from 22 citizens). Programming: ABC To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia states that we feel any decision by the Australia Broadcasting Commission to change its programming to replace the current 7pm State News and 7.30 Report programs will result in an unacceptable reduction in coverage of Western Australian events of vital interest to residents of Bears this state. We therefore calion the parliament to act immediately to ensure the Australian Broadcasting Commission continue its current programming of News and current affairs in Western Australia. by Mr Filing (from 21 citizens). Pensions: Age for Women To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The petition of citizens and/or residents of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully show concern at the Commonwealth Government's intention to amend the Department of Social Security legislation to raise the age of women for pension eligibility from 60 to 65 because: The proposal is active economic discrimination against women Women have a shorter paid working life than men Women receive less than equal pay Women have less access to superannuation The proposal does not recognise the value of women's unpaid labour Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House intercede on behalf of the Petitioners to: Ensure that women remain eligible for age pension at the age of 60. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. Mr Gorman (from 460 citizens). Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament duly assembled: We the undersigned citizens of the Warragul Community convey to the House:1. Our dissatisfaction with the continuing promotion by the Prime Minister for The Republic of Australia. 2. We believe that the present Constitutional Monarchy serves Australia well and we see no need for a constitutional change. 3. We are totally opposed to any change to the Australian Flag. As duty bound we shall ever pray. by Dr Kemp (from 114 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition is to show thatWe, the undersigned citizens, claims that AustralHouse is must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the Federation of its sovereign States in 1901, and then being confirmed under the Flags Act (1953). We do so because: It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language; It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right; It signifies the Christian ethic, friendliness, international goodwill; It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen; It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. So therefore do we petition thatour present Australian National !'lag be not changed, replaced or diminished In any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Neville (from 20 citizens). Citizenship To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Northern Republic Territory draws the attention of the House to the matter that many Australian citizens of diverse cultural backgrounds would be able to take up dual citizenship without ceasing to be Australian citizens were it not for the provisions of section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948 (as amended). Such persons would dearly welcome the opportunity of taking up the citizenship of such other country, which in many cases is their birth right but would not wish to put in jeopardy the citizenship of this country Australia which they are proud to call their home. Given that there is already a not insignificant number of Australian citizens who already enjoy dual citizenship, your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give deliberation to the matter of amending section 17 and related sections 18 and 23 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to enable such persons to enjoy dual citizenship. by Mr Snowdon (from two citizens). Strathdon Lodge To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the imminent closure of 'Strathdon Lodge' 13-15 101imont Road, Forest Hill, Victoria, 3131, a hostel providing specialist care for people with advanced dementia. We have been informed that this unit must cease providing care for advanced dementia sufferers, as the increasing costs and current debt cannot be serviced. Government funding for this twenty four bed unit is approximately $30 per resident per day. A request has been made to the Federal Minister for Health, to increase the bed funding by $20 per resident per day, to $50 per resident per day, to prevent its closure as a dementia unit, but this has been rejected. The alternative for these residents is a nursing home bed which receives funding of $80 per resident per day, therefore, the increase of $20 per resident per day to $50 per resident per day would allow the residents to be cared for in this unit, with a nett saving to the Health ministry of $30 per resident-per day. The imminent closure of 'Strathdon Lodge' and the highlighting this week on the increase of dementia in younger age groups, make it imperative that this unit should not be permitted to close. Your petitioners therefore respectfully urge that our request for a $20 increase per resident per day be granted for 'Strathdon Lodge' advanced dementia unit. by Dr Wooldridge (from 1,085 citizens). Petitions received. NA Grievance Debate Motion (by Mr Free)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent order of the day No.1, government business (Grievance debate), when called on, continuing for a period not exceeding 1 hour 15 minutes. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",60
150,Mr HAWKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wannon) (4.22 p.m.)Today, in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made some extraordinary statements. When talking about the economic forecasts in this month's Economist, he seemed rather proud to point out that Australia is at the top of the current account deficit list. I do not know whether the Prime Minister had read his briefing notes properly, but I found it very strange to look at the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, as quoted in this month's Economist, and find that for 1994 we topped the poll at minus 3.9 per cent-as is forecast; it will obviously be fairly close to the mark-and next year it is expected to rise. I found it quite staggering that the Prime Minister said that the opposition should be rejoicing about the economic figures confronting Australia. After all the years of his government, I could not believe the Prime Minister would be proud of the fact that we specialist are still going further into the red. My topic for the grievance debate today is the effect overall management of the economy is having on interest rates in this country. This government has lost sight of reality. It believes that the only way we will get a recovery is to have a rhetoric led recovery. It is interesting to look at all the words we hear from the Prime Minister-the usual Labor rhetoric about how things are always going to get better, even though we seem to be going further and further into debt. Just prior to the 1987 stock market crash, we heard the Prime Minister saying, 'This is the golden age of economic change.' I suppose there must have been some change for a few people. Some are still reaping the rewards as they find themselves being detained behind bars-some are even having close links with the Australian Labor Party. In 1989, as we were going into recession, he said, 'Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance-it has proved it.' In the next year we went straight into the worse recession we had had in 60 years. In 1990, as we were actually going into the recession, the Prime Minister was saying, Economy 'These are definitely the golden years of change.' I do not know whether he thinks that a rhetoric led recovery is going to have some real effect. I am deeply concerned: not only are interest rates continuing to rise and reaching some of the highest levels in the world, but we even find that the Reserve Bank is sounding increasingly concerned. Its annual report stated: ... the budget stimulus initiated in the period of economic weakness has to be wound back to make room for the necessary growth in business investment and to avoid a disproportionate share of adjustment falling on monetary policyin other words, interest rates. It seems that even the Reserve Bank is trying to warn the government about what its loose budgetary policy is going to do to the future of the recovery that is slowly starting to be evidenced in this country. The Reserve Bank is warning the government that, if it is going to avoid further interest rate rises, it is going to have to reduce its deficit. Yet it seems that the government cannot understand or will not understand or just will not listen, because we are gradually going further and further into the red. Not only do we have the budget deficit, but we have the balance of payments problem. It is quite staggering to see what has happened to foreign debt under the Labor government. It seems that the government does not even care. When this government came into power in 1983, Australia's foreign debt was $23 billion. By 1988, that figure had risen to a massive $96 billion. By 1994, it has reached $166 billion. It almost seems to be an exponential increase. There are now estimates around that, if things do not change by the year 2002, our foreign debt could be around $400,000 million-a staggering figure and, I would suggest, pretty close to an unsustainable figure. This makes us increasingly vulnerable to volatile international financial markets. We are indeed becoming more and more vulnerable. The government talks about wanting to make the nation more independent; it seems that, when it comes to financial efforts, we are becoming less and less independent. As we become more and more beholden to foreign bankers, more and more beholden to the level of foreign investment, we are obviously reducing our independence; we are starting to mortgage our sovereignty. The really concerning thing is that this situation could send interest rates even higher. It is interesting to look at what the OECD has to say. The government is often very quick to quote from the OECD. The Prime Minister has been quick to claim the credit when the OECD has had something favourable to say. The OECD now says that in 1995 Australia is likely to have the largest current account deficit of industrialised countries. It predicts that in 1995 Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates in the world. This is exactly what the Economist, which the Prime Minister wanted to quote from earlier today, was saying. Not only do we have the highest current account deficit for 1994, but the forecast for 1995 shows that it is rising and that we will still be at the top of the polls. It seems that the Prime Minister is quite happy to talk about some of the figures, but he is overlooking what the complete picture is going to mean. Interest rates are a matter of very real concern. As I said, the OECD has forecast that in 1995 Australia will have the highest long-term rates in the world. Is telling the business sector that interest rates are going to be the highest in the world really the sort of thing that will fuel a long-term recovery?",64
151,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,It's not likely.,65
152,Mr HAWKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is right, it is not likely. Is that going to encourage people to invest in Australia or is it going to drive them off? If they have to borrow money to invest and they can borrow it at a lower rate from somewhere other than Australia, clearly they will have some hesitancy in coming to Australia. If you look at the same article in the Economist, you find that right now Australia has the highest prime rate in the world, at 9Yz per cent. We do actually share that prize with someone else-Sweden. It also has a prime rate of 9Yz per cent. The government used to like to cite the Swedish model as the example Australia should follow. Recently it has had some reluctance to talk about Sweden, and I think if you look a bit deeper you can probably see why. We also find that some of the other countries we are dealing with have rates that are significantly ,lower. It is even more interesting to look at real interest rates and the CPI increase for the past 12 months. Australia's CPI rate is 1.7 per cent. Let us look at a few comparable countries. Britain has a higher CPI, of 2.4 per cent, but if we subtract that from its prime bank rate we find that the figure is significantly lower, nearly one per cent lower, than Australia's. The Prime Minister often likes to talk about Great Britain in disparaging terms.",65
153,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,He hates them.,66
154,Mr HAWKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He does hate some of them too, I think. But, as I say, the real rate of interest is nearly one per cent lower than Australia's. Let us look at some of our trading partners. Our No.1 trading partner, Japan, has a forecast inflation rate this year of zero. Guess what its prime bank rate is-three per cent. In other words, its real rate of interest three per cent. Australia's is 7.55 per cent, significantly more than double that of our No. 1 trading partner. We could go on and look at countries like Switzerland, which has a real rate of 5.4 per cent, and the United States, which has a real rate of less than five per cent. Then, of course, that OECD outlook even shows comparisons with New Zealand, a country the Prime Minister also likes to make disparaging remarks about. The OECD again forecasts that our rate will be the highest-higher than New Zealand's. (Time expired) Export of Services: Shipping  p.m.)-My grievance this afternoon relates to our failure as a nation to exploit available opportunities for the export of services and to utilise Australian inbound freight services and insurance services for our imports, as well as utilise opportunities for our exports. There is a long standing culture in this country in both the public and the private sectors of giving preference to foreign shipping, foreign freight forwarding, foreign insurance and foreign services generally. Sometimes I think it is a hangover from 1788 when this country was settled and shipping was a captive market for the British shipowners, who were later joined by the Scandinavian and European shipowners. In more recent years they have been joined, in respect of iron ore and coal, by Japanese controlled or Japanese owned shipping services generally. It is probable that therein lies the major reason this country has never developed a major international shipping industry. On a cargo/distance basis-a tonne/kilometre basis-we are the fifth largest shipping market in the world. It is an excellent basis upon which to develop our own international shipping industry. But this long standing culture in Australia of an aversion to Australian services, including international transport services, applies to both imports and exports. It is time that competitive Australian services be given a fair go in the market. A recent report released by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator is Cook) and prepared by LEK Partnership Pty Ltd included material drawn from responses by some 1,370 service exporters, interviews of 75 key companies and surveys of some 45 associations. The report is based in the main upon the information drawn from those responses, interviews and surveys. The report shows that there is great potential for growth in the export and use of Australian services. In fact, projections indicate that export revenues from all service exporters will more than double in the five years between 1993 and 1998 and that jobs in the service sector will increase from some 228,000 in 1993 to 337,000 in 1998. But there is also a domestic multiplier effect from that: the direct jobs in the service sector go up by some 109,000 and on top of that revenue from sales will increase from $14.9 billion to $33 billion in the years 1993-98. There is great opportunity there. If we can break this long standing culture, and if we can get Australian importers and exporters to at least consider using competitive Australian services and transport and everything associated with transport, there is a great gain to be made. We can go on to look wider at the question of services generally. What is a service? A:ccording to the Economist magazine, a service is 'anything that you can't drop on your foot'. If we look more broadly, page 10 of that report lists some 28 different industries from which information was drawn. I will not quote all of them but the industries represented include: wholesale and distribution; technical services like architecture, consulting engineering and surveying services; services to agriculture; business administration; advertising and marketing; legal services; scientific research; education and training; broadcasting and media; cultural, entertainment and recreation; transport and storage; and finance and insurance. I will not read the rest of the list because I want to confine my remarks more specifically to shipping and its related services. Shipping is not the only component in the overall cost of the transport service. It is the major cost but linked to that at either end are insurance, freight and all the other services that are necessary to ensure safe transit, good condition and reliable delivery times for the products being carried. Across the world we are seeing the increasing development of integrated transport services. In other words, dealing with one organisation that is responsible for the transport of the freight from a place in one country to a place in another country brings with it efficiencies for the consignor as well as considerable opportunity for those organisations involved in the provision of all of those services. The report deals with transport on page 97, and says: Transport systems and infrastructure such as ports and airports are especially important to developing a dynamic and efficient service environment. It goes on to say: Australian flagged ships carry less than 10% of the nation's international shipping tradethat would be by valueclocking up a $2.8 billion deficit in 1993 because of the use of foreign vessels. In 1993. was equivalent to the total net trade deficit in services. Shipping by itself accounted for the total net trade deficit in services. The report goes on to say: The issue of shipping reform is complexwe all know that; we are dealing with itHowever, it should be given high national priority as it affects Australia's overall trade efficiency. This is not a report from a transport organisation, from a shipping company trying to push its own barrow or from a maritime union trying to increase opportunities for its members; this is a report on Australia's international services generally from the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. So the organisation making those comments has considerable merit and considerable status. Freight and insurance stand out as the continuing poor performers in services. As I said, our total deficit for 1993 was $2.8 billion. In 1992-93 we had a freight deficit of $2.5 billion, which was shown in the ABS figures released last month, most of which involved shipping. Freight payments to overseas operators rose from $A3.2 billion to $A3.7 billion. Earnings paid to Australianbased operators rose from $1.1 billion to only $1.2 billion. Traditionally Australian shipping has been eschewed by exporters, many of them foreign based. There is a choice between selling abroad on a cost, insurance and freight basis, CIF, where control of the insurance and freight charges are in the hands of the seller, and buying abroad on a free on board basis, FOB, where the buyer arranges freight and insurance. Most of our exports go out on an FOB basis. On the east coast of Australia the Japanese insist that market forces operate in the determination of coal prices. On the west coast of Australia, where Japan is our major customer for iron ore, the market for competitive Australian marine insurance is closed. That market is reserved by the Japanese for Japanese marine insurance companies. It is a pity that we do not have the same kind of arrangement from this government in support of this figure Australian marine insurers. In the concluding minutes I draw the attention of the House to article X of the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Australia and Japan which came into force on 21 August 1977. It states: The Contracting Parties, recognising that international shipping activities between the two countries play a significant role in the development of their economic. trade and commercial relations, and bearing in mind the objectives and principles of international agreements to which both Contracting Parties are parties, shall promote mutual co-operation for the development of shipping between the two countries on a fair and mutually advantageous basis. I believe that marine and cargo hold insurance associated with the movement of cargoes between Japan and Australia come within the ambit of article X of this treaty. I calIon our government to take up this issue and bring to the attention of the Japanese government the provisions of article X of this treaty so that there can be a greater opportunity for competitive Australian insurance companies and shipping services to have access on a fair and mutually advantageous basis to the movement of cargoes between Japan and Australia. Most people I speak to have no knowledge whatsoever of the provisions of this treaty, let alone a knowledge that the treaty exists. We want a fair go for competitive Australian services in our imports and exports, particularly our imports and exports with Japan. (Time expired) Swiss court case: Mr Karel Rychetsky",66
155,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I would like to raise a case where justice has been denied to a businessman for more than 99 months through the connivance and machinations of the Swiss government, in effect, costing him around $A5 million. Mr Karel Rychetsky was born in Czechoslovakia and now lives in my electorate in Western Australia as a naturalised Australian. Mr Rychetsky arrived in this country in October 1988. After fleeing the communists in 1948, Mr Rychetsky obtained an economics degree in Switzerland and then worked in Colombia before settling in Switzerland in 1963. In Switzerland he founded a company called Orbex SA, an export distribution company. He was the manager and partner of that business. He put up 45 per cent of the capital to start Orbex and his partner put up the other 55 per cent, though they both agreed to have equal representation and voting rights in the company. Mr Rychetsky's partner in Orbex, Mr Vilem Allan, also controlled the company which manufactured the drinks and cubes using a prearranged formula to calculate the retail cost of the product. The formula was called 'scheme 1964' and was based on a calculation of the prices of the raw materials and packaging, plus 20 per cent profit. In 1969, Mr Allan took over the account controlling the production of the drink known as Tikisa. He then effectively had a monopoly over the company which provided Orbex with the product for export. Between October 1974 and June 1975 a judicial expert in Switzerland found that. Mr Allan had artificially manipulated the prIces of the products leaving the factory so that a higher export cost was assessed using 'scheme 1964'. This meant that Mr Allan stood to make a windfall profit from the inflated prices of the exported goods since he was a partner in the exporting company itself. Over a twoyear period, between 1971 and 1973, t-e judicial inquiry found that the amount was In excess of 900,000 Swiss francs. On the basis of the judicial expert's report, Mr Rychetsky lodged a claim against Mr Allan for fraud in 1975. This claim was rejected; however, the Swiss government at no time contested the validity of the judicial expert's findings in regard to the overpricing scam which netted Allan 900,000 francs. It was at this point that the expected 18 months of arbitration on Mr Rychetsky's claim ballooned out to more than 99 months costing him a great deal of money. The court dragged Mr Rychetsky's case out for this long for a number of reasons. Firstly, the court decided to hear the case in private and not in public. Though Mr Rychetsky'.s cla-m .-as well substantiated-four detaIled JudIcIal reports in his favour were provided by him at cost of over 60,000 Swiss francs-the court took 99 months to make a decision. This court was composed of three members: two of Switzerland's most senior judges and a friend of Mr Allan's lawyer. During the court hearings none of the many documents provided by Mf Rychetsky were examined, none of the parties involved were cross-examined and no witnesses were admitted. In addition, Mr Rychetsky's lawyer was gagged and Mr Allan's lawyer was heard. Even more curious is part of the court's decision, finally reached in April 1978, which said in part: To know if the principles of the scheme have been respected in the facts 3.l!d,. if give- - e case, the inobservation of these pnnclples an incident on the price to be paid by Vilem Allan to Karel Ryche-ky for his participations in ORBEX, are questIons which cannot be solved without help of an expert's report ... Honourable members should remember that Mr Rychetsky provided four reports. This was what appeared to be the first illicit act by the arbitration court. It called for a new report permitted only Allan to question the expert and to use false balance sheets to support his view. Following the arbitration court hearing, the former highest judge in France, Mr Jean Cosson, concluded that the arbitrators proceeded in connivance, that an error of the Supreme Court judges Forni and Leu was excluded and that he could not explain the behaviour other than· by corruption. Mr Rychetsky then lodged a penal complaint against the authors of the falsified report. The judges Forni and Leu said their task had been only to decide the judicial questions and they would be victims themselves if that report had been false. This suggests that they did not establish the facts and therefore were guilty of a breach of article 4 of the Swiss constitution. Mr Rychetsky brought a penal action against the two judges for this failure, but it was rejected out of hand without any inquiry. He was received by the President of Switzerland, Mr Arnold Koeller, in October 1990 and explained his case. After the case was aired in the German magazine Der Speige/, Koeller ordered a negotiation of the transaction. In a discussion it was stated that the Swiss government did not want to pursue the matter because the image of Switzerland would suffer if the case went further. It was said that the government was ready to settle Mr Rychetsky's claim and that it would be interpolated by the European Commission on Human Rights in relation to his pending claim of denial of justice and violation of contractual rights. Mr Rychetsky petitioned the Swiss government in June 1992 to January 1994 based on the writings of a number of senior Swiss and foreign specialists in law requesting the Swiss parliament to admit damages and re-establish the integrity of the Swiss justice system. That petition is still pending. Mr Rychetsky has corresponded with the Swiss minister for finance and the general secretary of finance concerning the settlement of damages. Since he has not been able to get a Swiss lawyer to represent him, he has been using a French lawyer. I would like to read a letter but sent on behalf of Mr Rychetsky by Rolf Bossi, who was at the time one of the best known penal lawyers in Germany, to the Supreme Court judges Rolando Forni and Hean-Jacques Leu dated 30 May 1986. Honourable members will have to excuse some of the English-it is not the best-as it has been translated from German. The letter reads: Your Honour, As evidenced by the attached power of attorney, we are defending the interests of Mr Karel Rychetsky who has appointed us to examine your behaviour as an arbitrator in the case of Rychetsky vs. Allan, and if the case arises, to submit our findings for examination by the Swiss penal authorities. From the documents handed over to us, there is indication that Mr Rychetsky has suffered in the arbitration process in which you acted as Judge, important damages which Mr Andre Cottier, doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor of Geneva University, has evaluated at Swiss Francs 3,8 mill. The award was based upon an intentional false expert's opinion. The introduction of this expert's report into the procedure can only be explained as an act of connivance between the Arbitral Court and the Experts. You are highly suspect by reason of the following circumstances: At the beginning of the arbitral proceedings, already four accounting opinions on the subject of the dispute as ordered by one judge and established by a renowned Swiss fiduciary were at your disposition. In spite of that, you had ordered a new opinion even though a rapid decision in the arbitration process was possible based on the opinions already established. This done, you not only offered the defendant (Allan) the possibility of dragging out the proceedings beyond 99 months, which is a duration without equal, but you also prepared the way for the intentional establishment of a false opinion to the prejudice of our client. By nominating the expert and by putting the opinion into the proceedings, you have participated in the penal act of the expert according to Article 307 of the Penal Code. As we have already stated, it was not necessary to order a new opinion. During the proceedings, you had refused the plaintiff all possibilities of control which could have led to a verification of the opinion. The witnesses were questioned only by the Expert, the plaintiff had no possibility of questioning the persons to whom Mr. Jaquier had access. It is equally incomprehensible that you had accepted, without critic, the false opinion into the arbitral verdict. At that time there were four opinions of the expert Michet from the years 1974 and 1975. These differed, in a most important way, from the Jaquier opinion which prejudiced our client. This should have lead you to proceed with an investigation of the Jaquier opinion if you had not, from the beginning, the intention of basing your judgment on the false opinion. But the contrary happened. The expert was given the competence of a Judge because he could question the witnesses without control and the part of the other party to the process and in this manner you had prevented all control of the expert by our client. It is intentionally that you have contributed to the penal act. Taking into consideration your formation as a Jurist and your experience as a Judge, one has to exclude the possibility that you had overlooked the fraudulent maneuverings of Allan and the intentional establishment of a false opinion. Already in the autumn of 1978 you had in your hands the legal opinion of Professor Stefan Trechsel, Member of the European Commission of Human Rights, which analysed in depth the serious offences committed by the defendant, Allan, offences which are to be attacked by law. In the summer of 1983 you had received a copy of the complain of our client against Jaquier and Pollicino for intentional establishment of a false report according to Article 307 of the Swiss Penal Code. As cited in the opinion of Professor Andre Cottier, the errors contained in the Jaquier opinion appeared so clearly that any first semester student of Economics could see that the Jaquier opinion was false. You had as well at your disposition the Michet opinions which differed in an important way from the opinion under attack and which should have lead you to examine critically its contents. Suffice to say, you are highly suspect of having participated not only in violation of Article 307 of the Swiss Penal Code but equally in fraud. The letter goes on for some duration. But the federal judges Forni and Leu refused to renounce their immunity, and Mr Bossi held a news conference in Zurich on 30 June 1986 repeating publicly his serious charges against these two judges, leading Swiss newspapers to publish them the next day. However, the Swiss authorities did not undertake to investigate these heavy accusations and, for that matter, the two judges did nothing against Mr Bossi, knowing that these facts were true. It is my opinion that the injustice to my constituent Mr Rychestsky spans 20 years, and it is time the Swiss government stopped equivocating and admitted that there has been a gross miscarriage of justice and settled with Mr Rychestsky after all this time. Liberal Party of Australia: 50th Anniversary",68
156,Mr CHYNOWETH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,My grievance today is about the Liberal Party in this its 50th anniversary. I grieve for the demise of a credible opposition and a party that has had an impact of some note in this House and on this whole nation. Mr Biiney-A once great party.,70
157,Mr CHYNOWETH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes, a once great party. That is correct. Fifty years of mediocrity has come to a climax with a bunch of disparate people thrown together with no common idea or goal, except attaining power in any way possible. It is a party that started with some goals and policy-but a party started, of course, by Robert Gordon Menzies for his own political aspirations. I would like to remind the people of Australia about a couple of events in the past which the Liberal Party and its founder, Robert Menzies, were involved in. The first event I would like to remind them of was the famous pig-iron dispute. There was an article in the Vanguard recently in relation to this. It states: But still in 1938, a time when travel was a much more exclusive thing than it has now become, a band of these workers had refused to load pig-iron onto a ship called the Dalfram on the Port Kembla wharves. Japan had invaded China a year earlier. Nanking had been subjected to the most brutal and ruthless massacres. While none of these workers could speak a word of Chinese they understood what was happening over there. They could see the clouds of war gathering over Europe. They wanted no part of the Japanese war machine. They refused to load the raw materials of war. ' Melbourne wharfies refused to load the Atsuta Maru. Wharfies in Fremantle, Port Adelaide, Hobart, Sydney and Brisbane had refused to load cargos for Japan but been beaten by legal sanctions and threats of violence. The then Attorney-General Bob Menzies tried to force the Port Kembla wharfies to succumb. They were threatened with gaol and fines. There were threatened with losing their livelihood. Menzies provocatively swept through the Illawarra coastal districts to bring the threats home to the Crewmen of the Dalfram supported the ban. Their leader was declared insane and dumped in a madhouse only to be soon released. They sent in the bankers and rent collectors to throw people of their home. Strikers were bashed in the streets by police. BHP locked up the Port Kembla works, throwing thousands out of work just before mas. The wives and families took up the cry of no war materiel for Japan. The Port Kembla wharfies only gave way when they had brought an end to pig-iron to Japan. The person who instigated all this was none other than Bob Menzies. An article in the Truth of 31 August 1940 states, under the subheading 'Millionaires on Dais of Leaderhere ship': Australia has grown impatient with the procession of major blunders which have characterised Menzies' captaincy since the war began. These blunders, and the shiftlessness of which they are symptomatic, have irritated and distressed the people beyond measure. Nothing less than a sweeping change will satisfy the people on September 21. Of course, Curtin was put into power at that time. Those articles make interesting reading because they show a little bit of the history the Liberal Party. If you want a copy of it, can supply it to you. Also, the Liberal Party policy called the Liberal Platform, the official platform of the Liberal Party of Australia issued by the federal secretariat in November 1948-it does not issue those sorts of ments anymore because it does not have policies-states under the heading of 'social security': I. Generous provisions by means of an effective social insurance scheme, for superannuation, incapacity, sick pay, medical and the unemployment, widowhood, and family endowment. All children to be provided for by child endowment. That was quite reasonable. That was the sort of policy the Liberal Party had at its formaspecific tion in 1948. However, if you remember the 1949 elections-which I do not because I was only a few years old, but I have read enough about them-Menzies got into power at that time because he said he would remove petrol rationing and increase child endowment and there would be a huge increase to pensions and the like. He did that when he men. power in 1949. He did remove petrol rationing. The pensioners got a huge rise, but that was the only rise they got for year after year. out One of the other things that was removed at the time was called the social services contribution. A Liberal Party ad that was going Christaround on 3 December 1949 stated: Existing SOCIAL SERVICES to be maintained, the Means Test modified, and CHILD ENDOWMENT extended to the first child without affecting the any further supply of basic wage. The interesting bit is 'Existing social services to be maintained'. What happened when the Liberal Party got into power in 1949? I have an actual tax return from one of my constituents who has been kind enough to supply it to me. His taxable wage at the time was £389 6s.",70
158,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,What was the tax rate?,71
159,Mr CHYNOWETH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The tax rate was 18p in the pound. His social services contribution was £29 12s. His tax was £18, so his total tax was £48 9s. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Victoria at the time was R.W. Chenoweth-no relation, I must say. Howof ever, he was contributing to the social serI vices of this nation. That money added up over the years to around £30 million, I believe-a huge amount of money. What did Menzies do? He put it all into consolidated revenue. It all disappeared and went into this docuhuge amorphous mass of money, so the money of those people like my constituent, who contributed more in social services contribution than in tax, disappeared. Menzies stole it. He put it away and it was never seen again. I still have people coming to me and like expenses, complaining about it. If we look at the actual summary of the way Chiftey set up the social services fund in 1946, from 1 January, we find that it was a and separate levy which operated to finance the fund. In 1950, the special levy was merged with general income tax; financing of the fund passed to payroll tax-an amount equal to the updated 1950-51 levy contribution. In 1976, the then Treasurer, Mr Lynch, had accumulated the balance paid into the consolidated revenue fund. This was all got into done under the Liberal Party. Just imagine what could have been done with the £30 million-odd invested right back in 1949-50 to set up our own superannuation fund, which we are trying to do now. We are actually trying to do this through legislation that the government has brought into try to encourage people to get into superannuation. We could have had a huge base already established. What has happened to it? The Liberals just stole it-frittered it away. Who knows what they did with it. It is gone forever; it will never be found. That is the sort of thing that the Liberal Party has been doing over the past 50 years. I cannot think of anything that really stands out as something we could say the Liberal Party has put its stamp on-that it has come up with an idea, that it has put it forward and that it has been well received by a majority of the Australian people. The Liberal Party is a party that has lost its way. As I said before, I recall walking to Parliament House past the new Liberal Party headquarters which was being renovated and was not open at the time. Out the front I saw a statue of Robert Gordon Menzies. I had a great laugh to myself because covering the bust was a plastic garbage bag. I thought to myself that that was just where it belonged. Child Support Agency: Complaints",71
160,Mr HALVERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I doubt that I am any different from any other member of this chamber when it comes to naming the source of most complaints from constituents about any government department or agency. The Child Support Agency, CSA, always but always wins hands down. The deficiencies in the management, administrative procedures and operations of the CSA not only have been a source of constant criticism by its disillusioned clients-in some instances 'victims' would probably be a better wordand their parliamentary representatives but also have been criticised by many others, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian National Audit Office and the Joint Standing Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. It has been obvious for a long time that the CSA has never managed adequately to come to grips with the important job that has been entrusted to it. Unfortunately, the government has been responsible for prolonging the agony by its apathetic attitude and torpid approach to introducing the necessary measures to effectively overcome the plethora of problems-major and minor-which have beset the CSA since it was established in June 1988. Although there have been some improvements to the operations of the CSA over recent months, the changes came far too late for one of my constituents. The disgraceful episode that I bring to the attention of the House this afternoon has, thankfully, now been resolved-although it is arguable whether or not the resolution has been satisfactory in all respects. It serves to illustrate, however, the powerlessness of innocent people against an unsympathetic and incompetent bureaucracy and the effort required to obtain justice even when the bureaucracy is finally forced to admit that it has been wrong. This unhappy chronicle of events concerned one of my constituents whose treatment by the CSA can only be described as abominable. My constituent and his wife were married in 1983. Their first child was born in 1986. They separated in May 1989 and at that time reached an informal agreement that, pending final settlement and in lieu of formal maintenance, my constituent would continue to meet their home mortgage payments of $175 per week. My constituent directed his employer to deduct this amount directly from his salary and pay it directly to his wife. This informal agreement was confirmed by a court order made in September 1989. Shortly after, a second child was born. In accordance with section 21 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, both children were 'eligible children' under stage 2 of the child support scheme. In November 1989 my constituent, his wife and their legal advisers attended a conference at the Family Court and all matters relating to their separation including child support were resolved. To enable the wife to remain in the family home, it was agreed that my constituent would make a lump sum payment of child maintenance and reduced weekly child support payments. Both parties consented to this arrangement and an application to register this agreement was sent to the Dandenong Child Support Agency. The agency admits that it mislaid this application. Apparently a further application was forwarded to the CSA in February 1990, together with written advice confirming that the husband had been making regular payments direct to the wife, that there were no arrears in child support payments and that payments would commence through the agency at the appropriate time. It seems that this second application was also mislaid by the CSA, so a further copy of the agreement was provided to it. My constituent, quite understandably, hoped that the old principle of third time lucky would apply and that the matter would be resolved. Unfortunately, his confidence was subsequently proved-along with the first two applications-to have been misplaced. Some two years after the first application had been provided to the CSA, my constituent was shocked and dismayed to find that his income tax refund had been withheld as payment of arrears in child support. He visited Dandenong CSA and, during an interview with an agency officer, was informed that the CSA had been receiving payments in accordance with the agreement. But the agency was claiming arrears of more than $6,000, which it alleged was owing under a retrospective administrative agreement. The agency officer advised my constituent to contact a solicitor and make an immediate departure application in the Family Court from the administrative assessment of child support. My constituent followed this advice. However, because of his financial situation at the time, he applied to the Legal Aid Commission for assistance. Although his application for legal aid was ultimately refused, his solicitors filed a departure order on his behalf and the matter was subsequently heard in the Family Court. My constituent and his wife appeared at the hearing, both represented by barristers. There was no appearance on behalf of the CSA, despite the fact that it had been served with a copy of the departure application and that it was on the basis of its claim for arrears that the matter had proceeded to the court in the first place. Mter lengthy negotiations between the legal representatives of my constituent and his wife, complicated by the conflicting and confusing information from the CSA, consent orders were finally made. On the day of the court hearing, my constituent's barrister spoke several times with a representative of the CSA by telephone and advised the officer of the terms of the consent orders which, amongst other things, specified that there were no arrears. She was assured by this officer that all penalties, fines and costs sought by the CSA would be cancelled and that my constituent's income tax refund cheque would be sent to him upon receipt of the orders. A sealed copy of the orders was duly sent to the Dandenong CSA. The question of costs for my constituent was not pursued at the hearing because, in the absence of the CSA, this would have resulted in extending the hearing for a further day. Counsel representing my constituent was concerned that this extension would involve him in considerable additional costs with no guarantee that they could be recovered. By this stage my constituent had incurred costs of more than $2,000, of which he had managed to pay a $350 deposit. In February 1992 my constituent approached me complaining about the inefficiencies of the CSA and about the financial loss and personal distress he had suffered, and was still suffering, as a result of its actions. I wrote to the then Treasurer informing him of the complaints and seeking his advice and intervention. Three months later, advice was received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer that the matter was being thoroughly examined by the Dandenong CSA, and it was noted that several matters required further investigation. Two further letters were subsequently forwarded by me to the parliamentary secretary in regard to this matter. Finally, in August 1993 the Assistant Treasurer wrote that, after reviewing the file, the registrar conceded that this matter had not been handled in a satisfactory manner and that my constituent may be entitled to seek compensation. After advising my constituent of this latest development, I understand that he wrote to the CSA making a claim for compensation. Apparently, in the best tradition of the CSA, this letter was also mislaid. In the absence of any response from the CSA, my constituent again approached my office for assistance. Understandably, as over 2'12 years had now elapsed, my constituent's solicitors were pressing him for payment of the balance of his account which he had not been able to meet. In May of this year I wrote to the deputy child support registrar at Box Hill, making a claim on behalf of my constituent. The claim included his legal costs, estimated loss of wages, travelling expenses and damages for distress and inconvenience. Following a considerable number of telephone calls from my office to the CSA, and after waiting three months, during which time advice was received that the matter had been referred to Attorney-General's office to determine whether the CSA had been negligent, a letter was ultimately received by my constituent from the CSA. Enclosed with the letter was a cheque to cover the amount of my constituent's legal expenses only. Despite the admission that there had been 'a series of errors by the Child Support Agency' and that there was 'a breach of duty of care by the Child Support Agency', the letter advised him that if he wanted to pursue any further claim he must provide further evidence of actual financial loss or damage and that the loss damage was caused by the agency's actions. This whole shameful and disturbing episode has understandably caused my constituent enormous distress and has sorely tested the patience and tolerance of his solicitors. shameful and unforgivable that it took someimportance thing in the order of 2'12 years for the right, and then only in part, the wrong it perpetrated on my constituent. The fact is my constituent has been financially disadvancourse, taged as a result of the maladministration the CSA in this matter. He is still out of pocket in respect of legitimate expenses incurred in defending himself against the CSA's false accusation, expenses which will be very difficult to substantiate, stringent requirements of the CSA and the length of time that has now elapsed. The unnecessary and unjustifiable trauma and stress my constituent has suffered is immeasurable and has not been acknowledged by the CSA. (Time expired) Social Justice Policies",72
161,Dr THEOPHANOUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (5.12 p.m.)I want to talk today about the issue of social justice and social policy generally and the importance for this country of developing even further its social policies as we move towards the end of this century and the beginning of the new one. In this regard the ALP National Conference made some extremely important decisions with respect to social justice and other social policies. It was the unfortunate that the media chose to ignore most of these important policy decisions for the dubious reason that they were all agreed by the party; there was no controversy. So the media thought it was boring. But in a range of areas-I mention the social justice platform, the employment platform and the social security platform-there were significant and important new commitments, and there were important new developments in social policy. Social policy issues will be the key set of issues that determines politics moving into the or 21 st century. The minister and I recently returned from the United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, where central issues of social policy, especially the rights of women, were debated. Significantly in the context of the discussion of It is these issues, matters c-me up such as the of universal health policies, the CSA to importance of rights for women and for had indigenous people and the importance of that universal education. 'Universal' means, of the inclusion of women in this area. of So there was a whole range of social policy debates and discussions. The United Nations declaration on human rights was challenged. Did it meet that challenge? It did, and there will be a further report on this matter later given the this week by the minister. In relation to social policy and social justice policy there has been a lot of discussion this country and the adoption of a number of approaches. The adoption of the platform meant that the Australian Labor Party is committed to a series of policies with respect to, first of all, the acknowledgment of universal social rights to employment, educagovernment tion, health and housing. Secondly, there was a commitment to set a range of benchmarks for achievements by governments, state and federal, with respect to those social policies and to achieve those benchmarks. Thirdly, there was a recognition that having those policies was not sufficient unless there genuine access and equity policy, that is, policy which ensures that people have access to those services irrespective of religion, gender or ethnic background. That is another key element of social justice. There was a reinforcement of what I have referred to as the fourth element of social justice, the direct provision of assistance to the most disadvantaged in our community, young kids who are in trouble, homeless people, single parents who do not have enough means of support, et cetera-those groups in the community who need direct assistance, a helping hand, so to speak. We must not ignore them in the total picture of social justice. Why is this current development within the Australian Labor Party important? It is important because it is part of an international development. There has been an attempt, especially by social democratic parties, to redefine the agenda. Following the collapse of the eastern European societies there has been an attempt to move to the radical right in politics. Many people have tried to emulate the Reagans and the Thatchers of this world. Unfortunately, those experiments have proved a disaster from a social policy point of view. The societies that have followed those prescriptions have ended up with huge gaps between the rich and the poor, with the creation of an underclass and with many other social disasters. There has been, therefore, serious discussion about how there can be a genuinely social democratic approach that on the one hand gives a real place for the free market in and on the other hand recognises the importance of social policies. In this regard, it is has interesting to note that the British Labour now Party and its new leader have adopted an approach very similar to the approach adopted the by the ALP National Conference and by the in its social policies. That approach gives due recognition to the role of the free market, to the role of the marketplace, but at the same time gives due recognition to the importance of social policies, policies on employment, health, education and a whole range of areas. This development throughout is a a range of social democratic countries is a important when looked at in the context of what has been done in Australia by the race, Australian Labor government. A large number of the policies that l1ave been developed are similar in their approach. Therefore, there is a tradition arising in which the Australian Labor Party is leading the way in many respects, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said recently. When the Prime Minister did me the honour of launching my book on social justice he said that, in many ways, Australia is leading the way in developing this new social democratic philosophy. I bring this point up because so much has been written in the last few months about the conservative party in this country, especially the fact that the Liberal Party is facing its 50-year anniversary. It is a tragedy that there is currently such division in policy direction, that there is no coherent philosophy to replace the kind of benign welfarism of Menzies and, instead, there are those who want to follow the Thatcher model. The recent revelations concerning the philosophical underpinnings of the beliefs of the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), indicated the extreme extent to which opposition members are prepared to do that. It was revealed that much of the honourable member's maiden speech was actually from this extreme Right source. That represents one dimension of the Liberal Party, but there is also the other dimension-those people who actually want to do something about social policy and welfare. They have not been sufficiently listened to in the context of the Australian debate. It is time that they were listened to. It is time that there was an attempt by the conservative parties-especially by the Liberal Party, which has to show leadership in this matter-to accept the fact that in Australia, as indeed in any other civilised society, there has to be certain basic criteria of social justice and that those criteria have to be adopted and incorporated into a coherent position. That has not been happening. When Alexander Downer became the Leader of the Opposition",74
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to members properly.,76
163,Dr THEOPHANOUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"When the Leader of the Opposition became the Leader of the Opposition, he said that he wanted to have a party that was going to steer a reasonable course. What did we see? A whole series of decisions taken after that point were contrary to the interests of social justice, especially Aboriginal people. (Time expired) Bushfires: Aerial Firefighting Capacity",76
164,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to address the House on an issue of interest to most, if not all, honourable members, and that is aerial fighting of bushfires. Again, in recent days, we have seen bushfires rage out of control in parts of New South Wales and Queensland. This again prompts a re-examination of our fire fighting techniques. After seeing the disastrous New South Wales bushfires encroach into the Sydney outer urban area earlier this year, we need to examine very seriously the development of an aerial bush fighting capacity in Australia. I am glad to say that there is a very extensive aerial firefighting capacity in Victoria and South Australia. It has been developed over some 25 years and includes a number of large agricultural fixed wing aircraft which are placed near sites which are subject to outbreaks of bushfires. In recent years, they have been relatively successful in quelling fires before they get to the point where aerial fighting and ground fighting has little or no impact. A measure of the infrastructure built up by the Victorian government is the involvement of its Department of Conservation and Natural Resources in the New South Wales bushfires of January this year. I understand that, from 5 January to 16 January, 50 conservation and natural resources staff and 14 contract pilots-plus engineering and other support staff-were directly involved in air operations. They filled such roles as air operations manager, air attack supervisor, aircraft officer, airbase manager and airbase staff, and were positioned at most major centres of activity around Sydney. Thirteen conservation and natural resource aircraft flew a total of 424 hours. The aircraft involved were: three medium helicopters for firebombing and evacuation; three light helicopters for command, mapping and air attack supervision; six fixed wing firebombers; and one fixed wing aircraft equipped with infrafor red line scanning, which was the mapping aircraft. The conservation and natural resource firebombing aircraft used 3,500 litres of foam concentrate and 32 tonnes of fire retardant. It is a matter of great concern that New South Wales is so ill-equipped in regard to its aerial fire fighting capacity and is therefore left unprepared to cope in a proper way with its bushfire seasons. I make that point because it does establish the importance and value of an aerial capacity in fighting bushfires-a lesson yet I have to say to be fully learnt by the New South Wales and Queensland governments. Moreover, this form of firefighting capacity is very cost effective. Richard Alder of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources wrote a paper for a conference of the Institute of Fire Engineers in Adelaide in December 1990. In his paper entitled, 'Fighting bushfires from the air', he set out the cost effectiveness of aerial firefighting. When the department conducted an analysis of the quelling of fires at an early stage over a number of years-the last five, for example-it was able to identify fires in which the actual use of air attack has clearly prevented losses in terms of suppression costs and damage. In April 1994, the Australian Fire Authorities Council, which represents all Australian urban, rural and land management fire agencies, compiled a position paper on firebombing in Australia. It concluded that agricultural fixed wing aircraft, and light to medium sized helicopters with a suspended bucket or belly tank, can provide a costeffective suppression option for fires burning in remote or mountainous country while these fires remain small. We do have, therefore, an established framework which can be copied by states other than Victoria and South Australia to enhance their firefighting capaciNavy ty. However, it does concern me that we seem to be rushing headlong into adopting larger aircraft. This was very much the recommendation of the then Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure-now the Senate Economics Legislation Committee-in its recently released report entitled Disaster management. That committee recommended that CL215 water bombing aircraft be trialled in this summer. There has now been a rash of newspaper reports, both in national and regional newspapers, accepting as a fait accompli that the CL215s will be trialled in Australia over this summer. That concerns me enormously because I have serious questions as to, firstly, the cost effectiveness of very expensive aircraft and, secondly, their technical capacity-whether or not they can actually do the job we require of them. National Jet Systems, which I understand is based in South Australia, has offered Australian authorities a $2.5 million deal to trial these Canadair CL215 SuperScoopers this bush fire season. I am led to understand that this $2.5 million is providing two aircraft 250 hours worth of flying. That is very expensive when you compare some of the possible alternatives, such as the Catalina from southern California, which I understand would be available in Australia for some $500,000 each, including the transport and purchase of those aircraft. I am not saying that Catalinas are the answer, but I do not believe in embracing the Canadair CL215s until they have been properly assessed. The opportunity provided by a developing industry in my electorate to utilise the former Royal Australian Navy Grumman Tracker aircraft has also not been properly considered. Converted Grumman Trackers are operated throughout the world in a fire control role: by Connair in Canada, Direction de la Securite Civile in France and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in the United States. Shadowstone Aviation, based at the West Sale Aerodrome in Gippsland, has obtained an option to purchase four ex-Royal Australian Grumman Tracker aircraft, which are now hangared at their base at West Sale whilst a detailed analysis and costing on the project is carried out. The indications at this time are that Shadowstone Aviation could convert these aircraft to fire control configuration for approximately $1.2 million each. Conversion time would be in the vicinity of 12 months per aircraft depending on funding availability and perceived urgency. That can be compared with the cost of triaIling two Australia Canadair CL215s for $2.5 million. There is a great deal of expertise available to Shadowstone Aviation. Its partner organisation, Yungur Aviation, was responsible for refurbishing to flying standard and then ferrying to West Sale 10 of these former Royal Australian Navy Grumman Trackers. In these addition, members of Shadowstone Aviation have had personal experience with both aircraft through the National Safety Council arrangements with the Conn air and Canada exchange programs for the fire control aircraft out of season. We have to look at the cost. Moreover, the Canadair CL215s need to fly in and scoop up the water. I worry about whether or not that and is possible. We are told that they require a certain distance to do that. There has to be a body of water, although it may be that they are able to do that in the ocean so long as the fires are not too far away from the coast. I caution the House about accepting the recommendations of the Senate standing committee without further investigation, particularly in regard to the possible alternative of the Grumman Tracker aircraft. I do not say definitively, nor does Shadowstone Aviation, that the Grumman Trackers are the answer, but we do know that on a cost and practical basis they seem to have a number of advantages over the CL215s. Of course, water would be pumped into the Grumman Trackers whereas the CL215s would need to scoop up the water. (Time expired) Taylor, Mr I: Resignation as Leader of the Western Australian Opposition",76
165,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a Western Australian state parliamentary colleague, the member for Kalgoorlie in the state parliament, Mr Ian Taylor. Members would be aware that, until today, Mr Taylor was the leader of the Western Australian state opposition and he announced his resignation from that position yesterday. Mr Taylor has been a friend and colleague of mine for almost 20 years. I first met Mr Taylor in 1976 when he was a member of the Dianella branch of the Australian Labor Party and a delegate and subsequently an office bearer of the Perth Electorate Council of the Australian Labor Party, which is the relevant party unit responsible for giving organisationfrom al support to the federal member for Perth. We subsequently worked on a campaign for Mr Keith Wilson to become the state member for Dianella. I take the opportunity of paying Mr Taylor because in very many respects he is not the usual stereotype of a politician. I will draw attention to a number of attributes he has, but one point I make about Mr Taylor is that in the 20 years I have known him he has not changed. Public office has not deNo formed him by usage, which is a complaint of often made about politicians by members the public. Ian Taylor is a good and decent honest, a man of great integrity, and he has It always been publicly spirited. He has two, think, very great characteristics. To my knowsignificant ledge and experience he has always put his family first and he has always put the comparty. munity, the state and his own party before his own self-interest. He became the state member for Kalgoorlie in 1981 at a by-election. In 1986 he the state minister for health and in 1990 he became Deputy Premier to Premier Carmen Lawrence, now the member for Fremantle in this House and Minister for Health and Human Services. In 1994 he became leader of the Western Australian opposition. On three occasions he has put his own view of the community, the state and the party good ahead of his own personal position or his personal advancement. On the occasion of the now member for Fremantle's becoming Premier, he chose to become Deputy Premier rather than contest the position of premier because he believed that she would be a better Premier for the state's future. When he became Leader of the Opposition in 1994 he was, in effect, against his better judgment, drafted by his colleagues, and his resignation in the last 24 hours has been his own decision on the basis of his view of his own capacities. One of the hardest things to do in this profession is have a cold-blooded view about one's own capacities and a view about what is best for institutions, community, state or country, rather than what is best for oneself. I do not normally rely upon editorials the West Australian, but I think today's editorial of the West Australian gets it right. It states: Mr Taylor is widely respected as a decent and forthright man-a man most people would not tribute to mind having as a neighbour. In the end, it was completely in character for Mr Taylor to make the harsh judgment about himself . . . and to step aside with a minimum of fuss. matter how unsuited politicians are for positions status, they usually need to be prised from them. of Mr Taylor . . . went with honour. The editorial draws a conclusion with which man. He is I agree. It states: is likely that history will endorse that judgment. II believe that is right. Ian Taylor has made a contribution to the community of Western Australia, to his state and to his I take this opportunity to wish him, his wife, Sandy, and his family well for the future and wish him well in his continuing representation of the people of Kalgoorlie in the state became parliament of Western Australia.",78
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocher)Order! It being 5.37 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed earlier the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Bowen, Sir Nigel Hubert, AC, KBE Debate resumed.",79
167,Mr LAVARCH,CONDOLENCES,"I wish to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). I join with those members in expressing deep regret on the death of Sir Nigel Bowen. Nigel Bowen was born, quite literally, in a log cabin in 1911 in British Columbia in Canada. At the time, his Welsh born father, Otway, and English mother, Dorothy, were trying to make a go of cherry orcharding after a previous stint in South Africa in the diamond industry. Apparently the particular land in question was subsequently resumed for the purposes of building a railway and the Bowens moved from Canada to Australia. They then set up the family home on a sheep property near Gunnedah shortly after Nigel's birth. Their luck on the land, however, was not terribly much better than it was in Canada and eventually the family moved to Ashfield in Sydney where Otway Bowen returned to his original profession, accountancy. These were not easy times, even for accountants it would seem. Nigel apparently needed the help of some relatives to spend some two years of his schooling in England. He then completed his schooling at King's School in Parramatta. He then moved on to tertiary studies at Sydney University where he completed his law degree. He practised initially as a solicitor and then joined the uth Wales bar in 1936. During the Second World War he served, we heard earlier, in a number of roles with stinction and obtained the rank of captain. was remarked during a eulogy delivered by ob Ellicott at the funeral that during some work in Papua New Guinea he shared his unit with Captain Frank Packer and Corporal Ninian Stephen. This was quite an amazing collection of outstanding Australians to be one very small unit of the armed forces. After the war, Sir Nigel returned to the bar and shared a floor of Denman Chambers in Sydney with such other well-known Australians as Gough Whitlam, John Kerr and, somewhat later, Bob Ellicott. In 1953 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel in New South Wales and in Victoria one year later. His reputation quickly grew, particularly in the areas of equity and constitutional law. He had an extensive appellate practice before the New South Wales Supreme Court, the High Court and the Privy Council. He served as Vice President of the Law Council of Australia for three years from 1957 and as President of the New South Wales Bar Council for two years from 1959. For many years, from 1946 to 1961, he was the editor of the Australian Law Journal. Hence, he made a major contribution with that august journal. Sir Nigel's interest in politics first stemmed from his involvement with the bar and in representing the legal profession. In 1964 he entered parliament, winning the seat of Parramatta and following in the footsteps of some very distinguished lawyers, including Sir Howard Beale and Sir Garfield Barwick. Within two years, he became Attorney General. As we heard earlier, he served in that office on two separate occasions. He had a fine record in all of these portfolios, but it is the portfolio of Attorney-General about which I would like to comment. As I mentioned, Sir Nigel was a leading Australian silk in constitutional matters. One of his most notable achievements was to see that the appropriate role of the High Court of Australia was as the supreme law making body of common law in this country and the final arbiter in all constitutional matters. He New then successfully proposed legislation which saw a range of appeals cut from the High Court to the Privy Council. The final leg of that chapter, of course, occurred with the passing of the Australia Act in 1986. After the defeat of the coalition government in 1972, Sir Nigel contested leadership of the Liberal Party and was unsuccessful by one vote. As Bob Ellicott said at the funeral, 'How different the history of this country may have been if he had won.' In 1973 Sir Nigel resigned his seat in parliament to accept the appointment as Chief Judge in Equity of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He held that position until taking up appointment as Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia in 1976. It was his lifelong friend, Bob Ellicott, who had served with him earlier as Solicitor General, and then as Attorney-General, who convinced Sir Nigel to take the position at the Federal Court. Bob Ellicott recalled that at first Sir Nigel was somewhat reluctant. It was only after he had been shown the splendid view from the 21 st floor of the court building in Sydney that Sir Nigel finally agreed. It was during his period as Chief Justice of the Federal Court that Sir Nigel probably made his finest contribution of many to Australian life. Obviously, it was a difficult period. It was a new court, a major development in the Australian legal system, a court which had been mooted for many years- Sir Nigel himself played a role as Attorney General in laying the groundwork for its establishment-and a court which struck some sensitivities amongst state systems, judiciaries and governments. The fact that the court is now so well respected and held in such regard is in no small measure a result of the work that Sir Nigel Bowen performed as chief justice of that court. I believe that the Federal Court is rightly considered to be one of the premier legal bodies of this nation. Its reputation, both in Australia and internationally, is very strong. Again, that flows largely from the work that Sir Nigel performed as chief justice. It is with regret that we mark his passing. However, we remember the outstanding work that he has performed for this country. Our deepest sympathies go to Lady Bowen and the family.",79
168,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES,"May I first thank the Speaker for giving me the opportunity to represent this House at the state funeral for Sir Nigel Bowen on Saturday. I was certainly most distressed to learn of his death. Sir Nigel lived a good many years. He made an enormous contribution in so many fields of endeavour and it is a wrench when somebody like him is taken, even at this time. I join in speaking to the condolence motion to ensure that Lady Ermyn Bowen and Sir Nigel's daughters are aware of the way we feel about him and about his passing. I succeeded Sir Nigel as the member for Parramatta. I did not serve in the parliament with him. He left here in 1973, and in September of that year I was elected to succeed him. He had been a very fine representative in the parliament. I had been President of the Young Liberals and worked with him in that capacity over some years. I was very much aware of his contribution in Parramatta because I had been associated with the area for most of my life. As has been mentioned, between 1964 and 1973, whilst he was in the parliament, he had the privilege to serve as our foreign minister, Attorney-General and Minister for Education and Science. As has been remarked by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), he missed by only one vote as being chosen as Leader of the Opposition in 1972. In relation to that, I guess a number of stories could be told. Sir Nigel's contribution to the Liberal Party was most significant. He brought stability and good sense to decision making. He was seen as having been a most significant contributor to policy development at a time the Liberal Party, having been in office for some 23 years, was seen as being vulnerable. More importantly, he was a popular local member of parliament, as I discovered only too quickly-I was often compared to him. Sir Nigel's secretary was with me for a number of years. She was a very fine lady who always told me that, when Nigel was holding clinic-if one may use that term-in his Parramatta office, he would make sure that he walked the streets for some 15 to 30 minutes just to be seen about. I think all of that showed. He had that great eminence as a national leader, but his assiduous attention to the needs of his constituents, in my view, ensured that he held the seat of Parramatta when most other people thought it would have been lost. If my memory is correct, I think he won at that time by something of the order of 356 votes, which ensured that Michael Whealan did not have a career in this parliament. I was interested in the Attorney-General's remarks because he drew very heavily upon the speech of a former member of this parliament-Bob Ellicott, formerly the member for Wentworth-at the state funeral. Bob's eulogy made a number of important points. Those first points about Nigel having being born in Canada and his family's early difficulties-the log cabin, the cherry orchard, the resumption by the railway, the move to Australia, the history of drought in Gunnedah, which I suspect is in the electorate of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)",80
169,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,No. Actually the electorate of the honourable member for Gwydir.,81
170,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES,"But close by. One of the things that people often thought about Nigel Bowen was that because he went to the King's School in Parramatta he was a person who would not understand what hardship and adversity meant and that because of his association with the King's School in Parramatta he should be held out to be some rather ephemeral character with little regard for the wishes and aspirations of ordinary people. Nigel Bowen was brought up in Ashfield. He was sent to the King's School because of the generosity of a paternal aunt, the same aunt who gave him a short period of education in the United Kingdom. He went to Sydney University on a Commonwealth scholarship and, on what I know from my own father's experience, a university exhibition, which was available to those who were in effect pledging their future in order to obtain an education. He also won an exhibition to St Paul's College, where he also had a very notable career as a general all-rounder, something that I think distinguished Sir Nigel through the whole of his career. I wanted to make those points about Sir Nigel's early life because they link very well with some comments that Bob Ellicott had to make about Sir Nigel the politician. Because they were made by Bob Ellicott-a person whom I greatly admire, a person of great eminence himself-I think they mean so much more. I encourage those who want to know a bit more about Bob Ellicott to read his maiden speech in this parliament because it was another matter that distinguished him from many who come to this place. He had this to say of Nigel Bowen: At the outset it is important to understand the breadth of his political outlook. He was not a conservative. He had passionate concern for the country as a whole. He placed the interests of Australia first and above sectional attitudes and loyalties. He was a liberal thinker. But to him liberalism was a way of life not some cold principle of logic. He had a deep concern for the people and their welfare, for the rights of women and the individual's rights in the face of government. His political life bears testimony to all these things. Nigel Bowen was a man who had achieved great eminence through his own efforts. When somebody like Bob Ellicott says, as he did, of Nigel Bowen that he regarded him as a leading silk at the New South Wales bar, as one of the leaders of the Australian bar and as an acknowledged expert in the fields of constitutional law, commercial law, industrial law, property law, company law, tax law, probate law as the breadth of his advisory practice, and that his opinion and advocacy were widely respected and sought, it means something. He added: He appeared often and in a variety of cases both in trial and appellate courts. As the years passed his reputation as an appellate advocate grew as a study of Commonwealth law reports will quickly reveal. He appeared on a number of occasions in the Privy Council. I was able, while waiting for a case there to compare him with one of England's leading counsel. Nigel did not suffer from the comparison. What distinguishes this man is that, notwithstanding that eminence, he saw fit to contest a seat for this parliament which was not a sinecure; it was always a seat that involved contest, as it does today. He gave up that career to come to this parliament. There are not many today, although there are someand I look at some of my colleagues as I say this-who give up as much to come and serve in the parliament in the nation's interests. He did serve Australia in that way. I found him a very great and personal example, one that I was proud to follow into this parliament. I do share the particular distress of his family at his passing at this time.",81
171,Mr ELLIOTT,CONDOLENCES,"I rise, as the current member for Parramatta, to join this condolence motion to Sir Nigel Bowen. Parramatta is one of the electorates that has existed since Federation. As of today there have been 11 members for Parramatta. They have produced one Prime Minister and six senior cabinet ministers through that time. I think anyone who looks at that record would say that Sir Nigel Bowen's contribution to government and to the parliament compared well with those other distinguished representais tives that went before him. Indeed, if you look at Sir Nigel Bowen's career both in the parliament in terms of portfolio responsibility and his later career and look at his predecessor as member in Sir Garfield Barwick, you will see they held a number of the same portfolios and both made in their own way-in very different characters, I would suggest, from my understanding of the history-substantial contributions parliament and to the law. They both had distinctive views and approaches in the area of foreign policy as well. As the member for Parramatta he was well regarded certainly by the people. I can recall the period around the 1972 election, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has already pointed out, when the seat of Parramatta was well contested. I think it is true say that had there not been a candidate Liberal Party of the stature of Sir Nigel Bowen our prospects of winning the seat perhaps would have been realised. He was well regarded and performed well in a difficult election campaign, given his responsibilipresent ties, and retained the seat. One of the memories I have of that particular period, whilst not agreeing with much of the government of the day's approach to foreign policy, is him speaking on a university campus. I think his understanding of Asia and Australia's place in Asia was certainly ahead of its time; it was very detailed. That was reflected in a comment that the Hon. Bob Ellicott made in the eulogy at the funeral where he indicated that Sir Nigel Bowen as foreign minister had proposed to the then Prime Minister the recognition of the People's Republic of China in early 1972-it is in that sort of time frame anyway-and that was rejected. I certainly recall at least one public meeting where his presentation about Australia's role with Asia was very expansive, demonstrated a real understanding of Australia's future direction and helped to set the scene for positive attitudes to changing foreign policy perspectives in the years that followed. Other members have spoken about his widely varied career. The thing that is notable that he did maintain that sense of history in being a representative of the people in Parramatta who, as many members of the House would know-certainly the member for Berowra would know-regard their history very fondly. He maintained that tradition well. I think he served the parliament extremely well. I join with other members in expressing my sympathy to his family and the recognition of his strong contribution to the public to the life of this nation.",82
172,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I too would like to add a few words to this condolence motion. Unlike other members, I was fortunate to have actually served in the parliament throughout the parliamentary term of Nigel Bowen. I found him to be a great colleague, a redoubtable friend and a tremendous contributor. Of those times I just want to to say a few things, although much has for the already been said. I think it is of interest that the seat of Parramatta, as the present member has identified, has produced so many representatives of considerable distinction. The father of the member for Bruce (Mr Beale), for example, the late Sir Howard Beale, was a member for Parramatta. As I recall, so too was the late William Morris Hughes. Mr Ruddock interjecting",82
173,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,He was not? I thought he was. I am sorry. It was my recollection that he had been. I certainly know that Sir Garfield Barwick was the immediate predecessorMr Ruddock- Sir Frederick Stewart.,82
174,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"It was Sir Frederick an Stewart I was thinking of. Some very redoubtcomplaints able people have represented that seat in the west of Sydney. As the honourable for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) said, Nigel always had a sense of history. Of the seat and its identity in the formation of this country ours, there is little doubt that Nigel was proud. I think it is important that, at a time when we tend to retrace our origins and times rewrite history, we recall that there nothing at all in our past, in the sense of goodwill and good intent of those who have gone by, of which we should not be proud. That does not mean they did not make recognition mistakes, and that does not mean that some of the things that happened over the course the settlement of Australia are not things we should not regret. But I think at the same the pride that Nigel Bowen had in our history is a matter deserving considerable commendacountries tion. As a minister he served, as has been identified, in three portfolios. I really wanted identify a couple of aspects of two of them. The first was Attorney-General. People tend to forget Nigel's role in several aspects. First, it was he who, after very protracted debate, decided that the Federal Court should established. There was significant discussion as to whether or not there should be a federal court. There were those who felt that the Court should have jurisdiction, that the state supreme courts should exercise the Federal Court now enjoys. Nigel was not of that persuasion. It was he who really, more than anybody else, persuaded cabinet to adopt not the idea of a federal court and it was during was his term as Attorney-General that the Federal Snedden. Court was established. Also during that time, as has been cominterest mented on, he was the first to limit appeals the Privy Council from the High Court of Australia. I think, again, that was an initiative which reflects very much a mood that we endorse. But at that time it was a significant initiative because there was some doubt as whether or not it was wise in the context Australia's role in Asia. Nigel Bowen suggested a press council. It was he who sought to bring together, under independent chairman, a body to consider of unethical behaviour by the press. In that role, again, I suggest that he member played a very mindful role. He was not for long foreign minister, but as foreign minister there too, as the honourable of member for Parramatta has suggested, he was very one of those first to suggest Australia's identity with Asia. I well remember the belief at .that he had, and which quite strongly was is held by the MCMahon government in which the Nigel was foreign minister, that it would be wrong to recognise the People's Republic of China if it meant that we had to reduce our of Taiwan. Without doubt, it was essential that we recognise China. That was of not the point. The difficulty we have today still in trying to lay down properly the relatime tionship between Australia and Taiwan, and, of course, Taiwan's relations with other around the world, reflects the concerns that Nigel expressed then. Of Nigel so nearly becoming Leader of the to Opposition and leader of the Liberal Party, little has been said during the course of this condolence motion. But there was a comment that I think is worth remembering, and that was one that I read in the Sun newspaper, I be believe, of Sydney on 31 December 1972: Nigel Bowen QC had a number of offers to resume his legal career before he decided to contest the High Liberal Party leadership last week. the role that Then it continued: Bowen's supporters now believe Nigel lost the leadership through the vote of one member who did want to vote against Bowen but thought the job should go to a younger man. When the fourth b-lot tied, he was forced reluctantly to vote for BIlly Whether or not that was so, I think it is of that Nigel himself felt that he was too to old when he entered politics at the age of 57. There is little doubt that he made a remarkable contribution in spite of those feelings all and, as has been suggested, had he been elected leader of the Liberal Party, I have to little doubt that the history of the Liberal of Party and, I believe, the coalition may well have varied significantly. Nigel Bowen was a great Australian. He certainly made a great contribution to the law outside the parliament as a judge of the court of appeal. Interestingly enough, he was sworn in as a member by the then Chief Justice of New South Wales, Mr Justice Kerr. He was subsequently, of course, chief judge, and he was also chief judge of the Federal Court. One of those very good examples of the contribution Nigel Bowen made to the wider world was the fact that he believed it more appropriate to remain the member for Parramatta than to accept an appointment to the High Court. There is little doubt that, had the High Court received the benefit of his contribution, it too would have perhaps been a different place. I have no doubt that he also certainly had the qualifications to have been chief judge of the High Court of Australia. He was a remarkable constitutional lawyer, a tax lawyer and a company lawyer. He made a great contribution to Australia. To his widow and to his daughters, on behalf of Rosemary and me, I extend our deepest sympathy.",83
175,Mr CONNOLLY,CONDOLENCES,"Last Saturday at the memorial service for Nigel Bowen, his friend and colleague the Hon. Bob Ellicott QC said this of him: At the outset it is important to understand the breadth of his political outlook. He was not a conservative. He had passionate concern for the country as a whole. He placed the interests of Australia first and above sectional attitudes and loyalties. He was a liberal thinker. But to him liberalism was a way of life not some cold principle of logic. He had a deep concern for the people and their welfare, for the rights of women and the individual's rights in the face of government. His political life bears testimony to all these things. is. I think that quotation more than aptly sums up the substance of the man and what he believed in. My colleagues the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and other members have spoken in detail on his earlier life and his overall contribution. There are a number of matters I would just like to refer to briefly. His war service perhaps has not been adequately covered and I shall therefore just mention it. His first service for Australia in a public sense was during the Second World War when he was appointed a captain of a quite unusual unit responsible for the landing of troops in New Guinea. His service there was quite unique for a number of reasons, not least of which was that the unit consisted of not only Captain Nigel Bowen but also Captain Frank Packer and Corporal Ninian Stephen. As was noted in the narration on Saturday, it was indeed quite a company! The 43rd Landing Craft Company was, as I said, a unique unit and one to which he made a significant contribution. He conducted himself as the adjutant with considerable bravery. It was a water transport unit responsible for the landing of Australian forces behind enemy lines on some occasions and certainly to carry the Australian forces forward against the Japanese in that sphere of operations. After the war he returned to the law and shared chambers on the second floor of Denman Chambers with some other interesting characters of Australian political history: Mr E.G. Whitlam and the then Mr Kerr. He subsequently was made a silk in 1953. As has already been noted, he had an immense advisory practice in company law, tax law, probate, constitution law-both commercial and industrial-as well as property law. By 1959 he had become the leading silk at the New South Wales bar and he was a very widely respected person in his profession. This was demonstrated by the fact that he was made President of the New South Wales Bar Association in 1959. In 1960 he was the Vice-President of the Law Council of AustralIn 1964, when Sir Garfield Barwick became Chief Justice, Nigel Bowen saw that as his opportunity to enter into federal parliament. He stood for preselection and was successful. He became, as we have heard, the member for Parramatta. In 1966 he was Attorney-General. Perhaps that was the period of greatest contribution to Australia in his parliamentary and legal roles because, as I said, he was a liberal and he wanted to see the system change in a way which was to the benefit of Australians. In that context, he applied his fundamental political values. He thought, for example, that the High Court should become the court of ultimate appeal for Australians. Subsequent to that, the previous arrangement by which Australians could appeal above the High Court to the Privy Council was disallowed. He established a committee under Sir John Kerr to report on the system of administrative review to protect individuals from Commonwealth bureaucracy and a committee to reform the Judiciary Act to improve the federal system of justice. We have seen the results of that in the legislation that has gone through this chamber over the years. For many years people were talking about the need for a Federal Court, as has already been referred to by the right honourable member for New England. Again, he introduced legislation to that effect, although unfortunately perhaps, in a sense, he was not in the portfolio long enough to see that reach its achievement; nevertheless, he set the foundations which were subsequently carried through. In November 1969 he became Minister for Education and Science and in 1971 he became the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the MCMahon government lost power. This was the period in which I got to know him best because at that stage I was in the diplomatic service. It has been noted by the right honourable member for New England, and certainly by Bob EIIicott last Saturday, that he saw the need to recognise communist China earlier than the government was prepared to at the time. The explanation given by the right honourable member for New England is an interesting postscript to this particular set events. Nevertheless, it demonstrated at the time that he was conscious of the need for change, although change did not eventuate until the Whitlam government followed. In 1972 I was appointed to a delegation by Mr Bowen and by the department to negotiate the seabed boundaries between what was then Indonesian West Timor and the north-west coast of Australia, through to Papua New Guinea and the Bensbach River. Those negotiations were very successful for Australia. In October 1972 he signed the treaty which eventuated and that recognised and accepted Australia's rights to the bulk of the seabed. The only part we missed out on and which at that stage we were unable to negotiate was what was then regarded as the Portuguese Timor section of what was then part of the Timor Gap. That has since been concluded by the Hawke government. It has brought and will no doubt continue to bring considerable wealth to Australia. It overcame what was potentially an embarrassment in Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia for a number of years. After the elections of 1972, he stood for the position of Leader of the Opposition, as has been noted by the right honourable member for New England: he missed by one vote. Historians may well question in the future what that meant to this country and what it meant to the Liberal Party, and what impact it could have had had he been successful. Nevertheless, that is only for the speculators of history. The fact is that he was not successful and he subsequently resigned from parliament and returned to the law. This is where, in a sense, he had his third career. Successively after 1973, he became a judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and Chief Justice in Equity, where again his quality as a judge was immediately recognised by his profession, the community and the government of the day. In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia Bill was passed and he became the Chief Justice. Being, in a sense, the father of the court, that was a very appropriate ending to his legal career at that stage. His chief justiceship of the Federal Court was probably his greatest of contribution to our national life. That is not my judgment, it is the judgment of Bob Ellicott, but I think it is a fair one. I conclude by quoting once again from his friend, who said on Saturday, 'It is given to very few to excel in most aspects of their lives. It was given to him.' On behalf of my electorate in which he lived in his latter years, to those who knew him and his friends and relatives I extend my deepest sympathy.",84
176,Mr WILLIAMS,CONDOLENCES,"It is remarkable, listening to the debate on this motion, to see how wide is the contribution to public life made by Sir Nigel Bowen, and also to see how deep is the quality of that contribution. He has had, as the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has pointed out, more than one career and he has excelled in them to an extent that any person would probably be proud to have in just one. My personal acquaintance with Sir Nigel Bowen is quite limited, but I value it nevertheless. My personal acquaintance probably began when I started reading judgments delivered by him in his judicial capacity. In the course of my years of practising law I have read many and they are well worth reading. I had a closer acquaintance with him when he was appointed the head of the Federal Court of Australia-a position first entitled 'Chief Judge' and later changed to 'Chief Justice'. Looking back from 1994, it is really remarkable that the Federal Court was established only in 1976-at least established under legislation in 1976: I think it commenced operations in 1977. It is a court that almost immediately obtained a reputation as a superior court at the federal level of the highest quality. It has now grown to a court of more than 40 and is still growing. There is no doubt that the reputation of the court was enhanced by the people who have been appointed to it, particularly the original appointees. I think the reputation was gained, to a considerable extent, by the leadership of Sir Nigel. He managed to weld a court into a very effective operating unit making a major contribution to public life in Australia, and the law in particular, in a very short maintained that leadership throughout the 14 or 15 years that he was its head. He maintained also a strong link with the legal profession whence he had originally come. As has been mentioned, he was the President of the New South Wales Bar Association and he was the Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. His contact with the profession was a genuine and open one, not one merely designed to aid in the operations of the court. It is in that connection that I first encountered him. In 1985 I was the Chairman of the Federal Courts Committee of the Law Council of Australia. We made proposals to Sir Nigel for the establishment of a federal courts liaison committee. He readily acceded to that proposal. I can remember even now the discussions that were held in his magnificent office in Federal Court building in Phillip Street, with its more than 180-degree view of Sydney harbour. That liaison committee was established and it survived the establishment of the federal litigation section of the Law Council in 1987. The connection he had with the profession, the esteem in which he was held, has resulted in his being one of only two persons ever to have been made an honorary life member of the Law Council of Australia. I am very proud to be able to say that I was the one who promoted that membership during a term of office that I had in the Law Council in the 1980s. In a profession-here I am talking about the legal profession, including the judiciarywhich is highly critical of its own members, I cannot recall a harsh word or even a critical word ever being said about Sir Nigel, either as a barrister in his earlier years, or as a judge. He was the epitome of courtesy when one appeared before him. I join with those who have spoken in extending sympathy to his family.",85
177,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to briefly associate myself with the tributes that have already been paid to Sir Nigel Bowen. Along with the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr time. He Ruddock), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), I was also present at the very impressive state funeral held at the Church of St James on Saturday and heard the really quite outstanding eulogy delivered by Bob Ellicott, a close friend of Nigel Bowen's and a former Commonwealth Attorn-y-General. Much has been said about his career and I will not retrace it. I served on Nigel Bowen's preselection committee, which I suppose is a practical contact with somebody who entered politics. It was a Saturday afternoon when the result was announced. He won on the second ballot from a field of about 15. It was in the dank basement of 30 Ash Street, which was then the Liberal Party's headquarters, that the result was announced by the then General the Secretary of the Liberal Party, John Carrick, later a very close friend of Nigel's. In fact, Nigel departed the parliament in 1973. I remember two incidents in particular which were a very real earnest of the man. When it was widely rumoured, and undoubtedly the case, in 1972 that he could have filled a vacancy which had arisen in the High Court of Australia, he had decided to hang on in Parramatta in circumstances where the omens were not good. I remember running into him at a Liberal Party gathering and expressing my admiration for his putting party before self. He said, 'John, we have to win this one' - meaning the election. As history shows, we did not win the election despite his very best efforts. He was held in very high regard. What impressed me most about him was his unfailing evenness and courtesy. He was always very courteous to people. He demonstrated that you could be a highly regarded, tough person and reach the pinnacle of your profession without engaging in bad manners. He was a good reminder of that characteristic, which occasionally I suppose we are all guilty of forgetting. There are few people who would doubt that, of five or 10 giants of the Sydney bar in the postwar period, Nigel Bowen would be very high on the list. His breadth of legal capacity was enormous. I, like the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), know of nobody in the profession who spoke ill of him. I would like to thank Nigel for the contribution he made to the Liberal Party. He was a very gifted foreign minister. He brought breadth and knowledge to the party. He had a great intellect and was widely respected. I was very pleased to be at his memorial service and am very happy to associate myself with this motion and to extend my thoughts and sympathy to his family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.

Second Reading",86
178,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that the capacity to protect key witnesses is a vital component in dealing effectively with serious crime, particularly organised crime. There are numerous ways a person may become a witness. These include being at the scene of a crime as an accomplice or innocent witness when it occurred or becoming aware of criminal activity and reporting those concerns to the authorities. However, in the case of serious or organised crime, often it is those persons who have been intimately involved with a criminal activity who are in the best position to provide direct evidence or to corroborate evidence obtained from other sources, such as telephone intercepts. They need protection and this protection also needs to be extended to the families of such witnesses. The Witness Protection Bill arose from the parliamentary joint committee report on witness protection. The bill is intended to be the basis of complementary legislation by the states and territories. For a number of years, the Australian Federal Police has operated a witness protection program. Programs are also operated by most police forces, including the New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian forces and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. In the case of custodial protected witnesses, the primary protection is provided by corrective services agencies in each jurisdiction. By law, these agencies have the care and control of prisoners. In the case of New South Wales, the Department of Corrective Services has established a purpose-built high protection prison within the Long Bay Correctional Complex for those prisoners in that state who require a high degree of protection. The parliamentary joint committee, or PJC, report recommended that the AFP should assume an expanded national protection role. In addition, the report recommended that legislation should underpin the scheme and that there be improved coordination and cooperation between the various law enforcement agencies and their clients. A Commonwealth-state-territory steering committee was established which identified the key issues which needed to be addressed in the model Commonwealth Witness Protection Bill. The steering committee and its subcommittees made an invaluable contribution to the development of the bill. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the cooperation and contribution made by the state and territory ministers and their agencies and officers in developing the bill. As an interim measure, in 1989 the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 was amended to permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to enter into arrangements with the commissioners of the state and territory police forces, the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority and Commonwealth and state-territory prescribed authorities to provide services for the protection of witnesses. This amendment has enabled the AFP to expand its program. The maintenance of the integrity and accountability of the program is of vital concern to the government and the commissioner. The AFP members involved with the assessment and placement of persons on the program are operationally a discrete unit. This means that the witness's police case officer is not involved in the decision making process for placement on the program. The bill provides that key functions, such as removal and placement onto the program, may not be delegated below the position of Deputy Commissioner of the AFP. Protected witnesses may be removed from the program for a number of reasons provided by the act. For example, they may ask to be taken off the program. Another reason may be that with the passage of time and successful relocation and integration into a new community, they are no longer in a high risk category. There are other provisions such as breaching the memorandum of understanding, taking unnecessary risks with their own lives or committing offences while on the program. Any removal is subject to review. The witness protection program currently operated by the AFP is for that small number of key witnesses and their families requiring a high degree of protection because of serious threats to their lives. Its operation is based on relocation, change of identity and integration back into the community in a new identity. This enables the witness to give evidence without fear of retribution. It is proposed that the bill give legislative support to the AFP in the operation of its program. The processes and procedures set out in the bill have been honed and tested by the AFP in the operation of its current program. The bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to enable the arrangement provisions to be relocated in the bill. The bill provides for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to operate a national witness protection program, NWPP. The commissioner will be able to enter into arrangements with state-territory commissioners of police and chairpersons of bodies such as the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to enable protection to be provided to witnesses of these authorities. These arrangements will include the recovery of operational costs. Placement on the NWPP is voluntary and is not to be given as a reward. Procedures are set out for the placement and removal of witnesses from the NWPp, safeguards surrounding the procedures for the issue of new federal documents, procedures to ensure that persons on the NWPP do not use the new identity to avoid civil or criminal liability and to enable foreign witnesses to be placed on the program. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented its report on the bill in June 1994. The committee expressed concern that the course of justice might be affected by the inability of an interested party to cross-examprogram ine a witness, with a new identity, about his/her prior convictions, for the purposes of testing hislher credibility. The problem referred to by the committee does not arise in the original proceedings which the person has been granted protection. In this situation the person gives evidence his/her original identity. The problem could gram. arise in a case where a person, with prior convictions, had been given a new identity and is a witness to a new crime. In such case, the person would be called to give evidence in his/her new identity. The committee's concerns were noted and clause 27 was included in the bill as a govbe ernment amendment. The clause requires witness who is called to give evidence in criminal trial in these circumstances to notify the commissioner. The commissioner is then required to take appropriate action, including advising the court, the prosecutor and accused person and hislher legal representarelating tive of the person's criminal record. It been necessary to give the commissioner discretion in such cases, as there wide range of cases where the witness could be called to give evidence. Accordingly, I propose to give the commisFederal sioner a direction that where the witness called to give evidence for the prosecution a serious offence-that is, one in which there is a real possibility of a gaol term or a stantial pecuniary penalty-the criminal record must be disclosed to the proper authis orities. The direction would not be intended to cover other cases, such as where the person is to give evidence for the accused. The government was not prepared to extend this clause to all cases where a relocated person is called to give evidence. Once the criminal record is disclosed, the witness would almost invariably need to be given a new identity and relocated. This would cause considerable dislocation to that person his/her family. This clause strikes a balance between the rights of an accused person and the rights and safety of persons who are, who have been, on the program. The placement of a foreign witness on the is a further example of the government's international cooperation in the fight against serious or organised crime. Such a person may be able to give vital evidence in an Australian criminal trial or need to live outside hislher country of origin pending and for following the trial coming on for hearing. Special conditions apply to the selection and in placement of foreign witnesses on the proParamount consideration needs to be given a to the protection of information held by the AFP on those persons on the program if the witnesses are to be truly safeguarded. The wider the information net extends, the greater the risk that the integrity of the scheme will jeopardised. It is for these reasons that the a usual administrative law review procedures a have been changed. Decisions made under the bill will be exempt from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This approach recognises the absolute security the requirements of the program. Questions to freedom of information and arhas chives legislation are proposed to be ada dressed by separate amendments to the relcould be a evant legislation. The AFP officers administering the program are subject to the Complaints (Australian Police) Act 1981. This means that is complaints against them may be the subject in of investigation by the ombudsman. To facilitate investigation of such complaints the subombudsman will have a right of access to the relevant program documents. Where a person involuntarily removed from the program or where a new identity is removed, these decisions will be made by a deputy commissioner to enable the person to appeal to the commissioner against an adverse decision. The bill does not have any financial impact. The more important features of the bill are: . it enables the commissioner of the AFP to operate a national witness protection program, NWPP, to provide protection and assistance and to witnesses and their families; . it enables the commissioner to enter into arrangements with approved authorities-that or is, state police commissioners-to provide protection and assistance, and for this purpose the existing provlSlons in the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 are being relocated in the bill; · it provides the AFP with the statutory procedures to govern the placement, and removal, of witnesses from the NWPP, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding, creating of new identities and thtf restoring of former identities; · it will enable foreign witnesses to be placed on the NWPP. In such a case, the person will not only have to be approved for inclusion on the NWPP by the commissioner, but also have an entry visa. The foreign law enforcement authority will enter into arrangement for the cost of such matters as travel and protection. Where all these requirements have been satisfied, final approval for acceptance in the program is reserved for the Minister for Justice; · it establishes a register of persons who are or who have been on the program, which must include certain information, including the old and new identity as well as the criminal record of the person, if any; · it provides safeguards regarding the processes for issuing new identity documents and mechanisms to ensure that persons on the NWPP do not use the new identity to avoid civil or criminal liability. A special measure has been included to ensure that the financial support statements under the MOV may be the subject of cross-examination; · it provides for special procedures where a person with a new identity is required to give evidence in criminal proceedings in his/her new identity; · it is proposed that the bill form the basis complementary legislation. To safeguard the integrity of federal documents, 12 months after the bill commences, federal agencies will not be able to issue documents for persons on state or territory witness protection programs unless there is complementary legislation in place and there are arrangements in place with the state/territory governments in question; · the ombudsman's power to investigate complaints under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 are retained. For this purpose it is proposed that the ombudsman has a right of access to documents and records held by the AFP in relation to the NWPP. · it creates offences relating to divulging information without lawful authority about the NWPP and persons who have been assessed for the program or who are or have been on the program; · it provides for the commissioner and the ombudsman not to be required to disclose information or produce documents in proceedings in the performance of functions under the bill, unless it is essential to the determination of the proceedings; · where in any proceedings the issue of the identity of the person on the NWPP arises, unless the court considers it is in the interests of justice otherwise, the proceedings must be held in camera and suppression orders issued. · the schedule to the bill includes an amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to provide that decisions made under the legislation will be exempt from the act. I note the extensive debate that occurred in the Senate. I understand that this bill will be supported by the opposition. I commend these measures to the House.",87
179,Mr WILLIAMS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Tangney) (6.38 p.m.)The genesis of the Witness Protection Bill was the 1988 report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which examined witness protection arrangements in Australia. Prior to the inquiry, the NCA, exercising powers under the National Crime Authority Act 1984, could make arrangements for protection of witnesses of appearing at hearings before the authority. The NCA, however, expressed the view that it did not have sufficient resources to set up its own witness protection scheme and that there were significant deficiencies in the facilities available for the protection of witnesses in Australia. As a response to this, the joint committee, in April 1987, began to pursue an inquiry into witness protection in Australia. The report examined four main areas in relation to witness protection. The first was the nature of witness protection and its role in the fight against organised crime. The second was the extent to which witness protection is an essential requirement of successful organised criminal investigation and prosecutions. The third was the extent to which organised crime witnesses were then presently protected and the nature, adequacy and cost of the arrangements. Finally, there was examination of the options available to the government to improve witness protection. The bill is drawn from the recommendations made by the joint committee in its report. It is an important piece of legislation. The core of the recommendations of the joint committee was that the Australian Federal Police should take on an expanded and a coordinating role in national witness protection programs. It was recommended that the AFP would provide services to state police forces on a user-pays basis. To facilitate coordination between police forces, it was further recommended that a witness protection liaison committee be established. The joint committee made a number of other specific recommendations. However, only the core recommendations were given statutory force. In 1989 the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 was amended to allow the AFP to enter into arrangements with state and territory police forces and the NCA. In this bill, the government seeks to provide significantly greater legislative detail on witness protection. In doing so, the bill incorporates a number of the more specific recommendations of the joint committee. In essence, the bill establishes a national witness protection program, NWPP, to be operated by the AFP. The NWPP is designed to enable witnesses to give evidence without fear of retribution and to provide for protection of persons who, because of their association with the witness, need protection. In practice, this is likely to most frequently apply to the witness's family members. The bill provides significant matters of detail concerning the operation of the NWPP, including procedures for witness placement, placement of foreign witnesses, contractual type arrangements between witnesses and the AFP, the obligations of disclosure by witnesses and the disclosure of witness information to other bodies. It also provides for offences. It is intended, as the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) pointed out, that the arrangements in the bill will be complemented by state and territory legislation. Again, the bill has not incorporated all the recommendations made by the joint committee in its report. The bill as originally introduced into the Senate was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee received submissions and conducted hearings on the bill. The Senate committee's principal concerns about the bill in its then form were for the protection of the interests of third parties. As a result of the committee's recommendations, the government has introduced amendments to the bill which were stated in the supplementary explanatory memorandum tabled with the amendments to have three main purposes. The first purpose is to provide further protection of the rights of third parties. To this end the commissioner of the AFP is to be authorised to notify a party or possible party to legal proceedings involving the witness that the commissioner would accept service of legal process on behalf of the witness. This is now subclause 15(2) of the bill. This will assist creditors and those who have child maintenance and other entitlements under Family Court orders against the protected witness. It is important that the witness not be enabled by his or her participation in the program to avoid his or her existing financial and other obligations. The second purpose is to avoid the NWPP protection facility being an inducement to a potential witness to give desirable evidence in exchange for protection. In this connection, the AFP is to be authorised to disclose to a court or a tribunal details of the financial support arrangements provided to the witness. But the nature of the disclosure is to be such that the court will not be able to identify the location, or to prejudice the safety, of the witness. This is now in subclause 26(5) of the bill. These arrangements, particularly the financial arrangements, could be an issue before the court or tribunal in which the witness is to give evidence. It is a principle of the bill, expressed in clause 5, that a witness will not be included in the program as a reward or as a means of persuading or encouraging the witness to give evidence or to make a statement. The Senate committee was concerned to ensure that the criminal record of the protected witness is preserved. Giving a person a I)ew identity under the NWPP effectively wipes out his or her past. Under the bill, any past criminal record does not attach to the new identity. The Senate committee considered that, in its previous form, the bill was not clear about the extent to which defence counsel would be able to investigate the background of a protected witness who will probably in all cases be giving vital evidence and whose credibility will probably in all cases be at issue. It is important that an interested party be able to cross-examine such a witness about prior convictions for the purpose of testing his or her credibility. Consequently, the third purpose of the government's amendments is to compel a protected witness who is later required to give evidence in criminal proceedings in his or her new identity to advise the commissioner of the AFP. The commissioner may then give a copy of the person's convictions to the court, the prosecutor and the accused or his or her legal representative. This may require the witness to be provided with a further new identity. In these circumstances, clause 27 does not compel the commissioner to disclose a witness's criminal record to the relevant parties. The effect of subclause 27(2) is that, after being notified by the witness of the requirement to give evidence, 'the commissioner may take any action he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances, including disclosing to the court, the prosecutor and the accused person or the accused person's legal representative the criminal record of the participant or former participant'. This means that the commissioner retains the discretion to inform or not inform the court before which the witness is to give evidence that that person has a criminal record in his or her former identity. It is a golden thread of our system of justice that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Consistent with that presumption, the accused person's defence counsel must be able to challenge the credibility of any prosecution witness and thus test the reliability of the evidence of the witness in order for justice to run its proper course. For this purpose, it is important that an accused person have access to the criminal record of a witness on whose evidence he may be convicted. In civil proceedings, a person's liberty may not be at risk. However, the proceedings may put at risk a person's entire worldly wealth, and often large sums of money are involved. Again, it is unjust that a person may be liable to lose significant property or incur a significant liability on the strength of incompletely tested evidence from a witness who is possibly unreliable. For this reason, it is also desirable that a formerly protected witness who has a new identity be compelled to disclose his or her criminal record through the commissioner of the AFP to the civil court in which that witness is to testify. In the explanatory memorandum, the minister states: It is intended that where the person is called to give evidence for the prosecution, in a serious offencethat is, one in which there is a real possibility of a gaol term or substantial pecuniary penalty-the criminal record be disclosed to the proper authorities. The explanatory memorandum goes on to state: It is not intended that the criminal record be disclosed in other cases, such as where the person is called to give evidence for the accused. It is not the purpose of an explanatory memorandum to give such guidance in the exercise of a statutory discretion nor is it appropriate to have recourse to the explanatory memorandum in order to properly understand clause 27 of the bill. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, in certain circumstances consideration may be given by a court to extrinsic materialincluding an explanatory memorandum-if such material is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision in an act. The Acts Interpretation Act makes it clear that such material is to be considered only in one of two sets of circumstances. The first is where it is necessary to confirm that the Protection Bill? meaning of the provisions is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the proviPolice Act. sion in its context. That is not the present case. The second set of circumstances is where the provision is ambiguous or obscure or its ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd or unreasonable and the consideration of the extrinsic material is necessary to determine the true meaning of the provision. That also is not the present case. On my reading, subclause 27(2) clearly gives the commissioner a discretion in all cases. In contrast, the explanatory memorancircumstances. dum appears to mandate action by the comanother missioner in certain cases. In my view, it is doubtful that resort can be had under the Acts Interpretation Act to the explanatory memoa randum in order for a court to be able to narrow or qualify the commissioner's discreit. tion given by that clause. I listened to the minister refer to this in his second reading speech, which he has just delivered. In the course of ed that he would give a direction as to disclosure in trials for serious offences involving the threat of imprisonment or serious financial penalties. Not having had the opportunity examine that proposal, I am not aware upon what it is based. But I question the effect a direction by the minister to the commissioncountability er in the light of the very clear clause 27(2). That provision clearly states: . . . the Commissioner may take any action she considers appropriate in the circumstances, including disclosing to the courtand to certain identified personsa witness's criminal record. I would be surprised if a court would interpret a provision to that effect as enabling minister to give a direction to the commisunder sioner as to how his discretion should be exercised in the absence of some specific power in the legislation to which it relates.",90
180,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,There is a power under the act to give directions.,93

184,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,Under the Australian Federal,93
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Order! The minister might like to come back to this later in his response.,93
186,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Sorry, I shouldn't interrupt.",93
187,Mr WILLIAMS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am actually grateful for the interjection because it confirms the very point that I was seeking to make. In this bill, we have a discretion specifically conferred on an officer in very prescribed, precise The minister is referring to piece of legislation. The two have to be married together. In the ordinary course of events, this being the later and specific bill, general power will not override it. I do not know the answer to it. I have not researched I only heard about it when the minister delivered his second reading speech. But I issue would urge the minister to examine it very closely to make sure that what he seeks to do it, he suggestcan, in fact, be done. This issue was raised and debated in the Senate during the consideration of the bill in detail, irrespective of the specific point that I to just sought to make, and the solution is somewhat inadequate. The solution is now in of clause 30 of the bill. It is basically an acprovision. It does not purport to language of be a preventative measure. Clause 30 requires the commissioner to he or keep the minister informed of the general operations, performance and effectiveness of the NWPP and, in particular, the exercise of the commissioner's powers under clause 27 of the bill. It also requires the minister to report annually to parliament on the witness protecthe tion program and the exercise of powers it. Clause 27 provides a form of continuing review of the exercise by the commissioner of his or her discretion. This is to be welcomed. Parliamentary scrutiny, in however crude a form, is essential. But it does not remove, limit, or prescribe guidelines for, the exercise of that discretion. It will not prevent the situation arising in which an accused can be convicted on the evidence of a witness who has an undisclosed criminal record. If it is later revealed in the minister's annual report to the parliament that an accused person was convicted in a case in which the criminal record of the formerly protected person was not disclosed, that accused person wouldarguably-have grounds for appeal against the conviction. Obviously this situation must be avoided. Nor will the provisions of clause 30 go any way towards preventing or monitoring the occasions in which a defendant or a plaintiff in civil proceedings is unsuccessful at trial because of the incompletely tested credibility of a witness with an undisclosed criminal record. I suggest that this is an unsatisfactory situation. Clauses 27 and 30, when read together, are inadequate in this vital area. I urge the government to examine how, by appropriate amendment, the interests of all parties involved might be protected. The bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts. It exempts decisions relating to the program from review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It was a recommendation of the parliamentary joint committee that appropriate mechanisms be established to handle complaints from persons who believe that they have been unjustly denied protection, or who are aggrieved by decisions made by agencies in the administration of the program. The exclusion of the decisions from review under the ordinary judicial review process is understandable. But the need for appropriate mechanisms of review for the situations referred to by the joint committee remains. This, plainly, needs more attention. In the explanatory memorandum, the government states that the bill will have no financial impact. However, in clause 9(2)(f), the bill provides that among the matters which the memorandum of understandingthe contract between the commissioner and the witness containing the terms under which the witness is to be granted protection under the program-may contain is a financial support arrangement. This suggests that the bill will have some financial impact. Indeed, it would appear that the cost of relocating, protecting and providing a new identity for a witness and his or her family is potentially extremely expensive process. The minister is invited to address this in his response. The bill requires that a prospective participant in the program make full disclosure of the matter set out in clause 7, before the person is accepted. The coalition is concerned that this requirement applies without any protection being given against self-incrimination. The matters to be disclosed include details of the following: the witness's criminal history; court orders relating to sentences imposed on the witness to which the witness is subject in relation to criminal prosecutions; financial liabilities and assets; any cash held by the witness, whether in accounts or otherwise; any business dealings in which the witness is involved; and all outstanding debts. If the applicant is not admitted to the program, he or she is entitled to these private details not being generally available either publicly or to the police. In fact, the scheme is likely to fail completely if information provided under clause 7 by a prospective protected witness is then used to prosecute the applicant or to enable another agency to do so. I said at the outset that this is an important piece of legislation. It deals with significant matters of law enforcement and the interests of private citizens. At law, one's legal identity defines one's relationship with the family, with one's livelihood and career, with the country of which one is a part, with those with whom one does business or by whom one is employed or whom one represents. Psychologically, legal identity defines our relationship in all these facets and with all these persons. Identity is really the core of our existence. The ability of a state to sanction and support the alteration of legal identity is a very significant act. It is significant not only for the person whose identity is altered but also for those with whom he or she has a relationship, whether emotional, legal or otherwise. This bill deals not only with emotions and psychology but with legalities. It seeks to provide a legal basis by which alteration of identity may occur. It must also ensure that it properly protects the rights and interests of those with whom the person an whose identity has been changed had or may yet have a legal relationship in his or her original identity. I conclude by noting a comment referred to in a letter from Senator Spindler to the minister that is annexed to the report of the Senate committee. The observation by an American commentator is that witness protection in the United States is the 'most unusual service ever offered by any government during peacetime'. Perhaps the same might be said in respect of Australia.",93
188,Mr CLEELAND,ASSENT TO BILLS,"-I suggest to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) that there is one thing he did not mention about the importance of the Witness Protection Bill: it also involves questions of life and death. This bill has its genesis in the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. It had its genesis when I received a phone call in my office from a woman who is commonly known around Australia these days as Miss X. Miss X was related to a well-known Melbourne criminal in Richmond. Through that association, a de facto relationship, she became involved in heroin, drug running, murder and other vile and notorious criminal acts. Members of the family involved were murdered. Victorian police became involved and Miss X became part of an embryonic witness protection program that the Victorian police force established. In order to protect Miss X from death-because that was the end result of her becoming an informant, no ifs or buts about that-the Victorian police took this lady to Mt Gambier in South Australia to hide her in a location where they believed she would be safe. I think the expression they use is a 'safe house'. Of course, the Victorian police have no jurisdiction in South Australia, in Mt Gambier. Miss X had been in the place only for a month when one day she was raided by the South Australian police force. Someone had recognised her and had told the South Australian police force that this notorious criminal was in Mt Gambier. Being good police, the South Australian police force raided her. In absolute fear and panic, realising that had no safety in South Australia and that her protection had been blown, she fled to Tasmania. On the way she purchased a revolver and ammunition, which she was carrying. She contacted my office from Tasmania and told me the story. That is where my interest in this area of witness protection commenced-all through a person known as Miss X. Since that time, she has been involved in matters which have involved Rogerson and Flannery, among other notorious murderers and criminals in this country. She is now under a witness protection program. I have not spoken to her for some time. She had the habit of ringing me on the telephone every now and again to have a chat with me. Although I have met her only once in person, in the flesh, over the years we did have a rather strange relationship, she as an informant telling me about areas of organised criminality. I recall one day we were speaking on the phone and she told me where five bodies were buried in Melbourne, information which, quite frankly, as a politician I did not particularly want to know. That was passed on to appropriate sources. So this bill is about life and death. Because people in the position of Miss X who come out, as it were, from an organised criminal group and dob their mates in, who become a squirrel or a turkey, who whistle, who give evidence against their friends, in the criminal world are dead-no ifs, no buts about it. So when as chairman of the joint parliamentary committee I had those discussions with Miss X, I was pleased that the committee agreed to accept that we should have an inquiry into witness protection in Australia. The committee, I might add, never met Miss X. In the course of that inquiry we travelled throughout Australia. We met with protected witnesses, those protected by the then Australian Federal Police force witness protection program. I recall being in Sydney, where we had arranged to take evidence from some of these people. The federal police force picked us up at the airport and put us in individual unmarked cars, each of us in a different car. We were driven around different circular routes in Sydney to make sure we were not she being followed. Eventually we found ourselves in a motel and met with two quite famous protected witnesses in Australia. Their evidence was quite unequivocal. If their whereabouts were ever discovered, they were dead-not only them but their families. That is the way we were told the system operated. Once you squealed, your family were targeted. In some ways for the committee it was quite a harrowing journey through the underworld and through criminality, to see the real underworld that exists and the real threats that people face. It is also unarguably true that the Miss Xs and other people of that ilk who come from the criminal world and who are prepared, through threat of prosecution, through fear engendered by their activities, or for whatever reason, to give evidence, are the keystones of the attack on organised crime. It is unarguable for those who have looked at criminality in Australia and who have any understanding of it at all that the informant is the most prized possession any police investigation unit can have. I go back to my own days in the Victorian police force, when the CIB of the day had a cash fund available to it. Its primary job as uniformed or non-uniformed officers was to encourage what were commonly known in the trade as fizzers. A fizzer was a criminal who would for money or for other reasons be prepared to discuss with a member of the police force activities of other criminals. I say without equivocation that the vast bulk of major crime is solved only by the use of these informants. But once the informers are known, say goodbye to them. It is that simple. So the inquiry was, for many members and certainly for me, a journey through the underworld. There are many people whom I think this House should thank, seeing we now have both the report and the legislation. One of those people the House should acknowledge in this respect is a former superintendent of the Victorian police force, a chap called John Barclay. John and I went to school together. We are both famous graduates of the Preston technical school. There are not that many famous graduates of the Preston technical school because it no longer exists. It is now called the college. John and I grew up together and joined the police force at different periods, where I met John again. John was the recipient of a Churchill scholarship. John was fortunate under that scholarship to have travelled to the United States and to have spent a number of months studying the US protection program run by the US marshals. John came back to Victoria with a very full and detailed report on the way that the marshals program operates in the United States. I believe that, in the course of that inquiry, John was quite generous in giving the committee a full copy of that report, including the recommendation he had made to the Victorian government, which was that the Victorian government should institute such a program. In fact, it did in some ways have such a program going. But the trouble with the states having programs is that crime is not state located. Indeed, crime is not national. Crime is international. Only this afternoon, I was reading an article from Hong Kong which detailed a couple of investigations involving Chinese importers and exporters of heroin. The article gave quite a detailed explanation of how two particular Chinese groups had operated out of Hong Kong, involving both Triad and nonTriad Chinese activities. That particular activity involved Australia, the United States, the Philippines and Thailand, and it involved can transferring through money laundering activities close to $US 100 million from various points around the world to various supposedly safe places where those funds could be used to the benefit of the people involved in the heroin trade. So, when we talk about crime today, we are not talking about state crime or about Australian crime. When we talk about major crime, organised crime is the usual term we use. That is a bit of a misnomer but we use that term because television and the media love it. If we talk about organised crime, we are talking about international crime on a huge scale, an enormous scale of billions of dollars a year. When a person from inside one of those groups has information that enables you to detect, charge and gaol someone, I believe it is incumbent on you to ensure that that informant lives, because if the system does not work you will not get more informants. Hence, the witness protection program is designed to create a new identity. The recommendation of the committee is that there be a national program. This is what this legislation would do. Indeed, some of the states some years back started passing complementary state legislation as part of the overall picture of the national program. I recall my colleague the Hon. Jim Kennan, when he was the Attorney-General for Victoria, putting up the original Victorian legislation, which was in advance of the Witness Protection Bill. In fact, having spent three years out of this place, I find it somewhat surprising to come back and be debating legislation which was recommended in my first period here. It may say something about the pace of change in important areas, but so be it. I am pleased to see it finally going through. The states are heavily involved. I know that in Victoria the now Minister for Police and Emergency Services, the Hon. Pat MCNamara, recently removed the sunset clause from the legislation that Jim Kennan introduced. I do not know what the other states are up to, but I hope that the other states are now passing complementary legislation so that we will have a national overview and indeed the ability to take a person needing the protection of the program from one state to another state. It is far too dangerous to leave a person at risk in, for example, Sydney if that is where he comes from. It is imperative that that person be relocated with a new identity far away from his original home and his original activities. You can well imagine what that involves. In this House, it sounds very simple to just pass legislation, create systems, pay money to these people and even arrange for foreign places where they might be safer. But can you imagine the effect of that on an individual, spouse and children; the difficulties that it creates? How do you explain to children that, as from tomorrow, they will be known as Jones instead of Smith? How do you ensure that children, when they go to a different school, will not say that their name is Smith, not Jones, and that their daddy comes from wherever? How do you ensure that in the program there is no leakability-no possibility of people leaking information as to true identity? What of the spouses-the innocent parties, if you like, of the whole system? They have to uproot themselves from extended family to be relocated in a new address with a new name, and are not necessarily able to use a telephone or mail for contact because that, would you believe, is also too risky. Sadly, it is not possible to say that people do not get access to telephone sources and, sadly, it is not possible to say that people do not get access to postal sources. Money speaks a very big language, and sometimes it speaks too big a language and is too big a temptation for some people. Can you imagine what it involves to go through this total change of identity? People have to change marriage certificates, educational qualifications and tertiary qualifications; they have to recreate the paper history that we all have somewhere in our cupboards, filing cabinets, banks or wherever we keep our papers; they have to recreate uncles and cousins so that there is continuity to the story; and they have to recreate their trade qualifications and work history. How do you go and get a job if you cannot prove your qualifications or if you have no references from where you previously worked? It is an enormously difficult concept to come to grips with. It is very difficult to legislate for but it is going to be more difficult to put it into place and make sure it works. It is, as I think honourable members today have said, an enormously important piece of legislation. It follows from what this government has done since 1983 with the seizure of assets legislation. There has never been in this country's history such a major legislative attack on organised crime-never. In a relatively short space of time, this government has changed forever the face of the attack on organised crime. For example, the case in the article I was reading today, which I just referred the House to, involved an Australian connection. In that particular case, assets worth $24.6 million were seized in Australia alone. So all of the legislation we have passed is important in the total approach and attack on organised crime. It is not my intention to go through the detail of the bill. Members such as the honourable member for Tangney can go through it clause by clause but, to me, the important thing is that the legislation is finally before the House. Members of the committee travelled to some strange places in Australia to take evidence and were part of preparing the report. We visited many gaols. In fact, many J;l1embers probably do not know that, even within gaols in Australia, it is necessary to have different sections where certain people are protected from other prisoners because they are known as informants. Those people who inform and are convicted themselves end up in a prison within a prison. It is pretty frightening when you go into a gaol and realise that these people have to be segregated within a gaol. The moment they go outside of the internal walls of their own protection unit, they are dead-inside a gaol. So it is a very serious matter. I want to again thank all members of the committee. I am awfully pleased that the recommendations have been accepted. I am concerned that some of the states still do not seem to be moving in the direction I would wish. It is surely time that crime is seen for what it is-national and international. It is surely time for some of the smaller states to recognise that it is time to tear down the state barriers. We desperately need a national criminal code. So why, in 1994, are we still talking about states rights when the threats we now face from around the world are far more important than the little power people want to take in the states to have their own judicial systems or their own criminal systems? We really do need, like this bill provides, a national overview. If I can do anything in this House in the remaining years I will spend here, it will be to continue to push for nationa long time. al approaches to control and attack organised crime. In conclusion, if Miss X is out there listennon ing to this debate today, she should know that she has been responsible in a way for this legislation because she drew the attention of one backbencher to a major problem. As a result, the joint committee had the inquiry and produced the report and now the bill is before this House. If Miss X is listening, I would like her to know that she has achieved something. I thank the House.",95

190,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to express solidarity with the people of Lebanon and, in particular, with 300,000 of my fellow Australians of Lebanese extraction whose homeland is still suffering under a long reign of terror. I am aware that Lebanon is not the only country suffering at this time from war, rapine, pillage and foreign sponsored genocide. Other examples, obviously, are Bosnia and Rwanda, but evil does not cease being evil just because it has existed for Let us recall that between independence in 1942 and the Syrian invasion in 1975 Lebawas the nearest thing to a liberal society in the Arab world. Its women were free, its minorities were respected and its living standards were relatively high. It was often described as the Switzerland of the Middle East. When tens of thousands of Palestinians fled their then homes in 1948, Lebanon provided these people with a sanctuary and in many instances a much more welcoming sanctuary than the other Muslim countries neighbouring on Israel. It was not a perfect democracy. It was more like a federation of communities of which the most significant were, of course, the Christian Maronites, the Sunni Muslims, the Shi'ah Muslims and the Druze living together with a power sharing arrangement. Lebanon was not perfect. At times there was some discrimination. Obviously some communities by and large lived better than other communities, but it was a civil society-a society where people could expect to leave their homes and be protected, where people could go to the police and be protected and where people could go to the courts and be respected. It was a society where the rights of Muslims were respected by the Christians and the rights of Christians were respected by the Muslims. And it was a bridge between East and West, a beacon of those values of liberty, tolerance and prosperity-values which are not simply Western values, although the West has possibly given better expression to them than other parts, values indeed which are universal aspirations. This was destroyed in 1975. It that those who intervened in 1975 posing as the saviours of the persecuted Muslim majority in fact came from a country which had no or very little respect for its own minority people. The Syrian government under President Assad was guilty of the most appalling atrocities against its own citizens, most significantly the massacre of 20,000 people in the town of Hama. Of course, in Lebanon it eventually became oppressive of all the people. The friends of Syria murdered not just Christian people but also the Grand Mufti of Lebanon. President Mouawad was murdered because he was insufficiently sympathetic to the Syrian objectives. I speak not as someone who is proChristian, pro-Muslim, pro-Druze, pro-Israel or anti-Syrian. I just believe that the Syrian army should return to its own country. I speak as someone who is pro-freedom, pro-liberal democracy and pro-Lebanon. I ask that there be an immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, that there be free elections under UN supervision as soon as is reasonably possible and that the Australian embassy return to Beirut as soon as is reasonably practical. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the recent Parramatta by-election campaign in New South Wales indicated that the return of the embassy would be made in July of next year. Why not now? Why can we not have an embassy in Beirut now as a sign of our nation's solidarity with the Lebanese people? If the US, British and French embassies could remain open through all the troubles of those countries, even though they were bombed and their nationals were being kidnapped, why could our embassy not be there then? Certainly our embassy should be there again now. Shipping",98
191,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (7.27 p.m.)Thursday, 29 September was World Maritime Day and, as parliament was not sitting at that time, this is an appropriate time to consider the role of shipping and pay tribute to the seafarers of the world. It is also particularly appropriate when there has been much debate over recent weeks about the role of Australian is interesting shipping and its future. This year, World Maritime Day was especially significant as it was the day after the ferry Estonia was lost in the Baltic Sea with the tragic loss of more than 900 lives. There are particular difficulties with ferries in the Baltic which have been raised with me on recent trips to that part of the world. I am sure everyone has been horrified by the tragic loss of life from this maritime disaster. I was particularly interested in what the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said in answer to the question from the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) about the Tasmanian ferry today. I learned of this disaster while attending a two-day seminar in Sydney entitled 'Ship Shape for the 21st Century'. This was an excellent seminar dealing with aspects of international shipping post Ships of shame. I give my congratulations to BHP Transport in association with Lloyds of London Press, which organised this important conference. Australia as an island continent is more dependent on shipping than most other countries. It is because of this dependence that I have over recent months strenuously opposed the suggestion to sell off the Australian National Line. As I have said in this House many times, the world's fleet is ageing and there is an increasing lack of trained personnel both at the officer and rating level. Australia must not put its shipping line at the mercy of foreign owners. There was a suggestion recently that Australia open a second register for shipping. I am pleased that this scheme now seems to have been sunk, and most appropriately so. It is interesting that the opposition calls for the Australian coast to be opened to foreign shipping with Australian ships having Australian officers but crews from Burma, the Philippines, Pakistan or various other places. The same claims are not made of our airlines. If it is good enough to open the Australian coast to foreign shipping, why not open the Australian airways as well? We could have the good old Aussie officer sitting up there in the nose of the plane and those running up and down rattling the drinks trolley, especially in front of the conservative members of this chamber, could be from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or, indeed, to add a really exotic touch, Myanmar. What is the difference if we are going to have people from these countries crewing our ships along the Australian coastline? Why do we not have them crewing our airlines as well? As we moved decisively to end slavery in Australia 90 years ago by stopping the recruitment of Kanak labour, why are some now suggesting that we introduce slavery into Australia? Dress it up as they might, this is what a second register for foreign seafarers on the Australian coastline would mean. Those of us who served on the Ships of shame inquiry know the conditions that seafarers are put into-low pay, being half starved and physically and sexually abused. Is this the sort of thing that we want on our coastal runs? If members of this House believe that this does not happen, I invite them to talk to any officials from the Missions of Seamen around the Australian coastline. The 'Ship Shape' conference brought together leading experts from 19 countries. I was particularly impressed with the conference's determination to rid the seas of unsafe shipping. Those involved know that unsafe shipping not only brings all shipping into disrepute but also costs everyone money. These were leading experts from throughout the world, and the message that they kept putting was that, more than anything else, for world shipping-not only Australian shipping-we have to rid the world's oceans of these ships of shame. I believe that we must commit ourselves to maintaining cabotage around our Australian coast. We should also pay tribute to those seafarers who go d-wn to the sea in ships. Long may they contmue to do so in Australian flagged and crewed ships. Hearing Loss Forum",99
192,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"I have been asked by a group of concerned citizens within my electorate to report to the parliament on a hearing loss forum that was conducted and coordinated in Port Macquarie recently. I will open with the letter from Mrs Flo Flavell which asks me to do this. The letter states: Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a report advising results of Hearing Loss Forum held 12.9.94 at Port Macquarie. I am also enclosing on a separate sheet comments made by people who attended the forum. The forum was a great educational success, and from the comments made at the forum, and the phone calls of appreciation received since, the forum covered a lot of territory that has been unchartered for the hearing impaired until now. I would humbly request you to table this report in Federal Parliament to bring the report to the attention of the members. A resolution was passed at the Forum that the Federal Member for Lyne, Mr Mark Vaile, MP be asked to recommend to the Federal Government that all Federal Government Employees receive a Program of Training on Customer Service for the Hearing Impaired. As I have said, this hearing loss forum was conducted in Port Macquarie. As honourable members would no doubt be aware, a large population of retired and elderly people live in that part of New South Wales. Mrs Flavell mentioned that the idea of holding the forum evolved from personal experiences- Mrs Flavell herself has a hearing disability-she has encountered over the 15 years she has worn hearing aids. She has worked with and listened to comments from hearing impaired people, especially the elderly, about the frustrations and embarrassment of trying to hear in public places such as churches, theatres, auditoriums, meeting rooms, et cetera. The most difficult problems the hearing impaired encounter in day-today living occur when they try to use over-the-counter services in banks, post offices, motor registry offices, Social Security, CES and the like. The reason is that there is a lot of background noise in these places by the very nature of the services they provide.To solve these problems, a loop mat unit was demonstrated at the forum. This unit can be placed on counters or desks in areas serving the public such as tellers' counters in banks. The loop mat, working in conjunction with the T switch in the hearing aid, will eliminate background noises and will allow the hearing impaired to conduct their business in privacy like those not suffering from hearing disabilities. The loop mat unit is compact, light and portable. It can be easily moved and is reasonably priced. Installing audio loops in churches allows the hearing impaired to hear the service. By installing the loop in auditoriCreek, ums and meeting rooms, hearing impaired members can participate in meetings and thereby are not deprived of the rights that other members enjoy. Loops in theatres will allow them to enjoy entertainment. The resolution passed at the forum was that the Hon. Ms Wendy Machin, state member of parliament for Port Macquarie, and Mr Mark Vaile, federal member for Lyne, be asked to recommend to the state and federal government that all state and federal government employees receive a program of training on customer service for the hearing impaired. Seventy people attended this forum. Amongst those present were representatives of business houses and service providers who had accepted an invitation to attend. There were representatives from the RTA and Social Security, managers of state and ANZ banks, the inspector of police and an audiologist from Australian Hearing Services. Also, 10 pupils who are taking a CES course in nursing assistance attended and were accompanied by a teacher. The students asked questions and said that they gained a lot of knowledge from the forum. The forum also identified a number of areas that should be targeted as far as an educational process is concerned, such as post offices, banks, doctors' surgeries, solicitors' offices, police stations, court houses, motor registries, theatres, auditoriums, meeting rooms, motels, television stations, and, most importantly, as far as this address tonight is concerned, Commonwealth operated government offices, where we should be thinking of providing the service not just to some sections of the disabled community but to all sections. Providing the loop mats in Social Security offices, CES offices and other Commonwealth offices is not an expensive exercise to undertake. I commend the recommendation of this forum to the government to investigate. Gerathy, Mr N.",100
193,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.36 p.m.)Tonight I want to say a few words about Nick Gerathy, a young 15-year-old Brisbane schoolboy. Nick left Brisbane about a fortnight ago and headed up through Archerfield, Rockhampton, Longreach, Cloncurry, Tennant Alice Springs and Glendambo. I caught up with him at Port Augusta. I was so impressed after speaking to him and his parents that I said I would say a few words in the parliament about his exploits. He headed down to Adelaide, across to Essendon, up to Cobar, Dubbo, Sydney, Tamworth and then back to Brisbane. What is so special about that? This young man, 15 years of age, was flying a Tiger Moth. Apparently this Tiger Moth still has its original motor. Nick began flying when he was 13, under the guidance of Barry Hempel from Hempel's Aviation at Archerfield, Queensland. He is currently studying in year 10 at St Laurence's College. He is planning a career as a commercial pilot, already having flown more years than pilots several years his senior. The purpose of the exercise was to raise money for Farmhand, which, as most people would know, is helping Australia's drought stricken regions.",101
194,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,A very worthy cause.,102
195,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely. I understand that Nick raised something like $40,000, which will be doubled by the support that the federal government will put in. Elders was the major sponsor. It is pleasing to see Elders get behind this exercise. What I want to focus on tonight is young Nick Gerathy. He was born in Tasmania in 1979 and is now living in Brisbane. I spoke to his parents the other day at Port Augusta. When I saw this young man hop out of the Tiger Moth, I was quite taken. It stunned me to see this young fellow, bright as you like, at about 9 o'clock in the morning. Obviously he had left Glendambo at first light. I quickly add, before people get concerned, that his flying instructor was in the second seat with him. This young fellow showed enthusiasm and sheer audacity by flying all around Australia and right across some pretty isolated country. Think of that stretch between Tennant Creek, Glendambo and Port Augusta! The sense of adventure, the sense of having a go, is well and truly alive. In my few words tonight, I acknowledge his efforts and those of his support team and his parents. No doubt they are back in Brisbane enjoying a well-earned spell from a fairly arduous task. Thank you, Nick Gerathy, for your efforts on behalf of rural Australia.

(6) Have any grants to the council held in trusts been accounted for as required by law.",105
201,Mr LAVARCH,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Inquiries made by my Department of the Office of Fair Trading, Department of Justice, Victoria, have revealed that the only record which that Office has in relation to Environment Victoria is an application to register a business name under the Business Names Act 1962 (Vic) made by the Conservation Council of Victoria Inc. That Office has also advised that no formal investigation has been initiated by that Office into the Conservation Council of Victoria Inc. I am not aware of any other inquiry. (2) My Department has also been advised by the Office of Fair Trading that the Conservation Council of Victoria Inc is registered under the Associations Incorporations Act 1981 (Vic). The e 'Environment Victoria' is not registered as a ness name under the Business Names Act 1962 . I am not aware of whether or not the Consern Council of Victoria is operating in such a This is in any case a matter for the Victoria ernment. The Australian Securities Commission has sed my Department that, on 20 May 1991, the uty Registrar of Incorporated Associations in oria advised the Australian Securities Commisthat a company called 'Conservation Council ictoria Inc' was granted a certificate of inoration in accordance with section 10 of the ciations Incorporations Act 1981 (Vic). As at of the change of incorporated status of the ervation Council of Victoria Inc thereby ted, the Australian Securities Commission elled the Council's registration under the orations Law on 25 May 1991. My Department has been advised by the e of Fair Trading that the Conservation cil of Victoria Inc has recently lodged outing annual returns with the Registrar of porated Associations. The annual returns of i porated associations are dealt with under rian law and administered by the Victoria rnment. No, and the Office of the Director of Public ecutions has advised that it has no information t the alleged commission of offences under monwealth law by the Conservation Council ictoria Inc relating to failure to account for a er expenditure of Commonwealth grants and c money.

202,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A person in receipt of a Disability Pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 for a war caused or service related accepted disability, is eligible to receive drugs under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) for the treatment of the accepted disability and any sequelae. The RPBS is a broader scheme than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), specifically designed to meet the special drug treatment needs of individual veterans with war caused or service related accepted disabilities. The range of drugs available under the RPBS Board includes those on the PBS Schedule plus those on the Repatriation Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. Other drugs not included on either Schedule may be provided with the prior approval of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The drugs listed on the Repatriation Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits are on the recommendation Labor of the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Reference Committee, a committee of drug experts nominated by Australian medicinal and pharmaceutical national associations and by the Returned and Services League. The role of the Committee is to ensure that drugs on the Repatriation Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits complement those listed on the PBS to meet the special drug treatment needs of veterans with war caused or service related accepted disabilities. A person may receive a Disability Support Pension for a non-war caused or service related accepted disability under the Department of Social Security legislation. This entitlement is restricted to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which comes under the National Health Act 1953. Medicines are listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee which takes into account the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each product. As at 1 July 1994, 437,500 people received a Disability Support Pension. CES Office Caboolture Gympie Ipswich Toowoomba Warwick Total The data provided in the table should be treated with caution. Data on the number of persons registered as unemployed with the CES are not an indicator of unemployment or a reliable indicator of changes in employment. This is because: some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES; the CES register can change over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs; and not all people seeking employment register with the CES for assistance. A more accurate indicator of the number of unemployed by duration is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which measures unemployment according to standards set by the International Labour Organisation. In this case ABS collection areas do not match the geographic areas specified in the honourable member's question. Unemployment (Question No. 1343) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) How many persons registered with each office of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) as looking for work on 30 June 1994 reside (a) on Bribie Island, Qld and (b) in the Queensland shires of (i) Kilcoy, (ii) Esk, (iii) Rosalie and (iv) Nanango. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The table below shows the number of jobseekers registered as unemployed at CES offices. (b) Queensland shires (a) (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) Bribie Island Kilcoy Esk Rosalie Nanango 856 135 516 4,326 787 83 856 135 4,326 870 516 Volunteer Management Program (Question No. 1345) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Will funding for the Volunteer Management Program cease on 30 June 1995; if not (a) when and (b) on what criteria will a funding decision be made and (c) what funds will be provided from 30 June 1995 to enable the program to continue. (2) What benefits from the program to volunteers and the Commonwealth have been identified since the program commenced.",107
203,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Volunteer Management Program (VMP) was announced in December 1992, as a limited term development program to cease on 30 June 1995. There is no commitment at this time to continue funding beyond that date. (a) A decision regarding the continuation of the program beyond June 1995, will be made following an evaluation to be conducted during 1994-95. (b & c) Any decisions regarding the amount of funding or funding criteria for any ongoing program will be made following the evaluation. (2) The successful tenderer for the evaluation of the VMP will be asked to ""evaluate the effectiveness of the program in addressing the VMP priority area activities making explicit reference to specific strengths and weaknesses in the program"". This exercise will identify what benefits to volunteers and to the Commonwealth have accrued from the program. General Practice Strategy (Question No. 1353) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Did her predecessor state on several occasions that funding of proposed divisions of general practice would not be drawn from the Medical Benefits Schedule. (2) Has she decided to have the indexed increase in the Medical Benefits Schedule to fund general practice divisions and accreditation; if so, why.",108
204,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The funding for the General Practice Strategy including the divisions of general practice has come primarily from new money. Only a small proportion, about $10 million out of the $136.3 million has been redirected from possible fee increases for general practice consultations. The Government has never given any commitment on the level of future fee increases for either GPs or specialists. (2) The fee increase for general practice consultations is half that being provided for specialist services because of the increased funding to GPs via the General Practice Strategy. While around $10 million, or 15 cents on the standard consultation item, is being redirected into General Practice Strategy, the Government is at the same time putting a further $126.3 million into the strategy this financial year. intended to address the issues facing general practice such as the redistribution of the workforce, an expansion of the role of GPs, better integration with the rest of the health system, more opportunities for peer review and continuing medical education, and, to improve qUality. National Health Goals (Question No. 1354) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Will a report concerning national health goals be released in September 1994. (2) Is a section of the report concerning child mental health and education almost a carbon copy of recommendations contained in successive reports prepared by her Department and its predecessors since the 1970s which have never been implemented successfully. (3) Has the Commonwealth since the 1970s failed to communicate with State government education departments and successfully implement child health goals; if so, will the failure continue for another 20 years. (4) How will the implementation of the report's child mental health and education goals be assured.",109
205,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A report concerning Health Goals and Targets is being considered by State and Territory Health Ministers in September 1994. It will be released after Ministers agree to its contents. An Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council Working Party on Child and Youth Health will release a draft policy paper for public consultation in September 1994. (2) There have not been successive reports prepared by my Department on child mental health and education. Historically State and Territory Governments have been responsible for the planning and delivery of health services for children in Australia, the Commonwealth's role being primarily in the form of financial provisions under broadly based national initiatives such as Medicare, and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes. In 1992, the Federal Government moved to take a more active role in child health when, as part of the work towards National Health Goals and Targets, consultants were retained to develop National Health Goals and Targets for Australian Children and Youth. Their report was submitted in September 1992 and it recommended that a national health policy be developed for children and young The additional funds are people. An AHMAC Working Party was subsequently established in 1993 to undertake this policy development work. It is composed of representatives of all the States and Territories, of the Commonwealth, of community organisations and of the National Health and Medical Research Council. A draft policy paper is almost ready for public comment and will be presented for consideration by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference later this year. This is the first formal initiative ever undertaken to develop a national policy in the area of child and youth health, and is expected to cover aspects of the emotional and mental health of Australian children and young people. (3) The AHMAC Working Party on Child and Youth Health has sought the views of State and Commonwealth Education authorities while developing a national health policy for children and young people. Their views will be sought again during the public consultation phase of this work later this year. (4) Any agreed national health policies and goals in the area of child health will be implemented by the appropriate agencies according to agreed strategies. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Question No. 1355) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Will the new title holders to land acquired through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund be required to perform any actions or pay any costs associated with local and state government requirements. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The nature of the title to land purchased through the Land Fund will not change on acquisition and grant to the titleholders by the Indigenous Land Corporation. Thus, title holders of land bought with moneys from the land fund will be subject to the normal obligations and charges imposed by State and local government authorities. Pastoral leases purchased with Land Fund moneys will be able to be converted to native title under the Native Title Act 1993 if the community involved can demonstrate continuing attachment to the land. These native title holders will then be bound by State and local government requirements as provided for in the Native Title Act. Section 193R of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill provides an exemption from stamp duty or other tax if acquisition and grant of a piece of land by the Indigenous Land Corporation take place within 12 months of each other. This is to ensure that stamp duty and other taxes are not payable twice in a year in respect of both the acquisition and the grant of an interest in land by the ILC. Department of Tourism: Electronic Information (Question No. 1369) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. Mr Lee--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Land Fund (1) Currently nil, however, the Department and the Bureau of Tourism Research are investigating the feasibility of using such facilities for information dissemination. (2) Unknown at this stage. Operational aspects are being considered as part of the feasibility investigation. (3) The role of libraries, and other public outlets, is being examined as part of the investigation into the feasibility of using public access points for electronic information distribution. Prime Ministers: Overseas Visits (Question No. 1372) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Which Australian Prime Ministers have visited Indonesia during their terms of office. (2) What were the dates of each visit referred to in part (1). (3) Which nations did Prime Minister Menzies visit during his terms of office. (4) What were the dates of each visit referred to in part (3).",109

Departmental records are not available for the period prior to 1950. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Question No. 1385) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Does Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party, oblige nations to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms under the Covenant are violated shall have effective remedy. (2) Do persons in Australia have effective remedies against violations under the Covenant; if so, what are the remedies; if not, when will the Government legislate to provide them.",110
207,Mr LAVARCH,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Article 2(3) states: ""Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes: (a) To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity; (b) To ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy; (c) To ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted."" Australia became a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (lCCPR) on 13 August 1980. The ICCPR is a binding international instrument and by becoming a party to it, Australia made a commitment in international law to the standards it contains. (2) Yes. Australia when joining the Covenant acted on the view, and continues to act on the view, that Art.2(3) does not require an aggrieved person be able to take action in a court to seek a remedy directly base on the Covenant. Rather, Australia takes the view that its law generally conforms to the Covenant. The ordinary remedies available in the courts, and through administrative mechanisms provide remedies to individuals that meet the requirement of Art.2(3). Thus not every matter concerning individual rights or freedoms is properly dealt with, at least in the first instance, by resorting to legal remedies through the formal court system. In many cases rights are better preserved by less formal processes, often associated with inquiry, conciliation and report. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HEROC), the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court (pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977) and the Ombudsman are some examples of Commonwealth institutions where aggrieved individuals can seek remedies for violation of their civil and political rights. In addition the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant allows individuals, who believe that their rights under the Covenant have been violated, to complain to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Australia acceded to the First Optional Protocol on 25 September 1991. This means that the Committee can consider complaints of alleged violations under the Covenant by Australia which occurred on, or after, the 25 December 1991. A complainant must exhaust all available domestic remedies before lodging his or her complaint with the Committee. Members and Senators: Eligibility (Question No. 1386) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Has his Department formulated or received any advice on the compatibility of section 44(i.) of the Australian Constitution which disqualifies any Member or Senator who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power and the Schedule to the Constitution which requires Members and Senators to swear or affirm true allegiance to the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; if so, what is the advice.",111
208,Mr LAVARCH,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed that the answer is no. Elective Surgery (Question No. 1387) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What sum was allocated to each State and Territory in the 1994-95 Budget for purchasing services for public patients from private hospitals. (2) What impact will each allocation have on the waiting times for elective surgery procedures in the respective State or Territory.",112
209,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Funds committed in the 1994-95 Budget for purchasing services for public patients from private hospitals were not allocated on a Statefferritory basis. Proposals were sought from all States and Territories. (2) Negotiations are still continuing with private hospitals in Queensland for funding under this program. It is a condition of funding that patients to be treated are taken off existing public hospital waiting lists. Impact on waiting times will be included in the evaluation of the initiative. Community Organisation Support (Question No. 1400) Ms Worth asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) What are the objectives of the Community Organisation Support Program. (2) What are the names of the organisations which have received funding under the Volunteer Management Program since its inception and what sum did each receive. (3) Will the Volunteer Management Program continue beyond 1994-95. (4) Has she given any indication, orally or in writing, to volunteer organisations about the future of the Volunteer Management Program: if so, what was the nature of the indication.",112
210,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The objective of the Community Organisations' Support Program (COSP) is to fund activities undertaken by community-based, non-profit organisations and groups, which relate to the policies and programs of the Department, which are national in focus, and are not direct service delivery or research. (2) The organisations funded through the Volunteer Management Program (VMP) are listed below with the amount received by them from February 1993 to June 1995: Volunteer Centre of New South Wales$108,709 Volunteer Centre of Queensland Inc-$101,325 Volunteer Centre of SA Inc-$107,078 Volunteer Centre of Victoria Inc-$116,490 Volunteer Centre of Western Australia$101,957 ACT Volunteer Association Incorporated$259,641 NT Council for Volunteering Inc-$256,533 Tasmanian Volunteer Centre-$192,714 Albury/Wodonga Volunteer Resource Bureau$95,385 Bathurst Information and Neighbourhood Centre-$95,385 Eastern Volunteer Management Project-$95,385 New School of Arts Neighbourhood House Inc$95,385 Noarlunga Volunteer Services Inc-$95,385 Para Districts Volunteer Service Inc-$95,385 Townsville Volunteers Incorporated-$95,385 Program Wimmera Volunteers Inc-$95,385 Peel Volunteer Centre-$95,385 Gold Coast Volunteer Centre (funding ceased)$46,107 (3) The VMP was announced in December 1992, as a limited term development program which is due to cease on 30 June 1995. There is no commitment at this time to continue funding beyond that date. However, there is to be an evaluation during 1994-95 and decisions about continuing the program cannot be made prior to the completion of this evaluation. (4) In discussions with representatives from the Australian Council for Volunteering (ACV) I gave verbal, in principle support for the continuation of the program subject to the outcomes of the evaluation to be conducted during 1994-95. Any decisions about the future of the program will be made following that evaluation. Cystic Fibrosis (Question No. 1401) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many adults suffer from cystic fibrosis in Australia. (2) What is the estimated annual cost of medication required by a typical adult sufferer of cystic fibrosis. (3) What financial assistance is available from the Government to adults suffering from cystic fibrosis to help meet the costs of essential medication. (4) What restrictions, limits or exclusions apply to the assistance referred to in part (3). (5) How many adult sufferers of cystic fibrosis hold a health care card. (6) What is the estimated cost of extending assistance and health care card eligibility to all adult sufferers of cystic fibrosis. (7) Do children suffering from cystic fibrosis automatically receive health care card benefits through the Children's Disability Allowance; if so, what income tests apply to the children's parents.",112
211,Dr LAWRENCE,TELSTRA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no comprehensive statistics but the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Federation estimates that the number of adult sufferers in Australia with Cystic Fibrosis is 750. The estimated total number of Cystic Fibrosis sufferers in Australia is 2500. (2) It is not possible to estimate a typical annual cost as the severity of the illness varies. The most common need is for drugs to treat chest infections which vary in frequency and intensity between patients. Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements are also needed. Some sufferers receive heart/lung transplants, in which case they would need transplant anti-rejection drugs. The maximum annual outlay for sufferers of any condition is limited by safety nets applying to individuals and families: Concessional-$135.20 General-$4oo.oo plus $2.60 per script after the safety net is reached. (3) The Government endeavours, through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), to provide necessary medication at a reasonable cost to the Australian community, including those who suffer from Cystic Fibrosis. The PBS safety net was introduced in 1986 to provide protection for families and the chronically ill by setting an upper annual limit on expenditure for PBS prescription drugs. General patients are protected by a safety net arrangement which provides PBS prescription items at the concessional rate of $2.60 after an initial outlay of $400. Holders of concession cards, issued by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs, are entitled to receive pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions at the concessional rate of $2.60 per item. They then qualify for free pharmaceutical benefits under current Safety Net arrangements after an outlay of $135.20, the equivalent to 52 prescriptions, in a calendar year. (4) From 1 January 1995, general patients will be required to declare their Medicare number when completing the declaration to obtain a concessional safety net card. This initiative is being put in place to ensure that temporary visitors to Australia are not able to stockpile drugs under the general safety net. (5) The Departments of Human Services and Health and Social Security do not have specific information on the number of adult sufferers with Cystic Fibrosis who hold a Health Care Card. However, the Department of Social Security is able to provide general information on the issue of Health Care Cards. There are a number of concession cards issued by the Department of Social Security, and all of these cards attract concessional pharmaceuticals for the card holder and their dependents. Health Care Cards are issued to people who are classified as 'disadvantaged persons' under the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Department of Social Security administers the issue of the Health Care Card on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health. In more general terms, a client who meets eligibility criteria and is classified as a 'disadvantaged person' is eligible to receive a Health Care Card. However, a Health Care Card is not issued to a client for reason alone, of suffering from a chronic illness. Therefore, one of the main criteria for issue of a Health Care Card to a client is their classification as a 'disadvantaged person'. (6) The estimated cost of extending assistance and health care card eligibility to all adult sufferers of Cystic Fibrosis is unknown. However, the Department of Social Security is able to provide the following information in relation to Health Care Card income tests. The Department of Social Security has advised that it is difficult to justify a separate Health Care Card income test for clients with Cystic Fibrosis and other chronic illnesses, as the PBS safety net limit is in place to help such people. The Department of Human Services and Health is responsible for any such amendment to the Health Insurance Act and any associated increases in costs. (7) Child Disability Allowance is not income tested. Any child who is eligible for Child Disability Allowance receives a health care card. Department of Tourism: Grants (Question No. 1416) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many grants did the Minister's Department make to individuals or organisations in the electoral division of Cowan in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) With respect to each grant made in (a) 199293 and (b) 1993-94, (i) under what program was it made, (ii) what was its value and (iii) what was the name of the recipient.

Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Nine grants were made to individuals or organisations in the electorates of Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay during the years 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94.

University College of the Sunshine Coast (Question No. 1451) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 29 August 1994: (1) What funding formula will be used to allocate recurrent grants for the proposed University College of the Sunshine Coast, Qld. (2) What weight will the formula give to areas (a) of high population growth and consequently high university enrolment growth and (b) with high rates of tertiary education participation. (3) How many students are projected to be enrolled in the University College of the Sunshine Coast in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, and (e) 2000. (4) What funds will be allocated to the University College of the Sunshine Coast (a) in base recurrent grants, (b) in growth funds and (c) under the Higher Education Equity Program in (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999 and (v) 2000. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth provides operating grant funding to higher education institutions in the Unified National System in the form of a single operating grant on the basis of an educational profile covering both teaching and research activities. This grant is determined on a rolling triennial basis which ensures that institutions have a secure level of funding on which to base their planning for at least three years. A ""funding formula"" is not used to allocate operating grant funds. However, the additional student places generated by the allocation of growth are funded at a rate which takes into account the varying costs associated with teaching different disciplines and levels. In 1996 funding for growth was targeted to regions of high population growth and low tertiary participation. More particularly, places were Recipient Value Funds Approved Walkers Ltd, Maryborough $90,000 1990-91 Walkers Ltd, Maryborough $95,000 1990-91 WE Moller Pty Ltd, $41,950 1991-92 Maryborough Walkers Ltd, Maryborough $12,410 1991-92 1993-94 Gympie value of each grant, and may not reflect the amount allocated to higher education institutions that were allocated funding for the capital development of new campuses. Over the 1994-96 triennium $15.6 million has been allocated to the Queensland University of Technology for the capital development of the new campus on the Sunshine Coast, and further funds of up to $5 million will be provided in 1997 on condition that an agreement can be reached with the State Government over an appropriate level of State support for the development. QUT was allocated 100 growth places plus pipeline from 1996 to reflect its commitments to the development of campuses on the Sunshine Coast and at Carseldine. (2) No formula is used to allocate additional places. If additional growth places are available in 1997, priority is likely to be given to areas of rapid population growth and low tertiary participation. (3) The Planning President of University College of the Sunshine Coast has advised my Department that the latest projections of numbers for the College are 250 equivalent full time student units (EFTSU) in 1996 and 1000 EFTSU in 1998. Enrolment growth in subsequent years will depend on the amount of Commonwealth funded growth allocated to Queensland University of Technology for use at the University College of the Sunshine Coast. (4) (a) The legislative authority for provision of Commonwealth funding for higher education is the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 (HEFA) which details (Section 4) the institutions to which grants for operating purposes can be provided. The University College of the Sunshine Coast is not identified as a separate institution by the Act and is treated as a campus of Queensland University of Technology. Accordingly funds are not provided directly to the College. (b) The Commonwealth provided additional growth of 80 EFTSU in 1996 to the Queensland University of Technology for the University College of the Sunshine Coast. Decisions have not been made regarding the allocation of funds and growth beyond 1996. (c) As the University College of the Sunshine Coast is a campus of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) funding under the HEEP is provided to QUT on the basis of its equity achievements. The HEEP funding allocation for QUT for 1994 was $108,000. However, this amount will be increased by around 25% ($28,000) following the recent announcement of an additional $lm for HEEP funds in 1994 and future years. The extra $lm has been transferred from the National Priority (Reserve) Fund and brings total HEEP funds for 1994 to around $5m. Queensland University of Technology will decide what proportion of its funding allocation will be allocated to equity initiatives at the University College of the Sunshine Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Question No. 1453) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 29 August 1994: Will any new title holders to land acquired through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund be bound by State law and local authority by-laws and ordinances. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The nature of the title to land purchased through the Land Fund will not change on acquisition and grant to the titleholders by the Indigenous Land Corporation. Thus, title holders of land bought with moneys from the land fund will be subject to the normal obligations and charges imposed by State and local government authorities. Pastoral leases purchased with Land Fund moneys will be able to be converted to native title under the Native Title Act 1993 if the community involved can demonstrate continuing attachment to the land. These native title holders will then be bound by State and local government requirements as provided for in the Native Title Act. Section 193R of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill provides an exemption from stamp duty or other tax if acquisition and grant of a piece of land by the Indigenous Land Corporation take place within 12 months of each other. This is to ensure that stamp duty and other taxes are not payable twice in a year in respect of both the acquisition and the grant of an interest in land by the ILC.

213,Mr WALKER,FAIRFAX WIDE BAY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In accordance with legislative provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act), the Australian Electoral Commission may declare a place to be a pre-poll voting office by publishing a notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. It is Commission policy to assess the effectiveness of previous arrangements and the location of premises when considering the establishment of pre-poll voting offices in order to provide an effective service to electors. The Act does not preclude the placement of prepoll voting offices within 6 metres of parliamentarians offices. (2) No. Moreover, the pre-poll voting centre site was used before the Office of the Member for Canberra was located in its present position. (3) The AEC is unaware of any allegations regarding the storage of election materials in the Member for Canberra's Office. Materials were either stored in a safe at the ACT Government 'shop-front' located in the shopping centre opposite the pre-poll voting centre, or, at times when that facility was unavailable, they were stored overnight in the Divisional Office. (4) No. Provisions exist under Section 200E of the Commonwealth Electoral Act for completed pre-poll votes to be stored in ballot boxes. Furthermore, it is a standard operational procedure of the Commission to store pre-poll votes in sealed ballot boxes. (5) An inspection of the pre-poll voting office was undertaken by the Commission on 28 June 1994 as a result of an earlier question on notice by Senator Kemp in order to determine the distance between the pre-poll voting office and the Member for Canberra's office. The investigation revealed that the pre-poll voting office was located more than 6 metres away from the Member for Canberra's electorate office. Australian Companies: Boards (Question No. 1517)",116
