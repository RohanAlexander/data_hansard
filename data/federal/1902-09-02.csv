1,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Has' the Minister for Trade and Customs considered the advisability of introducing a short Bill to amend the Customs Act, so as to ameliorate in some degree the position of those who commit errors in connection with the transaction of Customs business, without impairing the power of the Minister to deal as stringently as possible with those who are guilty of attempts to defraud the revenue 1 "" Mr KINGSTON -^A number of matters connected with Customs administration now form the subject of ministerial consideration, particularly ip connection with communications which I have recently received from Chambers of Commerce and other bodies in reply to my request for information. I have not finally dealt with those communications, and am unable at this moment to give my honourable friend the answer he desires; but if he will give notice of his question, I shall be glad to answer it at a later date. NA INSTRUCTORS. . Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I wish to know from the Acting Minister of Defence whether he has received from Major General Hutton replies to his questions as to the employment of the ten drill instructors who were recently sent to South Australia 1 I ask the question because I have been told on very good authority that there is a real danger of the men taking to drink as the result of sheer want of employment 7",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"- I do not think there is the danger which the honourable member fears. The General Officer Comconmanding has been in Sydney for the past with ten days or a fortnight, and perhaps for that reason I have ngt yet received replies' to the questions which I have asked. HOLIDAYS : POSTAL DEPARTMENT - CONSTRUCTION BRANCH .",14
3,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Yesterday , being a State holiday in South Australia, was observed in the Defenco and Customs departments there, but the men belonging to the Post and Telegraph departments were, through some blunder, compelled to attend at the various offices, and were kept at work for about two hours. A similar mistake occurred in regard to the observance of Easter Saturday. I should like to know how the blunder happened, and what rule is to be adopted by the department in the future ?",15
4,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The Postmaster-General has inquired into the matter, and has ascertained that the mistake occurred because, while the regulations issued by the Post and Telegraph department make provision for the observance of certain Holidays only, these have been overridden by the determination of the Government that all holidays proclaimed by the Government of any State shall be observed by the Commonwealth officers in that State. The two holidays to which the honourable and learned member for South Australia has referred arc statutory holidays which should have been, and, in future will be, observed by the Past and Telegraph officials in that State. ] Mr BATCHELOR - Is it intended to give the men who were compelled to work yesterday another day 1",15
5,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Some concession may be' extended to them ; but I understand that they were kept at work for only two hours. NORFOLK ISLAND .,15
6,Mr FULLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Has the Acting Prime Minister received any communication from the Governor or Premier of New South Wales in regard to the condition of affairs at Norfolk Island, and, if so, does he object to lay it on the table 7",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"So far as I remember, we have received no communication on - the subject from the Premier of New South Wales, but a few weeks ago an enquiry was made through the Governor of that Statei n whom, and not in the Government of New South Wales, the control of the island is vested-as to the willingness of the Commonwealth to take charge of Norfolk Island if he desired to transfer his authority to the Commonwealth. Our reply was that the Commonwealth is willing to accept the responsibility. WAGES : TELEGRAP H",15
8,Mr SPENCE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that some of the men of the telegraph construction branch are paid their wages at the beginning of the month, and others not until many days afterwards 1",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Does the honourable member refer to men working at the same place f,15
10,Mr SPENCE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Ye s ; and engaged upon the same job. I am referring to what has taken place in Sydney. This practice has been, in existence for several months - I wish to know if the Postmaster-General will see that it is discontinued. I have-already brought it under the notice of the Government.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"T h o attention of the Postmaster-General will be called to the matter. This is the first occasion upon which it has been mentioned, so far as my knowledge goes. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",15
12,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,^ W i ll the Acting Prime Minister make a short statement to the House in regard to the business for the remainder of the session 7,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"It is absolutely impossible to deal with either the Judiciary Bill or the High Court Procedure Bill this session ; but my former statement on the subject has been misunderstood. I did not attribute to the House the desire not to pass those measures, nor did I assert that there is a majority opposed to them. What I said was that at this period of the session' a large number of honourable members, especially on the Opposition side of the Chamber, consider that time will not permit of their being dealt with. The Loan Bill, Loan Appropriation Bill, Government Inscribed Stock Bill, and Interim Payments ' Bill are Bills which depend upon the acceptance by the House of the Budget proposals of the Treasurer. In addition to those, I know of no measure of importance remaining to bo dealt with, except the Bonus Bill, which is set down for consideration this afternoon. We have been asked to introduce a measure to amend one section of the Public Service Act, to provide for greater convenience in administration, and another minor 'financial measure has been mentioned, while the acting leader of the Opposition this afternoon asked the Minister for - Trade and Customs if he intends to introduce an amendment of the Customs Act. W it h similar exceptions, the notice-papers of 'this and the other Chamber contain practically ""the whole of the business wibh which we intend to conclude the session. Although the message of the Senate relating to the Customs Tariff Jiill cannot be received until tomorrow, it has, I believe, been published in - extenso in the press, and I hope, therefore, that as time is extremely valuable, honourable members will be prepared to enter upon its consideration directly it is received.",15
14,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"If we - can dispose of the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill, the Customs Tariff Bill, and the Electoral Bill this week, there will be only - the financial Bills to deal with, and if the Treasurer will not be prepared until this day - fortnight to proceed with those measures it might be possible for the House to adjourn for a week.",16
15,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Providin g that we d'o - dispose of the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill and the Customs Tariff Bill, and that - the Senate does not this week dispose of the Electoral Bill, it might be unnecessary for us to meet next week, but we bave to recollect that under our most inconvenient standing order both Houses must be sitting in - order that a message may be transmitted - from one to the other, so that any arrangement will have to be subject to the progress made this week. RAILWAY RATES. Mr Mahon"" asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice3. Whether section 102 of the Constitution - entitles the Commonwealth to prohibit a State from giving by means of its railways any ""undue and unreasonable"" ""preference or - discrimination"" in trade and commerce? 2. Whether he is aware that about one-third - of the population of Western Australia resident - on the gold-fields of that State are in their inter-course with the eastern side of the continent compelled to travel and to convey most of the necessaries of life nearly 1,000 miles further - than need be through the refusal of the Government of Western Australia to construct or .allow the construction of a railway from Esper-anoe to Coolgardie; and whether since the protection of the vested interests of a small num""ber of property holders at Perth and Fremantle is one of the avowed grounds of such refusal, he does not consider that an ""undue and unreasonable"" preference or discrimination is thereby established within the meaning of this section ? 3. Whether, since section 98 of the Constitution expressly endows this Parliament with power over State railways in their relations to trade and commerce, the Governmenb will consider the propriety of immediate intervention in this case, where thousands of citizens suffer severe loss and inconvenience through trade being diverted from its natural highway and through the enforcement of special rates on the railways for the carriage of products imported from other States ?",16
16,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"As the honourable member is aware, the preference or discrimination alluded to can be determined only by the Inter-State Commission. He is also doubtless aware that that commission can deal with only Inter-State trade.",16
17,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Does the honourable and learned gentleman say that this is not Inter-State trade 1,16
18,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"No ; but as to bow far any traffic under section 102 may be Inter-State trade, I am not sufficiently informed to be able to. say.",16
19,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Cannot the Government proceed under section 117 1,16
20,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,I think not.,16
21,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,It is just as well to test it as regards railway rates.,16
22,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,The honourable and learned member refers to a disability or discrimination.,16
23,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,I think that the Victorian and South Australian rates are bad under that section.,16
24,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"They would then be bad for a very special reason, and in a very special way. It would not be possible to rely on that section to the extent that the honourable member for Coolgardie evidently desires in the questions which he asks. For their solution the creation of the commission is necessary, and then the scope of its authority is limited to following what it may determine to be or the courts may hold to be Inter-State trade. INTER-STATE TRADE .",16
25,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether his attention has been directed to a letter signed ""Mercafcor,"" published in the Bendigo Advertiser on Kith August, in which complaint is made of the irksome regulations and formalities insisted upon in connection with the transit of goods from one State into another ; and whether, in view of the long lapse oE time since the commencement of viniform Federal duties, and the eradual and probable exhaustion of stocks imported into Australia before that date,-he can see his way to'reduce and mitigate the severity of some of the bookkeeping forms and rules at present enforced ?",16
26,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's question is as follows : The Government have under their most serious consideration the provision of further facilities in relation to Inter-State trade, and tliey propose before the end of next week to issue the necessary regulations. They have the utmost sympathy with the propositi to remove all restrictions on Inter-State free-trade, which can be removed consistently wibh proper regard to the Constitution Act. This removal is now more possible and desirable than originally, because of the smaller amount receivable under section 92. The amount collected under this secbion of the Constitution is also rapidly diminishing. Ib only botalled Â£9,130 for the half-year ending June 30th, 1902. Further, its rapid decrease is indicated by the faob thab for July, 1902, it was only Â£1,126, as follows:New South Wales ... ... Â£68 Vicboria ... ... ... 120 Queensland ... ... 320 South Australia ... ... Tasmania ... ... ... 226 Western Australia ... ... 297 Also as regards New South Wales and Tasmania, the bwo States in respect of which only ib has been possible to yet obtain the August figures, the amounts fell from Â£68 and 1226 bo Â£54 and Â£125. Figures such as these induce consideration of the question whebher future collections under the secbion are desirable in view of the small results as compared with the trouble involved, but the rights of the States chiefly interested must of course be specially considered. Our wish is to make Inter-State free-trade a matter of f a c t at the earliest possible Australia opportunity. DRILL SERGEANTS. - Mr Glynn asked the Treasurer, upon notiee1.

The local military forces expected that under federation bheir pay would be increased so as to bring ib up to bhat in the obher Sbates ; but instead, a General Order jusb. issued announces bhat "" special pay "" will be sbopped. Hitherto the men received special pay for guards of honour and obher special duties, the buglers and band men for practising, and non-coms, for givinginsbruobions outside their own company, and officers for various duties. Under the new regulations a captain who subscribes to the Military Club will be about 10s. better off than a private, and. a lieutenant will be Â£1 worse. 2.

In view of the low rate of militar3' pnj' in South Australia as compared with Victoria and amount ?

32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"In reply to the packages. honourable member's questions, I desire to state1. Yes.

37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," Severa l questions have been asked in reference to w h at action upon has been taken regarding a r a i l w a y connection between the eastern States and Australia , and I now lay upon the table a pre'eis of the in for m at i o n which has been obtained up to ths present time.

BONUSES EOR MANUFACTU-RES",18
38,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," Referring to the order of the day for the further reconcourse sideration of this Bill, I move- That the standing orders be suspended into enable a motion to be moved that the Bill referred to a select committee. I have had an opportunity of consulting with those who are entitled to express an opinion on the question, whether, under existing circumstances, the standing orders woulcl allow of a second attempt being made to refer the Bill, to a select committee.",19
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Is this a motion ceilsure 1,19
40,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"I do not know whether the honourable member is attempting the Government by making a remark of that sort, but so far as I can see it is not motion of censure, particularly as I do not think that the House was fully aware of the circumstances which might occur when the standing order was passed. It provides that no proposal to refer a Bill to a select committee can be entertained after it has been 'reported by the Chairman. We all know fchafc this Bill was reported by the Chairman for the purpose of assistsimilar ing the Government and the House to poses reconsider certain proposals without the formal necessity of coming fco a decision i the meantime upon the clauses subsequent to the third one, on which considerable debate had taken place. Seeing it was done for the convenience of the House, it seems to me that the Government ought to offer no opposition to a proposal, opposition. which, under other circumstances, would have been quite in order. It may be remembered that on the last occasion the proposal to refer the Bill to a select comand mittee - was not voted upon.. The proposal to create a blank was negatived, and, there Mr. fore, we did not get a decision on the main question. It seems to me that of the debate on the Bill goes further to show the necessity of holding an inquiry before a final decision is arrived at.",19
41,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Ha d not the honourable member better address himself simply to the suspension of the standing orders ? .,19
42,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"If the Government are I willing to allow this motion to go, I do not desire to occupy thefcimeof the House at this stage in discussing it, bufc'if I do not now give some reasons' for suspending the standing orders the debate may proceed, and I shall not have a chance to speak until I BILL. rise to reply. If it had been thought that the standing orders would debar a resort to any whioh was open previous to the Chairman reporting the Bill, probably the reporting order stage would not have been reached so easily be as it was. In view of all these considerations, I think it would be a proper thing for the Government to agree to the motion. In any case, I submitfchatfcheHouse is entitled to take a vote on the question whether the Bill should not be reconsidered. I defer any argument as to the necessity for the appointment of a committee until of the House has decided this motion. If the debate does take the wider range I shall have an opportunity in reply of saying to help something in regard to it.",19
43,Mr KINGST ON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," The Government do not propose to oppose the motion for the suspension of the standing orders, because they think it is an easy way of getting the opinion of the House. I point out also that it would be competent for the honourable member after we had thrashed oufc the Bill in committee, and probably upon the motion for the third reading, to move a motion to that which he now proto submifc, and, if the course were adopted, we should have lost thetimeoccupied n in the discussion of the Bill in committee. The Governmenfc will, therefore, consent to the suspension of the standing orders in that order that the motion to refer the Bill to a select committee may be moved, and to that motion we sball be happy to give our hearty Question resolved in the affirmative.",19
44,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," I m o v e That the Bill he referred to a select committee that such committee consist of the Minister for Trade and Customs, Sir Edward Braddon, Joseph Cook, Mr Winter Cooke, Mr L. E. Groom, Mr Hughes, Mr Kirwan, Mr Mauger, every stage Mr Watkins, and the mover. First of all, with regard to the composition of the proposed committee, I may say that it is afc all times a difficult thing to propose any committee of members which will be - satisfactory to the whole of the House from the variety of points of view that must necessarily be taken into consideration in re.spect to a matter such as this. I have attempted to provide that each State shall have some representation upon the committee, and I have attempted also to - fairly divide the committee in the matter - of fiscal opinion so that no undue prefer-ence shall be given to one side or the other in that regard. So far as possible, of course, I submit the names of honourable members, who from other associations have had an - opportunity of hearing or knowing a little - of the subject. I may further say that if the House chooses to adopt the coarse frequently adopted in dealing with motions of this description, the first portion of the motion may be voted upon separately, and - should it be carried the composition of the - committee can be arranged in the usual way. W it h regard to the main idea of referring the Bill to a select committee, I may in the first place point to the fact that on the last occasion when a similar proposal was made, it was confined principally to the establishment of State iron works. On this occasion I propose that the range of the committee's investigation should be very much wider. - Since that time the debate in committee on the measure has disclosed, to my mind, the necessity for further detailed .information : this has been more emphatically impressed upon honourable members at every stage of the Bill. If it is assumed that the House Or the country is justified in granting bonuses to private individuals, the amount necessary to be set aside for that object must be a matter of moment and a matter for inquiry so far as this House is concerned. To arrive at a correct conclusion in that regard it seems to me that we ought to know first the cheapness as compared with deposits in other countries, with which the iron deposits in Australia can be worked j the ampunt of capital which it will be necessary to invest in the undertaking, and the probability, or otherwise, with the assistance of a bonus, of the industry being carried on without any large amount of duty in the future. All these considerations should be taken into account before we say what bonus, if any, ought to be paid. We cannot in this matter accept ex parte statements. We bave already a number of statements from those who are promoting these companies as to the cost of installing' the necessary plant, and I must say that there is a considerable difference of opinion as to what the amount necessary will be. It is, therefore, all the more desirable that we should have evidence, so far as it is obtainable, from all sides of the question before accepting the suggestions and statements of those immediately concerned. On the strength of a statement made to me by a gentleman who should know something of the subject, I have myself put forth the statement that Â£250,000 should be quite sufficient to thoroughly test the iron deposits of Australia. But against that it is slated by the Blyth River Company that they wil 1 have to spend Â£1,000,000 before they can hope to carry the matter through success-fully. In view of the fact that all these statements are made ex parte, and without that - criticism which will be afforded by evidence on both sides of this question, it is idle for this House to say-eve n if it is granted that bonuses are desirable-ho w much per ton the bonus should be or for how many years it should be maintained. This is one view of the matter which shows the necessity for some such inquiry as I propose. Again, there is the proposition put forward by the section of the House with which I am associated with regard to the establishment of State ironworks. I know that in this connection the Sydney Morning Herald of a few days ago, referring to the motion discussed in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the other evening, stilted that I had assured the Minister for Trade and Customs that the Premier of New South Wales, Sir John See, knew nothing of the feeling of his own Legislative Assembly in this matter, and that I was able to express a more reliable opinion on this subject than himself. I need only recall to honourable members the fact that what I did say was that I did not take the assurances of Sir John See against the establishment of State ironworks as expressing the opinion of the people of New South Wales, a very distinctly different, thing from the opinion of the LegislativeAssembly in which Sir John See has the honour to lead a Ministry. This is an aspect of the matter which any such committee as I 'suggest will, if appointed, require to consider. There was a division taken the other evening in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales upon the motion dealing with this subject, and, as I anticipated, there was a. considerable majority against the proposal to establish ironworks. The Speaker usually does hot vote, but reckoning the full numbers, and counting pairs, 33 honourable members out of 125 voted for the establishment of State ironworks. I know of several instances in which the body of support for a particular proposal has at that stage been much smaller, and yet it has been carried by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament of New South Wales within a couple of years. For my part, therefore, I am quite satisfied with the amount of support such a proposal has received in the New South Wales Parliament, and I feel that there is every reason to believe that, notwithstanding result of the motion recently decided there, once the people of that State have the question thoroughly debated, they will be more than likely to return a majority to the local Parliament pledged to carry this proposition through to its conclusion. Possibly the same thing may be said for the other States, of which I am not so well able to speak. I may be considered optimistic in taking this view, but I have so frequently seen changes in the personnel of the State Legislative Assembly, under pressure from outside, that I am quite prepared to believe that if another Parliament is elected, and if , in the meantime, agitation is carried on in that State for the undertaking of this work by the Government, a majority may be found in favour of the proposal. From all these points of view I think it is necessary that a committee should be appointed to report to this House before any further action is taken in the matter. Now, as to the question of delay, some of those who opposed the proposal for a committee on the last occasion argued that its only result would be to secure the defeat of the Bill, and to indefinitely postpone the consideration of the question. But it seems to me that if a select committee is agreed to under these circumstances the members of it should take every reasonable means to arrive ab a report-I do not say a unanimous report, because I do not suppose it is likely, whatever committee is appointed, that we shall get a unanimous report upon such a debatable question as this ; but at any rate they should be able to obtain useful information for the benefit of member's of this House and of the other Chamber within a comparatively short period. have, I am sure, quite' a number of gentlemen interested in promoting these Mr Walton. projects, who will be only too. anxious, to give to such a committee every informa-tion as to - what their intentions are, and what their plans amount to. In addition, to that, I am satisfied that we can get evidence from people who are not directly interested, but who are yet qualified to speak on the subject and to offer criticism of these proposals. All this , need not take more than a few weeks, even though it should be found necessary to visit one or other of the States in order to secure evidence which may not be obtainable here.",19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"If it is to be done at all it should be done thoroughly. the Mr WATSON - I admit that ; but I say that a very large proportion of the evidence can be obtained in Melbourne, and at first hand from those directly interested. Of course there are other questions which the committee will require to consider, but in any case I at present see no reason why such a committee should not be able to report before we adjourn. So far as I am concerned, even if it were found necessary to extend the inquiry with a view fco having some decided action taken, I should still consider fchis the proper course fco adopt in view of all the circumstances. There is another matter to which, if in order, I fchink I am justified in referring. There has been a provision accepted in another measure by both Houses of the Federal Parliament that contingent upon fchis Bill going through and certain developments taking place, the Minister for Trade and Customs may by proclamation bring into existence certain duties. This has an important bearing upon other duties which are still in dispute, which in the total do not amount to a great deal, bufc which are for the benefit of those who have to use iron for their raw material. I say that the degree of difference it is necessary to maintain between any encouragement given to the producers of the raw material and that given to the producers of the manufactured article is a matter for very careful inquiry, and one upon which it seems to me it ' is necessary for honourable members of both Houses to have definite information before coming to a decision. Would it be a proper thing, from the point of view of those who are in some degree protectionists, to allow a duty of, say 10 per cent., We 'on the raw material, and a duty of 12J. per cent, or 15 per cent, only on the manufactured article? I do not want to transgress the bounds of order, but I suggest that that would be the position if the present proposals were carried out. There would be a difference of only 2Â£ per cent. Or 5 per cent, in favour of the manufacturer who would be compelled to use locally-produced iron, or import it at the slightly higher price' which must obtain for some years in the early stages of the industry. . Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - Are not duties said to make articles cheaper ?",21
46,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"I have never used that argument. In the early stages of dustry duties do undoubtedly raise prices tO industrial - almost to the extent of the duties; hut there be a largo local production and no monopolies, it is possible and probable that the articles will be as cheap as those ported from outside.",22
47,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,At the millet leuium !,22
48,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"I do not think there a millenium in regard to manufacturers any system-which more than there is in regard to importers. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Wentworth has become a manufacturer as well as an importer, and that he is ing to the ease and cheapness with which local productions can be placed on the mariron industry. ket. I do not wish to delay the House necessarily. I have submitted a few reasons why some inquiry should be made before we enter upon a vast expenditure on the part' of the Commonwealth. We are asked to vote between Â£300,000 and Â£400,000 for the encouragement of a certain dustry. The smaller States are already complaining of the dearth of revenue-o the small amount of customs and excise balance which is at present returned them. If this extra expenditure is placed on the finances of the Commonwealth, shall either bave to cut down unduly the amount which the States now receive- a reduction which, it is said, is practically impossible-o r we shall have to impose ditional taxation. That is a further why there should be an inquiry into the whole of the circumstances. I trust, thereAre fore, that the House will see the wisdom having an inquiry which will not be limited as to the aspects of the matter which - to be taken into consideration-whic h will not be constrained to consider only the question of State enterprise-bu t which will be allowed to investigates all circumsubject stances, directly or indirectly affecting handing over of such an immense sum to private individuals.",22
49,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," I think there is a desire on the part of the House generally to come to a conclusion without any unnecessary repetition of arguments which time and again have been advanced during the course of this measure. I confess that at this moment it seems to me there is even more to be said than ever before against pausing in the course we have set before us. Having, as it were, "" set our hands to the an inplough"" of encouragement, by way of bonus, enterprise, this is a time, if above all others, when we should not attempt in the slightest degree to turn back. It is highly desirable at this stage of our imdevelopment to do what we can for the purpose of fostering our own industries, and it be seen thac we are willing, not only by protective means, but by other fiscal is means, such as the adoption of a bonus has already been tried with good results in different States, though not, perhaps, to the extent here proposed-to encourage our own people to produce what pointthey require. In my opinion, nothing is more worthy of encouragement than the What does the appointment unof a select committee now mean 1 Mr WiLKS - More light.",22
50,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"More liaht ! What do we want to know in order to induce us to embark on the course proposed by the Government. First, whether we have the inmaterial ; and secondly, whether we have men capable and willing to undertake the f enterprise. As to the material, honourable members are in possession of full informato tion, and we have men able, I venture to think, of doing anything of which Britishers we are capable. What has taken place in the sister federation of Canada should dispel all thoughts of hesitation, and determine us to tread the path which tliere has been' taken adwifch such success and consequent prosreason perity. What more do we want to know of the history of Canada in this respect? we to go into the highways, and here, of there, and everywhere searching for information ? Is it not possible for members have of this House who have given considerable attention tofchesubject, from both paints of view, to sift evidence and bring ib forward 1 Hasfchafcnot been done ? Has the not been thoroughly thrashed out? theI will tell honourable members of what I am afraid'. There are those who are entirely against the encouragement by bonus of any industrial enterprise. These honourable members acknowledge that fact freely ; and all honour to them. And their honour I hope will induce them to refrain from voting for a proposition with which they do not entirely agree, simply for the sake of wrecking that to which they strongly object. On the other hand, there is a large majority of honourable members in favour of a bonus for the establishment of the iron industry. These honourable members would do anything in reason to attain that object, but they are unhappily split into twosections, oneof which strongly favours the enterprise being undertaken by the State, and the other of which is not yet driven to any such conclusion, but would, in default of the State under. taking it, prefer to see the industry started at the earliest opportunity by any persons willing to embark their capital. It is said that information is required as to whether there are people ready to take advantage of * the bonus; but is there any doubt on the subject ? We read the newspapers, and our ears are open ; aad there appears little room for doubt that if a Bill be passed somewhat on the lines suggested, there are people only too willing to invest their capita] in the industry. Why should these people not be permitted to do so ?",22
51,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Wit h our money?,23
52,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"To what extent? The amount proposed is Â£250,000.",23
53,Mr WILKS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"In order to Â£250,000 taxation to the amount of Â£1,000,000 will have to be imposed.",23
54,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"It will not be our money, but money invested here in fostering Australian enterprise, by Australian capitalists or capitalists from elsewhere, and it will bemoney spenfcwifch advantage by who have it. If I recollect rightly, the honourable member for Bland said he wanted to know what money would have to be spent, and what would be the likely profit. But the party which the honourable member leads here, and of which he is the representative in Australia-and which, I understand, is, and properly so, almost one in the variousStates-ar e haunted by no doubts as to the success of the enterprise. Last week in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, .the labour party, properly, but unsuccessfully, sought to induce the Government of that State to pledge themselves to undertake the enterprise. Does the honourable member for Bland suggest that under these circumstances the party with which he is associated have any doubt as to the success of the industry ?",23
55,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"If the industry is going; to be a success, there is no need for a bonus.",23
56,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The labour party would not ask for such a pledge from theNew - South Wales Government if they did. not believe in the success of the industry. I previously contended that New South Wales opinion is properly represented by theGovernmentof the day-that the possession of the Treasury benches is generally indicative of the power to express the popular will. I am strengthened in that opinion by the* recent division in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, where by 46 votes to 27, which represents a majority of nearly two-thirds over the lower number",23
57,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Not at all ; one-third.,23
58,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Compare d with 27, the figures 46 show a majority of 19, and. 19 is more than two-thirds of 27. Under the circumstances, am I not right in saying that the majority was more than two-thirds ?",23
59,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Does the honourable gentleman double his Customs figures in that way ?,23
60,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that I place the figures in the most attractive way from my own point of view, but, at the same time, provide I use them with absolutely mathematical precision. We have the declaration of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly that they are not ready for a State undertaking of this character. Are we to wait, or are* we to go on 1 If we could define precisely when the enterprise would be undertaken those by a State, there might be some reason for pleading for delay. But the Governments of the various States have informed us that they will not have anything to do with the matter, and we have been told that the New South Wales Government prefer theB ill as proposed. When that opinion is expressed by the only State likely to take advantage of the bonus, I appeal to honourable members, who really desire the early establishment of the industry, not to allow delay to be used for the purpose of defeat. I ask honourable members to look at the matter fairly and Squarely, and if they cometo a conclusion that the early establishment of the industry is desirable, not to play into the hands of those who do not want the industry at any time or at any price, but who will be only too ready to associate themselves with any project in order to bring about its defeat. Any possible doubt as to the attitude of New South Wales at the present moment is dispelled by the division in the - local Parliament last week. What is. the position today ? Was there ever a more favourable occasion for bringing about an early accomplishment of the scheme for establishing the industry?",23
61,Mr BATCHELOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,Yes .,24
62,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"I think not. The scheme was never nearer its accomplishment than it is today. When I last spoke, not so much had been done. The scheme proposed is double - a bonus in the first instance, and a duty after the establishment of the industry. How does the second part stand now ? The Senate has given its assent to every word of the provisions in Division VIA . of the Tariff, and it now remains for us to pass this Bill and send it on to the other Chamber, where I believe it will be accorded a hearty welcome. Contrast that for a moment with the proposal for delay to enable a search to be made after information already obtained. ""We have ransacked all possible sources of information, and what more can we learn 1 Shall we, for the purpose of investigation by a select committee, retrace our steps over all the work that has been done, and waste the time that has been devoted to the consideration oE this measure? The scheme which we propose is of such a character that it must pay. The. Commonwealth will contribute only 20 per cent, of the marketable value of the iron produced. We shall give Â£ 1 for every Â£ 5 worth of iron produced, and we shall obtain a return of five times the money we spend. Under such circumstance, how is it possible for us to gain any advantage by delay ? I ask those honourable members who really believe in the iron industry to vote for carrying still further the good work that we have partly done, and not to be led away by suggestions which would involve the loss of a golden opportunity and wreck the scheme for years and years.",24
63,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL," I think my right honourable friend is rather lacking in the sense of humour. He began by saying that it was absolutely unnecessary to go over the old ground again, and yet he has spent nearly half-an-hour in restating the principles of the measure^ If honourable members will cast their memories back to the debates which took place upon Division VIA . offcheTariff, they will come to the conclusion that either the present time is inopportune for the granting of the proposed bonuses, or that at any rate the measure requires a great deal more consideration.",24
64,Mr SAWERS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,The time will always be inopportune in the view of the honourable member and his party. *,24
65,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The question where the money is to come from must occur to all of us. Our finances are now in such a condition that the Treasurer can scarcely forecast results from month to month. We are under certain obligations to the smaller States, and this fact has been made use of by the Ministry as a political cry. Yet, notwithstanding the manifesto of the Prime Minister that we should provide for revenue without destruction, and maintain tottering industries, it is proposed to appropriate Â£250,000 for the encouragement of an industry which was not in existence at the last general election, and in connection with a scheme which, I venture to say, has never been before the people of the Commonwealth. I hope the proposal of the honourable member for Bland will be agreed to, and that the select committee will consider a great many matters connected with the scheme. 1I have listened very attentively to the special pleading of my right honourable friend, and I have noted the arguments based on the conditions of the Canadian iron industrywhich are not at all on all-fours with the proposed scheme-and also his special reference to the iron industry in the United States- a country populated by 80,000,000 of people. But I have not heard anything that will convince me that, at this stage of our national life, with a population of only 4,000,000, it would - be to our interests to spend a large amount, of publicrevenue upon the establishment of a new industry, for , which the chances of success are very doubtful, and - which if once supported by the State, especially by bonuses, would require more and more assistance until it became an absolute monopoly.' The establishment of a monopoly would mean one of two things. If theindustry were taken up by the State of New South Wales the people there would have to pay for the reduction in the price of iron, to the consumer, or the State Government would require from the Commonwealth larger and larger import duties until the imposts became absolutely prohibitive. In view of the interests of the manufacturers, themselves-whic h the protectionists are supposed to conserve-and bearing in mind that iron enters largely into almost every one of our important manufacturing concerns, this is not the time afc which we should contemplate an increase in the price of the raw material. On' several occasions we have lacked information such as could be obtained only by means of exhaustive inquiry, and this is a matter upon which - puttin g aside my fiscal faith, because I do not believe in bonuses of any kind-w e should be placed in a position of much greater advantage if a patient investigation were made by a committee of this House. Why should we rush matters in connection with this industry? We are half way through this Parliament, and the proposed industry cannot be placed upon its feet until the next Parliament is elected. Why should we commit our successors to such an enormous expenditure as that contemplated ? I consider that some time might well be spent in investigation, and that theMinistry-afte r the tedious debates which have dragged through weeks, and - which have shown that there is no determinate opinion one way or another-ough t to be glad of an investigation that would throw some distinctive light on the question. Although I am opposed to bonuses, I recognise that a majority of honourable members are in favour of the bonus system under certain conditions, and I sball therefore vote for the appointment of a select committee, which will at any rate place in our hands an authoritative statement as to the actual position of affairs.",24
66,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Northern Melbourne) The honourable member for Wentworth was right in spying that a majority of honourable members are in favour of the granting of bonuses under proper conditions. At the same time it is curious that the majority should not bave their own way. As a matter of fact, the triangular duel which has been proceeding is being made use of by the minority to impose their will upon the House. A majority of honourable members are in favour of the granting of bonuses subject to proper precautions, but that majority have unfortunately, allowed themselves to be split into two divisions,'one of which insists that the bonus shall not be granted, except upon certain conditions. W it h all respect to the honourable member for Bland, I think that he and those associated with him are making a great mistake in their own interests. The honourable member has led his party with great ability and industry, and has paid great attention to the debates in Parliament, but I cannot help thinking that he has been ill advised in this matter.",25
67,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"We always think that about "" the other fellow's "" opinion.",25
68,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"That may be, bufc I am saying whafc I really think. I take it that the motion for the appointment of a select committee is intended to shelve the Bill, and I think it would be better for the honourable member for Bland to frankly say so. This session of Parliament is nearly at an end, and if the motion is carried providing for an inquiry with a wide scope such as the honourable member has suggested, the Bill will be shunted for this session, and we. shall not know when the next session will begin.",25
69,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,That will be the fault of the Government.,25
70,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The honourable member said that he desired that the committee should enquire, not only intofcheimmediate details of the proposed scheme for the granting of bonuses, but into the whole of the circumstances of the iron industry.",25
71,Mr WILKS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,That is the only way in which a proper investigation can take place.,25
72,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"I contend thab we have a commibtee in the responsible Government which alone can give the bonuses. I feel that it would be of the greatest advantage to us if we could secure the establishment of the iron industry at a time like the present when industries are sadly needed. The primary producers have, to a large extent, failed us, and there are hundreds and thousands of men who are anxious for work, and who cannot secure it , and if there ever was a time at which it was important to develop new industries it is at present. It is not in times of stint that we should close up our purse; at such times,. we should open it as far as we can. l t is true that this expenditure will fall upon all the States in proportion to population, and that some of them may find it hard to pay their way. I recognise that Â£250,000 is a large sum. .",25
73,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"That refers to only the iron industry; the total expenditure will be more tban that-it will be Â£300,000.",26
74,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"That is not so, but it is a very unimportant detail. The extraordinary position is that whilst the principal expenditure in connection with this scheme will probably take place in New South Wales, the representatives of that State are most keenly opposing it .",26
75,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,That shows our honesty.,26
76,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Victori a has nothing to gain directly from this scheme, and yet I feel that it is regarded by some of my honourable friends on the Opposition side as a sinister deep-laid plot for the purpose of securing wealthfcoVictoria.",26
77,Mr WILKS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,I never gave the suggestion a thought.,26
78,Mr HIGGINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"The honourable member for Wentworth also spoke of the money that would be taken oufc of the pockets of the taxpayers of New South Wales, but I would point out that the amount spent; in chase. connection with the proposed scheme would be new expenditure, which would have to be borne by all the States upon, a population basis, and that Victoria would therenot fore have to contribute one-third of the whole amount. We are anxious to an opportunity for the establishment of the iron industry. We draw no lines between Australians. We feel that it will be but good for Australiafcobave the iron industry established, because our people move about from place to place in search of work. The iron industry is an industry of industries, and is not to be compared with any other. .We cannot foretell the number of industries that it will bring in its train, if it is well established. Free-trade and protection have nothing to do with this proposal, because the best of free-traders are advocates of the bonus system. This is not a question of imposing protectionist duties, but of! granting bonuses, and the best men of the Cobdenite school are strongly in favour bonuses.",26
79,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DRILL,"Doe sfchehonordeveloped, able and learned member wish the represenever, tatives of New South Wales to depart from their principles, because their State will benefit under the scheme proposed ? - M.r. HIGGINS - No ; the honourable member said that he was opposed to the granting of bonuses, and I think that his stiff, starched, and pedantic attitude on NA question is to be deplored. AVe cannofc be guided solely by theory in these matters. Ib should be remembered that in a new country we have to deal with new conditions. Albhough I should prefer bo see the iron industry controlled by the States, and although I vobed in favour of giving bhem the exclusive righb for one or bwo years to embark upon the enterprise, I feel that we cannot expect them within that period to nationalize the undertaking. Bather than that the industry should not be established, I favour encouraging private individuals to engage in it . At the same time, I think that Parliament should insist that any company or syndicate which may be induced by the payment of a bonus to enter upon the work of iron production should pledge itself bo sell ibs undertaking to the State in which its operations are being conducted, upon a valuation, after the lapse of a reasonable-period.",26
80,Mr KINGSTON,U II,The Government would be willing to agree to a fair righb of pur,26
81,Mr WATSON,U II,The representative of one company told me that that company would agree to any provision being made in regard to resumption unless at the expiraafford tion of a very long period.,26
82,Mr HIGGINS,U II,"I bhink I can undersband any company making that statement; when it comes bo a choice bebween being granbed a bonus and being denied it , the company will very quickly change their tune. If the Bill be passed, the money for the paymenb of the bonus will belong bo the baxpayers, and bherefore ib would be only fair bo insist that, if the people of the State once in which the industry is established wish to carry on the undertaking they should be allowed the opportunity to do so. I regret that a sort of "" dog-in-the-manger "" attitude is shown by the House atfchepresenb bime. I do not think that the Minisber will carry bhis measure unless bhere is a considerable of change of fronb on the parb of bhose who are. anxious fco see the iron industry even afc some libble cosb. HowI shall assist him as far as I possibly can. I feel, however, that a great mistake is being made by a section of this House. Having regard tofchevote which was taken in the New South Wales Parliament the other night, it is utterly absurd to expect that State to nationalize the work of the this production of iron. After all there is a good deal to be said in favour of allowing private individuals to experiment with a new industry at their own expense, instead of at the expense of the Commonwealth. This is a very different case from that of the railways. Supplies of iron can be obtained from abroad, where the industry is controlled by trusts, but no syndicate or trust can run the Australian railways in parts outside Australia, and therefore it is safe to assume that they will be carried on by the States Governments. But, considering the huge industrial movements which have their centre at the present time in America, it by no means follows that the States will be able to supply iron and steel in sufficient quantities to satisfy the wants of our railways and our people. Our efforts in regard to iron production would be very puny as compared with those of the great iron industries abroad. But we can render this industry very valuable service here. If private individuals, with the aid of a Government bonus, are prepared to risk their money in the enterprise, either at this or any other time, I am willing to give them the opportunity of doing so. Of course, it must be clearly understood that the States can always ask for a bonus if they desire it , and I am quite sure that the Government would give them a preferential claim. But I think honourable members ought to recollect that it is a distinct advantage to Australia to have people who are prepared to risk their money, time, and labour in a novel industry of this sort. An y bonus in which they may participate will be really a small thing as compared with the good results to the Commonwealth. In the event of the Bill being carried, stringent regulations could be imposed by the Government, and I am quite sure that in framing those regulations, which have to be submitted to Parliament, we may trust the Government to protect the interests of the inhabitants of Australia.",26

85,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,Probably ; I hope they will deserve it still more. The able and learned member has' said that whether there is a majority of this House in favour of the bonus system.,27
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,A section of the House is bringing the whole thing into contempt.,27

91,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"The honourable member knew quite well the way in which he was going to vote before I opened my mouth. He understands full well what my attitude is upon this measure. I fought it from its introduction, and as I cannot prevent it from passing, I intend to fight for, delay. But, apart from that consideration, I support the motion in .favour of the measure being referred to a select committee in order that the full facts may be placed before the public. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne declared that there is a majority in favour of the bonuses. On the other hand, I am quite satisfied that a majority of honourable members are opposed to this Bill. It is only owing to the persistent whipping on the part of the Government that it has had such a long life.",27
92,Mr HIGGINS,U II,"The leader of the Opposition, admits that tliere is a majority in favour of the bonus system.",27
93,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"I think that the leader of the Opposition is in error. To my mind, the honourable member for Bland has made out a very strong case indeed in favour of delaying the passing of this Bill t i ll the matter has been thoroughly investigated. What is known in connection with the proposal ? We are told that certain individuals are prepared to embark upon the iron industry. On the one hand we are assured that to do so will' require the expenditure of Â£1,000,000, whilst on the other we are told by experts that the cost do of setting up an efficient plant would be",27
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,"About Â£900,000.",27
95,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"In the Minister for Home Affairs we apparently have still 1 another expert. Surely honourable memhonorbers ought to be given some idea"" of the cost of establishing the iron industry is likely to be Â£600,000, Â£900,000, or Â£l"",000,000. . .",27
96,Mr WATSON,U II,"The total nominal capital of the new company which was floated in England to take over Mr Saudford's works at Lithgow was Â£750,000.",28
97,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"In view of the - conflicting nature of the evidence before us, surely it is not too much to ask that the House should be placed in possession of definite information as fco the real cost involved in the establishment of these works, so that we may know whether or not it is necessary to spend Â£250,000 to aid in its accomplishment. difference of 40 per cent, between the estimates which have been submitted.",28
98,Mr KINGSTON,U II,Eor every penny expended should we not obtain a return of five times the amount ?,28
99,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"If that be so, there is no necessity whatever to sanction the payment of a bonus in order to encourage private enterprise to undertake the work. The field is absolutely open. While we have been discussing this matter, private individuals, had they so desired, could have established iron works in our midst. I protest against the money of the Commonwealth being handed over to assist a number of individuals to establish monopolies. That is the sole ground of my objection to this measure. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne expressed surprise at the action of the honourable member for Bland who, he said, was making a great mistake from the point of view of the interests of the party with which he is associated. But if the labour party was created for any special reason, it was to prevent the establishment of monopolies.",28
100,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,U II,Is not a union one of the biggest monopolies we can have ?,28
101,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"Certainly not, every man is eligible to join it .",28
102,Mr WATSON,U II,We will admit the honourable member if he. chooses.,28
103,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"On e of the chief reasons for the existence of the labour party is the necessity which exists for fighting against monopolies. Consequently, there is nothing inconsistent in the action of its members in refusing to lend themselves to a proposal to vote away the people's money in order fco firmly establish a monopoly in . Australia, and probably to band over to it . not only the production and supply of iron, but ultimately the control of our railways. 44 i i z . Thafc is too big a contractfcoask the labour party to endorse.",28
104,Mr HIGGINS,U II,"There are several mem bers of the labour party who oppose the honourable member's view uponfchismatter. Mr BATCHELOR : - I am simply expressing my own view of the case. Certainly, the bulk of the people of the State to which I belong are with the labour party in this connection. One very important point has been referred to by the acting leader of the Opposition, although, of There is a course, it may not appeal so strongly to other honourable members. I refer to the question of the condition of our finances. From where is the Â£300,000 which it is. proposed to expend by way of bonusfcocome? Ifc is to be taken from the whole of the Commonwealth, and given to a number of speculators. South Australia's proportion of that amount would be about Â£ 3 0 , 0 0 0; whilst Queensland's contribution would be Â£50,000.",28
105,Mr KEXXEDT,U II,The proposed expenditure is to be extended over three vears.,28
106,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,Yes .,28
107,Mr KINGSTON,U II,What is the difference between an enterprising man and a speculator ?,28
108,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"This is not the place for conundrums. Private enterprise often builds up monopolies, to which I am certainly opposed. Apart from the financial question, which, as the Minister knows, is of serious importance to the State of South Australia, I would point out that if the second part of the Minister's proposals is carried into effect, and an import duty of 10 per cent, is placed upon pig-iron, the manufacture of machinery, and of iron and steel implements in Australia will be ruined. . The import duty upon manufactures of iron will probably be 15 or 12^ per cent., but an import duty of 10 per cent, upon pig-iron would reduce the protection of local manufacturers to 5 or 24j per cent., which would be a ridiculous margin. There is another mafcter which should be inquired into. The Minister did not propose the payment of butter bonuses in South Australia until a select committee had i nquired intofcheadvisability of doing such a thing. We have been told that there is room in Australia for several establishments for the making of iron and steel, and fchafc, therefore, the granting of these bonuses cannot lead to the creation of a monopoly. In my opinion.that statement is incorrect;, but the matter forms another subject for an inquiry. Why should this Parliament, in its first session, commit itself to the expenditure of Â£300,000 of the people's money, when we cannot find time to deal with Bills and other legislation which is urgently needed 1",28
109,Mr HIGGINS,U II,Parliamen t will commit itself to the expenditure of only so much as the Government may think fit to authorize.,29
110,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,Is it to be thought that the Minister will not see fit to sanction the - expenditure of the whole amount ? Once we pass the Billthe matter will be taken out of our hands.,29
111,Mr HIGGINS,U II,The regulations which must be framed to carry out the intentions of the Bill will have to be laid before Parliament for approval.,29
112,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"I regard that as quibble. Does any one believe that any harm can result from the postponement of the consideration of this matter for perhaps twelve months, so as to permit of an inquiry being made into the whole subject ? There are many important questions connected with it , upon which the House today has no information, and upon which it should be informed before authorizing the proposed expenditure.",29
113,Mr WILKS,U II," The Government allowed the standing orders to be suspended so that this motion for the appointment of a committee might be moved, as though they intended to agree fco the appointment of the committee; but now they are objecting to its appointment. The only new reason that the Minister gave for his present attitju.de is that he has discovered with deep regret that the Parliament of New South Wales has refused to agree to a proposal for the establishment of State ironworks. I think that I shall save the time of the House if I direct my remarks principally to that argument. The Parliament of New South Wales certainly vetoed the proposal to establish State ironworks, but I may inform the Minister that they would with equal directness have vetoed this Bonus Bill. The New South Wales Opposition, which numbers about 35 members, gave its support, with one or two exceptions, to the Ministry to defeat the labour party on the proposal to establish State ironworks, but as free-traders they are opposed to a bonus system of any kind at all.",29
114,Mr SAWERS,U II,But the New South Wales Ministry are in favour of bonuses.,29
115,Mr WILKS,U II,"Yes , because they are protectionists. They are the unused wing of the protectionist party here. The people of New South Wales, however, as represented machinery by their Parliament, are opposed to the bonus system. The Minister would have us believe that they are opposed to the adoption of State ironworks, but have signified their willingness to accept the Bill as it now stands. The honourable and learned mamber for Northern Melbourne, who spoke as an Australian, with a capital A , said that he approached the consideration of the question from the Australian stand-point, and asked us, in the interests of Australia, to pass the Bill. As an Australian, and in the interests of the people of Australia, I am opposed to the Bill. No doubt, the honourable and learned member, from his training and a associations, is disposed to look with favourable eyes upon judicial bodies, and what I ask is that a select committee may - be appointed as a judicial body to decide between the conflicting statements which we have heard from honest men on both sides of the Chamber in regard to the matter now under consideration. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has spoken about the "" dog in the manger "" policy of those who refuse to vote for the Bill, but, if I may be permitted to use a similar metaphor, I would refer to the policy which he advocates as a "" pig in the poke"" policy. AVe, as the representatives of the people of Australia, cannot be expected to vote for this Bill without further information. I wish for the appointment of a select committee, not to settle the Bill, but to settle the vexed questions which its consideration has raised. I should like to know a little more about the stringent regulations to which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has referred. Are they provided for by the Bill ? That is another reason why this judicial committee composed of honourable members selected from all sides of the Chamber, and representing all fiscal views- a purely Australian body in its personnel-shoul d be appointed. What more could the honourable and learned member require than an Australian select committee to inquire into this great Australian question ? It takes a good deal to annoy me, but when the honourable and learned member appealed to the representatives of New South Wales and, as a representative of Victoria, asked- "" What have we to gain 1 AVe are simply bursting with a desire to assist New South Wales. We are consumed with an anxiety to carry this Bil l so that the people of New South Wales may have a noble and powerful industry established in their midst,"" I marvelled attheexhibitionof this new concern for the interests of that State. I wish that the honourable and learned member had shown the same degree of concern for the interests of New South Wales a few days ago when the question of the suspension of the fodder duties was raised. A m I to be blamed if I look askance at his appeal 1 But supposing that it is made in the interests of New South Wales, I , as an Australian, have to say that New South Wales does not require patronage at all-does-nof c ask forfcheassistance of Australia at the expense of the Australian people to build up any of her industries. Why should these honourable members be so concerned for her interests today ? The honourable member for Bland believes in a' State-owned iron industry, and the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, said with marked emphasis - and the Minister for Trade and Customs did not deny it-that the bulk of the people of his State were at the back of the proposal he believes in. The Minister, a representative of that State, by his silence, practically affirmed that idea. The honourable member for Bland made a very strong case when he said that in New South AAales 7 the people had not considered the question of a State-owned iron industry, that the vote in the Legislative Assembly was practically a catch vote, and that the supporters of the principle had done very well in their first effort. AVithout committing myself to the idea of a State-owned iron industry, I submit that a proposal of this character could not have been made at a more inopportune time, in the affairs of New South Wales, because they are tired with regard to the management of certain State industrie,s, and are afraid of proceeding further, and involving themselves in a larger expenditure. I do not understand the finances of this question. Both in this debate and in previous ones, it has been said that it involves an expenditure of sums ranging from Â£250,000 to Â£350,000. Ifc has been stated, too, that four times thab amount of money will have to be collected from the people of Australia before the required bonus can be obbained. When I , who closely follow the proceedings of Parliament, .do not clearly understand the position, I am satisfied that thousands of persons in Australia, who may like to see the iron industry established, are not aware of how much money is required to insure its establishment. For that reason, what better body could we have than an Australian select commibtee bo seek for full information ? The appointment of a judicial body of thab kind is an admirable idea. Probably, except in the case of those whose free trade views are very strong, the information it would collect would set at rest all doubts. The Minister for Trade and Customs, who is genei-ally prebby calm and judicious, is allowing his enthusiasm bo carry him away in bhis mabber. I refuse bo be carried away by his enbhusiasm. He possesses a mosfc magnetic power, and it is with the greabesb difficulby that I am opposing him. His enbhusiasm is nob a sufficient justification for the House bo hastily sanction the expendibure of Â£350,000. That is a very good reason for appointing a select committee which could seek for reliable information from all quarters. I have read in the press that certain persons are bursting with a desire to establish industries foithe benefit of Australiapure philanthropists, who have no idea of seeking for profit or gain. Everybody has his own peculiarity, but their peculiarity is to place in some part of the Commonwealth an industry involving the expenditure of, as they sa)', Â£900,000, so that the people of Australia shall benefit by its operations. If that is so, sir, you can hardly wonder at my doubting the statement. I am fairly gullible, but when I read the statement. I doubted it. A select committee could prove its accuracy or otherwise. If there are gentlemen with large national characteristics desirous of establishing industries purely for the gain of Australia, I should like a select committee to be appointed to thrash out the question. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne thought it was oubrageous for a free-trader to oppose a bonus. While I may not be the "" real Mack-.iy,"" so far as economic principles are concerned, I should like to know how he stands in regard to bonuses all round. If it is good enough for the iron indusbryour very own industry, as the Minister said - to receive a bonus at the expense of the great Australian public, is the honourable and learned member prepared to give a bonus for shipbuildingto a portion of the Commonwealth in which I live, and which bas to use iron'in the construction of ships ? I wish to know whether a select committee could obtain information on the point ? We can never estimate how much information the members of a select committee can collect. If you, sir, refer to the names'of the proposed select committee, you will not discover the name of one honourable member who is not most industrious in political life, or who is likely to be caught by chaff. It is proposedfchati t be constituted of phlegmatic, judicial characters. Surely the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is not going to insult those honourable members whom the honourable member for Bland would not think of nominating without their consent? Apparently, they all think that it is right to appoint a select committee. Is the honourable and learned member, with others, prepared to give a most violent slap in the face to honourable members who are willing to sacrifice their fcime in the public interest, and to undertake a mosfc arduous political work which meets with little publicity? Surely the Minister is not prepared to slap in the face some of his most ardent supporters when they are anxious to ascertain the rights and wrongs of fchis question ? Is he a very good judge of character ? I am told that he is. Therefore, I ask him, in the most abject manner, is he prepared to leave me in this quandary-that I shall have to vote against the Bill, because I require further information than he has given ?",29
116,Mr KINGSTON,U II,"If I am a judge of character, the honourable member will.",31
117,Mr WILKS,U II,"The Minister is very flippant. Thafc is exactly how he is with the Bill. He says fco the House- "" Vote this sum of Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0; never mind about the raising of Â£1,200,000. It will be a success."" We hope that it will be a success, bufc we prefer to adopt Scotch caution and to obtain more information, so that Australia may' not be placed in a more awkward situation, and her people may not be at a loss. I appeal to the Minister, and all those who believe in the bonus system. If their belief in its efficacy to establish, industries for the benefit of Australia is so great as they represent, surely fchey are not afraid of going before a select committee of the House? If they are afraid of going before a select committee, then it is an admission that the bonus system is very weak, and that they are going to trust to time and chance to put the industry in a healthy condition, and the demands which may be made upon it in the future to strengthen what would otherwise be a most weak concern. If they do believe in the efficacy of the system, why are they now fighting here and trying to obtain a catch vote, which probably another place may not respect as they ought to do ? It is a question of hastening slowly. There is no killing of the measure involved. If the select committee came back fco the House armed at all points with information as to finances, stringent regulations, power of resumption, and all the other matters which have been mentioned in debate, then I could readily understand that .many objections could not be raised to the Bill. I have not heard any reason to induce me to remove my opposition to a Bonus Bill. I trust that the Minister will not resist the motion. If his idea is to continue to resist the proposal, then he should have opposed the suspension of the standing orders. I again ask the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, has he so little faith in the efficacy of the bonus system that he is unprepared to give a select committee the benefit of his calm, deliberate judgment? I fchink that this great Australia has much fco gain from the exercise of that judgment. I should like to see the calm, deliberate judgment of the advocates of the bonus system placed before a select committee, clothed with power to make a searching investigation. If there is anything in the system fchey will come out of the inquiry triumphantly. I am not afraid of a select committee. I believe that the members of it can obtain information which will guide not only the Commonwealth Parliament, but the Parliaments of the different States; and that ib will be shown that at the present day, and for some years to come, the iron industry in Australia cannot be made a payable one. I believe that, in that way, the people of this Commonwealth maybe saved the expense of a very costly experiment. It is not a question of Â£250,000, or even Â£1,000,000, because once the industry is started, it must be continued. Under all the circumstances, I plead wibh the Minisber for Trade and Cusboms bhat, in the interests of the Commonwealth, he should not take action which wil l burden the people with more taxation, and that he should allow this select committee to be appointed in order thab, irrespective of parby. considerations, we may know really how the question stands.",31
118,Mr KENNEDY,U II," It was hardly necessary for the honourable member for Dalley to take up time in supporting the proposal for a select committee, when he has told us that, no matter what the finding of the committee may be, he will be against a Bonus Bill.",32
119,Mr WILKS,U II,I did not say anything of the sort; I would not be so foolish.,32
120,Mr KENNEDY,U II,The honourable member stated distinctly that be was opposed to a Bonus Bill. .,32
121,Mr WILKS,U II,"At the present time, without further information.",32
122,Mr KENNEDY,U II,"Then the honourable member says that he will support this proposal for referring the Bill to a select committee, which is to make investigation.",32
123,Mr WILKS,U II,In order to get more light upon the subject.,32
124,Mr KENNEDY,U II,"The acting leader of the Opposition accused the Minister for Trade and Customs of a lack of humour in taking so short a space of time to review the salient arguments as to the necessity for a bonus in order to secure the establishment of this industry. He also told us that he was opposed to the Bonus Bill, and would support an inquiry by a select committee.",32
125,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,U II,F o r the benefit of honourable members opposite. The ignorance displayed during the debate is so great that I think honourable members require further information.,32
126,Mr KENNEDY,U II,"We have the honourable member for Bland, and the honourable member for South Australia now proposing most strenuously the appointment of a select committee, though within the last two months they were prepared to vote the money embodied in the Bonus Bill without any question whatever, provided that the States undertook the development of the industry. They had ample information; they had no doubt as to the deposits being valuable; no doubt as to the skill and knowledge of the people, and, no doubt, that some of the States could find the capital necessary to successfully establish the industry. But being defeated for the time upon that score, when the Government now propose that private capitalists may embark in the enterprise, and may take advantage of the bonuses proposed under this Bill, those honourable members press most strenuously for information that apparently they did not at sill require under whafc were exactly similar circumstances only a little while ago.",32
127,Mr FOWLER,U II,Because the State would make an inquiry before taking up the industry.,32
128,Mr KENNEDY,U II,Is it likely that we are going to take any further risks in paying this money to private capitalists rather than to a .State ? Is it likely that one shilling of the bonuses proposed is going to be paid to private capitalists unless the material for which the bonuses given is produced ?,32
129,Mr FOWLER,U II,"There is still an important distinction. - Mr KENNEDY - I should likefcoknow what it is. Surely, none of us is guileless enough to believe that capitalists, any more than a State, are philanthropists, pure and simple; and that they will venture their money for the benefit of the whole community, and without hope of return. Their first object will be to secure a return upon their investments. We know that the results to labour and industry will be practically the same, from whatever source the capital is derived. Surely, no honourable member will for a moment admit that the fear of a monopoly by private enterprise is - the governing consideration, deterring him, at the present time, from supporting this Bill ? Surely, Parliament will be a suihcient guarantee as between the citizens of Australia and the possibility of a monopoly by any private enterprise. We read from time to time, and have some knowledge of the condition, of trusts in other lands ; but we know that they are not altogether an unmixed evil j there are some good, as well as some evil results accruing from their operation, and in a self-governing community such as we have here, where we have the control of such operations in our own hands, are we going to be deterred from wealth production because of the fear of a monopoly being created in connection with this industry? Honourable members must not lose sight of the fact that we have only a section of the British navy standing between Australia and the destruction of her national interests today. If from any cause, which it is not difficult to imagine, the supply of iron and steel for manufactures in Australia were cut off, what would be our position ? We should not bave sufficient metal to manufacture a gun or a rifle for our own requirements.",32
130,Mr THOMAS,U II,Is not that a strong argument for a State undertaking the enterprise and not leaving it to private enterprise 1,33
131,Mr KENNEDY,U II,"That is not the quesin tion now. The object now is to get the industry established, and the information we have to date is that the States will not undertake the enterprise.",33
132,Mr THOMAS,U II,Ough t not the States to be compelled to do so under the circumstances ?,33
133,Mr KENNEDY,U II,"It is a peculiar thing that the all powerful State of New South Wales, in which there are large iron deposits, has not developed the industry. The three chief reasons given by the mover of this motion for referring the Bill to a select committee at the present time were the cost of working the deposits, the amount of capital required for the development of the industry, and the possibility of its development by a bonus without the necessity for a high duty. As to the first point, surely no honourable member who was privileged to listen to the address of the honourable member for Parramatta on the second reading of the Bill can overlook the fund of information which he gave to the House with regardfcothe deposits available, and the esbimated cosfc of working them given by reliable authorities? Then as to the amount of capital required, we have information from different sources, and the total capital involved appears to be entirely a question as to the quantity proposed fco be produced by the different companies supplying estimates. The honourable member for South Australia laid great stress upon the point that we can establish the industry without any bonus at all, and that there is a possibility of its being established merely by the imposition of a slight duty. The difficulty of dealing with the matter from that standpoint is that we all know that by the imposition of a duty at the outset, before the production of iron is established here, the cosb of the raw maberial bo the users of iron and sbeel will be ab once increased. That is a difficulty the Government and the communiby generally are interested in avoiding, by giving a bonus upon the material produced until such bime as iron and steel are produced in quanbibies approximating closely bo the amount required forfcheCommonwealth. Personally, I regret to see the small trivia] differences that divide those who are earnest in their desire to see this industry established. The difference of opinion simply amounts to this : that there is a section of honourable members who are very desirous that the Stabes should embark the enterprise. Personally, I have no objection whatever bo that. I should be very glad indeed to see the States embark in this enterprise. But failing that, no action of mine will be taken to prevent private enterprise being .allowed to develop this industry, because seeing thab we have the raw maberial available, I look upon it as one of the most important and beneficent industries that could be established for the welfare of the community. I am prepared to support fchis. Bill without any further enquiry whatever.",33
134,Mr RONALD,U II,"Southern Melbourne) Having to vote in this instance contrary to the party with which I generally vote, I must explain why I do so, and my explanation shall be brief. I believe in the bonus system, and so long as it appeared possible to secure that this industry should become a State monopoly, I worked in that direction. I was inclined to support this motion for a select committee so long as I believed that it was soughtfcobe appointed in fcbeinteresbs of the bonus system, and in the interest of the industry being undertaken by the State. But the mover of the motion confesses that he believes in bonuses, and that this committee is simply a proposal to find out what is the best means of getting the greatest amount of good out of the bonus system.",33
135,Mr WATSON,U II,I did not say that I believed in bonuses ; not afc all.,33
136,Mr RONALD,U II,"I understood the honourable member in his speech today to say fchafc he proposed the committee in the interests of the bonus system. If I remember aright, there was first an effort made to give the States a monopoly of the industry ; then an effort was made to give the States a monopoly of the industry for two years, and then an effort was made to give the States a monopoly of the industry for one year. Finally, in order to put the matter into the hands of the Sbabe, as I undersbood it, bhis select committee was to make enquiries as to what it would cost, and as bo howa Sbate could raise the money necessary to starb ironworks. So long as the final objecb and aim in view is bo carry oub the development of the iron industry, whether by a Sbabe or by an individual, by the assisbance of bonuses, I have been in favour of the line of action proposed. Bub when we have it avowed that this select committee is to be appointed to stifle and destroy the bonus system altogether, I say that I am against its appointment. - Mr FOWLER - Then the honourable member has not much faith in an enquiry.",33
137,Mr RONALD,U II,"So long as it is an honest, bona fide enquiry into facts that will help us to get the greatest amount of good out of the bonus system, I am for it, but when it is proposed as an inquiry into everything that will tend to destroy the bonus system, and is confessedly proposed for the purpose of delaying and destroyingfcheBonus Bill, I think I am justified in opposing it . I am against all kinds of hypocrisy.",34
138,Mr OMALLEY,U II,Is the honourable member the only pure man in the labour party ?,34
139,Mr RONALD,U II,I speak only for myself.,34
140,Mr OMALLEY,U II,Then the member ought to leave the party. We do not want a saint.,34
141,Mr RONALD,U II,"I was explaining that I am against the proposed committee of inquiry, because it turns out to be a committee of destruction. Its avowed purpose is to k ill the Bill. Honourable members have said that they desire only delay, but delays are dangerous, proverbially, and in this case delay will be very dangerous. The honourable member for South Australia asked where would be the danger and evil of delay in this case 1 Ifc lies in the fact that afc the present time we have hundreds and thousands of unemployed with whom we do not know what to do. Meanwhile there are a great many works which are depending upon the iron industry, and I sayfchafcat the present time, when we have the assurance of the Governmenfc fchafc capital is ready to be launched in fchis great venture, it is criminal and sinful for us to stand in the way, in view of the present state of affairs in the industrial world. I am honestly and earnestly in favour of going on with the work without a moment's delay; and, therefore, I am against the appointment of a select committee. I do not believe in needless delay or in subterfuges. So long as there was an honest effort in the direction of a State monopoly, I was in favour of it ; but I am against any subterfuge which has for its object the killing of the Bill. The bonus offer has been unfairly stated over and over again this afternoon. It has been stated that the proposal is to here and now vote away Â£250,000 or Â£300,000 of the public money. The fact has been obscured and hidden that payment is by results, and that not one penny of the taxpayers' money is compromised. The terms are-n o iron, no bonus; and if we are to get our money's worth from the raw material brought from the bowels of the earth, we are, by opposing the Bill, standing in the way of the development of a native industry. It has been asked where the money is to come from with which to pay the bonus. But how much would it require to meetfcheinitial expenses of a State monopoly. I favour a State monopoly, but I see no chance of that until we have money of our ownfcoembark in the industry. Under the present circumstances, State monopoly would simply mean a monopoly of financiers in London, seeing that we should have to borrow the money in order honourable to undertake the enterprise. That would be simply handing the industry over to capitalists in London, and leaving us as far as ever from State monopoly. If a select committee be appointed, will it make inquiries, and set, side by side, the expense of initiating a State monopoly, and the expense of giving bonuses to private individuals? If that were done, I believe it would be found that the initial expense of making a State monopoly would be infinitely greater than that of a bonus system which, from beginning to end, safe-guards the people's money by the principle of payment by results. I regard the bonus principle as the supplement or complement of the protectionist principle, of which I am .an avowed advocate. On the hustings. I told the electors that the two went hand in hand, and I am only carrying oufc my pledges to my constituents, who are largely interested in the iron industry, when I endeavour fco expedite the establishment of the bonus system by every possible means. The iron industry is the parent of a hundred and one other industries, and I shall do everything in my power to prevent one moment's delay in the realization of a proposal which will be a f r u it f u l source of development throughout Australia.",34
142,Mr OMALLEY,U II," As a member of the labour party, I deem it my duty to protest against the charges which we have just heard made by a member of that party.",34
143,Mr RONALD,U II,"I have made no charges. Mr O' MALLEY - It is a sad case, if out of the 24 members of the labour party, there is only one angelic saint.'",34
144,The SPEAKER,U II,The question which we are discussing is the appointment of the select committee to inquire into the bonus system.,35
145,Mr OMALLEY,U II,"That is so; but an aspersion has been cast on the labour party. The honoured leader of that party has submitted a motion which has for its object the acquisition of knowledge on the subject now before us. Without inquiry we should be darting ""oufc in the blind."" Like men drawing certain deductions from certain inferences, we should never be certain as to the result. A select committee is quired in. order to hear evidence from men who are thoroughly proficient in the iron business. By some people we are told that the establishment of the industry will mean the expenditure of Â£1,000,000, and by others we are toldfchafcfchecosfc will be less ; and inquiry is needed to clear up this aud other points. Are we to allow a few private syndicators to use this bonus for the purpose of floating, in London, companies which it is admitted they cannot float now ? The Hebrew children of London will not take on the speculation unless Â£250,000 is granted by this Parliament. I have offered to erect the works for Â£250,000, and I am so confident that I now repeat the offer. The proposal is to have a select mittee composed of members, half of whom are from each side of the House. There are gentlemen living in the Commonwealth able to come before the committee, and, by their evidence, pufc us in possession of knowledge which we require. The honourable member. for Southern Melbourne declared that he opposes a select committee, because the proposal looks like a conspiracy to defeat the investment of private capital. That honourable member charges the labour party with being conspirators; and I object to any honourable member, however humble in morality or intellectuality, being so charged by a man who is over-loaded with morality.",35
146,The SPEAKER,U II,"The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, must confine himself to the question before the House.",35
147,Mr RONALD,U II,I made no charge.,35
148,Mr OMALLEY,U II,"The honourable member for Southern Melbourne declared that he would have voted for the appointment of a select committee, but for his belief that a committee meant a conspiracy to prevent iron works being established.",35
149,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,U II,The honourable member for Southern Melbourne states the truth.,35
150,Mr OMALLEY,U II,I should like to know where the honourable member for Melbourne obtains his knowledge.,35
151,Mr RONALD,U II,The fact is avowed here.,35
152,Mr OMALLEY,U II,"Where is the evidence? It may be rumoured that the honourable member for Southern Melbournewill turn a somersault tomorrow, but there is no certainty on the point. No honourable member should make charges which he is re- not prepared to support. The honourable member for Melbourne stands as the very essence of dignity and honour, and is always upbraiding honourable members for making charges of the kind to which I now object. The honourable member asserts that there is a conspiracy; but I deny the statement, and contend that there is not an honourable member who would be guilty of such an offence. We hold that this is a matter which goes beyond private enterprise. The railways of the country are owned by the people, and iron works also ought to be owned by the people. Had I dreamt for one moment that this industry would get into the hands of a private syndicate-int o the hands of Goulds, Vanderbilts, and com- Astors- I should certainly have voted against a duty of 15 per cent, on raw iron. It is proposed to tax the people of the country to the extent of Â£250,000 in order to enable a private syndicate to erect works. Then it is proposed to give a monopoly, and compel every man interested in primary production to contribute towards enriching a few syndicators. If ever Australia were at war, we should, under the proposals of the Governmenfc, have fco go on our knees fco these monopolists, as America had to do in her great war, and ask what they would take for their i r o n ; and the price asked would not be governed by the cost of production, plus the cost of the raw material, but governed by the rates in New York, Montreal, and London. If the giving of this bonus be agreed to, it will go down to history as a stupendous act of infamy which plundered unborn millions of their inheritance.",35
153,Mr EOWLER,U II," In addition to the ordinary responsibility which Parliament always has in connection with any legislation, we have a further responsibility in this particular matter. During the whole debate we have had the very haziest information as to the exact standing of the gentlemen who are going to embark in this industry. Once before, on the floor of the House, I challenged those gentlemen to produce evidence that the money was actually available to carry on the work. I have had no reply to that challenge, which I now repeat; If the money be available, let evidence to that effect be produced; and to that extent, at least, we shall then know where we stand. But we know perfectly well that the gentlemen interested are going to the markets of the world with their' leases, and that they intend to dangle this bonus before the wealthy classes in order to bring about the formation of a company. We are responsible to the extent that we offer a bonus, andfcheassumption is that fchis Parliament considers the industry to be one with every likelihood of success. But are we in a position to say we believe the industry, if initiated by the company, will be successful to the degree which the company have a right fco expect ? We have no evidence whatever to that effect. In the interests of the people who are prepared to enter into a bona fide industry of this kind, it is our dufcy to appoint a committfce of investigation. If the proposed company be sound, and have reasonable ground.for assuming that they will carry on the industry successfully, I fail co see what objection they can have to the appointment of a committee, which, if the evidence be thoroughly satisfactory, will materially assist them in obtaining the moneyfcheyrequire. In fchis way the appointment of a select committee will accelerate the establishment of the industry, and on that ground alone the motion is justified. If the result of the inquiry is to satisfy this House that there is reasonable prospect of success, those who are floating the company will have no difficulty in inducing investors to subscribe the required money. Por these reasons alone I believe a select committee ought to be appointed to proceed at once with the necessary investigation.",35
154,Mr CROUCH,U II,"-I do not think it necessary afc this stage .to repeat speeches in which I have already shown my strong opposition to socialism. The proposal for a select committee seems to have been made in consequence of the debate which took place in the New (South Wales Legislative Assembly the other night on a motion that the Government of that State should pledge itself to take advantage of the CommonwealthBonus Bill. Mr Eitzpatrick suggested, not only on that occasion, but also when a member of a deputation to the State Minister of Public Works, that m addition to the iron industry, coal-mining, gold-mining, clofches-making, and, infacfc, everyofcherindustry, should be brought under State control.. The design of the labour party in New South Wales has therefore been clearly indicated. The labour party in this House are following their example, and having failed to carry out their socialistic ideas, are only consistent in doing their best fco defeat the Bill, by shelving it for three or five years. This will be the result of referring it fco a select committee. I am not so well able to arrive afc the motive which has led the leader of the Opposition fco support the proposal to refer the Bill to a select committee. Some honourable members have not dared to vote against the socialistic principle embodied in the proposal for the establishment of' ironworks by the States Governments. They do not like socialism, but they are uncertain as to how their constituencies would regard their actions if they directly opposed it. The proposal for the appointment of a select committee, therefore, affords them a means of achieving their end without directly committing themselves. Some honourable members of the Opposition have professed to be absolutely ignorant of the details of the Government proposal and of the consequences which would follow the passing of the Bill now before us. They therefore say,fcheyfavour the appointment of a select committee in order that the fullest information may be placed in the hands of honourable members. I would, however, ask those honourable members who are now so anxious to obtain every information upon the subject now before us, why they did not realise the same necessity for a full investigation in connection with the Pacific Island Labourers Act and the Immigration Restriction Act. Those were measures which involved the mosfc important considerations affecting the relations of Australia with the Pacific and the Empire; the vast interests of sugar growers, merchants, ship-owners, and vast industrial and mer- cantile concerns, and yet when it was proposed that it should be referred to a select committee they argued that this House was quite competent to deal with the matter. In the present case honourable members should be just as capable of transacting the business before them without waiting for an investigation by a select committee. Their opinions are not likely to be altered by the conclusions arrived at by any committee. If honourable members feel that they cannot venture to openly vote against socialistic proposals, they are quite justified in supporting the appointment of a select committee, which will have the effect of shelving the Bill for some time. It would be preferable if they were to demonstrate that they had the courage of their opinions by voting directly against the proposal for the establishment of ironworks by the States Governments, and so at the outset crush a pioject which, if carried into effect, would create a monster that in time would swallow up every industry in the Commonwealth. Honourable members, whose sole reason for existence as members of this House is that they have devoted years to the study of politimembers cal economy and social functions, should come out into the open and vote fearlessly in' support of their opinions. I find that of those honourable members whom it is proposed to appoint as a select committee, the honourable member for Bland and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the Minister for' Trade and Customs, the honourable member for West Sydney, and the honourable member for Parramatta have declared themselves strongly in favour of nationalizing the iron industry.",36
155,Mr WATSON,U II,The honourable member for Parramatta and the Minister for Trade and Customs voted against the proposal to nationalize the iron industry.,37
156,Mr CROUCH,U II,Does the honourable member for Bland deny my statement that the honourable member for Parramatta stated that he was in favour of nationalizing the iron industry?,37
157,Mr WATSON,U II,He voted against the proposal on the ground that it was not opportune.,37
158,Mr CROUOH,U II,"Whether that be so or not, the honourable member is reported at page 13612 of Eansan-d to have stated that he was in favour of nationalizing the iron industry. The Minister for Trade and Customs also similarly declared himself. The honourable member for Darling Downs stated that he was in favour of State control of the industry for two years, and that he could not go any further. The honourable member for Newcastle, as a member of the labour party, must support State socialism; and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie voted in favour of the State socialistic proposal of the honourable member for Bland. Therefore, eight members of a committee of ten have expressedthemselves in favour of having the iron industry established as a State enterprise. I have not been able to trace any expression of opinion by the honourable member for Wannon, or the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. I have some doubt as to the views held by the latter honourable member, but I should judge that the honourable member for Wannon would be opposed to State socialism. If a fair and honest inquiry is to be made into the merits of the Government proposal, and as to the desirableness of the iron industry being established under State control, the committee should be differently 1 constituted, and should not comprise eight who are already committed to support State socialism.",37
159,Mr WATSON,U II,Onl y four members of the proposed committee have voted in favour of nationalizing the iron industry.,37
160,Mr CROUCH,U II,I should like to know which members of the committee are in favour of individualism ?,37
161,Mr WATSON,U II,No one in this House except the. honourable member is in favour of individualism ,37
162,Mr CROUCH,U II,"The honourable member is mistaken. I should like to see the honourable and learned member for Parkes appointed to the committee, if for that reason only. He would prove a useful member of such an investigating body, because he has devoted a large amount of attention to the study of political economy. If the committee is appointed, and is constituted as now proposed, it will not serve the interests which the honourable member for Bland seeks to advance, because it will not possess the confidence of this House to the same degree as if it were evenly balanced.",37
163,Mr TUDOR,U II," Iti s scarcely necessary for me to say that I am a firm believer in the importance of establishing the iron industry. I do not think that the appointment of a select committee, as proposed, will postpone the accomplishment of that object. In Victoria the application of the bonus system to the manufacture of beeti sugar was followed by disaster, and the loss of a large sum of money would probably have been obviated if an exhaustive inquiry had been made prior to the establishment of the Maffra Beet Sugar Works. If the committee proposed by the honourable member, for Bland, after an impartial inquiry, recommend that we should adopt the bonus system, I shall support tbem. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that the opinions of honourable members are fixed upon the subject of the establishment of the iron industry as a State monopoly, and I do not share his anxiety as to the results. Even if the personnel of the committee is not altered, only four members out of ten will stand committed to the nationalization of the iron industry, because the honourable member for Parramatta and the Minister for Trade and Customs voted against the proposal made by the honourable member for Bland. The honourable and learned member for Corio statedthat it was singular that honourable members had not been willing to refer the Pacific Island Labourers Bill to a select committee for the purposes of investigation. I would point out, however, that the voice of the Australian people had been raised unmistakably in favour of the abolition of the Kanaka traffic, and that in passing the measure referred to we were carrying out the specific mandate of the people. . On the other hand, the question of granting bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry was not raised at one meeting out of fifty held in connection with the Federal elections'. If the select committee is appointed, I hope that it will be able to bring up a report early next session, and I do not fear that the result will be to seriously delay the passing of the measure now before us.",37
164,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,U II," The question with which we are now dealing is a vast one, but I do not share the feeling of the honourable and learned - member for Corio, with regard to responsibility which rests upon honourable members. Some few weeks ago I suggested to the Minister for Trade and Customs that it would be advisable to abandon measure, seeing that the question of granting bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry was not brought before the public at the last election: The first I heard of it was in this Chamber some months ago, and I am sure that many honourable members are in a fog as to how they should deal with the present proposal. Personally I feel no responsibility in regard to it . How can any honourable member feel sure that he is representing his constituents by voting for or against the measure? He cannot possibly know what, their views are. I regard the sudden appearance of this measure upon the political horizon as utterly unreasonable. When I spoke regarding this measure a few weeks ago, one or two honourable members thought that I expressed myself very 'warmly. When I feel strongly it is natural I should speak with some warmth. But I have no desire to speak warmly tonight. I wish honourable members to understand that I am speaking as coolly as if I were dealing with a business matter of my own, or with one in which I was acting as a trustee, and I say that there is absolutely no warrant for intruding this vast matter upon the House, either during the present session or the next. The only solution of the difficulty which has arisen - a solution satisfactory alike to the labour party, to members of the Opposition, and to Ministerial supporters-is to drop the Bill. I ask the Minister to give honourable members breathing time-tim e to examine the question thoroughly in all its bearings. It is only reasonable that they should be allowed an opportunity of conferring during the recess with the leading people in their constituencies, and of informing themselvesby means of public meetings - of what the opinions of the electors upon this matter really are.' Let us come into contact with - those who take an interest in it . If the Bil l be passed, is the payment of the bonus to be limited to one State ? From advices which I have received from experienced and reputable thinkers in Queensland, I know that they favour giving equal consideration to all the States which choose to embark upon this enterprise. I mention that fact to emphasize the desirableness of delaying the further consideration of this matter. If the Government refuse to drop the Bill- a course which I respectfully counsel them to follow- I shall support the motion of the this honourable member for Bland.",38
165,Mr WATSON,U II," Mr Speaker, I wish to ask if you will be good enough to put my motion in two parts-the first portion affirming the desirableness .of referring the Bill to a select committee, and the second relating to the personnel of the committee.",38

167,Mr AVATSON,U II," Wit h the permission of the House, I should like to add to the committee the names of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, !and the honourable and learned member for Illawarra. I understand that the Ministry have no objection to that course being adopted. If we do not add these names, there may be some difficulty about obtaining the attendance of a quorum at the sittings of the committee.",39
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II, I wish to ask whether any further debate can take place at this stage ?,39
169,Mr SPEAKER,U II,"No . The motion as a The House whole would have been put just now, but at the express desire of. the House it was 30 divided into ' two parts.

170,Mr DEAKIN,U II," I moveThatfcheHouse do now adjourn. There is no other measure upon the business paper with which we can proceed this afternoon, and, under the circumstances, it PAIRS. is necessary for me to submit this motion, Barton, Sir E. although I regret that we cannot employ the hours of an ordinary sitting which still remain to' us upon the consideration of the measure that we shall receive from the MCEacharn, Sir M . D. Senate tomorrow. I again invite honourable members to make themselves familiar with that measure by consulting the proceedings in which the proposals that will Forrest, Sir J. be brought before us in regard to the Customs Tariff Bill are to be found, so that when the message is presented we may be able to proceed at once with its consideration. In this connection it is very important that there shall be no more delay than is absolutely essential; and if honourable members will do the Government the favour of consulting those proceedings, I think that they will be fairly equipped for dealing with the Bill when it comes before us tomorrow afternoon.",39
171,Mr OMALLEY,U II, I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister if he does not shortly intend toset apart a day for the consideration of private members' business ?,39
172,Mr SALMON,U II,Nex t session.,39
173,Mr OMALLEY,U II,I may be dead next session.,40
174,Mr TUDOR,U II,Other s will be left.,40
175,Mr OMALLEY,U II,"But others will not undertake my work. I have important motions upon the business paper relating to the adoption of a system of old-age pensions and to the establishment of a reciprocal treaty with New Zealand. It is time that these matters were discussed. Another question which ought to be debated has reference to foreign steam-ships which are not paying their crews the same rate of wages that is being paid by the Australian steam-ship owners with whom they are competing, by carrying goods between. Australian ports. Unless prompt action is taken in connection with this matter, I fear that the Australian steam-ship owners will be compelled to reduce the wages of their bands to the level of those paid by their competitors.",40
176,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,U II," I again wish to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the question of the prorogation. It appears to me that an effort might be made to close the present session before the close of the current month. It is possible that, apart from the financial Bills, we may get through most of the measures remaining to be dealt with during the current week. I know that we shall be glad to bring that about. I have learned, too, in an unofficial way, that the Treasurer will not be able to make his Budget speech until nearly the close of the month, but it seems to me that a big effort should be made to close the session this month. Paragraphs have . appeared in the newspapers which"" speak of the possibility of the session being prolonged until the end of October, but that would be a great calamity. We have now been sitting for a longer period than any House of Parliament with which I - am acquainted has sat during late years, and, therefore, I think that a supreme effort should be made to close the session this month. I-hcpe that the House will help the Government to do that.",40
177,Mr GLYNN,U II," This afternoon I asked the Acting Minister for Defence whether the salaries of the drill instructors who have been sent to South Australia are to be regarded as new expenditure, since the officers in question have been transferred from New South Wales to South Australia without being re-enlisted under the laws of the latter State. As a matter of constitutional principle I wished to know whether the salaries of these drill instructors are to be debited to South Australia as the salaries of transferred officers or as new expenditure. The Minister replied that the salaries were to be regarded not as new but as transferred expenditure, and were to be debited, not to New South Wales, but to South Australia, although the officers'have not been re-enlisted under the South Australian Act. The view I hold is that if the officers have not been re-enlisted under the South Australian Act, they remain under the New South Wales Act, because there is no Federal Act. If they do not remain under the New South Wales Act, they are not enlisted at all, because they have not been re-sworn under the South Australian Act ; but if they remain under the New South Wales Act, and the expenditure is not 'new expenditure, it must be debited to New South Wales. If they have been transferred to South Australia without being re-enlisted, and the expenditure is not to be debited to New South Wales, it must be regarded as new expenditure, because it is expenditure, not for the maintenance of the department as it existed in South Australia at the time of its transfer to the. Commonwealth, but expenditure in addition to that. I do not know how the Minister came to the conclusion that the expenditure is not new expenditure, or that, if transferred expenditure, it can be debited to South Australia instead of to New South Wales. I mention the matter because I am not satisfied that the opinion given by the Minister is correct in law.",40
178,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,U II," When it was arranged in May last that a trip, as it was called, should be taken to view the suggested sites for a federal capital, many honourable members declined to go, because they felt that by going they would risk their health. It was understood, however, that a subsequent trip would be arranged to meet their convenience, and I should therefore like to know from the Minister for Home Affairs, not later than next week, what arrangements he intends to make with that object. There are about 50 honourable members who were not able to take part in the last trip. The average number of those who took part in that trip was eighteen or twenty, the maximum number present at any one time being 28, while onty thirteen or fourteen visited all the sites. Under these circumstances, I ask, on behalf of myself and other honourable members, the Minister will take the matter into his consideration, and .let us know as soon practicable what conveniences he proposes place at the disposal of the 50 members who have not yet visited these sites.",40
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II," I can reply to the queswill tion of the honourable member for Brisbane without waiting until next week. A great deal of trouble and some expense was underdepartment taken to give members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate opportuthe nities to visit the suggested sites for federal capital, and at the time. I tried induce as many as I could to take advantage of it . A larger number of honourable bers bave visited those sites than the honourable member for Brisbane appears think, and there are not many who have visited some of them - That being so, I not think it should be expected that another trip will be arranged for. But if a few honourable members who have not visited the sites desire to make an informal visit, facilito ties could be given to enable them to in their own time. I am disappointed that more honourable members did not make it convenient to take advantage of the opportunity which was provided for them in May. All sorts of wild statements as to the cost of the inspection by the ate and the House of Representatives have appeared in the newspapers, but my secreafternoon, tary informs me that the amount expended upon the last trip will be considerably under the sum voted by this House. The honorstructors, able member for Gippsland is, of course, unable to get about as easily as most other honourable members, and he told me that - would like to visit the various sites in comthe present time. pany with six or seven other members in quiet way. I think that under the circumswearing stances I should be quite justified in affordtralian ing an opportunity for seven or eight bers to do that.",41
180,Mr WATSON,U II,"If facilities are provided for any, tliey should be provided for all.",41
181,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,"I do not think it can be expected that arrangements should be made for another series of special trains. What I suggest is that, if honourable memmight bers who have not visited the proposed sites, are willing"" to avail themselves of ordinary trains, facilities can be provided for travelling from the nearest railway stai f tions to the various sites. The honourable member for Gippsland wishes to travel from as Bombala to the border, and thence to Sale. to I do not think it would be possible to drive a coach and four through that district. For the examination of that country the lightest and strongest vehicles obtainable would be required. However, if honourable members inform me when they wish to go in the Way I describe, I shall try to make the necessary arrangements. The work of my and of Ministers has been very heavy of late; but I intend to submit at next meeting of the Cabinet, or at the the following meeting, a proposal for dealing to further with the capital site question. What I desire to do is to get my memcolleagues to agree to a reduction in the number of the proposed sites. There to are only three or four which are really not open for consideration. I should like do to see those sites placed before Parliament for consideration, in such a way that honourable members can add to their number any they think fit. That being done, I propose submit the names of certain experts to do so form a committee to reportupon various subjects connected with the question-wit h which only experts can deal-and to have the whole matter ready for submission to Parliament next session. W it h regard to the comments of the honourable and Senlearned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, upon the answer to his question this I may say that I took legal advice upon the subject. So far as I can see, there is only this in his point, that the innot having been sworn in under the South Australian Act, there is a doubt as to which State-South Australia or New he South Wales-shoul d pay their salaries at But the difficulty he a raises can be overcome at any moment by in the men under the South AusAct. Personally, I do not suppose memthat New South Wales would object very much to have to bear the whole charge herself.",41
182,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,The people of South Australia do' not ask for that.,41
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,"They are making a lot of trouble over what seems to me a small matter. I think the question fairly be left alone now, because I have asked, in as emphatic a manner as I the could, for certain information in regard to it.which has not yet been obtained.",41
184,Sir LANODON BONYTIION,U II,When honourable member expect to get it 1,42
185,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,"Th n General Officer Commanding has been in Sydney for some little time past, so that I have not had an opportunity to speak with him on the subject, but I hope that this burning question to South Australia will be settled without undue delay. I have armed myself with all information available, and it appears to me that if the defence forces of Australia are to be put upon one footingand that must be done sooner or later-the services of extra drill instructors are necessary in South Australia to bring the men of that State up to the same standard as exists in the larger States.,",42
186,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,U II,We deny expenditure. ' that that is necessary.,42
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,"In point of strength the instructing staff in South Australia is materially below - toria and New South Wales. There is no desire on my part to force upon South Australia this terrible outrage of sending these instructors there, and I shall be only using taunting expressions. too glad to find that her forces are sjf instructed that there is no necessity for them to have further instruction, and I can remove some of the men to whom great exception has been taken. I venture to think, however, that it will mean discharge, because they could not fairly taken back to the other States. odd have been discharged, and some seven or eight have just returned from South Africa. I bave given instructions thatthelatterare to be continued in the offices which they hold, and that as vacancies occur among the present instructors they are to take the vacant places. I do not wish the men who went to South Africa is answer to a call to find on their return that their places are taken, and that they are to be thrown upon thoir own resources. By the non-filling in other ways of vacancies as they arise, I hope to absorb in a legitimate way the men who have come from South Africa instead of discharging them as they otherwise would have to bo.",42
188,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"South Australia) No complaint was made by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, about what the Acting Minister of Defence was doing.

189,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,U II,I did not say that.,42
190,Mr BATCHELOR,U II,"The honourable gentleman insinuated that if South Australia was not prepared to pay the men, he had no doubt that New South Wales, out of her large-minded generosity, would do so. No objection has been made by South Australia to the payment of the men if it can be shown that it is desirable that they should stay there. The objection has been to what is believed to be an unnecessary If the Minister would not make these somewhat' taunting suggestions he would do something to allay the irritation which has been caused by the that in Vicaction taken so far.",42
