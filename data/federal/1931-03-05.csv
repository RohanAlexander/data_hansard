This duty, which was proposed in the interests of the fellmongery industry created considerable difficulties in connection with the disposal of sheepskins. The Government has now decided that the best interests of all concerned will be served by the cancellation of the duty from the date on which it was imposed. It is proposed therefore to take no further action in regard to the motion now before the House for the imposition of this duty, and it will accordingly lapse. Instructions have been issued to discontinue the collection of the duty from the 4th March, 1931, and the Government proposes to refund all amounts collected since the imposition of the duty.

DISCUSSION or MOTION OI? WANT or CONFIDENCE. Mr SCuXLIN (Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.44] - Because of the motion of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) has just given notice, I move That the House do now adjourn. Mr GBEGORY. (Swan) [2.45] - I enter a most emphatic protest against delay of the consideration of the business of the country. All know how desperate is the condition of Australia at the present time. Honourable members have been brought here, at very groat expense, from all parts of the Commonwealth, to give their attention to public affairs, and I should, therefore, like the motion of want of confidence to be so amended that the discussion could proceed immediately. The Leader of the Opposition is, I am sure, ready to make his speech, and the members of the Government should be able to reply to it without asking time for preparation, for the people are looking eagerly for this Parliament to do something. Thousands in Australia are unemployed, and those concerned in industry are in a desperate position. I am anxious to know if the Government proposes to take any action to assist those engaged in rural pursuits, and if not, if it will resign. I should like a' motion to be made asking the Governor General to dissolve the House, in the exercise of his power under section 5 of the Constitution. It is time we did something; the present drift must not continue. In the circumstances, the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) could not do other than move the adjournment of the House yesterday; but some arrangement should have been made whereby the discussion on the motion of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice could have been proceeded with today. I hope that when the debate commences, the House will sit on Saturday and on Monday and continue the discussion uninterruptedly until the motion is disposed of. We should get down to business immediately, and see if we cannot do something for the country, which is suffering so greatly at present.",11
31,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Newcastle) [2.48] I am at a loss to understand to whom the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) is directing his complaint. As notice of a motion of want of confidence has been given by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), that gentleman, is responsible for the delay of which he complains.",12
32,Mr LATHAM,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was compelled to give notice of my motion, and I took the first this opportunity available to me. Question resolvpd in the affirmative. House adjourned at 2.49 p.m.",12
