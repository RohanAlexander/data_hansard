The reduction of postage from 2d. to l^d. reduced the revenue by over £1,000,000, making a total of more than £2,000,000 in three years. The restoration cf penny postage would reduce the revenue by yet another £1,000,000.

A report in one of the morning newspapers attributes to me the statement that the Prime M i nnow ister had, upon the platform and in this Chamber, attacked the last direction President of the Arbitration Court. for Although the right honourable gentleman has many sins, this is not one of them.

In committee: (Consideration of Governor General's message). Motion (by Mr LATHAM ) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1921. Resolution reported and adopted. In committee (Consideration of bill resumed from 17th June, vide page 3267): Clause 3The principal act, as amended by this act, and every provision of that act as so amended shall, in relation to any question of legislative power, be construed as if that act were, as from the commencement of this act, confirmed and re-enacted as so amended; to the intent that where .any provision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, or of that act as amended by any act or acts, - has before the commencement of this act been, or would, but for this act, have been, construed as being in excess of the legislative power of the' Parliament, that provision shall, as from the commencement of this act, be read with and deemed to have been enacted in relation to the amendments made by this act.",15
13,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.10] - The Arbitration Act provides that certain judicial powers, in cluding the enforcement of the act and the interpretation of awards, shall be exercised by the President and Deputy Presidents of the court; but as it limits the tenure of those officers, the High Court has held that the provisions relating to enforcement and interpretation are ineffective. It is doubtful whether an amendment of the section relating to tenure Would effectively validate the provisions affecting enforcement and interpretation. Honourable members almost unanimously desire that the judges of the court shall have complete judicial power. In order, therefore, to obviate the possibility of the argument being raised that existing provisions as to judicial power, which are ineffective because that power is conferred upon unqualified persons, cannot be validated by making those persons qualified, this clause provides that the principal act as amended from time to time shall be construed as if it were conIn other words, this clause is an explicit declaration of the intention of Parliament that the judges of the Arbitration Court shall exercise those judicial powers which the existing act purports to confer upon the President and Deputy Presidents. It will full y clothe the court with those powers which Parliament thought it had originally conferred upon it . To remove a possibility of doubt as to the meaning of the clause, I move That the words "" in relation to any question of legislative power"" (lines 3 and 4), be left out.",16
14,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,Do I understand that this clause will apply to the members of the Deportation Board?,16
15,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"This legislation will not in any way affect the gentlemen who held seats on the Deportation Board. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 4 and 5 agreed to. Clause 6Sections 12, 13, and 14 of the principal act are repealed, and the following sections inserted in their stead:"" 12. The chief judge and the other judges(a) shall be appointed by the Governor General in Council; and (fi) shall not be removed except by the Governor General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. 13. The qualifications of the chief judge and of each other judge shall be as follows :He must be a barrister or solicitor of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State of not less than five years' standing. 14. (1) The chief judge shall receive a salary of £3,000 a year, and each other judge, shall receive a salary of £2,500 a year, and the Consolidated Eevenue Fund is to the necessary extent hereby appropriated accordingly. (2) The chief judge and each other judge shall be paid such travelling expenses as are prescribed. 14A. A judge, other than the chief judge, shall have and may exercise sucb . of the powers of the chief judge under this act as are assigned to him by the Governor General. 14B.

(2) If a judge retires on permanent disCourt. ability or infirmity, he shall, has served in that office for less than five years, be entitled, on retiring, to an annual pension at the rate of twenty one-huntice dredths of his salary and at thu ing to accept such an appointment. additional rate of three one-hunamendment is therefore necessary. dredths of his salary for each plete year of his service after the expiration of the said five to the date of his retirement, so that the rate of his pension tinued. shall not exceed one-half of salary. (3) The pensions of the judges shall charged on and paid out Consolidated Revenue Fund. (4) They shall grow due from day day, but shall - monthly.""",16
16,Mr DUNCAN,CONCILIATION AND,"HUGHES (Boothby) [11.18] - This clause relates, among other things, to pensions for the judges of the court. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has given notice of an amendment which he proposes to move to the Judiciary Bill regarding the pensions of High Court judges.",17
17,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.19] - Will the honourable member permit me to explain? I understand that he proposes to move to this bill an amendment similar in terms to that which has been circulated by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr . Manning) in respect of the Judiciary Bill . That matter relates to the proposed new section 14B. The earlier provisions, as honourable members have said, are also of importance. Proposed new section 12 is in the same terms as section 72 of the Constitution, because it is desired to make it perfectly clear that these judges are to exercise judicial power in the sense in which that phrase is used in the Constitution. Proposed new section 13 amends the existing provision of the act, which provides that the qualification for appointment shall be .that the President shall be one of the justices of the High Court, and the Deputy President may be a justice of the High Court, a judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or other persons qualified as legal practitioners.",17
18,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Why place a limitation on the qualifications?,17
19,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"I shall deal with that matter in a moment. The first point is that the existing act provides that the at President must be a justice of the High That provision does not impose if he any obligation upon any justice of the not H i gh Court to accept appointment to the - Arbitration Court, and, in fact, no jusof the High Court is at present will This The comother point is that the existing provision years that members of the legal profession but shall constitute the court, will be conThat is necessary, because the his court will exercise judicial powers by im be posing penalties on members of the comof the munity. It would be unusual to give to persons without legal qualifications the to power to fine citizens, and possibly to be payable send them to jail .",17
20,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,The arbitration judge will be a criminal judge as well ?,17
21,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"I am speaking of the imposition of penalties under the A r b i tration Act. There has never yet been a case in which such powers have been placed in the hands of persons not specially trained to determine the nature of an offence, and to pass judgment upon the admissibility of evidence in relation to it . On that ground it is necessary that the members of the court shall be members of the legal profession in accordance with the universal practice in British communities. If we had more extensive powers under the Constitution it would be - nossible to insert in the bill a provision of an entirely different character relating to wages boards and committees of conciliation, which need have no power to impose penalties at all, and whose duties would be confined to industrial regulation. Under our existing powers, however, unless the enforcement of penalties is to be left in the hands of every court exoept the Arbitration Court, this amendment .is necessary. It is generally agreed by both sides in industry that the Arbitration Court should, in effect, administer the act judicially, and that this power s'hould not be exclusively in the hands of other tribunals, as is the case at present.",17
22,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Is there no power under the present Constitution to appoint wages boards ?,17
23,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"U n d e r the present Constitution, wages boards, on the Victorian model, could not be appointed, because we can utilize the method of arbitration only. Wages boards act on their own knowledge, independent of parties and representations of parties.",17
24,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Coul d not tribunals be appointed ?,18
25,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , under the In dustrial Peace Act , but in that case there must be a dispute between two parties. The great advantage of the wages board is that it operates independently of the existence of disputes. Under our constitutional power, it is necessary that there should be a dispute, and even then the power of the tribunal to be constituted is limited to arbitration and conciliation for the purpose of settling that dispute. It is quite true that any tribunal appointed would be constituted in such a manner as this Parliament thought proper, but even then it would not be able to function as a wages board. It could only arbitrate or conciliate for the purpose of settling a particular dispute.",18
26,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Reid) [11.27] - I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to submit each proposed new section separately. The whole body of the bill is contained in clause 6, and it would be unfair to expect us to deal with the clause in globo. regret that the Government will not seek increased power from the people to enable us to determine the conditions under which the judges will be appointed, but I shall not labour that subject, because it has already been fully discussed. Proposed new section 13 readsThe qualifications of the Chief Judge and of each other judge shall be as follows:-He must be a barrister or solicitor of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State of not less than five years' standing. I can see no reason for that new section, because the Government in choosing judges should not be restricted to barristers or solicitors of five years' standing. The best men should be selected for the position, and personal qualities should be considered before judicial training. Some of the best arbitrators in the past have been men of little or no legal training. suming that the Government's policy in selecting barristers or solicitors is a wise one, I wish to know why the choice should be limited to barristers or solicitors of five years' standing. There may be many excellent men who have not actually practised at the bar, but who have excellent qualifications for the position. They may have a standing of only two or three years. I have in mind a man of about 40 years of age who was recently admitted to the bar. He is an officer of the Commonwealth service; but I am not necessarily suggesting that he should be appointed to one of these positions, although, if he were regarded from the stand-point of his probable success as a conciliator and arbitrator, his chance of appointment would be good. He has had wide experience, and has settled many disputes. I cannot see why this Parliament should tie its hands in the making of appointments of this character. Some honourable members opposite may criti cize the Labour Governments of Queensland and New South Wales for not appointing lawyers to all judicial positions. They selected men who, in their opinion, would be best able to discharge judicial functions. I said last night that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) showed his wide knowledge of industrialism when he had to deal with the difficult industrial problem associated with shipbuilding. He appointed a layman, I Mr Connington, to the shipbuilding tribunal because of his wide industrial experience, his tact, and his understanding. That appointment was responsible for one of the greatest industrial successes of that troubled period.",18
27,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"East Sydney) [11.32] A little alteration would greatly i m prove this clause. There may be some justification for insisting that the chief judge should be a member of the legal profession, but that limitation should not be applied to the appointment of the other judges. Many persons without legal', training are better able to judge industrial matters than are lawyers. Knowledge of the world is sometimes of greater value than knowledge of the law, and all the wisdom of the human race is not by any means confined to lawyers. As- A number of the men who practise in our courts have shown marked ability in handling business problems. I do not know that business men make more mistakes than lawyers. An y judge would be sorely puzzled if he had to deal with the technicalities of my trade. The appointment of men with experience of the world would tend to bring the court into favour with the workers. My object is to make the court an institution to which the workers and the employers can look with confidence and respect. I move That in proposed new section 13 the words "" and of each other judgebe left out.",18
28,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"North Sydney) [11.37]. - This may be regarded as the vital clause of the bill, for it deals with the constitution of the court which will exercise the powers of this Parliament under paragraph xxxv., section 51, of the Constitution. T have always been a strong advocate of arbitration, but my experience has led me to believe that the most effective form of what is called arbitration-if by arbitration we mean a legalized method of adjusting industrial differences-is not a court, but a tribunal whichmay take the form of a wages board, or a round-table conference at which the parties are equally represented under an independent chairman. The honourable the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) informed me, in reply to a question put to him yesterday, that we cannot set up wages boards under the limited powers conferred in our Constitution; but that is only true if we are to postulate for the wages boards power virtually to legislate in industrial matters.",19
29,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,It is a matter of procedure as well.,19
30,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Wage s boards under the existing industrial power could deal only with a de facto or a de jure dispute.,19
31,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,And only by the method of conciliation and arbitration.,19
32,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"I cannot see that that is a serious limitation of our powers. To anticipate is almost to invite a demand. It is surely enough that we should provide redress for a grievance that exists. Therefore a wages board to deal with de facto and de jure disputes would not be under auy serious disability. But, if we create a tribunal that will be free to roam over the whole industrial field, anticipating industrial unrest-to create a storm where there was a placid sea-w e shall invite more trouble than in the nature of things seems to be our lot. I do not accept the conclusion that the honourable the Attorney-General draws from the real limitation of our industrial power. Wc are about to appeal to the people for wider power, under which it is intended to create authorities. Just what those [129] authorities are to do is not now so clear as it was a day or two ago, although there was much doubt about it even then. But, whatever they are to do, clearly from the wording of this clause it is not intended that they shall operate so as to exclude the authority which functions under our existing industrial power. There will still be a court-thoug h one possessed of wider power-appointe d for a number of years. We shall have appointed men to exercise the functions of arbitration judges. But the next Parliament may come to the conclusion that a court is, in some cases, not the best, and perhaps, in all cases, an imperfect instrument for the adjusting of industrial disputes. A judge must stand aloof,' and the questions which arise in industrial conflict cannot be understood by those who do so. The nature of industrial disputes is such that the relation between the person whose duty it is to settle them and the disputants ought to be intimate. A conciliator or arbitrator should not be solely dependent upon evidence; he ought to have knowledge and experience. The judges of the Arbitration Court are eminent men, learned in the law; but it cannot be said that any of them has had much experience of industrial affairs. It is extremely difficult, in fact, to find suitable men with such experience. Under the existing system, decisions are given on the evidence adduced in court, and any one who has practised in the courts, knows what such evidence usually amounts to. The procedure before a wages board isi entirely different. The members of a wages board-employer s and employees-kno w all the circumstances of the industry with which they are concerned, and it would be useless to spend time in calling evidence intended to enlighten, or, if you like, befool them. I favour a system having a court at its apex, but in which the ensuring of justice and the securing of industrial peace will rest mainly with wages boards or similar tribunals.",19
33,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,The court would be a sort of an appeal court.,19
34,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"The court should be an appeal court. From my experience, better results would be obtained in that way. and in less time. When the case of, let us say, the ironmoulders, is brought before the court it is necessary for the employees' representatives to inform the legal mind on the bench of the technical details of the industry from the standpoint of the workmen, and then the employers' representatives put the case from their point of view, and since the President of the Court has no first-hand knowledge of the industry, he is confused rather than enlightened, but a wages board would at once get down to the real issues of hours, wages, and conditions, which are always the substance of a dispute. It would be better, in my opinion, to make, these provisions more elastic. I have no objection to a courtI believe in having one-bu t I consider that it would achieve more satisfactory results by acting through other instrumentalities, reserving for itself only the final word, in case of some special emergency. It is proposed to appoint the judges for life. If they are so appointed some work must be found for them to do; and if another Government came into office with different views on the industrial question, it would be saddled with that responsibility. understand the object of the Attorney General in submitting this proposal. He desires to give the judges, or the persons who exercise this arbitral power, the qualification necessary to enable them to impose penalties; and under the Constitution that can only be by appointing the judges for life. is admitted on all hands that our Arbitration Court has now inadequate powers, but, as we are going cap in hand to the people to ask for more power, we should merely consider this measure as the effecting of temporary repairs to the ship to enable her to make port, hoping later to get another which will better serve our requirements. the alterations proposed by the bill in the existing law are so elaborate and expensive that it would appear that we have no faith that the vessel will ever be replaced by one more suited to our service. Possibly in this we are wise, for frequently those.who go to sea in fairy argosies do not weather the storms.",19
35,Mr FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,The right honourable member said that the disadvantages well as the advantages of the scheme were obvious. What are the disadvantages?,20
36,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"O u r experience shows that the Arbitration Court is unable to bring about industrial peace It haa been quite impotent to settle the two strikes which are just at an end; nor could it settle the strike which occurred last December. Apparently the court can only settle strikes that do not matter. As soon as an interruption in an industry becomes serious, it says, "" We cannot deal with it ; we have no jurisdiction."" In my opinion we are more likely to get industrial peace by setting up some kind of grand industrial council, upon which the leaders of industry and the leaders of Labour will be represented, and having subordinate to it State councils, and subordinate to them, various boards or tribunals to deal with particular industries. That scheme was suggested by me some years ago and was supported by the Labour organizations, and u n t i l we get a scheme that is acceptable to them we cannot hope for success. I realise that the Government has other ideas on the subject, so I shall not obtrude mine any further.",20
37,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.54] - The real issue raised I quite by the amendment of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) is whether only the chief judge of the reconstituted court shall be a lawyer. He suggested that that would be quite sufficient for all purposes. But I "" remind honourable members that under secdone It tions 6 and 6A of the act provision is made for the imposition of penalties up to £1,000. in certain cases; and under section 38c penalties up to £1,000 may be imposed in the case of organizations of employers and employees, aud up to £10, in the case of individual members of organizations. In existing circumstances they may be inflicted by But almost any court except the Arbitration Court; but only by persons who have, what I may term the constitutional qualifications. Obviously penalties of this character should be imposed only by persons who understand the rules of evidence, and whose legal training is adequate to enable them fair l y to determine on the evidence whether an accused person is guilty or not guilty. It would as be entirely unprecedented for us to commit the imposition of such penalties as these to persons without legal training. If only one member of this Bench is legally trained, it will mean that prosecutions from all over Australia, against organizations as w ^ l l as indithat viduals, will have to be heard before That might be convenient for Melbourne unionists or employers, but it would mean that unions and employers in other States would have to bear the expense of distant proceedings,"" or have their cases dealt with by their State police position of judicial power. courts.",20
38,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Would not that apply in any circumstances?,21
39,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"It would not apply to anything like the same extent if the three judges were qualified to impose penalties. Mi"". COLEMAN - Is it intended that these three judges shall travel from State to State?",21
40,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"U n d o u b t e d l y ; will sit in the various parts of monwealth just as the present judges do. I point out to honourable that if only one of the judges has judicial power to impose penalties and interpret awards, there will be great confusion, for the chief judge would be able, to so much more than his colleagues could do.",21
41,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Is it provided i Constitution that judicial power shall be exercised only by barristers or solicitors?,21
42,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"No , but I submit with great confidence that it is essential that the persons clothed with power to impose these heavy penalties and even imprisonment should have legal qualithe fications and a proper understanding the law.",21
43,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"If the Attorney-General means to say that only trained lawyers have any sense, he is wrong.",21
44,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"My acquaintance with the honourable member should prevent me from falling into that error. my opinion, it is essentia] to the possibly satisfactory working of the present act that all three occupants of the bench shall be men of legal otherwise serious confusion would occur, and the first to complain of it would the members of unions for whom, I presume, the honourable member for East Sydney is speaking. It would mistake to set up distinctions between the chief judge and the 'Other judges; the like. all of them should be well versed in rules of evidence and competent to pound the law. It is just as desirable a man should get a fair t r i a l before him. the Arbitration Court as before any other court. The provision for a five years' period is in the existing act. It has always been a requirement that there must be a minimum period of experience in the profession before a man is placed in a The obtaining of a university qualification does not in itself confer upon any individual the necessary capacity for administering the law. I would say also that the mere possession of a period of five years in the profession does not confer on every man that standing for capacity; but without the experience of at least five years in the profession it is highly improbable that a man would have sufficient knowledge to enable him to deal comthey petently with all the matters upon which the Comhe might have to pass judgment.",21
45,Mr FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,The provision is for the members protection of the litigant.,21
46,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"It is for the protection of the public, and in particular of the litigants. I am in agreement with do much that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) had to say about wages boards. My own view n the is that, although probably it would be very desirable that inquiries into certain general questions, such as standard hours and the basic wage in industries generally, should be made by a central arbitration tribunal, serious difficulties would arise if such a tribunal were to determine detailed conditions for all in of dustries. The conditions laid down in awards are sometimes of very great importance to all concerned in industries. I agree that it would be very desirable if we could set up means for determining particular conditions and trade relations between workmen in varying grades other than by a court of jurists. But under In our present powers wages boards cannot be introduced in such a way that they could work. Our present power depends upon the existence of a dispute, training, and arbitration is confined to the purpose of settling that dispute. A wages board be could operate only within the limits of a dispute. The description of the limits of a dispute is not easy. We should still be a require to continue the procedure we have at present, for the serving of the log and Under the present Federal the powers it would be very difficult inexdeed for any body of laymen sitting on a wages board to know where they were. It is not sumcient to have a dispute. The award must deal with that dispute and must not go beyond it. Under our present constitutional powers the arbitrating body is not able to determine what it thinks fair and just in order to bring a dispute to an end; it has to operate within the limits of the dispnte. That has been settled by the High Court in a series of decisions that are very difficult to understand. To set up a system of lay arbitrators nnder onr existing powers would lead to almost endless litigation. 1 assure honourable members that there will be a great saving of time and expense to all concerned under our present system if - these powers are conferred upon men who are legally trained. Mr Rodgers.i-If conciliation is to depend on the work of the boards, we should hardly need these judges.",21
47,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"The judges would be needed under any system. As the right honourable member for North Sydney put it, there must be a court at the apex of the system. I understood the right honourable gentleman to intimate that he thought the court should be a general body of appeal. Personally, I do not accept that position in industrial affairs. There should be a very severe limitation upon appeals, and upon the legal element generally. At the same time, in my view it will always be necessary to have a body like this to determine certain general matters; such, for example, as standard hours and the basic wage, which it is not, wise to leave to be determined by uncoordinated lay tribunals. If the extended powers to be asked for by referendum are granted, we shall have a much more elastic and much more sensible system than we have at present.",22
48,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND,"Newcastle) [ 1 2 . 5 ] I am sorry that the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) cannot accept the amendThc ment. I have every respect for lawyers, but I have had a very unfortunate exin perience of their lack of practical knowsheep. ledge when dealing with certain occupaabout tions in this country. I can give an illustration of this in the definition seam of coal laid down by a very eminent lawyer. Certain payments per inch are made where a seam of coal is less than the thickness of 5 feet, and refuse is paid for on the basis of what is known as a standard seam of 5 feet. In giving his decision, £he eminent lawyer to whom I refer, instead of defining a seam of coal ! from the roof to the bottom, decided that where there was 15 feet of coal from theroof to the bottom, a standard seam of 5 feet might be taken out of the centre; payment should be made for the refuse in that 5 feet, and no account need betaken of the rest. In the mine in which I worked at the time, following upon that decision the practice adopted was to takeout the 5 feet in the centre, and the coal was being ruined for four solid years; before any change in the definition of a seam was made. It was ultimately made by a common-sense practical arbitrator. I mention the matter to show that in the coal-mining industry, in which the conditions of the work axe constantlychanging, it is necessary to have boards appointed which can deal at once in a practical way with questions submitted to them.",22
49,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,We need first-hand' knowledge.,22
50,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND,Yes ; the first-hand knowledge of practical people. Without that knowledge we must add immensely to the cost of arbitration.,22
51,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"What is suggested is very sensible, but there are grave difficulties in the way of the adoption of thesuggestion under the present system.",22
52,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND,Why not change thesystem ?,22
53,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,That is what the Government is trying to do in asking for additional constitutional powers.,22
54,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND,"I agree that the i m position of penalties for refusal to comply with awards should be left to a judge, but that should not prevent the adoption - of a system enabling practical men todetermine the conditions in any industry. whole of the shearing industry washeld up as the result of a huge mistakeconnexion with the method of countingI heard some men talking that only a little time ago. Thereason why the arbitration system is not of a operating satisfactorily today is that the legal expenses involved are too high. Imagine unions having to pay £10,000* to secure a hearing of their case! That is quite wrong. The sooner we get back to simplicity, and imake provision for the appointment of local and practical tribunals, able to give decisions quickly, the sooner we shall have industrial peace.",22
55,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND,That is where conciliation committees will be found useful.,23
56,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND,"Conciliation, of course, has its proper place in the settlement of industrial disputes, but I am referring to the necessity for the appointment of practical boards, the members of which, because of their special knowledge of industries in which disputes occur, may be able to settle them promptly, instead of those concerned having to wait for, it may be, two years before their case can be heard. I hope that the Attorney-General will even now agree to an amendment enabling the Government to appoint boards of laymen to deal promptly with industrial disputes. It is true that we propose to take a referendum to secure additional constitutional powers, but in the meantime there is' considerable 'industrial trouble in the different States. There are hundreds of men out of employment at pr<jsent because there is no tribunal available to promptly settle industrial differences. There should be such an amendment made in the bill as would enable the Government to appoint practical laymen to carry out a job requiring practical knowledge. If the Attorney-General will not agree to such an amendment we cannot compel him to do so because, unfortunately, we have not the numbers. We can only hope that whatever new scheme of arbitration is decided upon by the Parliament it will be based upon common sense and will not perpetuate the high costs and delays of the present system.",23
57,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"East Sydney) [12.13] I must compliment the Attorney-General on the time it took him to explain what is proposed, and on his loyalty to the profession of which he is a member. The honourable gentleman spoke of the necessity of legally-trained men dealing with penalties. I think it will be admitted that Judge Webb has carried out his work very creditably. There is a good deal of common sense in some of his judgments, and he has not done anything outrageous, as it was suggested by the Attorney-General might happen in the circumstances he outlined. Mr Bubble, as chairman of the coal tribunal, has brought common sense to bear in his judgments. We have been told that there is no precedent for what has been proposed from this side; but one of the powers conferred by the people upon the political Labour party is to establish its own precedents. Of what use is it to. debate a question if we are to be tied to precedent? If we are to blindly follow precedent we shall never make any advance. I do not share the fear expressed by the Attorney-General that persons who have not had legal training would do injustice in the hearing of industrial disputes. I believe that they would bring their common sense and knowledge of the world into their consideration of the matters submitted to them, and if called upon to impose penalties, would be guided by the evidence submitted to them. The standing committees of this Parliament receive and weigh evidence, and although they do not include any legal members, they produce some of the most valuable reports that are made to this Parliament. We should not be wedded to precedent; the Labour party, being a progressive organization, creates precedents. The-purpose for which the Arbitration Court was established is defeated because legal technicalities are allowed to override common sense. The reasons advanced by the Attorney-General are not an effective objection to my amendment. Unless the court is popular and has the confidence of the people it cannot be a success.",23
58,Mr A GREEN,CONCILIATION AND,"Kalgoorlie) [12.22]. - The amendment has much to commend it. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) argued that if laymen were appointed to the court, its judical character would be impaired to some extent. In Western Australia representative industrialists who, by long years of association with unions, have a good working knowledge of the 'arbitration law have been appointed to the court. A tribunal composed of qualified laymen representing the workers and the employers, with an independent president to hold the balance truly between them, would compel more confidence than a bench of three lawyers. Our object should be to inspire in employers and employees 'alike complete confidence in the court. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) said that one weakness of the present court is that all its members have had only a .legal training. Whilst legal training fits a man for judicial functions, and is of supreme importance, it does not give to him that wide knowledge of men and affairs that is so essential a qualification in a person arbitrating upon industrial matters. A court constituted as I have suggested would be a more forceful instrument for the promotion of industrial peace. What knowledge of the workers and the conditions in trades and industries oan be possessed by a man whose whole life between childhood and his entry into the legal profession was spent at college and the university ? Even an industrialist can acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the conditions in different industries only by lifelong study I do not impugn the partiality of the judges, but men who have had no industrial experience undertake a hopeless task when they accept a seat on the Arbitration Court. The only members of the legal profession who are qualified to deal with industrial matters are those who have spent many years of their life amongst the workers, before lifting themselves out of the rut of manual toil. one is the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), but few with his knowledge and experience of industrialism are to be found in the profession to which he belongs.",23
59,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Fawkner) [12.27] I understand that the Attorney-General stated yesterday, in answer to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), that instead of delegating to the court the full industrial power that this Parliament is seeking from the people, it will prescribe the limits within which that power shall be exercised by the court. Throughout the discussion on the referendum proposals, I understood that the court would be invested with complete authority to deal with such questions as standard hours and the basio wage, and speaking to the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) to the bill relating to industry and commerce, I emphasized my belief that the court would deal with those issues free from political considerations and restrictions. That I considered the redeeming feature of tha Government's proposals. If , however, the powers of the court are to be measured out by Parliament as the Attorney-General has stated, we shall,, in effect, whilst asking the court to fix the maximum hours of labour to be worked throughout the Commonwealth, direct it to award not more or less than, say, 44. A court so restricted could do nothing but fix a standard week of 44 hours.",24
60,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,O r fix no standard hours at all.,24
61,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"The Attorney General pointed out the advisability of having standard hours and the basic wage determined by a body which was entirely removed from political influence, and he said that its determinations would follow a thorough investigation of economic conditions. I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether I have taken aright his answer to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory),- and whether, when we constitute this court Parliament will have power to prescribe the limits within which the court shall exercise its power on such questions as the fixing of maximum hours pf labour and the basic wage?",24
62,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [12.31],- I have already given Such a several reasons for opposing the amendment, and have in advance, replied to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green). The question raised by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) does not arise directly upon this bill, but, with the indulgence of the committee, I wish to say that wherever Parliament legislates for setting up an agency to perform any function, whether that agency be a commission, such as the Development and Migration Commission, appointed to discharge certain functions under an act, or whether it be an agency or authority of another kind, such as one to deal with industrial affairs, there is no means of forcing Parliament to confer any specified powers, or any specified degree of powers, upon the agency or authority. There is, however, in the case of the High Court a constitutional provision which in itself defines certain of the powers to be conferred upon an authority. Under the powers that are asked for ' under the Constitution Alteration Bill, it will be possible for Parliament to legislate with respect to establishing authorities with such powers as Parliament confers upon them to deal with industrial matters, &c. Those authorities would only have the power that Parliament conferred upon them to deal with industrial matters. For example, in the early days of the Arbitration Court the rural industries were excluded from its scope, but were subsequently included thereini Honourable members know of the dispute that has raged, and is still raging, respecting the exclusion of State servants from the sphere of the Arbitration Court. That is a matter entirely within the power of this Parliament to determine. In the existing act is a provision that certain determinations as to hours shall not be made by less than three judges. Accordingly, it would be possible, if Parliament thought fit, to confer only limited powers upon any authority, whether it be the existing court or any other body. Under the law as it stands, it would be possible to enact, for example, that the Arbitration Court shall settle disputes in the manner provided under the act, but that it shall not settle disputes in a given industry. This Parliament might also, under the existing powers, although it has never done so, provide that the court shall not have power to award more than a certain number of hours a week as the standard hours in any industry, or in .a given industry. Such legislation as that, however, would not fix the hours in any industry. If the Parliament limited the powers of the court, it would then be for the court to determine whether it would make an award. If it made an award, it would be bound by the limits prescribed by Parliament, whatever they might be.",24
63,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,There might maximum .and a minimum' limit.,25
64,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so; and if this Parliament were sufficiently foolish it might prescribe limits very close together. If Parliament greatly limited the power of the court it would then be for the court, or other authority appointed under new legislation, to consider whether any award as to hours should be made at all. It might very well; say, "" This is an industry for which no award as to hours should be made.""",25
65,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"It might decide, as the result of its investigation, that it could not make an .award in view of the limitation that had been placed upon it by Parliament.",25
66,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so, but Parliament could not, under this power or under the proposed new power, control the discretion of the court by forcing it to make awards as to hours and wages inindustry. It is true that Parliament would be able to confer on the court only very limited powers, and thereby confine it to a considerable extent.",25
67,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,I a there no way of obviating that by wording the proposals for increased powers?,25
68,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,There is no way of obviating that save by an amendment of the Constitution.,25
69,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND," I allowed the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) to continue his remarks, which were hardly relevant to the proposed amendment, but the Attorney-General is now entering into a general discussion of the whole bill. I am afraid that if he is permitted such great latitude other honourable members will claim the same privilege.",25
70,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"I regret that, in my anxiety to explain the position, I have been drawn into a general, discussion. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [12.37] - I support the clause so far as it relates to the appointment of Arbitration Court judges, and the qualifications for the position. I do not intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), because it is eminently desirable that we should appoint three judges with legal training, and able to weigh properly the evidence placed bebe a fore them. A provision should be inserted in the bill to enable the Arbitration Court to appoint assessors to assist it.",25
71,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"That power exists under the present act, but has seldom been exercised. I shall suggest that it be made more real than it is, when we are considering the general amendment of the Arbitration Act. Mr C. EILEY - It would be better if we now considered the appointment of assessors to assist the Arbitration Court judges. It would certainly entail greater expenditure for the time being, but it would be cheaper in the long run if it brought about a more satisfactory working of the arbitration system. In the absence of assessors, the findings and awards of the court might not give general satisfaction, and the expenditure incurred in the hearing of cases would thus be absolutely wasted. The case of the painters and dockers was heard by Sir John Quick last year, and the employers claimed that special rates should be paid for nermanent and casual work. vious claims by the Painters and Dockers Union were heard by Mr Justice Higgins and Mr Justice Powers, and on each occasion the justices refused to grant other than a casual rate. The painters and dockers are employed practically on an hourly basis. They may be employed on various work in connection with ships from 7.30 a.m. u n t i l 3 p.m. or 4 p.m., when their services are dispensed with . The recent award of Sir John Quick provided for permanent and casual rates,.but what I take exception to is that Sir John Quick made known his proposed award, and invited the parties to the dispute to offer any suggestions. took the opportunity of submitting f u r ther evidence, to which the employees were given no opportunity to reply. Yet, on that evidence, Sir John Quick materially and fundamentally altered his proposed award, with the result that the painters and dockers in New South Wales went on strike. If assessors were appointed to assist the Arbitratio n Court judges, there would be fewer opportunities for industrial disputes. We should insert in the bill a provision giving the judges power to appoint assessors.",25
72,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Unde r the existing act any party is able to insist upon an assessor being appointed, but that right has not yet been exercised. Mr C. RILEY - It is the duty of this Parliament to provide for the appointment of assessors.",26
73,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Would it not be diffieach cult to appoint assessors who would command the confidence and respect of both parties? They would either be employers or employees. Mr C. RILEY - The assessors would need to be representative of both parties to a dispute. W it h the assistance of expert assessors, the judge would be in a better position to make an award that would receive the approval of both parties. Amendment negatived.",26
74,Mr DUNCAN,CONCILIATION AND,"HUGHES (Boothby) [12.46] - The amendment which I wish to move on this clause is on the lines of an amendment of which the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has given notice. I regret that he is not present to move it , and I have, without Pre- authority from him, adopted the form of his amendment, because it appears to me to apply to this bill just as much as to the Judiciary Bill . When I first saw the amendment I thought that the objections to it outweighed the arguments in its favour, but since I have had an opportunity of considering it , I regard it as excellent. I hope that it will commend itself to. the committee. It raises the question of the age of retirement of A r bitration Court judges. This is a particularly suitable time to discuss this question, because, as there is no judge of the Arbitration Court, the merits of the case can be discussed in the abstract without reference to individuals. The amendment The employers which I now move isThat after the word "" entitled"" in proposed section 14B, the following words be inserted :"" subject to the next following sub-section."" The proposed new section will-then readWhere a judge has served in that office for uot less than fifteen years, he shall, on retiring, be entitled, subject to the next following sub-section, to an annual pension at the rate of one-half of his salary. The proposed new sub-section referred to in the amendment is(IA) In the case of a Justice who retires after attaining the age of 70 years, the annual pension to which he is entitled shall be at a rate less than the rate specified in the last preceding sub-section by one-tenth for each year or part of a year of his age, in excess of 70 years, at the time of his retirement. The effect of the amendment will be that if a judge does not retire at the age of 70 years the pension to which he is entitled will be decreased by one-tenth for year that he continues i o hold office, so that, at the end of ten years, no pension will be payable. On the other hand, if he continues on the bench his salary will be twice what he would draw as pension. A chief judge - retiring at 80 years of age .would draw in salary £15,000 more, and an ordinary judge £12,500 more than if he had retired at 70 years of age. At 5 per cent, those amounts represent an income of £750 and £625 per annum respectively. Many men whose names readily occur to the mind retained their mental abilities long after 70 years of age. The late Mr . W. E . Gladstone, Lord Halsbury-wh o was editor-in-chief of the Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England after he was 80 years of age-and Sir Samuel Way, late Chief Justioe of South Australia, are instances of public men who retained their mental abilities until they had reached a great age. Every honourable member has personal knowledge of private individuals who have retained their intellectual powers far beyond the ordinary span of life. On the other hand, it has become the general practice, in the Public Service of Australia, at any rate, to fix an age at which every one, with a few exceptions, shall retire. The idea is that, although there are isolated cases of men possessing outstanding ability at an advanced age, that is not the general experience. The retiring age varies in different States. In some States it is 65'; but the"" amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie suggests that 70 should be the retiring age, and I agree with that. Such a provision is not so necessary in the appointment of H i gh Court judges. The experience and legal knowledge accumulated by a judge in his lifetime may enable him to deliver accurate judgments long after the age of 70, but I suggest that in the - Arbitration Court, in particular, we should have men as judges who cannot be described as "" old,"" and who have at least some adaptability of mind. In saying that, I am not disparaging the President or Deputy Presidents of the present court; nor am I attacking old age as such, which would be - the last thing that I should wish' to do. I have omitted the second part of the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie, which makes provision for a judge who is 70 years of age at the coming into force of the Judiciary B i l That would not apply to this bill, because there are no judges of the Arbitration Court. I hope that my amendment will not prevent the President and Deputy President of the court from receiving, the pension which their successors will be allowed under this bill. I should like an assurance from the honourable the Attorney-General on that point. There are a number of arguments, which I do not wish to elaborate, in favour of this proposal. There is, for instance, the argument that the retirement of a judge at the age of 70 gives opportunities for the promotion of younger men. The amendment will not make the appointment of judges any the less a life appointment, but it will be a direct --inducement to a judge to retire at 70. I wish to make this point clear, if it is the only point that I do make clear: As the chief judge will draw a salary of £3,000, and a pension on his retirement of £1,500, he would be more than human, or less than human, if he did not desire to continue to draw his salary as long as possible. The inevitable result of the bill will be that every judge will retain his office to the last possible moment; but if the amendment is agreed to, his pension rights will be decreased annually if he remains on the bench after reaching 70 years of age. That, at least, will take away from him the inducement to remain on the bench. A consequential amendment, by inserting the words ""before reaching the age of 70 years"" after the word "" in f i r m it y in proposed new subsection 2 of section 14B,- will be necessary to bring that sub-section into line with the amendment.",26
75,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [12.57] - The amendment raises the important and interesting point whether it is desirable that there should be an age-limit to judicial appointments. The substance of the amendment is that there should be such a l i m it . The Constitution, as interpreted by the High Court, makes it impossible to appoint effectively Federal judges except upon a tenure for life. I should like to take this opportunity to remove a misapprehension as to ithe effect of that decision upon the present justices of the High Court. Those justices were undoubtedly appointed for l if e, and they l . hold their office under the provisions of the Constitution. The decision of the court affects the tenure only of future High Court justices. It will be beyond the power of. the executive to l i m it the term of appointment of future judges; but, before that decision was made, the existing justices had been appointed for life. Accordingly, it is a mistake to think that the present judges have, by their own decision, given themselves seats on the bench for life.' The honourable member suggested that it was preferable to discuss this amendment on this bill rather than on the Judiciary Bill , because by so doing it would be possible to exclude all questions relating to the personality of the present judges. In a sense that is so, but it will be impossible to avoid that issue if a similar amendment is proposed on the Judiciary Bill . If the committee passes this amendment, it will still have to consider what provision it will make with respect to the existing justices of the High Court. In other words, I suggest that if the honourable member succeeds in his amendment, the difficulty to which he referred will not be avoided, but only postponed. amendment provides an indirect method of fixing an age l i m it to judicial appointments. The intention of the Constitution in providing that the remuneration of the judges shall not be terminated during their tenure of office- "" tenure of office "" means "" life ""-is that there shall be no financial pressure on a judge to retire. The passing of the amendment would be an intimation that it is desirable for judges to retire at 70 years of age. That is an important question, but I suggest that it would be desirable to postpone the discussion of it until we are dealing with constitutional questions generally. That would be better than seeking indirectly to evade the provisions of the Constitution by putting pressure upon judges to retire otherwise than in accordance with the conditions contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.",27
76,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Coul d not the clause in the bill be left unaltered, and the question, as it affects arbitration judges, be discussed on the Judiciary Bill?",28
77,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"The Judiciary B aud Arbitration Bill must be kept separate. This bill abolishes the position of President and Deputy President of the Arbitration Court, so that the honourable member is quite safe in leaving out the last portion of the amendment of which the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has given notice. Tli6 Government suggests that the embarrassment referred to 'will inevitably arise on the Judiciary Bill , and, having regard to the relatively short time in volved, the importance of the issue, and the undesirability of doing anything in directly which cannot be done directly, consideration of the amendment should be postponed. Sitting suspended from l.S to 2.15 p.m. Progress reported MINISTERIAL CHANGES.",28
78,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.15] -{B y leave.)-For the information of the House I desire to announce certain changes which have taken place in the Government. For some time past, Senator Pearce, Minister for Home and Territories, has expressed a desire to be relieved of the position of a portfoliod Minister. He felt that the continuous and heavy administrative work of his department This has precluded him from devoting the necessary time to the onerous legislative duties which his position as Leader of the Government in the Senate entail. It is also my desire that he should be able to devote more of his time to the legislative and policy side of the Government's business. I therefore invited him to take the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council, and he has accepted that'position. It is of interest that this arrangement is similar to that which obtained in the first Federal government, when the late Senator R. E . O'Connor was Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Pearce will, of course,, retain his seniority in the Cabinet as the third in order of precedence, and will continue as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator the Honourable Sir Victor Wilson, K . B . E . , and the Honourable L . E. At k i nson, have tendered their resignations, which have been accepted by the Governor General. Senator the Honourable Sir Thomas Willia m Glasgow, K . C . B . , C.M.G., D.S.O., V .

In committee (Consideration resumed) :",28
79,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Y a r r a ) [2.19] - The amendment does not really affect the principle involved in this clause; its object is indirectly to alter the tenure of office of the judges, and to that extent I am prepared to accept it . But I object altogether to the granting of pensions to judges on their retirement. I take the view that judges should not be placed in a position different from that of other members of the Commonwealth Public Service. We haye many omcers who are receiving salaries by no means equivawill lent to those paid to our judges, are contributing to a superannuation f u n d ; but it is not proposed that the judges shall do so. That, in my opinion, wrong in principle. It may be argued that we provide old-age pensions for people who do not contribute to the scheme; but before persons can receive an old-age pension they must satisfy the authorities that they have practically no income or property; so they are in an enlistened tirely different position from the judges. I know that the judges of our courts usually not appointed until they are least in middle l if e ; they do not enter Service in their youth like most of our omcers. But, in my opinion, their could be met by providing special conview ditions for them in the Superannuation Act. I have no desire them harshly dealt with, or to oblige them to pay exorbitant rates; but they should be subject to the same treatment as other public servants.",28
80,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"An attempt was made to include them in the superannuation advanced scheme, but it was found impossible actuarially to do so for they are so few in number that an equitable basis of tribution could not be fixed.",29
81,Mr SCTJLLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"It may not be posjudge sible to fix the scale of contribution them on an exact actuarial basis, but am sure that a reasonable rate could be determined, even though it might mean a somewhat larger contribution from the Treasury than is made under the general scheme. I object to distinctions being made in this matter between various branches of the Service. The practice granting pensions without any contribu70 tions from the beneficiaries is unsound; but if we are prepared to apply it to the judges, we should, to be consistent, move all the conditions that govern granting of old-age pensions. I do not desire to compare class with class, or the highly paid with the poorly paid officials in our Service, but I contend that no distinction should be made between them. Honourable members know that persons with very small incomes are debarred from participating in our old-age pension scheme. I realise that the amendment is moved with the object of giving the judges an incentive to retire at the age 70, or a few years later.",29
82,Mr DUNOAN,CONCILIATION AND,HUGHES - The effect of it be to reduce the incentive for then) and they to remain in office.,29
83,Mr SCTJLLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"It comes to the same thing. It makes it worthwhile in their is own interests to ' retire, altho\igh appointed for life. It is a way of getting over the constitutional difficulty; but I object to the general principle, and I shall vote against the clause.",29
84,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Oxley) [2.27] - I # with close attention *to the speech of the honourable member for Boothby are (Mr Duncan-Hughes) in support of his at amendment, the intention of which is to the reduce a judge's pension by one-tenth for every year that he remains in office after case he reaches the age of 70 years with the to encourage early retirement. I am afraid, however, that it will not have the to see desired effect. Let us take the case of a Chief Judge, drawing a salary of £3,000 a year, who retires at the age of 70 or at other ages up to 80 years. I am sorry I have not been able, in the time at my disposal, to ascertain the percentage of the population that reaches that age, but I know that very few do so, and I am sure that a very small percentage of the perconsons appointed to this court will attain that age. Under the amendment, if a retired at the age of 70, his salary for would stop immediately, but in the ten I following years he could draw £15,000 in pension, and that would be his total remuneration ; if he retired at the age of 71, he would receive £3,000 in salary, and £12,150 in pension for the remaining nine years, or a total remuneration of £15,150, which is £15 0 more than he would have of received had he retired when he attained years of age; but if he retired at ths age of 75 years, he would receive £15,000 in salary, and £ 3 , 7 5 0 - in pension, or a retotal remuneration of £18,750, which the would be £3,750 more than he would have received had he retired at 70 years.",29
85,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"But he would have enjoyed only five years' leisure, instead of ten.",29
86,Mr BAYLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I shall deal with that point in a moment. If he retired at the age of 79 he would draw £27,000 in salary for nine years, and £150 in pension for the tenth year; or a total remuneration of £27,150, which would be £12,150 more of than he would have received had he retired at 70 years. It must be clear, therefore, no judge would think of retiring at 70 years of age to obtain any pecuniary advantage. I h e only inducement for retirement would be, as the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) has pointed out, the desire to enjoy that leisure which he would not have if he remained on the bench. I am unable to see that the amendment would achieve the desire of the honourable member who has moved it .",29
87,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"Balaclava) [2.30] - Un fortunately I did not hear the observations of the honourable member for Boothby in support of his amendment. I should like to say to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley)' that, although I followed his analysis with great care, experience teaches me that we ought not to be impressed by calculations such as he made. I know of State judges who would have retired at least at the age of 70 years if pensions had been available to them. They would have been, only too glad, in view of the state of their health, and the inroads made upon it by the work of the bar and the bench, to retire then. The Victorian pensions f u n d , however, does not permit of more than two judges drawing the full pension at the same time. When a man has had a long career at the bar, and, generally a lucrative one, followed by a period of strenuous service on the bench, the queslic servants. tion of pounds, shillings and pence is not. of so much concern to him as his own health and comfort. Although judges may be inclined to retire at 70 years of age, the y are sometimes unable to do so, unless some penpublic sion is provided upon which they can exist. I speak as a believer in pensions. I am unlike the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) in that respect, and I take leave to doubt whether the honorlegal able member reasoned with his usual care in instituting an analogy between judges and old-age pensioners, or ordinary memmiddle life. bers of the Public Service. whether there is one in 50 of the of Australia who did not make a huge pecuniary sacrifice in accepting a position on the bench. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) could, no doubt, if he felt inclined, tell us story of many men who voluntarily for themselves. feited large incomes, not to enjoy a period of leisure by service on the bench, but to secure the distinction and renown i their profession which a transfer from the bar to the bench would give them. I know of one judge who cannot, with propriety, be named, who accepted a salary of £3,000 a year and forfeited an income of £7,000 a year. It was his ambition before he finished his career to serve a period on the bench. In giving judges salaries of £3,000 or £3,500 a year, we nope to secure the services of the best men before they have begun to slip down the western hill of life. Judgeships have, on many occasions, been refused in Australia because the men to whom appointments were offered did not feel justified in giving up the incomes they were earning at the bar for a judicial salary of barely half the amount. It was that reason, doubtless, which induced the men who laid the foundations of the judiciaries of the States to make provision for pensions for judges in most cases. The honourable member for Melbourne (L)r. Maloney) will bear me out when I say that, even when pensions generally were withdrawn in this State, those payable to the judges were allowed to stand. It was felt that there should be an inducement to a man, in the autumn of life, to retire from the bench,. rather than continue to serve when his faculties were failing.",30
88,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,That applies to all pub,30
89,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"To suggest that there is any analogy between judges and ordinary members of the Public Service is entirely wrong. We endeavour to secure servants when they are young, and the younger the better. We do not proceed on that principle in the appointment of judges. We look for in them an extensive experience in the various walks of life, because we want ripened judgment, and, in the case of average men, we cannot expect that before they had passed I doubt Mr BLAKELEY - We could not expect judges it by catching them young.",30
90,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; when they are young they are not suitably equipped for the work we require of them. In the the matter of pensions, the judges stand by They for f e it big incomes by their transfer from one branch of the law to another, and, if we want the best men n to preside over the courts of the Commonwealth, we should be prepared to provide substantial pensions for them or to give .them larger salaries. Whatever view I may take of other provisions of the bill, I am very glad that a pension provision has been inserted in this measure, and in .another upon which we shall shortly de. liberate. I have not discussed the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby, because 1 did not hear the .arguments with which he recommended it to the committee. It occurs to me that, if we can, we should prevent men from staying too long on bench. I say, with very great respect of a number of men who lived to a ripe old age, that we have had distinguished men in this State, some of whom bid fair to tarnish the reputation which posterity might otherwise have attributed to them by lagging a little superfluous on the stage, because of certain circumstances. I am one who, when I had the privilege to speak for the Government in - this House, accepted the responsibility of bringing down a measure to provide the first Commonwealth pension for the first Chief Justice of Australia. The late Sir Samuel Griffith was one of the most prominent men in the Federal movement, in the development of the great northern State of Queensland, and in the shaping of the early institutions associated with the Federal judiciary. When he was stricken down by illness, it seemed to me a cruel thing to ask him to remain on the bench and endeavour to discharge the . then terribly irksome duties of the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. I submitted a measure providing for a pension for him, and it was carried by this Parliament. I then said that the time would inevitably come when the whole of the judges of the High Court of Australia, and of the other courts associated with it, would, if the Parliament were wise, enjoysimilar privileges to those enjoyed by other men .who in the past, in like positions, rendered distinguished service to the nation.",30
91,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,Melbourne) [2.36] I shall not delay the committee long in speaking to the amendment. against pensions for judges altogether. I think that the honour of the position should be sufficient to induce any man to accept an appointment to the bench. Mr G. A. FBANCIS - What about the inducement to members of the House of Representatives ?,31
92,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"What has that to do with the question? Has the honourable member ever heard of a member of the House of Representatives being given a pension? Mr ISCUU.IN - We have not a life tenure, either.",31
93,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"We have to be examined every three years to see if we are the fit to continue our duties. No judge of whom I have ever read has had to go through such an examination. A policeman is examined periodically, and, if I had my way, I would have medical men examined every five years after they had reached 40 years of age. I agree with the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) that judges should always be properly cared for. There have been times when county court judges in this State were not given a square deal, but the judges of the Supreme Court were held to be sacrosanct. We had an unfortunate experience of pensions in the Public Service of Victoria. The position here was worse even than that in America when pensions were being paid to people who claimed to have taken part in the War of Independence. I had figures in connection with the matter taken out, and they showed that in Victoria, with a population of 200,000 less than the population of New South Wales, we paid more in pensions to public servants than was paid in all the other States combined.",31
94,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"The Victorian pension list rose to nearly £400,000 a year at one' stage.",31
95,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"We paid for pensions in Victoria £2 for every £1 paid in New South Wales. In my view, we should pay judges well during the term of their service. When they retire they can claim the old-age pension, just as any other member of the community is entitled to do. We give our old-age pensioners a pension of 20s. per week, and the Government proposes in this bill to give judges, by way of pension, more for I am one day than old-age pensioners receive in a month. We are under no great obligation to our judges for assisting to simplify and cheapen the administration of justice. In a recent divorce case the proceedings were continued for 21 days at a cost of over £5,000 for one side. That is a glaring example of the cost of legal proceedings. It will be agreed that every one who goes to court does not get justice. Privileged men are in our courts permitted to malign witnesses, and to say to them what they would not dare to say outside a court. The whole system of law should be made more simple. Judges in Denmark, where, perhaps, more justice is dispensed than in any other, country in Europe, do not receive huge salaries. No one who knows anything of the history of Denmark will impugn its courts of justice. I intend to vote for the amendment, and I am glad that a member of the profession to which the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) belongs has proposed an amendment which will give more justice than is provided for by the bill . On one occasion, I was sued by a land agent for commission alleged to be due to him . I had received a letter from him, but I had never seen the man. In court, when I was giving my evidence, the presiding judge told me to get down out of the box. The judge then asked the land agent, "" Will you have a verdict against Dr Maloney or against Mr Godfrey, the solicitor ?"" My solicitor strongly resented the judge's action, and carried the matter before him in chambers, and the agent did not dare to proceed further in court. This occupant of the bench, who manifestly was unfit for his position,' drew a pension. I do not object to any man receiving a pension, provided that all can be treated alike. If the people could by referendum declare that the aged and in valid should be paid a pension equal to that to be paid to the judges I should be happy indeed.",31
96,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.46] - Obviously , if we are to attract to the Commonwealth judiciary men of the calibre necessary to ensure its efficiency, provision must be made for the payment of pensions. When a man has reached that period of life when his faculties are failing, and he is becoming less competent to discbarge his high judicial functions, he should retire. But the Constitution provides that members of the Federal judiciary must be appointed for life, although in certain circumstances a judge may be removed by the Governor General, on resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Possibly in the near future the people in their wisdom will amend the Constitution by prescribing a retiring age for judges, but u n t i l that is done, this Parliament should not attempt to achieve indirectly an object which cannot be constitutionally achieved directly.",32
97,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,Why not ask the people now to amend the Constitution ?,32
98,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND,"For reasons I have stated previously, the referendum proposals to which this chamber has already agreed must not be mixed up with other suggested amendments of the Constitution. Believing that it would not be right to attempt to evade the Constitution by this indirect method of providing pensions, the Government cannot accept the amendment, but is quite agreeable that individual members shall vote upon it as they please.",32
99,Mr MANN,CONCILIATION AND,"Perth) [2.50] - The object of the amendment is to offer an inducement to judges to retire at 70 years of age; but the figures quoted by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr . Bayley) indicate that it would have the opposite effect. Therefore, it would defeat its own object, which is one with which most honourable members sympathize. To men occupying judicial positions at 70 years of age the failure of their powers may not be so apparent as to others; in fact, the older a man gets the less inclined is he to admit any in firmity. It is highly desirable, therefore, that no extra encouragement should be given to a man to remain in a responsible position after his faculties have consider-, ably declined. I regret that I cannot support the amendment ",32
100,Mr DUNCAN,CONCILIATION AND,HUGHES (Boothby) [2.52] - I understand that the honourable member for Yarra is supporting the amendment because he is opposed to the payment of pensions to judges.,32
101,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am supporting it for the reasons put forward by the honourable member; but I am opposed to the whole clause, because I do not believe in the proposal to pay pensions to the judges.",32
102,Mr DUNCAN,CONCILIATION AND,"HUGHES - On that point I join issue with the honourable member for reasons that have been stated by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . The objection has been voiced that the amendment is an indirect method of removing judges from the bench. I prefer to say that it will remove - or reduce - the present in ducement to them to the bench. Under the drafted, a judge is encouraged to consub-section tinue in office as long as possible, because he can draw his full salary up any age, and a full pension upon retirenot beunderoffice ment. If my amendment be agreed to, this he will receive his full salary u n t i l retires, and, if he is then over 70, a reand duced pension thereafter. The AttorneyJudge."" General said that this proposal should be deferred until the constitutional session. There are obvious reasons why that should not be done. fore that session can be held the judges of the Arbitration Court will have appointed, and they will naturally resent any suggestion at a constitutional session that the terms of their engagement shall be varied and their pensions reduced.

I understand that that term is applied when the Attorney-General really intervenes to argue a case before a court. In this case that is not the intention; it is desired merely to give to interested parties an opportunity to be heard. If the Attorney General were to intervene, and argue the matter personally, or instruct counsel to argue it on his behalf, the Government would be taking sides in the dispute. That meaning may be read into the clause as it stands.",34
116,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.14] - It is not intended that that the Attorney-General shall do more than issue a notice. The clause goes on to appli- provide that an order may be made permitting applicants to be heard. It draws a distinction between such applicants and the parties to the dispute. It is certainly not intended that the Attorney-General shall become a party, and be heard upon the determination of any question. I believe that the clause, as worded, is sufficiently clear, but if any honourable member can su«»srest words that will make it clearer I am prepared to give the matter consideration.",34
117,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"Balaclava) [3.15] - I am act so much interested in the amendment as I am in certain words in the last two lines of the proposed new sub-section under discussion. The principle of intervention for the purpose - clearly outlined in the subsequent part of the clause is a wise one to adopt, and it should have been adopted years ago. Why not delete all the words after "" court,"" so as to authorize the Attorney-General in the public interest to in tervene in any proceedings before the court after giving the prescribed notice in writing?",34
118,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,But why allow intervention on any subject?,35
119,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"And why not? all the present interests of arbitration confined to standard hours and the basic wage?

121,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"They , may be the principal, but they are not the only questions. Provision for the intervention of the Crown is made in the Victorian law relating to divorce, and it is not restricted, but enables the judicial adviser of the Crown to intervene whenever he considers that it is in the public interest to do so.",35
122,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"That is a different kind of intervention from that provided for in the bill,",35
123,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"It is, and it is not. Although the procedure and intention are different, that provision permits the adviser of the Crown to inform the court of certain views, and to make the application direct.",35
124,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,But that 'is not provided for in this bill .,35
125,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"That is so, but I am asking the honourable member to notice certain important differences, as well as some striking similarities. The right of intervention in divorce matters, although it must be exercised in a different manner from that provided for in the bill , is intended to be used for the same purpose-to protect the public interest. There may be matters, other than those mentioned in the clause, in which vention may be desirable. I suggest the honourable the Attorney-General that a certain order from the court. the concluding words of the proposed sub-section should be deleted so' as to widen the provision and provide more facilities for interested parties, by the will of the court,- to be heard.",35
126,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"East Sydney) [ 3 . 1 7 ] - I cannot understand why the honourable the Attorney-General is so anxious to confine this provision to matters affecting the basic wage and the standard of hours. No right should be given to the Crown to intervene. The influence of a government representative in the court is powerf u l and difficult to resist. If the Crown Are interferes in a case, judges naturally become nervous, because they are dependent on the Crown, and there is then a possibility of the decision of the court being materially altered to meet the views of the Crown. Although I prefer that the Crown should not have the right to intervene, if that right is alTo give the right to interfere only in matters of wages and hours, which are burning questions at the present moment, will convey to the minds of some people that the Government is already taking sides. Judges Should decide on the evidence submitted to them, and in that event there is no necessity for the Crown to interfere. We should have confidence in the judges of the court. The proposal will not commend itself to those who have to appear before the court, or to the public. It will have a tendency to protract proceedings before the court, and that is the very thing we are trying to prevent. The employers- I do not blame fchem-will fight every case that comes before the court. Vested interests are very powerful, and the proposal will encourage them to use their power to in fluence decisions of the court. If honourable members had had experience of vested interests, they would not give the Attorney-General this power. Two of the States have come to a decision regarding the standard of hours, and on that subject the vested interests of Victoria alone would be sumcient to compel the Attorney-General to intervene in the court proceedings.",35

128,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,Is not that provision a dead-letter ?,36
129,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"In practice, it is. To increase the powers of intervention in this clause would mean that all the matters as to which the Attorney-General intervenes would be heard by three judges. I suggest that section 39 of the act enables the Crown to protect the in terests of the public in any case where it is thought that an injustice or serious in jury has been done.

My reply to the inquiry of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), in his second reading speech as to the effect of a ruling given by the judges in such circumstances, is that it would directly affect only the specific dispute before the court, but indirectly it would be of value in guiding the judges when sitting separately. It would not be a common rule in the ordinary acceptation of that term, for there is no constitutional power to pro 1 vide a common rule. [3.27] - I",36

136,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling) [3.42] I move That 'in proposed new section 18B (3) the court. words ""registered under this act"" be inserted after the word "" employees."" It would then readUpon publication of the notice in the Gazette any person, or organization ciation of employers or employees registered under this act. may apply to the court liberty to be heard and the court may, if of opinion that the applicant is interested the determination of the question, permit applicant to be heard and tc examine and cross-examine witnesses. At present, employers' organizations not subject to the same responsibilities and obligations as the employees' ganizations. Recently, the Australian Workers Union was obliged to appear fore Mr Justice Powers simply because an oflicer of the Pastoralists Association position. handed a. document to its general secretary at the head office of the union. Australian Workers Union could not, simply as that, oblige the pastoralists appear before the court.",37
137,Mr ABBOTT,CONCILIATION AND,"Why is that? AYES. Mr BLAKELEY - P o r the simple reason that the pastoralists' organization is not registered. Because the Australian Workers Union is registered, it has to meet heavy responsibilities. I claim that similar responsibilities should be placed upon the employers' organizations.' Under the existing law thisis not so. Recently the organization to which I belong spent £950 in postage alone in sending out claims to respondents ",37
138,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,Every respondent has to be served?,37
139,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,Yes .,37
140,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"There is not only service of the claim required, but service of any variation of the claim. NOES.",37
141,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I give this as an illustration of our responsibilities. We go to the court as a responsible body. We have our officers to do the work. The respondents on the other hand, are represented by secretaries or officers of their organizations, who, though they are not termed "" p a i d agents "" , ' are in court to PAIRS. represent members of their organization. A great deal of argument took place during the hearing of the case to which I refer as to the righ t of these people to appear in the picture at all. The judge, wrongfully, in my opinion, refused to sustain the contention of the representative of the Australian Workers Union that Mr Allen, secretary to the respondent organization, was not entitled to appear - before the Briefly, we say that whatever responsibilities are imposed upon one section of the community should be imposed on the other section.",37
142,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Reid) [3.47] - The or assoamendment submitted by the honourable for member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) is it is intended to meet a complaint made by the in whole of the trade union movement of the Australia. I realise that there might be legal difficulties in giving effect to it . The are Attorney-General (Mr Latham) from his experience of this particular jurisdicortion is aware that this deals with one of the provisions which is a f r u it f u l source beof expense and delay, and something should be done to improve the present",37
143,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney The General) [3.481 - This is a question as which raises difficulty owing to the cirto cumstances that there are only twelve registered employers' associations and 146 registered employees' associations. I do not think that the Government can accept the amendment, but it will give it sideration. The Government full y appreappear ciates the diflSculties which have been ferred to with regard to the service claims, but that is no reason for preventing employers from putting their case in the best possible way. I shall give sideration to the amendment, and if find it at all possible, the difficulty which the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has referred will be dealt with in another place. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 9 to 12 agreed to.",37
144,Mr SCTJLLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Y a r r a ) move That the following new clause he inserted:9A. Section 27 of the principal act amended by inserting after the word "" dispute "" the words, "" or of any ings for the variation of an award or in relation to an award."" The section now provides that no bararbitration rister, solicitor, or paid agent may in the court unless by consent of both parties. This applies only to the original dispute, but not to the hearing of an application for the variation of an award or any other proceedings in relation to",38
145,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.51] - The effect of the new clause proposed would be much more fartions reaching than the honourable member Yarra (Mr Scullin) contemplates or i tends. It would prevent a man being titled defended by a member of the legal prothink fession in a criminal prosecution for breach of an award. Surely it would be fair to deprive a man of legal assistmade ance in all proceedings in relation to award. - Mr Scullin - That is not intended, and I am prepared to accept the omission of the words "" o r in relation to award "" from my proposed new clause.",38
146,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"I thought the honoremployee. able member would concede the force my objection. The new clause proposes an amendment of the section of the act which is supposed to exclude the legal profession from the Arbitration Court. The section readsOn the hearing or determination of any industrial dispute an organization may be represented by a member or officer of any organization, and any party not being an organization may be represented by an ployee of that party; but no party shall (except by consent of all the parties) be sented by counsel or solicitor or paid agent. What happens is that the employers have conemployees who are in fact lawyers. They in court, not as counsel or solicitor, rebut as employees, and they put i h their of whole time as industrial advocates.",38
147,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,They are paid agents.,38
148,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"They are employees, conand as such they may appear. There are I many men on both sides who put in the to whole of their time as paid agents, as every one knows. But because men are omcers of a union, although devoting most of their time to industrial advocacy, they are not regarded as paid agents. On the. other side, lawyers in the employ of employers' organizations, are able to appear [ 3 . 5 0 ] - I as employees, though not as counsel or solicitors. Men have actually gone through a complete course of legal training to is qualify themselves for industrial advocacy, particularly in the State courts, and proceedhave abstained from procuring their admission to the profession in order that they may continue to practise in the courts. The section which the appear honourable member for Yarra seeks to amend is one which obviously requires further consideration when a full revision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is - before Parliament. It would not it . be proper to amend it in the patchwork - way proposed by the honourable member in dealing with applications for variaof awards. The section raises the for question of the extent to which the n - parties to an industrial dispute are ento obtain the skilled assistance they proper. An application for a variaa tion of an award is very frequently made not upon a small point, and is commonly in order that an award may work an smoothly. There are no long proceedings associated with such applications. It is often more convenient for the parties, when applying possibly before a judge in an a distant State, to send a solicitor to the court, than an oflicer or I ask the committee not of to accept the amendment, because it does not deal with the whole question, and would impose a considerable amount of inconvenience and additional expense in the settlement of small matters between the parties",38
149,Mr SCTJLLLN,CONCILIATION AND,"Y a r r a ) [3.57] - The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) has said that the use of the words "" or in relation emto an a w a r d "" would deprive a man reprecharged with the breach of an award of the assistance of counsel. That was not contemplated. The arguments advanced by the Attorney-General apply with equal force to section 27 of the act as it now stands, and if he feels so strongly on the matter, it is amazing to me that he has not attempted the repeal of that section, which has stood since the original act was passed.",38
150,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,We are endeavouring to avoid controversial matters as far as possible for the present.,39
151,Mr SCTJLLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"It is logical to contend that there should attach to any application for the variation of an award the same conditions as those which applied to the hearing of the original dispute. Parliament has always confirmed its intention to, as far as possible, keep legal arguments out of the consideration of industrial disputes. It is felt that in the hearing of such cases the arguments should be submitted, not by legal men, but by those on both sides who know the industry affected. I ask leave to amend my proposed new clause by omitting the words "" or in relation to an award."" New clause, by leave, amended accordingly.

152,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Y a r r a ) [4.5] - I move That the following new clause be inserted :9B. Section forty A of the principal act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph :"" (c) assign to the Board of Reference any matter affecting the harmonious relationship of the parties to any order or award of the court."" At the present time the board of reference can deal only with the matters specified by the court, and the purpose of the amendment is to have a board of reference that can deal with disputes that may arise in regard to questions not mentioned in the dispute upon which the court has made an award. Often questions that were not included in a dispute upon which the court has arbitrated are very real causes of discontent and trouble. The effect of the amendment would be to ... 15 bring into play real conciliation and pre... 34 vent many of the irritations and stoppages of work that frequently occur. 19",39
153,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong-Attorney AYES. General) [ 4 . 6 ] - I agree with the object of the proposed new clause, and, if it could be effective, I would have no hesitation in accepting it . The desire of the honourable member for Yarra is to permit to be assigned to a board of reference any inharmonious conditions not covered by an award of the court. That NOES. would be a wise provision. But, unfortunately, the power of the court and boards of reference are limited to the subject of a dispute, and it is impossible to provide any means for dealing with other matters affecting harmonious relations.",39
154,Mr COLEMAN,CONCILIATION AND,Not even with the consent of the parties.,39
155,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Not in a way that would give legal effect to their agreement. The acceptance of the amendment would only. mislead the parties into proceedings before the board of reference, and any decision of the board in regard to matters which were not originally in dispute, although accepted at the time by the parties, would, under the present constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, be entirely invalid.",39
156,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"E'ast Sydney) [4.8] Members of the Labour party dread industrial disturbances, and are desirous of bringing into existence any machinery that will, promote kindly feelings between employers and employees. The honourable member for Yarra has shown great ingenuity in proposing this new provision, and he should receive the support of the Government. Surely the intention of Parliament is to prevent industrial quarrels, and to smooth away any bad feeling that may arise between employers and employees.",40
157,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"I would accept the clause if it would do any good, but it would only cause trouble.",40
158,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,There is no reason why we should not make an experiment in the direction proposed. I feel confident that the Attorney-General will regret his nonacceptance of the clause. Proposed new clause negatived.,40
159,Mr SCTJLLIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Yarra) [4.14] - I move That the following new clause be inserted:90. The principal act is amended by insertupon ing after section 22(3) Upon a registered organization lodging a claim as to any matter upon which the court is competent to deal, the court shall cause such matter to be published in the Gazette which shall be deemed to be sufficient notice to the respondents involved in the matter lodged in court, and the court will in accordance with any ther publication in the Gazette fixing a date for the hearing of the matter so thereupon proceed to hear such matter."" In some disputes, several thousand persons must be served with notices to appear before the court, and this amendment proposes to allow the summons to be by notice in the Gazette. I understand that the serving of a log by publication in the Gazette would not legally constitute a dispute, but it would save a considerable amount of trouble and expense. In one case, 9,000 respondents had to be served with copies of the log, and later with summonses and other processes. That involved great cost for printing and postage. As clause 8 provides that, in any proceeding affecting standard hours - and the basic wage, in which the Attorney-General intervenes, a notice in the Gazette shall be sufficient to enable all interested persons to appear before the court, I suggest that a Gazette notice by the Crown should be sufficient to summon disputants to appear before the court. . Mr LATHAM (Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.15] - It would be a sensible aet to adopt such a provision if we could be certain that it would prove effective. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), however, has shown quite clearly that it would not dispense with the major portion of the expense that is now incurred in the ascertainment of the respondents in an industry, the printing of the log-whic h is often a bulky document-and its service upon the respondents by registered post. The amendment is designed to make advertisement in a newspaper do duty as service upon probably hundreds, or even thousands of individuals. Such a provision could probably be made if our powers were greater than those which we possess. Under our existing powers, the procedure is by way pf arbitration; and arbitration means a proceeding between parties who have an opportunity of being heard. It cannot be said that it is certain that the validity of this provision would be upheld. It might be; but would it not be better to wait until the people have pronounced the proposals that we intend to subnut to them?",40
160,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND,"If the court had the power to make a common rule, it would not matter very much.",40
161,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"It would not matter fur- at all. If proceedings were instituted upon this basis it might be held to be inlodged effective in an arbitration case possibly after the proceedings had continued for months, or even after an award had been made. I do not profess to be certain upon the matter, but there is an element of danger in it, and the results might be very serious.

162,Dr EARLE PAGE,COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTBIAL,"Cowper-Trea surer) [ 4 . 3 1 ] - I am pleased to be in a position to inform honourable members that the sale of expropriated properties in . . 32 the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, ..12 supplementary to that effected on the 31st March, ""1926, has been brought to a most .. 20 successful conclusion. It will be rememAYES. bered that the first group of expropriated properties offered for sale on the 31st March, 1926, comprised 47 plantations, 91 trading stations, 11 bungalows and business premises, and 4 lots of virgin land, and that, of these, 100 lots, officially valued at £234,588, realized £272,365, leaving 53 lots unsold. Of the latter, 15 lots were withdrawn from sale for various reasons, and the Government decided that the-remainder were to be resubmitted for tender, with the official valuations disclosed. The tenders for this residue closed on the 15th June, 1926, and have now been dealt with. Of 38 perties offered for sale, 30 have been sold arefor £202,556, as against the official valuation of £162,511. A decision on tenders for three of the properties is pending consideration of certain technical points that have arisen, and two of the properties are being resumed for administrative purposes. There thus remain, in addition to virgin lands that are being withheld from sale for the present, only the following minor lots in the hands of the Government out of the first group of properties submitted for sale:-On e trading station, valued at £21; the Kokopo Hotel, valued at £4,369; and one bungalow, valued at £201- a total of £4,591. Honourable members will be pleased to note that up to date 130 properties, officially valued at £397,159, have been sold for £474,921. A gratifying feature of the sale is that among the successful tenderers are to be found many returned soldiers, the majority of whom have been engaged on plantations in New Guinea as employees of the Expropriation Board. There appears to be no doubt but that this highly successful sale of valuable properties marks a distinct advance in the economic progress of the Mandated Territory. The catalogue of the second group of expropriated properties to be offered for sale is now in the hands of the printer, and should be available early in July, 1926.",41
