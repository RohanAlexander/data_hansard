This are in. It has billions of dollars in unfunded shonky tax that cannot even raise money as such as the Gateway, in my electorate of incompetent government. This is before we start 'no ifs or buts' surplus that the Treasurer appropriations are just a hint of the extra election year promises. The iconic Gateway project being conducted needed boost to infrastructure. Driven by the road freight over the next decade, coupled terminals, this billion-dollar project involves surrounding Perth Airport and the freight and This is arguably WA's most important area development, growth and continued economic However, this is just one of the joint Commonwealth-state turmoil by a thoroughly irresponsible government.

That is what these mining communities. If we don't have investments. I repeat: he said, 'If we don't have the investments.' I asked the Treasurer during mining tax has raised less than 10 per cent WA project, the government would pay for insistence that without the tax investments seemed unable to answer this simple question, in the 2012-13 budget. Where the money will question entirely that the Treasurer seems is at risk due to the Treasurer's and the Prime a premise particularly insulting and damaging The government has paraded its ministers barely rate a headline.

I would like to reiterate once again my During Wednesday's question time, the Treasurer important infrastructure development in my own essential that the Treasurer come forward informing the House and the people of Swan this project. Too often during this parliament cancelled or delayed indefinitely. Too often without any increase in quality led by Tony Abbott, recognised that the of Western Australia and Australia as the Perth area but in my seat of Swan. As such, project without introducing a mining tax that However, the Labor government used this of the people of Swan and Western Australia, be incredibly unpopular.

10,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am pleased Nos 3 and 4. When we consider the appropriations the general budgetary position and the government's we know, that performance has been dismal. There deficits which this government has produced vastly larger than originally projected. Of were boldly promised there would be a surplus told the parliament and the nation in May last come out and admit that it could not be done. The overall budgetary position is grim, basic incompetence. But, even more troublingly, in the budget numbers because of extra spending Network Company, the Clean Energy Finance in the budget bottom line. In other words, accounting trick. They are spending this year, dollars more than is contained in the budget about. But although that money is not included be spent and has to be paid for. How is it borrowing. The question therefore which presents government is engaging in this accounting trick? is not including within what is colloquially underlying cash balance significant spending, I want to make three points focusing particularly relation to the government's equity investment The three areas I want to cover are: firstly, NBN; secondly, to look at what is Labor's stated budget bottom line in the underlying cash balance; evidence is increasingly clear that the accounting underlying cash balance is threadbare indeed. Let us start with the question of precisely the National Broadband Network. As at 30 June was the cumulative injection of equity by been spent over three years since 2009-10-in period almost $1 billion a year was being which was not included in the published budget the door every day and still On just $1 billion a year so far, you might is a serious matter, but the key point is it gets 2012-13 the amount to be spent is $4.672 billion, it is closer to $7 billion and in 2015-16 it period there is another $5 billion which this four years including this year, $20 billion but none of that money is included in the figures to rise to speak on appropriations bills bills we obviously consider questions of budgetary strategy and performance. As is no other word for the shameful string of year after year-deficits which turn out to be course, this year, 2012-13, was the year that we of $1½ billion. That was what Treasurer Swan year, but before the end of last year he had to reflecting mismanagement, lack of discipline and the true position is worse than that revealed on entities like the National Broadband Corporation and others which is not included the government's figures are based upon an and for several years to come, billions of bottom line-the headline number that we all talk in the printed documents, the money is still to to be paid for? It is to be paid for through itself is: what is the basis on which the What is the basis on which the government called the budget bottom line or strictly the and is that accounting basis justified? on the accounting trickery being used in in the National Broadband Network Company. to review exactly how much is being spent on excuse for not including that money in the and thirdly, to make the point that the basis for not including that money in the how much money has been and is to be spent on 2012, $2.832 billion had been spent and that the Commonwealth into NBN Co. That money had other words, on average over that three-year spent on the National Broadband Network, money figures. Yet those are still dollars going out dollars that have to be repaid. say: is that really a serious matter? Of course it a lot more serious from here on in, because in in 2013-14 it is over $6 billion, in 2014-15 is almost $5 billion. Beyond the forward estimates government discloses it intends to spend. In the will be spent on the National Broadband Network, which Treasurer Swan has presented to the parliament and the people of Australia as he the government will end up with at the end of the year. Let us turn to the question of whether there the government is taking to spending all this figures, not including it in the budget bottom this expenditure in the bottom line? Why is National Broadband Network Company can be in the case of the National Broadband Network being taken-in fact, it is a technique that They have used it quite extensively and they Corporation which according to the government's businesses seeking funds to get innovative ground. Of course parenthetically we might note a venture capital business investing in proposals viable investments. One can quite reasonably very much of that money generating a positive return. Nevertheless that has not troubled the government treatment in relation to most of that $10 billion being pumped into the National Broadband Network. Finance and Deregulation told Senate estimates included in the budget bottom line. Following media release in which she quoted the words of for not including that money in the budget bottom line: So the extent to which the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Government's policy, then the majority of its activities That of course is the same rationale that Broadband Network. The theory is that these designed to secure a financial return. The theory into a business venture which is going to and in turn for the taxpayers of Australia. A typical feature of this particular accounting separate legal entity, typically as the acquisition done with the National Broadband Network Energy Finance Corporation and a similar technique Track Corporation Ltd. If you are a government ordinary annual expenditures, what ought to routine expenditure and the spending of government, technique is obviously extremely attractive money into ventures which are politically desirable, people that you are spending that money. Of What we need to do is look at the underlying treat the payment of this money as an investment. How valid is it to accept the assumption cash into one of these ventures such as makes his claim as to the amount of deficit that is a good accounting basis for the approach that money but not including it in the published line. What is Labor's excuse for not including it that a major expenditure program like the simply excluded from the budget? It is not just Company that we have seen this approach the Rudd-Gillard government are quite keen on. have also done it with the Clean Energy Finance press release will invest $10 billion in clean energy proposals and technologies off the that the ripper business strategy here is to be that the private sector does not think will be raise very serious doubts about the likelihood of and they have used the same accounting as they are using in respect of the money In 2011, officials of the Department of that most of that $10 billion will not be that estimates finance minister Wong put out a one of the officials explaining the justification is undertaking investments, and that's the will not impact upon the budget bottom line. is being followed in the case of the National are expenditures which are investments is that this is money that is being invested generate a positive return for the Commonwealth strategy is that the money is allocated to a of equity in that entity. That is what is being Co., that what is being done with the Clean has been used with the Australian Rail which is tempted to hide what ought to be be moneys included in your budget as part of the then the use of this particular accounting because it lets you pump a significant amount of but you do not need to tell the Australian course, the accounting treatment is one thing. economic substance and ask how valid it is to that every dollar the Commonwealth puts in in the National Broadband Network Co. is being exchanged for a dollar of equity in the National value. Or in fact, when we look at the substance equity is actually worth a whole lot less because the National Broadband Network Co. taxpayers can have no confidence at all that eventually going to be returned? Let us be clear: be established for this accounting treatment question: how good an investment is the National The evidence is clear. It is a dud investment. extremely badly and no objective observer generate the requisite positive return based with the financial track record. In 2010-11, NBN Co. lost $323 million. cumulative loss by the time of the closing off million. To that point, taxpayers had put putting in $2.8 billion and in three years roughly of that has disappeared, roughly a third of Co., $900 million just splashed up against trusting, you would have to be remarkably credulous to come back. Then let us look at the operational track losing money so far but it's performing so well course it's all going to come good and the ourselves that NBN Co. is supposed to pass had passed less than one per cent of the 12.2 the way, that is after 30 per cent of the time when it is supposed to finish at the end of 2020. less than one per cent of the premises that passed. What about the number of people served 2012 there were 10,400 premises with an active number when this is a project that has been spent $2.8 billion plus the additional money year, as we know, there will be another almost You might well say, 'The NBN Co. assures premises, so they are starting to make a bit from NBN Co. so far is a consistent record its first corporate plan, issued in December 317,000 premises with fibre. The actual number consistent record of NBN Co. overprimising and are seeing that again. It is supposed to get In estimates on Tuesday night the company admitted which was contracted to design and connect Broadband Network Co. which has the same of it, can we conclude that each dollar of than a dollar because this is a dud investment, is performing very poorly and because we as the money which is being put into NBN Co. is that is the necessary requirement which must to be valid. Against that backdrop, let us ask the Broadband Network Co. turning out to be? It is an investment which is performing could persuade themselves that it was likely to on the evidence we have seen today. Let us start In 2011-12, NBN Co. lost $504 million. Its of the books last year, 30 June 2012, was $923 in $2.8 billion. What we have had is taxpayers a third of that has vaporised, roughly a third that has gone. On the published accounts of NBN the wall. You would have to be remarkably to believe that that $900 million is going record of NBN Co. You might well say, 'Okay, it's operationally that we are confident that in due money is going to come back.' Let us remind 12.2 million premises. As at December 2012 it million premises that it is supposed to pass. By has elapsed between when it was announced and Over 30 per cent of the time has elapsed, and are supposed to be passed have actually been on the fibre network? As at the end of December fibre connection to the NBN. That is a tiny underway since 2009 and when we have already that has been spent this year. By the end of this $5 billion that will have been pumped into it. us that by June 2013 it is going to pass 341,000 of progress.' Unfortunately, what we have seen of overpromising and underdelivering. Remember: 2010, said that by 30 June 2012 it would pass was roughly one-eighth at 39,000. It is a underdelivering, and all the signs are that we to this 341,000 by June 2013, as I have mentioned. that there is a company called Syntheo, 66,000 premises in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory split into serving areas has yet been switched on. We might also look at how NBN Co. is According to its corporate plan, the number going to increase from 3,500 as of 30 June 2012 they had only reached 10,400.

So we had of the member for Lilley and the Prime Minister biggest mining companies in the world to almost no money.

How could you do that? Well, you go into are doing. You do not take the Treasury people are doing. You sit down and you negotiate Peever and Mr Freyberg from Xstrata and 'Well, the first thing we want is all state course, that immediately opened it up for states royalties is up to the states because the thing actually belongs to the people of the state. people of Australia. Each state, under the Constitution, and therefore is able to set its own royalties-that when they are extracted by companies. That was the first major flaw and there was was just beyond belief. Here we have a mining built-and let us pick a number-for $400 million, iron ore mine or a coalmine. Over the last year In the case of coal, it may have even quadrupled, obviously quadrupled as well. The company has original asset under the taxation scheme so that have to be pulled out at the cost of billions that is not going to be able to do the sorts of people will want wireless, they will want to be tied to a wall. We will ask, 'Are you going to and deeper into debt, that will not do what it that will actually deliver for the people of and Melbourne but one that goes out into the people, not only in Groom and Maranoa but for that the people make the right choice because three years of the destruction of Australian admission by the Treasurer, but we us who understand business and how accounting when the Treasurer designed the RSPT and then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, on the any outcome would have been fine-just tell the negotiating genius and the economic genius going in and negotiating against three of the produce a tax which, as we know, has produced to install pink batts in ceilings, then find billion to get it out.

What states do with their that is forgotten in all of this is that the resource It does not, as the Treasurer says, belong to the owns its own assets, its own resources is to value the value of those resources a little bit of logic in that. The second, though, company with an asset that they may have $500 million, and let us say that it is an the value of that resource has probably trebled. so the value on the day of that mine has already had the opportunity to depreciate the the three miners said, 'I'll tell you what, Mr Treasurer, why don't you allow us to depreciate at today's market value?'

He wrote about the fact, and remarks on the about $36 billion in infrastructure, drawing it again, and not just at its original value but companies that are particularly advantaged large investments, just went snap, 'Thank you will take this one.' The rest is history. But what commodity prices return, whether large companies at the moment is accruing credits and - again, are not at CPI or the bond rate, but at the bond number!

But he should not be entitled to get up in here and use to the NBN being off budget. If you look at not on budget. This has been remarked upon occasions. This is not accounting trickery. This that was managed by the previous government it is not trickery. For them, they employ these and it is not right that it is done and they need mislead, for example, on the pace of the rollout, critical decision on the points of interconnecting, that involves massive redesigns of the network, requires time. They ignore the fact that it signed in recent times, the Telstra NBN agreement, us to roll out the network.

We upgraded, and in other parts it is basically mentioned by them, because there When you look at that infrastructure spend healthcare agreement. In our area, in Western Druitt Hospital we have invested over $2 million equipment, in paediatric equipment and a new for an upgrade of that equipment as well, to Western Sydney where residents, whom I improved equipment.

These schools, in terms of transforming schools, since terms like 'accounting trickery' when he refers most government business enterprises, they are by the minister for finance on a number of is a form of practice to deal with this situation and is also respected by this government, and type of devices to simply mislead the public, to be called out on it.

Our commuters Tugun to Varsity, on the M1, which is seriously further north at Varsity, but it is already quite light rail to come through to the southern Gold system that could achieve the objectives of southern Gold Coast and act as an interim, wait for the light rail to come to the southern cost effective. I have spoken to a number of think that it is something that we again need to transport needs of the southern Gold Coast, overlooked, that there is not a Southport-centric southern end of the Gold Coast continues to wait. I would like to touch on an issue that is many families on the Gold Coast. That is difficulty on the Gold Coast was 5.7 per cent for average of 5.6 per cent, which is comparatively new figures for the southern Gold Coast due analysing to see what we can possibly do with the trend.

Anecdotal evidence would suggest Coast-as it is in many parts of Australia-is is to increase the economic performance of hopefully there will be some major infrastructure us too. The final issue that I can deal with, given the Gold Coast for fly-in fly-out into the mining closed its public submissions for its draft 2031 there will be a light rail network from the However, with regard to heavy rail, the draft and building new rail stations at Yatala, Ormeau This would allow for the introduction of an and Elanora to support the Brisbane to Gold Coast the heavy rail corridor to the Gold Coast Airport for public transport options for the southern Gold for us to wait, and we desperately need to do have to rely, particularly in the section from congested.

35,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I chamber for their valuable contributions on this comment on the natural disaster that we witnessed important issues that arise from that disaster of government. These are important issues to natural disaster, particularly in Queensland, future disasters might be avoided or, at least, Queensland perspective on the disaster Our nation's history and our culture is Nature. We have always been a sunburnt country, rains, and in the months just gone obviously fires throughout the south and flooding rains in the north. Our hearts go out to the residents who are faced embers and ashes of Tasmania, Victoria, Australia. Our thoughts and prayers also go people and their neighbours-in central, hold back the tide that was sadly delivered strength of our nation and culture, the determination heroic battles by Australians with mother nature, hand in the time of need. Thankfully, north Queensland was spared Having lived through Cyclone Yasi and Cyclone Mackay, we offer understanding to those in need hand. Just as the helping hands arrived in that the favour was returned. Certainly, SES Queensland were on the ground in some of the Regional Council staff members were working Bundaberg region and the Burnett region-along SES units in Mackay, Calen, Midge Point and Sarina. I would also note that groups like the Robyn Geiger, made up and donated community people who go through these disasters. When life, you forget the small things. The packets just small things like that to help people out. to north Bundaberg. My electorate did not escape entirely unscathed, no damage to human life or serious damage and destroyed in the Whitsundays. I happened volunteer at the VMR at Airlie Beach when frightening thing to see the size of the waves and I am incredibly proud to represent said, the worse of Mother Nature really does proud to call myself a Queenslander today. thank my colleagues on both sides of the matter of natural disasters. Firstly, I wish to over the last month, then, to address two and which require urgent attention from all levels raise now while the images and impacts of this are fresh in our mind so that issues arising from their impact is minimised. I will provide a more as it affected my electorate of Dawson. embroidered with heroic battles against Mother both relieved and challenged by flooding Mother Nature has challenged our continent with with the task of rebuilding their lives in the New South Wales and, more recently, Western out from my electorate in north Queensland to the southern and western Queensland-who could not by ex-tropical Cyclone Oswald. We have the and resolve forged through centuries of and the bonds of mateship and of lending a from the worse of ex-tropical Cyclone Oswald. Ului, and the devastating 2008 flood in today and we are also there to lend a helping north Queensland during our time of need, I note crews and volunteers from right around north worse-hit areas of our state. I note that Mackay in flood-prone areas-particularly around the with a team of SES volunteers from local Mackay Church Of the Nazarene, led by Pastor care packages, which are very good for something horrendous like this happens in your were made up of toothbrushes, soap, shampooThat was done by that church and sent on down as was evidenced by the boats-there was to homes-which were smashed against the rocks to be down there giving a certificate to a the storm system was passing overhead. It was a that were pounding those boats. We actually watched and could do nothing as one of them basically split in two in front of our eyes.

One is the breakdown of the happened everywhere above Bundaberg, although do happen. Somewhere above north Bundaberg there fibre-optic cable there, which was the main and north Queensland. Then, unfortunately, landslide in Kingaroy. We had the main line and no Telstra telecommunications services. was the breakdown of the 000 emergency service That was out for about 20 hours, which was distressed not only by that event but to read a Daily Mercury-that there was actually an the time that those emergency numbers were with a serious lung condition-collapsed in her 12 hours on the floor, trying to get help by These things route through to a nominated when they do not get to those people they go When help arrived it was in the form of her and took her to the hospital but, three days and the complications that she already had. the same time.

It is quite with the daughters of both of the people who together that will come to this place and and the Minister for Broadband, and the Minister for Emergency Management to ensuring that this does not happen again. There with that triple-0 number. I have already No-one is blaming Telstra for that incident, but to triple 0 at that time of need, and the fact as a result of that, is quite distressing. The second issue is the Don River, which years of erosion from the hills upstream, there deposit is right near the mouth of the river, island' now. It effectively provides a blockage sea. A five-metre flood in that river used to that a 4.5-metre flood or less now causes flooding community. In the event of a five-metre, six-metre believe we would actually see homes wiped out suburb. I note that the Whitsunday Regional grant from the Queensland government through floodplain risk and management study for the before any work can take place to ensure that, will not cause a problem in another part and supply options for flood mitigation works in probably will take some months. We need to works that are recommended by the study to season, we could get a flood through that sand movements, and then we would be back study or something like that to find out what is going on. The Queensland government provides funding part of its Royalties for the Regions program-for is actually no federal equivalent. I know they moment to try to get some funding to help in these now. The people of Bowen do expect that indeed federal-where we do not have any bucket We want them to assist in preventing a natural breaking out and flooding homes. So, in the spirit say to the government: invest in the flood before it is a problem. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:25): It is of extremes where, on the one hand, our environment on the other hand, it can be very harsh and property and to people's lives. Unfortunately, harsher parts of our environment. We have witnessed our country whilst parts of Queensland My parliamentary colleague, the member devastation of Bundaberg and the destruction friend and colleague the member for Flynn has it tore through properties, tearing up fencing things that were in its path and caused extreme regard to some of the areas we have visited, that has been caused in rural areas is really people and families in those areas who have hard to imagine what went on in some of is a river that flows to the side of Bowen. Due to are large sand deposits in that riverbed. One and it is so big that locals actually call it 'the to water as it flows out the mouth and into the cause some problems, but I have got to tell you issues particularly in the rural part of that or higher flow coming through that river, I in the Queens Beach area, which is a sizeable Council has recently received $104,000 in a their floods response subsidy to develop a Don River. That is good; that needs to happen if they are going to remove this bit of sand, it cause more damage to homes. That study will the Don River, but I am concerned that the study get going straight after that. If we leave the languish, if we leave them beyond the next wet river which could change the hydrology and the to square one and we would have to do a subthrough its Floodplain Security Schemeflood mitigation works like this. But there are liaising with the federal government at the sorts of instances, but it is not there right all levels of government-council, state and, of money for this type of project, to assist. disaster that could be caused by the Don River of prevention being better than the cure, I prevention works so we can fix the Don River fair to say that in Australia we live in a land can be very kind and very giving but, very violent and cause massive destruction to over the last couple of months, we have seen the the extremes of bushfires burning across and New South Wales were flooding. for Hinkler, has already spoken about the of property and loss of life in his electorate.

Turning to the Gold Coast, the electorate by Cyclone Oswald over the Australia Day minute that the impact on the Gold Coast of same extreme scale as what was experienced affected on the Gold Coast. One of the images of the waves crashing through Meesh's Restaurant electorate, and the ferocity of the waves as the windows of the restaurant, basically wiping probably an image that will live with many Australians businesses and homes within my electorate that their roofing structures and their building structures about 50,000 homes that lost power, Whilst, clearly, there was a direct impact businesses that were affected by this as well, livelihood for a considerable period of time. small businesses when we do have these severe small businesses that are already struggling much harder for them to get back onto their community to make sure that we get those small track. We had emergency services locally always been and I am sure will continue to to the community at the time.

Speaker) (13:29): I thank Deputy Speaker assisting me in the chair today. First of all, us of the summer of natural disasters that we seen it for the last three summers, such has been my electorate, and of course in many parts of that have been so devastating in so many areas alerts that go out are vitally important in saving lives. It also highlights that we have deficits Australia that we must address. I would hope disasters we can look at this collectively across saving lives and property. It was through those communications, that people were alerted to get coming their way in very short order. A photograph for me was one of that family in Tasmania who over the water trying to get away from the fire. all of us that having an alert and being able cases. Fires in parts of the far west of my electorate burning out pastoral land.

I was showing with cattle stranded in a sea of water-there railways and houses totally surrounded but also councillors and mayors have been unable I also thank the government in Queensland, of Primary Industries, local government and the Commonwealth.

Their council workers, the Emergency Management Queensland are just remarkable. Some days I think that if we run. I pay tribute to all those people. I know has only in the last 10 to 12 days been able to applications for category C and, in some cases, have only just been assessed. I have some colleagues which show the sorts of things that them to the Attorney-General. They include one was no hope for those cattle-and ones showing quite isolated, the other point I make. These to get out there until only very recently. the Premier's department and the Department the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General in they could to assess these applications for into.

And we have to make seen in the last summer-we are out there to help and make sure that people are able to be given their morale up and helps them cope with the surrounds them. When you see photographs of what happened fierce Mother Nature can be. We know how Mother Nature can be.
