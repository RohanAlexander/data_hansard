2,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"In accordance with standing order 41(h) and the recommendations of the whips adopted by the House on 27 August 2008, I present copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by the members for Calwell, Canning and Oxley. These items will be considered in the Main Committee later today. NA AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2008 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 August, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Dutton moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House recognises the impact on small business of the Government's proposed changes to the ‘Birdsville Amendment', and recognises that the Federal Court is the more appropriate Court to hear cases under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, and the House calls on the Government to abandon its proposed changes to the ‘Birdsville Amendment' and to similarly abandon its plans to allow the Federal Magistrates Court hear section 46 cases”.",17
3,Mrs MOYLAN,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to pick up where I left off last week. We are in this chamber to debate the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. It is really a change to the Birdsville amendment-a bill the coalition introduced less than a year ago. The Prime Minister seems to be living proof of the saying, ‘You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain,' because changing the Birdsville amendment will certainly make him an enemy of Australia's small business operators. The provisions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which include section 46, prohibit various trade practices that tend to prevent or lessen competition in an Australian First Reading market for goods and services. They lay down rules which, as interpreted by the courts from time to time, restrain anticompetitive behaviour and promote competition in the marketplace. The Birdsville amendment was introduced by the coalition to specifically address the issue of predatory pricing. It clearly states: A corporation that has a substantial share of the market must not supply or offer to supply goods or services for a sustained period at a price that is less than the relevant cost to the corporation of supplying such goods and servicesfor a prescribed purpose. The delineation between market share and market power is essential to how this bill works, especially in how it impacts on predatory pricing. The predatory pricing prohibition introduced by the Birdsville amendment can be considered to apply in a broader sense. The major reason for this is that it is applied to firms with a substantial share of the market rather than firms with substantial market power. The coalition feel this is crucial to protecting small business in this counto try and we want it given the chance to have some impact. It was enacted less than 12 months ago and we are yet to see it properly tested in the courts. It has not been in place long enough for it to be clear whether it needs changing or indeed how it needs changing. Sound economic policy is one thing but change for change's sake is something we do not want to see, especially when small businesses are such a significant part of the economy and stand to be substantial losers. The Prime Minister spoke in July of last year, funnily enough, before he was elected, about helping small business. At that time, he said: There is no doubt that prosperous small businesses equal a prosperous economy. And the of government policy is to support them, not get in their way. Now he and his colleagues are asking us to support legislation that is going to not only make it more difficult for small businesses but possibly put many operators out of business. The idea behind the Howard government's introduction of the Birdsville amendment was to bring a level of certainty to the Trade Practices Act. They say the only certainties in life are death and taxes. It is quite ironic, in this instance, as threshold test from market share to market power will, along with the introduction of many new taxes by this government, spell certain death to many of the small businesses in Australia, particularly in my electorate of Pearce. Thirty per cent of Australia's wealth comes from small business. More than 90 per cent of Australia's businesses are small businesses and, as the Prime Minister pointed out last year, small business already employs half the private sector workforcemore than four million Australians-and this number continues to grow. Having said that, the coalition recognise the importance of having both diversity and balance in the marketplace. While we recognise the importance of promoting and encouraging the growth of small businesses, this should not be to the detriment of corporate Australia. Finding the balance between the two has always been a strength of the coalition and if Labor cannot manage this perhaps they should step aside. While Labor will be quick to point out how certain sections of the corporate sector were quick to voice their disapproval of the Birdsville amendment, it will no doubt ignore the support and praise it received from the very people who will benefit from the amendment-small businesses. The Motor role Trades Association of Australia welcomed to the introduction of this bill as it will allow small business operators to seek redress against predatory behaviour. The Australian Retailers Association also supported the bill because it distinguishes predatory pricing from legitimate competitive discounting, which was previously unclear. The Council of Small Business of Australia and the ACCC both gave their support to the bill that we had introduced. Apparently they can see its benefits, but the Prime Minister and the changing the member for Lilley cannot. Small business owners have long claimed the pricing strategies of bigger competitors have been deliberately harming their trade, and I have seen first hand evidence of this. Following the introduction of the Birdsville amendment, Michael Delaney from the Fair Trading Coalition told the ABC: There's been a tendency to, in big business, to see it get ever larger and to capture more and more market share with the effect of driving out small businesses. Now this has been happening on a grand scale, particularly in grocery and in liquor and certainly in petrol. Despite cries for help, the ACCC has previously been powerless to stop alleged predatory pricing-selling below cost to intentionally harm or eliminate smaller rivals. Professor Allan Fels, the former Chair of the ACCC, said: It's a bit like a murder case, if the commission steps in early and saves someone from being wiped out by predatory behaviour, then it's very difficult to go to court and argue there's been murder when the person's still alive. And on the other hand, if they've been destroyed and you've got a dead body, dead men don't talk. There's no evidence you can take to court. Greg Hoy, finance editor for ABC news, then said: So for many years the pressure's been on the eral Government to give the market watchdog, the ACCC, the legal teeth to do something by bolstering the Trade Practices Act. I was shadow minister in this place in 1994, and recommendations were made then. It seems to have taken a long time to get to the point where we got good legislation in this place, only now to see it overturned. The Prime Minister and the Member for Lilley, I am sure, would agree healthy competition is absolutely vital for a strong economy. Competition increases efficiency, lowers prices for consumers, provides greater choice, encourages innovation and the uptake of new technology and lifts productivity. As the Prime Minister alluded in his speech from July of last year: Competition policy properly implemented also provides fairness. Properly implemented it levels the playing field for small business giving small business people the opportunity to compete with bigger players on fair terms. The clear imbalance in bargaining positions puts small business at risk of being treated unfairly. That is why the Trade Practices Act is portant – because it protects competition by stopping big business from abusing their power by driving competitors out of the market and prohibits unfair dealings with small business. Small business, consumers and the economy are the winners from strong competition laws, and this is why Labor has always supported laws to strengthen competition. Those were the Prime Minister's own words. He then goes on to say how the then Howard government was ‘dragging its feet' in this regard; however, by introducing the Birdsville amendment, the coalition government legislated for what the Prime Minister seems to be advocating in his speech of last July. On top of that, he now wants to change the Birdsville amendment to favour those with market power. The Prime Minister may be Fed- the most indecisive figure since Hamlet. Let us just hope his and the member for Lilley's economic mismanagement does not have the same tragic outcome for the people of Australia-particularly small businesses-as it did for Denmark. Many proprietors in my electorate of Pearce are already feeling the negative impact. As a former small business owner as well as the former shadow minister for small business, I have maintained regular contact with small business owners and continue to take a great interest in what they have to say. They are the ones who are out there fighting to make a living. I recently conducted a small business survey, and many people had concerns about the amount of red tape that is being introduced by this government, particularly in the form of additional taxes. As the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for finance, competition policy and deregulation, said on the steps of Parliament House on Tuesday: The reality is that business and consumer confidence has plummeted under this Government over the last eight months and that really is compounding the international problems that are facso im- ing our economy at the moment as well. ‘Small business is petrified' about where our $1.1 trillion economy is headed, he said. The Labor government clearly cannot manage issues of inflation, and it wants to heap further pressure on it with a new $2.5 billion tax on condensate from the North West Shelf of Western Australia. In light of confirmation from Woodside Petroleum last week that Labor's $2.5 billion tax grab on condensate will be passed on to consumers, the Rudd government seems inclined to do whatever it wants, regardless of its impact the businesses and families of Australia. is again demonstrated by the government's desire to shift from market share to market power, especially as many small businesses are concerned with the meaning of market power as defined by the High Court. Its narrow definition means the scope of the Birdsville amendment would make it harder for the ACCC to bring action against large businesses who engage in predatory pricing. Whether market share or market power is used as the threshold test, to be found guilty of predatory pricing a business would have to have priced their goods below cost with the intent of substantially damaging or eliminating competition. Unfortunately, this is not easy to prove in court-not that it seems to worry the Prime Minister. Maintaining his government's white knight image is all that seems to matter at the moment. We the coalition believe the Birdsville amendment will be beneficial to small business in Australia but will not ultimately be detrimental to big business. This legislation works towards an environment where both can operate in harmony, and it deserves a chance to run its course. Let's see how it plays out in action. Let's see whether it does need any amendments and then take any necessary action. But my concern continues to be-and I know that many on our side of the House share this concern-that these practices have made life very difficult times tenuous for small business proprietors in Australia. I totally agree with the recommendation of the shadow minister for finance, competition policy and deregulation, the member for Dickson, that the coalition support the bill, with the exception of changes to the Birdsville amendment and the Federal Magistrates Court consideration of section 46 cases.",17
4,Mr CLARE,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Blaxland) (12.15 pm)Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity on to make a contribution to this important deThis bate. Can I also welcome the school groups that are in the upper gallery today and another school group which is present in the parliament today, Wattawa Heights Public School from my electorate. Welcome to Canberra; welcome to Parliament House. I have to tell those school groups that this is not one of the most exciting debates that they will see in parliament today-that comes a little later, at 2 o'clock-but it is one of the most important, because the Trade Practices Act 1974 is one of the most important pieces of legislation that this parliament has ever considered, and the amending legislation that we are considering today, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, is perhaps the most significant reform to that act in the last two decades. What it does is as follows. It strengthens predatory pricing to ensure that big companies cannot persistently sell goods at a loss to run their smaller competitors out of business, it abolishes the monetary thresholds for unconscionable conduct claims and it also helps small business by allowing them to litigate claims in the Federal Magistrates Court, meaning quicker and hopefully cheaper resolution of competition disputes. The bill also gives small business a guaranteed voice on the ACCC, requiring at least one ACCC deputy chairperson to have a small business background, and it clarifies the ACCC's inand at vestigative powers. It is worth pointing out, and I acknowledge that the member for Pearce has done this, that small business has welcomed this legislation. Richard Evans, the Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, says it is: … very good news for smaller retailers. Tony Steven, the CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said the legislation would: … only help in the area of anticompetitive conduct. Michael Delaney of the Motor Traders Association said the bill offers: … retail motor traders and other small business operators long denied access to justice against unfair and anti-competitive behaviour. Small business is crucial to our economy. It employs more than 3½ million Australians and generates about 40 per cent of our GDP. To survive, it needs a fair and competitive environment, and that is what this bill is all about. So where does it fit in the history of petition policy in Australia? For the better part of the last century, Australian competition laws were well intentioned but frustrated by judicial interpretation. At the turn of the century, the Sherman act fostered a strong culture of competition in the United States. The 1906 attempt by this parliament to replicate it with the Australian Industries Preservation Act fell victim to constitutional challenge. The High Court's decision in the Huddart Parker case in 1913 effectively gutted the act. The story of the revival of Australian competition law is the story of two Attorneys-General, two men who served that office with distinction and were both later appointed to the High Court. The first was Sir Garfield Barwick. While I think his advice to John Kerr in 1975 was pretty lousy, I think his advice to Robert Menzies in 1960 was spot on. He convinced the then Prime Minister that restricting the behaviour of monopolies was necessary, and that culminated in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1965. In the ‘Concrete Pipes' case, the High Court judged that that was unconstitutional, but importantly it did overturn the majority opinion in Huddart Parker, opening the door for the Commonwealth to make a third attempt at competition policy. Enter Lionel Murphy. After the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, Murphy developed a new competition bill: the Trade Practices Act. As legal academic Russell Miller says, the: Impact on Australian business was enormous. In a few short, broadly expressed clauses, the Act prohibited contracts, arrangements or understanding in restraint of trade, monopolisation, resale price maintenance, price discrimination, and mergers likely to have an effect on competition. The Trade Practices Act was an integral part of the Keating government's national competition policy, which in turn was part of the com- enormous structural reforms of the 1980s and the 1990s-reforms that set up the last decade of economic growth. The COAG process enabled the Keating government to drive its reform agenda. COAG proved a very effective vehicle for competition reform, and that is why this government is using COAG again as a vehicle for more reform, not just in competition but in water, health, housing and education, and in an area that is of specific concern to me-and, I know, to the member for Lindsay-the regulation of financial services and credit. In all of these areas, national leadership is necessary to drive real reform. There is still a lot of work to do to improve competition between big businesses and small businesses. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the supermarket. I will say more about the ACCC's inquiry into grocery prices in a minute, but first I want to take a look at the predatory price changes that are in this bill. The bill beefs up protections against predatory pricing. In simple terms, predatory pricing is when a company consistently sells goods at a loss to force smaller competitors out of the market. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act says that that is illegal. Applying this section, however, has proved more difficult. A number of recent court decisions have undermined its operation and you can almost feel the frustration of the ACCC when you read its 2003 annual report. In that report the commission said it had: … concerns about the application and effectiveness of the misuse of market power provision. The ACCC has reviewed a number of its investigations following theBoraljudgement and discontinued some of these. In other words, the court's decision in Boral made it impossible for the ACCC to act. I recognise that there have been a number of attempts to correct this since then. This bill amends subsection 46(1AA) to direct the court's attention to a corporation's market power rather than just their market share. I know there are differing opinions on this in the chamber but I think this the better approach because it recognises that the reality of a corporation's power in a given market is not necessarily reflected by their market share. Professor Stephen Corones made this point in the Financial Review last week: ... having a substantial market share tells us nothing, or very little, about whether there is a lem that warrants regulation. In a sense, market share is meaningless: the key question is whether a firm, acting on its own, has discretionary power – whether it has to take into account the competitive reaction from other firms. In other words, it is market power that is the antithesis of competition. The bill also makes a number of other changes to section 46. It ensures that victims of predatory pricing do not need to prove that the predator has the ability to recoup their losses-one of the problems that was created in the High Court's decision in Boral. It also implements the recommendation of the 2004 Senate inquiry into the trade practices legislation clarifying the meaning of ‘take advantage' in section 46 to allow courts to widen the scope of this test in response to the High Court's decision in Rural Press. The changes to the provisions prohibiting unconscionable conduct contained in section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act should also help small business. Unconscionability is a legal principle developed in the law of equity. One of the innovations of the original Trades Practices Act was to inject this equitable principle into statute. While the credit for this innovation rests with Lionel Murphy, the Howard government did extend its operation to small business through the addition of section 51AC in 1998. For that, they should be commended. This bill takes it one step further. It abolishes arbitrary monetary thresholds for actions brought under section 51AC, drawing the law's attention to the wrongdoing rather than the regularly disputed question of whether monetary thresholds have been reached. I think that is a good thing. It will help to discourage unconscionable conduct between corporations and between businesses and their customers. As I mentioned earlier, the bill also assists small business by making it easier to litigate prob- section 46 matters. Currently these matters must be heard in the Federal Court. This process is thorough, but it can also be pretty costly and slow. It is an unattractive legal avenue for small business. The bill extends the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court to section 46 matters, making it easier and cheaper for small businesses to pursue legal protection from anticompetitive behaviour. Taken together, these three reformschanging the definition of market power, abolishing monetary thresholds for section 51AC matters and allowing easier access to legal remedies-represent a significant extension of the protection for small business under the Trade Practices Act. They do not protect small business from competition; they help ensure markets operate in a fair and more competitive way. As I said earlier, a lot of work is needed to improve competition in our supermarkets. The ACCC's grocery inquiry identifies several areas where competition is not working as well as it should be. I note that the government has already acted on some of these fronts. Easing restrictions on foreign investment in the grocery industry is one of them, and this morning I noticed that the minister has foreshadowed changes to creeping acquisition laws; but today I want to focus on two other barriers to competition mentioned in that report. The first is restrictive covenants. These are agreements in commercial leases that restrict shopping centre landlords from bringing new tenants that might compete for business, usually other supermarkets or independent grocers. The effect of these restrictive covenants is obvious. If a supermarket can act in a virtual local monopoly, then customers will have no choice and will end up paying more for the shopping that they want to do. But the problem is deeper than that. The ACCC report says this: As well as acting as an impediment to entry into local areas, restrictive provisions in leases also as a broader barrier to entry, particularly for pendent chains, as access to prime sites across a range of locations is restricted, which serves to entrench the dominance of the MSCs both in localised areas and more broadly. These sorts of provisions are already prohibited under part IV of the Trade Practices Act if they have the purpose or effect of substantially reducing competition. I know Aldi complained bitterly about these in their evidence to the inquiry. The Shopping Centre Council have also said that they would like to see the back of them. The ACCC, I think, should be using section 47(4) and section 46 to challenge these covenants in leases. They are bad for shoppers, they are bad for small and independent grocers and, in the long run, they are bad for our economy. The ACCC's report suggests that they are going to be looking at this in the future. In my view, if their attempts to crack down on these types of restrictive covenants fail in the court, we need to come back here and have a look at what changes are needed to strengthen their hand. The other issue raised in the ACCC's report is planning and zoning laws. These laws play an important role in protecting local communities from overdevelopment and congestion and in ensuring the delivery of local communities. Their purpose is to protect the community interest. This is a good thing, but the system is often abused. Large commercial retailers like Woolworths and Coles ‘game' the system to protect their own commercial interests. In evidence to the grocery inquiry, Woolworths admitted lodging 22 development objections since 2005. Often, they have little to do with planning issues that affect Woolworths; they are about protecting their market position. For example, the ACCC report describes the case of objections raised by Woolworths to an independent supermarket opening in the Appin act area in New South Wales. The report states: inde- Woolworths acknowledged that the grounds on which it had lodged the appeal-traffic and access, heritage, noise impact and overshadinghad no impact on Woolworths. Rather, Woolworths acknowledged, the objection was lodged for the purpose of pursuing a commercial opportunity. What is clear is that a system that has been set up to protect the community interest is being abused by big companies like Woolworths to advance their own commercial interests. I think governments should respond with structural reform that stops these abuses of process from occurring and builds a more competitive market environment. Uniform planning laws are already on the COAG agenda and I understand the Assistant Treasurer has written to the Prime Minister to request COAG consider this in light of the ACCC report. This is important. Beating the abuses of the planning system is essential if we are going to make the grocery industry more competitive, and it requires national leadership. There are a few other amendments in this bill that are worthy of note. The bill ensures that at least one of the ACCC commissioners needs to have a background in small business. This is a good thing and it gives clear legislative purpose to the intention of the previous government. The bill also strengthens the ACCC's powers, making it easier to obtain information, documents and evidence under section 155 of the act. This is another common-sense amendment and I think it is long overdue. There are many critics of the ACCC in this parliament, but I think we should all agree that we need to give the ACCC the powers to do their job, and these amendments do that. Thirty-four years old and Lionel Murphy's Trade Practices Act is still a work in progress. There is always more work to do, but this bill represents a major step forward in the continual improvement of competition policy in this country. I hope it attracts support that it deserves, both in the Senate and in the courts. If not, I guess we will be back here again, because small business and consumers deserve the support that the Trade Practices Act is designed to give them. I commend the bill to the House.",20
5,Ms MARINO,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. I endorse the coalition's opposition to the proposed amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, known as the ‘Birdsville amendment'. These amendments seek to amend existing subsection 46(1AA) so that the terms ‘substantial market share', ‘substantial period' and ‘relevant cost' are omitted and the wording of the subsection will be in the same terms as subsection 46(1). The proposed amendments are supposed to reduce uncertainty as to the act's operation and to improve its ability to target anticompetitive unilateral conduct. The coalition introduced the Birdsville amendment in September 2007 and it has been in place for less than a year. Clearly this is not long enough for the amendment to have been tested properly in the courts, and the provisions have not been in place long enough for it to be clear why they might need to be changed. There have been 75 complaints to date; however, there have been no court cases yet. Effectively, the Birdsville amendment has not been tested through the courts. The breadth of submissions and the nature of the recommendations by the 2004 Senate committee reflected a level of frustration experienced by both business and the ACCC with the manner in which section 46 had been interpreted by the courts. As a consequence of those interpretations, the ACCC had not been able to successfully prosecute a number of corporations which it had considthe ered had engaged in a misuse of market power. Therefore the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007 was introduced into the Senate on 20 June 2007. The two subsections (1AA) and (1AB) included ‘substantial share of a market' and became known as the Birdsville amendment. The subsections were significantly different from subsection 46(1), which provides: A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power … The Birdsville amendment prevents a company with a substantial market share from selling or offering to sell goods or services below cost for a sustained period of time for the purpose of: (a) eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation that or any other market; or (b) preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or (c) deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market. The Labor government's proposed amendment would change ‘market share' to ‘market power'. The coalition opposes this amendment. Small business in particular is concerned that the meaning of ‘market power' as defined by the High Court is too narrow. Labor's amendment would further reduce the scope of the Birdsville amendment and make it harder for small businesses, via the ACCC, to bring an action against corporations or large businesses which engage in predatory pricing. The term ‘market share' is also likely to be a simpler economic term for the courts to apply. Changes to the amendment will return a level of uncertainty to the Trade Practices Act to the detriment of small business, as the threshold test will change from ‘market share' to ‘market power'. The definition of market power defined by the High Court following the Boral case in 2003 is a very high threshold, which essentially applies to only monopolists or near monopolists. The changes will also make it even more difficult for a small business to assess whether it has a case against a larger competitor for predatory pricing. Just imagine you are the corner store in a small community, or in Bunbury or Busselton in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia, and you need to bring a case against one of the two major supermarket chains in Australia or perhaps even Costco, that retailing giant planning to open in Australia. This is a company with annual sales of around US$65 billion. It would be a daunting prospect for any small business to bring a case in such a in David and Goliath situation, particularly as a significant proportion of small businesses are family owned and run. Making the time, going through the process and finding the money to do so in such circumstances can be prohibitive for small business owners. ‘Market share' as a definition in this instance would be critical to the small business. Regardless of the threshold test that is used, be it market share or market power, to be found guilty of predatory pricing a business would have to price their goods below cost with the intent of substantially damaging or eliminating competition. However, the Birdsville amendment does not stop legitimate and procompetitive discounting, as is claimed by some large business organisations. The amendment will only be triggered by below-cost pricing where that occurs over an extended period of time for an anticompetitive purpose. It should not stop any company from matching a competitor's price, holding Christmas or any other clearance sales or sales to clear old stock at the end of the trading day. Customers will not miss out on this activity. Small business is the engine room of our economy. We understand very well that there are millions of people employed in small business-nearly half of the working population. There are approximately 2.5 million small businesses in Australia, representing 96 per cent of businesses, and there are over 13,000 local small businesses in my electorate of Forrest. A majority of these are family businesses, and I will not compromise those businesses or those families by agreeing to amendments that will in any way lessen their capacity to compete with the duopolies that are open for business in many areas. Given the importance of the small business sector and the fact that we know that numbers of small business actually increase competition in the marketplace to the benefit of consumers, the coalition will not support the government's proposed amendments to the Birdsville amendment. This was enacted only at the end of 2007. I believe it needs time to work and to be tested through the judicial system. We want to ensure that small businesses are not forced out of the market by unfair competitive practices by much larger competitors. The only businesses that could be affected by the Birdsville amendment would be those who are engaging in predatory pricing or, in other words, selling goods below cost in order to substantially damage or eliminate their competition. Effectively, that is the misuse of market power through market share, which it is the intent of section 46 to deal with. If predatory pricing is allowed, consumers will ultimately pay higher prices due to a lessening of competition, with fewer businesses in the market. Small businesses will be forced to close, and families and communities will suffer. Predatory pricing occurs when a corporation prices a product below some measure of cost and it does so with the intention of driving a competitor out of the market. The corporation subsequently raises the price again in an attempt to recoup the losses it incurred as a result of its below conduct. This is referred to as ‘recoupment'. In effect, predatory pricing is an exclusionary tactic, because the corporation is actively seeking to exclude competitors for the product from the market in its pricing. This can be done in one of two ways: the corporation excludes an existing competitor from the market for the product because the competitor cannot match the below cost price that has been set, or, for a new competitor, the corporation sets the price so low that it deters anyone else from entering the market. The difficulty with predatory pricing is that, in some instances, it can appear to be a legitimate competitive behaviour because the existence of a price war is often an indicator of competition-as happened in the Boral case. I note a recent article by the Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent, David Crowe, who wrote of Associate Professor Zumbo's comments that the Birdsville amendment protected small business without raising any risk that short-term or legitimate discounting practices could be considered predatory. Associate Professor Zumbo said that small business taking action under the law needed to prove that bigger rivals had substantial market share, priced their goods below cost, did so for a sustained period and did so for an anti-competitive purpose. I also note that the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia is concerned the changes will not improve the Birdsville amendment. Ken Henrick, CEO, recently stated to the Senate committee that NARGA was not entirely comfortable with a return to the concept of market power, largely because of the precedent set in the Boral case. In addition, this bill also seeks to extend the jurisdiction for section 46 cases to the Federal Magistrates Court and to remove the price threshold for unconscionable conduct. The coalition also does not support the procost posal to allow the Federal Magistrates Court to hear section 46 cases. They are, of their nature, complex and usually long and unlikely to be beneficial to small businesses. Conducting the hearings in the Federal Magistrates Court will not necessarily make them less complex or shorter. In fact, section 46 cases can often end up in the High Court of Australia. The Federal Court of Australia has a well-developed competency and long experience in hearing such cases and is best placed in hear section 46 cases. The Law Council of Australia has expressed concern that the government's amendments to enable section 46 cases to be dealt with by the Federal Magistrates Court will not have the effect of lowering costs and could, in fact, potentially increase them. I reiterate that the coalition opposes these changes to the Birdsville amendment in section 46. It has not had enough time to prove itself and be tested by the court system. The Birdsville amendment defines a company's influence by its market share, not its market power. Market power is a more general concept that was too hard to prove. It also allows small business a fighting chance, and they should be provided with that continuing opportunity. Let me remind the House that it is the Labor government that have been inconsistent on this matter, as they unanimously supported the introduction of the Birdsville amendment last year. We have already seen a fall in business confidence since the election of the Rudd Labor government, and we have seen the government receive the worse rating of any government in Australia in the latest Sensis business index for small and medium enterprises. In fact, the report shows business confidence has fallen eight percentage points to reach 25 points, the lowest level since the survey began 15 years ago and less than half the level recorded at the same time last year We have also seen the introduction of the GroceryWatch website. On this website we see the Rudd government endorsing one of the two major supermarket chains as having the lowest prices in the vast majority of regions across Australia. However, Kevin Rudd has said that, to increase competition, there needs to be a greater number of retailers to challenge the two major supermarket chains. Yet his government has officially advised people to buy their groceries at one of the two major chains. This is nothing more than free promotion for the major supermarket retailers. The Assistant Treasurer was quoted in the West Australian on 26 June as saying: We're not doing it for a price impact, we're doing it to give people more information ... I would ask: what does this information on the GroceryWatch website actually deliver to people who live in regional Australia, who do not live close to one of these major supermarket chains? The site notes that basket prices for individual stores are not available. How does this help someone living in my electorate in the towns of Harvey or Augusta? For the $3.70 difference in price on what is termed a ‘basic staples' basket when I checked the site on Saturday, someone in these towns would have to get in their car and drive to find them. With the current price of fuel, this would cost a lot more than the potential savings. I would ask again: how does this site help people in those small towns, and how does it encourage people to support small business in their small towns? These are the businesses that set up in areas that the major supermarket chains do not. These small supermarkets provide an invaluable service and support to the community. They provide prizes for local raffles and support the local sporting and community service organisations. How does recommending that people travel to shop at one of the major supermarket chains help regional small business, local people or their community? Today, former Woolworths boss, Reg Clairs, is quoted in the Australian as fearing for Australian's food industry under the Coles-Woolworths duopoly and the growth of global manufacturers. He said he was concerned about the power at the top of the chain. Mr Clairs is quoted as saying: … there's been a greater emphasis on the retailer taking charge of the supply chain … I am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country. And further: … ultimately, the global manufacturers will take the power base. I would add here that it will not only be food manufacturers who will be at risk; it will be our farmers, our growers, our small and local businesses and their communities. And they will continue to be at risk. Section 46 is about the misuse of market power, and anyone in small business is very aware of the challenges and issues involved in taking on a major corporation or a large business, firstly, in the marketplace itself and, secondly, in the courts through the Trade Practices Act. The Birdsville amendment was born out of the frustrations and community concerns that came to light in the inquiry of the former Senate Economics References Committee into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small business. The concerns centred around the High Court's interpretation of section 46 of not providing adequate protections to small business. The intention of the section was to provide a simpler test, a market share test that was easier to understand and litigate, rather than a market power test. I will not support any changes to the act which reduce the competitiveness of small businesses, increase their exposure to major corporations and increase the misuse of market power. As I said earlier, small businesses are a critical part of the economic and social fabric of many regional centres and towns right across Australia. The majority of these businesses are family owned and run. They are a major employer nationally. They are the cornerstone of our society and a critical player in strengthening competition in the marketplace. And let us not forget that a win for small business is a win for consumers every time.",24
6,Mr NEUMANN,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The aim of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is to improve the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection in relation to unfair pricing, abuse of market power and violation of consumer rights. The role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is to apply the act for the benefit of consumers everywhere in Australia, both urban and rural. The role of the ACCC is to administer and enforce particularly part IVA, anticompetitive behaviour; part V, consumer protection; and part IVA, unconscionable conduct in relation to commercial transactions and consumer dealings. I speak in support of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The Trade Practices Act 1974 was a wonderful groundbreaking law, an initiative of the Whitlam Labor government in the 1970s, after decades of inaction by conservative coalition governments. I am a bit less charitable to former Attorney-General Garfield Barwick, the then member for Blaxland. Certainly, there were plenty of opportunities during 23 years of coalition rule, from 1949 to 1972, to do something about this. But it took a Labor government, in 1974, to bring in the Trade Practices Act, which has made such a difference to the lives of individuals, small businesses and large corporations in this country, particularly in the areas of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. When I listen to speakers opposite, they often parade themselves as champions of free enterprise and a free market. I just do not think they get it when it comes to this sort of legislation. Their record seems always to socialise losses and privatise profits, and it is left to Labor governments to do the hard yakka when it comes to providing promarket and pro-competition reform in the economy. It is Labor which has a proven record when it comes to these areas. All too often those opposite seem to side with big business-big oil companies, big tobacco companies, big liquor companies and big supermarkets. They seem to worship at the feet of oligopoly. They always side with big producers and forget consumers. In contrast, Labor governments strengthen the trade practices legislation. We did it in 1986; and we were the architects of National Competition Policy, which set the parameters for policy to enhance the economic performance of Australia in the last few decades. It was National Competition Policy which contributed to the strong economic experience that we have enjoyed. This bill is long overdue and is probably the most substantive legislative change in more than 20 years. The bill amends by schedule. It makes amendments to section 46 of the act, to enhance anticompetitive unilateral conduct. There will be a requirement that at least one of the deputy chairs of the ACCC has knowledge and experience in the area of small business. There is a significant amendment to section 51AC to extend protection against unconscionable conduct in business arrangements. Schedule 1 relates to the misuse by corporations of their power in the market. Section 46 amendments to the Trade Practices Act focus on promoting business competition and reducing anticompetitive behaviour of big business. It is a fact that competition prices and that helps consumers-and it helps those people in my electorate. Oligopolies, even monopolies, allow big business to set prices, and consumers have to take it or leave it. Schedule 1 of the legislation deals with predatory pricing, the role of recoupment in predatory pricing litigation under section 46-and, in particular, clarifies the meaning of ‘take advantage' for the purposes of section 46-and makes a wonderful reform in conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court in relation to matters under section 46. I am surprised that the member for Forrest opposes that conferral of jurisdiction, because it was the Howard coalition government which established the Federal Magistrates Court and kept on conferring jurisdiction after jurisdiction and enhancing, in an imperialistic way, the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. And now, when they sit opposite, they oppose the extension of the jurisdiction. I cannot get it, because the Federal Magistrates Court has simpler procedures-justice can be done for people more expeditiously and the court proceedings themselves are less formal. Everything about that court is more user-friendly than lots of other courts in this country-certainly the supreme courts and the federal courts-so I just do not get why the coalition is opposed to the deferral of jurisdiction. What is the background to this legislation? The Senate referred to its Economics References Committee the issue of whether the Trade Practices Act adequately dealt with small business and protection from unconscionable conduct and the misuse of market power. The committee tabled its report on 1 March 2004. The report made 17 recommendations, including nine in relation to prohibitions against the misuse of market power. It was not about market share; it was about the reduces misuse of market power. The former coalition government implemented some of those recommendations in relation to predatory pricing but failed on others. In 2007 the coalition government did not listen to and act upon the anxiety of business, nor of the ACCC, which expressed its views to the Senate inquiry concerning a range of matters-recruitment and predatory pricing litigation, the ‘take advantage' term in section 46 and others. Instead, on 19 September 2007, the Howard government dropped the ball; they squibbed the issue. That is what they did when it comes to consumer protection-and still they do not get it. When we hear speeches by those opposite, it is clear that they still do not understand difference. They just cannot get it. They just do not understand. The Birdsville amendment-the ‘HowardJoyce amendment'-threw out all the principles in relation to the ban that applied on predatory pricing. Still they focused on market share, which is just one factor alone, rather than on the misuse of market power. The Birdsville amendment was made without any consultation with the business community-and they say they have such a great relationship with the business community! They did not contact the Treasury, they did not contact the ACCC and they passed the legislation just to satisfy Senator Joyce. Thank you, Senator Joyce, for what you have done-and I say that in a very ironic way. Let us have a look at what 2007 brought to us, and the folly of the Birdsville amendment. That section made an amendment to the legislation. This is what they did: section 46(1AA) purported to prohibit a corporation with a substantial share of the market from supplying, or offering to supply, goods and services for a sustained period at a price less than the relevant cost to the corporation of providing them. That is what it said: ‘market share'. It did not mention market power, despite the fact that the Senate report referred to it. So they looked at one aspect. They did not look at the fact that big corporations can take advantage of their power in the market. The new section 46(1AA) contains significant improvements, and there are provisions which do not exist in the current legislation. The new section 46(1AA) states that a corporation may still be found to have contravened the legislation even if the corporation cannot, and might not ever be able to, recoup losses incurred by supplying goods and services at a price less than cost. I think everyone in this House would agree that it is wrong for corporations to engage in this type the of behaviour to prevent market entry by a competitor or to rid the market of a competitor in this way. The amendment we are bringing in today gives the Federal Magistrates Court guidance as to the factors which must be taken into consideration when a court looks at whether a corporation has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power. The court may have regard to whether a corporation's conduct was materially facilitated by its substantial degree of market power; whether the corporation engaged in that conduct in reliance on its substantial degree of market power; whether the corporation was likely to have engaged in that conduct if it lacked a substantial degree of market power; and whether the conduct was otherwise related to the corporation's substantial degree of market power. Presently section 46 does not explicitly state whether it is necessary to prove recruitment in a case of predatory pricing. The amendment takes up the Senate inquiry recommendation to expressly state that it is not necessary to establish such a case. That Senate inquiry followed several cases which have been referred to. It also followed the Dawson review, which considered the use and scope of section 155 of the act. Soon after the Dawson review provided its report to the government, several important Trade Practices Act cases were considered by the courts. The High Court considered the application and interpretation of section 46 in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v ACCC in 2003, commonly called the Boral case. There was also Rural Press Ltd v ACCC, commonly called the Rural Press case-and that was the 2003 decision. There were other cases discussed in the Federal Court. The full Federal Court considered the issue in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v ACCC in 2003 and in Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v ACCC in 2003. All these cases raised questions about the adequacy of the legislation to protect small business from anticompetitive behaviour and conduct, including the misuse of market power. And guess what? The Howard coalition government ignored it all and the Birdsville amendment was enacted. What did Peter Armitage, head of competition and consumer protection at Blake Dawson Waldron, have to say concerning the Birdsville amendment? On 28 September 2007 he said: Make no mistake: this law is bad for consumers and bad for competition. The fact that there is no equivalent law in any other country in the OECD reflects their understanding that it is highly undesirable to chill the flames of competition and is no basis for thinking that the amendment is progressive or beneficial. But we have heard from the member for Forrest that the opposition are going to support the Birdsville amendment. What was substantial market share? In the current legislation there is no definition and there are no factors listed to give us guidance-as the amendments in relation to market power provide. It is just hopeless. It leaves it all up to the courts to decide-a complete abdication of legislative responsibility, courtesy of Senator Joyce. The new amendments rectify these omissions and clarify the ‘take advantage' provision and recognise the reality of life for consumers and business-that it is market power, not market share, that counts. Market share is just the tool. It is just something look at to identify whether or not corporations have market power. You have to look at a rigorous analysis of the economy, of the section, of the pricing policy and a host of other factors when you consider market power. To focus alone on market share is not good enough. What do other people say about the Birdsville amendment? Professor Alan Fels, the former chair of the ACCC, has also been highly critical of the Birdsville amendment, as has Bob Baxt, who is a former chairman of the Trade Practices Commission and is a partner in the law firm Freehills-a well known and well-respected law firm which has been engaged by governments to do legal work on the behalf of governments. Bob Baxt said: The Birdsville amendment, which prohibits corporations with a substantial share of the market from engaging in predatory pricing for the purposes of damaging competition, is apparently based on a simplistic and unprincipled evaluation of how competition law should operate. … … … As the government has been previously advised by many, this is an inadequate guide for corporations to assess whether they are engaged in anticompetitive behaviour. He went on to say in his opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review of 19 September 2007: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has recently consistently said that market share will no longer be regarded as the most important or relevant factor in evaluating anti-competitive mergers. The commission correctly notes that, in assessing whether competition is lessened, other important issues include barriers to entry, countervailing power and related matters. … … … Far from protecting small businesses, this amendmentthat you can the Birdsville amendmentis likely to prove unwelcome to them as well as to others, as increased complexity will lead to litigation and lengthy appeals. Not only will the small business sector not enjoy any real success as a result of these amendments, but most importantly, consumers will suffer significantly as companies abandon any attempt to discount in situations where they have any degree of market share. A damning indictment indeed. The amendment contained in the bill that we are dealing with today-conferring jurisdiction and dealing with the reality of business experience and experience with consumers-is really important. In one sector alone it is important. The report of the ACCC inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries recommended a number of things, including unit pricing with a nationally consistent approach, changes to the zoning and planning laws to get rid of obstacles to supermarkets coming into shopping centres and changes to the horticultural code of conduct. The overview of that particular report said the bleeding obvious, that most Australians regularly visit supermarkets for their grocery needs, but then went on to say: As the average Australian household spends around 12 to 14 per cent of its after tax income standard groceries, increasing prices for these goods have been strongly felt. The ACCC received 250 public submissions and a vast quantity of data, information and documents from supermarkets and other retailers, suppliers and groups for this inquiry. So, in one sector alone, consumers really feel the pinch when it comes to abuse of market power. When I do my grocery shopping, consumers talk to me about the fact that there are too few businesses in the market. There are also changes in this amendment legislation in relation to unconscionable conduct. Currently under section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act, unconscionable conduct is proscribed in connection with the supply of goods or services to or the acquisition of the same from a corporation, and there are limits there when it comes to prices up to $10 million in terms of the supply of goods and services. The Senate inquiry recommended that the $10 million price limit be repealed. This bill abolishes the $10 million price threshold. This amendment will help to protect non-listed businesses engaged in business dealings exceeding $10 million. This bill will have a big impact in helping the people in my electorate. I do not live in an electorate where people are rich; the people in my electorate battle and struggle. It is a rural and regional seat. I know from my experience growing up in Ipswich that anything to help consumers will help the average person in my electorate. The consumers in my electorate do not have much opportunity to express themselves in the market on a day-today basis. When it comes to supermarkets, big producers and big suppliers are the ones who tend, in an oligopolistic way, to dictate the prices. Any amendments that will enhance the rights and roles of consumers in our society and improve competition and fair trading will help the people of Blair, and I strongly support this bill. It is an indictment on on the previous coalition government that it took this government, the Rudd Labor government, to make these amendments, which are long overdue.",28
7,Mr ROBERT,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The big question this afternoon is: is there a difference between market power and market share? The member for Blair would have us believe, through diatribe and legalese, that indeed market power is the panacea for all evil and that the current market power test will sustain all corporate evil and provide the right and best thing for small business. May I remind the honourable member for Blair that history has proven otherwise, and by history he stands condemned. Labor says no, the market power test is sufficient; I contend very strongly that the market power test is not sufficient and that the market share test, that of the Birdsville amendment, needs to remain. Small business in this country employs almost 50 per cent of the nation's workforce, and up to 50 per cent of these small businesses employ no-one. They are the engine room of the modern economy. Small business knows what it is to fight against large predatory competitors. They know what it is to battle daily to increase market share, feed their families and employ Australiansnotwithstanding Labor's recent budget of 134,000 unemployed; something, I contend, the Labor Party takes rather glibly. I speak on behalf of the hard working men and women of my electorate of Fadden, the fastest-growing electorate in the nation and one of three Gold Coast seats. As this House knows only too well, those three seats of the Gold Coast are the small-business powerhouse of the nation. The Gold Coast has more small to medium-sized enterprises per capita than any commensurate city or area in the country. And small business says the market power test is not sufficient to protect it from predatory pricing from competitors. So, whilst I support elements of the bill, I cannot support a return to market power by removing the Birdsville amendment on market share, nor can I support the move to allow the Federal Magistrates Court to hear section 46 cases. Before understanding where we are to go in the future, it is important to understand where we have come from in the past. The provisions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which includes section 46, prohibit various trade practices that tend to prevent lessen competition in an Australian market for goods and services. These provisions are at the heart of the Trade Practices Act. Since 1974 they have been instrumental in shaping the Australian economy. They lay down rules which, as interpreted by the courts from time to time, restrain anticompetitive behaviour and promote competition in the marketplace. The original form of section 46 of the TPA reflected provisions which went back to Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 in the United States and the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906. It was directed at a corporation operating independently using its market power against a competitor. Since that time, section 46 has been the subject of a number of formal inquiries and resultant amendments. Today, subsection 46(1) provides that: A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of: (a) eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation in that or any other market; (b) preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or (c) deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market. Despite the amendments to section 46 over the years, there remain concerns that the section does not achieve its purpose of prohibiting the misuse of market power. The Review of competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, the Dawson report, was released in April 2003. Its terms of reference were broadly cast, as there had not been a comprehensive review of the provisions since the Independent Committee of Inquiry into a National Competition Policy for Australia in 1993. After the Dawson or committee had completed its consultations, a number of decisions about section 46 of the TPA were handed down by the full Federal Court and High Court. Of these, Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2003) 215 CLR 374, the Boral case, raised a number of issues. However, the full weight of these judgements and decisions and the impacts they would have were not fully known; thus, the Dawson committee did not make any recommendations for change. The following year, the Senate Economics References Committee conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business, which detailed a number of concerns about the effectiveness of section 46 at that time; specifically: whether the TPA gives sufficient guidance as to what constitutes substantial power in a market; whether the TPA provides guidance as to what constitutes taking advantage of market power; whether there is protection against predatory pricing; whether a financial power test should be introduced; whether the TPA should proscribe the misuse of market power in a second market; whether there is sufficient protection against the of co-ordinated market power; and whether an effects test should be included as an tion to or substitute for the current purpose test. These have been recurring themes in calls for an update to section 46; hence the coalition's addition of the Birdsville ment in 2007 to further protect business from predatory firms who have a substantial market share. The Birdsville amendment was introduced a year or so ago. It stops a company with a substantial market share from selling or offering to sell goods or services below cost for a sustained period of time for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation, or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation; preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any market. Some on the Labor benches will argue that the Birdsville amendment introduced considerable uncertainty into the law by introducing concepts of ‘substantial market share', ‘sustained period' and ‘relevant cost', terms which had not been determined by the courts. May I refer my honourable Labor colleagues to the fact that, in the vast bulk of legislation in this House, terms will be defined by the courts from time to time and that waiting for the courts to determine the relevant meaning of phrases or words before enshrining them in legislation is farcical at best and perhaps a little stupid at worse. The bottom line is this: this amendment has not been in long enough for it to be properly tested in the courts in any way, shape or manner. Because the amendment is less than 12 months old, it clearly could not have any of the morose effects that are being suggested in such hyperbole from the Labor use government or, indeed, from big business. The provisions have not been in long enough addifor it to be clear how they need to be changed. All law needs time to settle down, to shake out, and for its relevance to be judged by industry. In this case, 12 months is amend- clearly not enough. The overwhelming question is: why would a company sell or offer to sell goods and services below cost for a sustained period of time if not to wipe out a competitor? The market share test simply says you cannot sell or offer to sell your goods and services at less than what you paid for them for a long period of time to knock out the bloke next door. And if you have got your goods and services for sale at a price less than what you paid for them for a sustained period of time, unless you have large market share, I would suggest very quickly you are heading for the bankruptcy courts. It is poor business practice to sell things for less than you bought things for, and the only reason you would do it for a sustained period of time is to knock out a competitor. This is not about sales over Christmas; this is not about a special to get customers through your front door; all of those things have a short duration attached to them. This is below-cost pricing for a sustained period of time. There is only one viable, economic reason why you would do that and that is to knock out your competitor, to put them out of business. I would have thought there would have been a term or a phrase or a concept that an economic conservative would understand, but clearly, in this form of government, I am vastly mistaken. The government wants to repeal the Birdsville amendment; it wants to get rid of the market share test and return to market power. Let me give the parliament a brief example. The Woolies and the Coles service stations have something like 16 to 17 per cent of service station locations, yet they control 80 per cent of the market. Their market power is 16 per cent of service stations; their market share is 80 per cent of fuel The two concepts are different and needed. Labor's amendment would reduce the scope of Birdsville and make it harder for the ACCC to bring action against large businesses who engage in some form of predatory pricing. Small business in particular, and especially in my electorate, is concerned that the meaning of market power, as defined by the High Court, is far too narrow. Market share is highly likely to be a simpler economic term for the courts to apply within their judgements. It is interesting to reflect upon the Boral case, as this has defined, more than any other case, what the market power test means. By way of history, Boral manufactures concrete masonry products-blocks, bricks, pavers. Boral, Pioneer, C&M, Rocla and Budgetfive companies-all supply these products in the Melbourne marketplace. In the 1990s a price war broke out between manufacturers of these masonry products for the supply of products into Melbourne. By their nature, a price war is a good thing for consumers. The price war took place when the Victorian economy was in recession. Surprise, surprise-a Labor government at the helm! It had an adverse effect upon the commercial building industry and the level of demand for concrete masonry products. Boral and Pioneer cut the prices charged for concrete and masonry significantly and, in many cases during the war, Boral's prices were less than their variable costs. In 1995 Rocla closed down all its Victorian masonry operations, followed in June 1996 by Budget, which stopped making concrete and masonry products. The ACCC alleged that between 1994 and 1996 Boral engaged in conduct that contravened section 46 of the TPA. In particular, the ACCC alleged that Boral reduced the pricesMr Shorten-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Between 1992 and sold. 1999 it was a conservative government in Victoria.",32
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,There is no point of order.,35
9,Mr ROBERT,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Hence I referred to it as being in the early 1990s, when the Labor Party was actually in power, that the price war broke out. But I thank the parliamentary secretary for his grasp of history, as only a great Labor man could possibly understand. Referring to the Boral case in particular, the ACCC alleged that the conduct of Boral was designed to eliminate or substantially damage C&M and other competitors, including Rocla and Budget. The majority of the High Court, with Justice Kirby in dissent, decided that Boral had not breached section 46 of the TPA. Section 46 did not contain, at the time, any concerns or words regarding predatory pricing. Clearly this case demonstrates that market power by itself is not sufficient. If market power could not be attached to the Boral case-Boral being the size that it was at the time when the price war started, when the Labor Party of Victoria had destroyed the economy, causing Kennett to come back in and restore the economy to the sort of First World economy that it wasmarket power by itself was not sufficient, considering what had happened during that time. Birdsville will not stop legitimate and competitive discounting, as is claimed by some large business organisations. The amendment will only be triggered by belowcost pricing, when that occurs, over an extended period of time for an anti-competitive purpose-an extended period of time; the period of time it took the Labor government in Victoria to almost wipe the economy out prior to the Kennett government.",35
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,The member for Fadden will refer to the bill before the House.,36
11,Mr ROBERT,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Birdsville will not stop pro-competitive discounting. It should not stop any company from matching a competitor's price or from holding Christmas sales, any other clearance sales, or sales to clear old stock at the end of the trading day. The Birdsville amendment is designed to protect small business from predatory pricing over an extended period of time. It is a good amendment. It needs time to work its way out. It has the support of the small business community-a community that Labor is perhaps not listening to, as they are seeking to remove the market share test. Moving onto the Federal Magistrates Court, the coalition does not support the proposal to allow the Federal Magistrates Court to hear section 46 cases. Existing section 86(1) confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court in respect of any civil proceeding arising under the Trade Practices Act. Existing section 86(1A) confers an additional jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court under certain limited parts of the Trade Practices Act. During the Senate inquiry, submissions expressed concerns about the costs and delays associated with bringing section 46 matters, particularly for smaller businesses. If the costs associated with enforcing section 46 are prohibitively high, then it will not be effective in addressing anticompetitive conproduct, no matter how well it is otherwise suited to doing so. Section 46 cases are, by their very nature, complex and are unlikely to be beneficial to small and medium business-that section of the economy that employs up to half of all Australian workers and that the coalition stands by, supports and defends. Section 46 cases often end up in the High Court. The Federal Court is best placed to hear section 46 cases because it contains most of the expertise pertaining to the TPA. It is unclear what this Labor government actually plan to do with the Magistrates Court. The jury is clearly out as to whether the court will remain or be subsumed. The government may abolish it, which may make the whole process completely useless. The coalition will stand up for small business. I will stand up for small business in the electorate of Fadden and for small business on the Gold Coast. The powerhouse that actually runs the economy is the small to medium enterprises. The coalition will stand up for it, and we will stand up for the Birdsville amendment. We will stand up for those hard working men and women who, through incentive, through opportunity and through choice, go out to make a difference for their families. We will stand up for these people and will not support the government's changes to these two elements of the TPA.",36
12,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"It is nice to have rare times in parliament when you have a bit of rhyme whereby the member for Braddon follows the member for Fadden-which is very good. I notice we have a number of primary schools represented in the galleries. We say hello and come them to the parliament; they can see us in our dry activities today-but on very important legislation. I might add that students from Table Cape Primary School, from my electorate, are in the building at the moment. Unfortunately, I was not able to meet with them just now. It is a wonderful school and they come from a beautiful part of the north-west coast of Tassie. They have beautifully rich soil there, and I have always mentioned to you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, that you can drop a toenail in the ground on Table Cape and grow a foot. It is a brilliant area and a brilliant school. Hence to the legislation before us, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. This is a bill to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to improve its ability to mote competition and fair trading in Australian markets and to crack down on anticompetitive behaviour. The member for Fadden mentioned history, and the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, is very much a student of Australian political history. He well knows that the Australian Labor Party has a strong legacy of competition reforms, having been responsible for the introduction of the Trade Practices Act in 1974 to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. Labor made improvements to the act in 1986 and also instigated National Competition Policy and led on into the 1990s with it. Part IV of the Trade Practices Act promotes competition by prohibiting anticompetitive conduct. Section 46 of part IV prohibits unilateral anticompetitive conduct, most notably by prohibiting corporations from misusing substantial market power to harm or eliminate competitors or competition generally. Part IVA of the Trade Practices Act promotes fair trading by prohibiting unconwelscionable conduct. In particular, section 51AC of part IVA prohibits unconscionable conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, a corporation. However, it is the government's belief-and this is mirrored in the legislation-that a series of court decisions have undermined the operation of the act, in particular section 46. You may well remember, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, that in opposition we indicated that we would strengthen the Trade Practices Act to restore its original 1986 intention. Schedules 1 and 2 of this legislation promote competition in Australian markets by enhancing the prohibitions against anticompetitive unilateral conduct contained in the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the competipro- tion code. Schedule 3 makes additional amendments to the Trade Practices Act and to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 46-misuse of market power-to: address predatory pricing, clarify the role of recoupment in predatory pricing cases, clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage', and confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court for section 46 matters. Schedule 2 of the bill makes corresponding amendments to the version of section 46 found in the competition code, which is the version of section 46 that applies to all persons in the states and territories by virtue of application legislation in those jurisdictions. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Trade Practices Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to require that one of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's deputy chairpersons have knowledge of or experience in small business matters to repeal the thresholds for unconscionable conduct cases under section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act and section 12CC of the ASIC Act and, finally, to clarify the ACCC's information gathering powers under section 155. I would like to concentrate on some sections of those schedule amendments. I mentioned that the bill strengthens sections 46 and 51AC as part of the government's ongoing commitment to improve Australia's trade practices laws. As mentioned, it also includes several amendments that improve the ability of the Trade Practices Act to be effectively enforced. By making these amendments, the bill implements the government's announcements of 28 April 2008 to strengthen the laws to promote fair competition. The measures contained in the bill were foreshadowed as opposition amendments to the Trade Practices Legislation Bill 2007. The amendments, however, were not adopted in the final version of that bill which was passed on 19 September 2007, despite many of them being recommended by the government's own Senate inquiry into ness of the Trade Practices Act, particularly in protecting small business. At the government, then in opposition, noted that the amendments would be pursued following a change of government. Small business and consumers demand nothing less than an effective trade practices regime. Reforming the Trade Practices Act to bring it into the 21st century has been an article of faith for this government. The package which I mentioned and on which I would like to elaborate will ensure genuine competition for the benefit of consumers and small businesses. Predatory pricing hurts small businesses with the consumer paying the ultimate price. The previous government's changes to the Trade Practices Actto which the previous speaker, the member for Fadden, certainly alluded-most notably the Birdsville amendment, were a rushed job, put through without consultation in September 2007. Those changes have introduced confusion into the act. The government's reforms will clarify this section of the act and, contrary to comments by members opposite, particularly the member for Pearce, strengthen its powers to identify anticompetitive behaviour. On advice from the ACCC, we have replaced the share of market test with the market power test because market power is a broader term which will capture anticompetitive behaviour from powerful businesses, whether that power comes from a high market share or any other source. The coalition have indicated they will be voting to keep the Birdsville amendment. The Birdsville amendment is not supported by the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, the former ACCC chair, or Mr Bob Baxt, who is a former chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. I would like to refer to some comments made by Bob Baxt in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday, 19 September 2007. His opening the effective- comments were: It is a great pity that the governmenttime, the the then Howard governmenthas chosen to ‘ride on the tail of political opportunism' in agreeing to the self-styled ‘Birdsville amendment' to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. After a fairly lengthy discussion about what he believed were the flaws in the Birdsville amendment, and I think it is well worth noting and perhaps contemplating his closing comments, he said: Far from protecting small business, this amendment is likely to prove unwelcome to them as well as to others, as increased complexity will lead to litigation and lengthy appeals. Not only will the small-business sector not enjoy any real success as a result of these amendmentsmost notably, the Birdsville amendmentbut most importantly, consumers will suffer significantly as companies abandon any attempt to discount in situations where they have any degree of market share. This legislation, introduced in haste and ently as a result (among other things) of the cisms made on a certain radio station, will not serve the Australian business community well (business, but most particularly consumers). I would like to look at this Birdsville amendment, which was part of the former government's legislation, and section 46(1AA). The present reference to market share has given rise to uncertainty and may reduce pro-competitive price competition in markets. The ACCC has publicly stated that section 46(1AA), as currently drafted, adds considerable confusion to the law and should be amended to clarify the protection it provides. The bill achieves this by aligning the Birdsville amendment with a long standing prohibition in section 46(1). In particular, the bill amends section 46(1AA) to focus it on a corporation's market power as opposed to its market share. The size of a firm including its market share will, however, remain a relevant factor in establishing a corporation's market power for the purposes of the revised prohibition. Section 46(1AA) presently operates in relation to firms with ‘a substantial share of a market'. This is inconsistent with a long standing prohibition in section 46(1), which operates in relation to firms with a substantial degree of market power. The bill amends section 46(1AA) to align its operation with the long standing prohibition in section 46(1). This includes focusing its operation on market power as opposed to market share. The concept of market power allows the court to consider all the relevant characteristics of a market in determining whether a firm has acted anticompetitively. Such factors would include the size of a firm including its market share, as well as the size and number of its competitors. The concept of market power has been effective in targeting unilateral anticompetitive conduct. For exappar- ample, in 2006 the Federal Court imposed critipenalties totalling $8.9 million on Safeway with respect to four breaches of section 46(1) and other anticompetitive conduct. This was despite Safeway having only around a 16 to 20 per cent share of the relevant market. I refer, as mentioned earlier, to a couple of other sections of our amendment. The bill amends the Trade Practices Act to require that at least one of the ACCC's deputy chairpersons have knowledge of, or experience in, small business matters. Why the requirement for small business experience? There are a number of trade practices issues that tend to confront small businesses in particular. These include issues relating to collective bargaining, retail tenancy, franchising, unconscionable conduct and the misuse of market power. The Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007 amended the act to create a second deputy chairperson for the ACCC. As noted in the second reading speech to the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007, it was intended that this position be filled by a candidate with experience in small business matters. However, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007 strangely did not include any legislative requirement to that effect. The government's amendments now include a legislative requirement that a deputy chair of the ACCC have small business experience. The amendment ensures that small business has a prominent and permanent voice at the ACCC. The ability of parties to effectively pursue rightful claims is as important as having well-drafted laws. Concerns have been expressed about the costs and delays associated with bringing section 46 matters. If the costs associated with privately pursuing section 46 claims are prohibitively high, it will not be as effective in addressing anticompetitive conduct. This bill addresses these concerns by conferring jurisdiction over private matters arising under section 46 on the Federal Magistrates Court. By doing so, the bill improves access to justice for businesses in cases arising in appropriate circumstances under this important provision. In the little time remaining to me I would like to look at the argument that we present regarding whether the Federal Magistrates Court is an appropriate court to hear section 46 matters. We believe it is. The 2003 Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small businesses considered that the Federal Magistrates Court had developed expertise in resolving issues without requiring the expense of a fully contested court case. It concluded that this expertise could resolve a substantial number of section 46 matters with cost savings to all sides. The Federal Magistrates Act 1999 permits the Federal Magistrates Court to transfer proceedings to the Federal Court when appropriate. Such a transfer may occur in complex and resource-demanding cases or where the amount being claimed is beyond the $750,000 jurisdictional limit of the Federal Magistrates Court. The 2003 Senate inquiry recommended that the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court be extended to enable it to deal with misuse of market powers, which relies on section 83 of the act. Section 83 allows parties to rely on findings of certain previous proceedings as prima facie evidence in an action for loss or damage. While a section 46 matter relying on section 83 of the act may be an example of an appropriate matter to be heard by the Federal Magistrates Court, there is no justification for so limiting its jurisdicin tion. In conclusion, the bill brought by the government to this House fulfils our commitments made in 2007, when this legislation was brought forward by the Howard government. The amendments we put forward strengthen the Trade Practices Act in its intentions to stop anticompetitive behaviour, to have fair trading and to have conscionable conduct. I recommend the government's bill to the House.",36
13,Mrs HULL,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise today to oppose the changes that the Labor government has proposed in the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 in relation to the Birdsville amendment in section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1999. The Birdsville amendment was introduced by the coalition government less than a year agoafter a long period of lobbying by a number of us on Capital Hill, in both this place and the other. It was introduced to ensure that small businesses had a fair go when major supermarkets and the like set up shop and made it very difficult for these small businesses to be as productive. Since the introduction of the Birdsville amendment, it has been no secret that it needs time to work and needs to be tested in the judicial system. We have to make sure that small businesses are not pushed out of the market by unfair, anticompetitive practices by much larger companies. I refer to a particular incident that took place in my electorate not so long ago. It has been the subject of some discussion by the ACCC and also NARGA, which is the body representing this particular small business. The situation, which was brought to the attention of the ACCC Chairman, two inquiry commissioners and a number of senior staff of the ACCC, was an example of what was believed to be an act of predatory pricing by Woolworths against a Supa IGA supermarket Cootamundra, in my electorate, in the Riverina. There was a list of products that Woolworths Cootamundra was selling each week at prices considerably below Woolworths' published statewide specials for those weeks-that is, Woolworths in Cootamundra were undercutting their own specials, which applied across their network in all other Woolworths stores in New South Wales. The reaction from the ACCC at the time was to reject the suggestion of predatory pricing, abuse of market power or whatever you would like to call it. The chairman suggested that it might have been in the interests of Metcash Ltd to give the independent some price support through this cycle, thereby subsidising the independent. And there were comments made that the chairman was cynical about suggestions the ACCC should act to stop such behaviour by Woolworths taking place. Some of the comments were that, if taken by the ACCC, this action would surely be to the advantage of the IGA independent. NARGA, in defence of their chain and the IGA in Cootamundra, pointed out that it could not be certain that Woolworths was selling below cost but they did know that Woolworths was selling below their own statewide specials and at an extremely low cost, and they indicated that the ACCC rightly had the necessary powers to investigate whether it was in fact below-cost pricing and therefore potentially predatory. Contact was made with the Cootamundra Supa IGA by the ACCC, but the ACCC basically said it would be really difficult to prove predatory pricing. There was no conversation in detail in relation to the allegation or the concerns that were being expressed by not only the owner of the Supa IGA but other people as well, and there was no great attempt to collect any information on the products or the period of time involved in this low pricing. I repeat: the pricing was below what was advertised right across New South Wales in every other Woolworths store. It did rate a mention, though, on page 538 of the grocery inquiry report. The ACCC said in relation to the Cootamundra allegation: The ACCC sought information from Woolworths about the pricing policies of its Cootamundra store and the costs of supplying the discounted products over the period of the promotion. Although the information provided suggestseverything always ‘suggests' to the ACCC!that Woolworths sold some of the relevant goods at below its cost of supply, the ACCC notes that this only occurred for a limited period, the purpose of which was to vigorously compete with a refurbished store reopening. The information did not suggest that the conduct was directed at or could have resulted in eliminating, or substantially damaging, the newly refurbished competitor. When the parliament passed the Birdsville amendment on predatory pricing, it was welcomed by many people-by me, Senator Ron Boswell, Senator Barnaby Joyce and those of us who had been trying to have this looked at and seen to since the integrity of the process had been undermined by the Boral case. It was a very important statement of principle. The parliament had really stated that the type of conduct that I have just referred to by Woolworths in Cootamundra was simply not acceptable. But it was also recognised that the courts would need to define some of the elements, including ‘substantial share of a market' and ‘sustained period of time'; that a complainant would still require the ACCC to establish where there had been below-cost selling, because a complainant would have no access to the internal company information of an alleged predator; and, finally, that the courts would need to decide on ‘purpose' in relation to injury or elimination of a competitor. The ACCC Chairman himself said in a news release on 12 October 2007: Inevitably, we will prosecute appropriate cases to test some of these questions before the court. However, it should be remembered that businesses which have suffered as the result of anticompetitive conduct of larger rivals can bring their own legal actions under the Act. It should not necessarily be assumed that the ACCC will be the first to bring forward such a case. It is equally conceivable that a private party could be the first mover in this area. In fact, torically, the majority of actions under section 46 have been taken by private litigants. Regardless, clarification from the courts on these issues will be welcome when it arrives. The news release went on to say: Mr Samuel said that the full implications of the changes would not be known until they had been properly tested by the courts … But now Mr Samuel is acting as the court. Is this a vote of no confidence from the member for Riverina in Mr Samuel? Sadly, sorrily, so it is. I for one have always stood up for the integrity of the Chairman of the ACCC, but I am sad to say that I can no longer stand up for that integrity. I have come up with every conceivable reason why the ACCC can do nothing about anything anymore. Here we have now-rather than an increase of rigour over those businesses to ensure their behaviour is not predatory and an abuse-a watering down of this section, and it is a crime to say the least. COSBOA is the Council of Small Business of Australia and represents those small businesses. I did note that someone from the government side of the House last week-I cannot recall who-indicated that COSBOA actually supports the removal of this principle. It does not. It clearly says in its press release of 27 August 2008: COSBOA believes that it should be the birth right of every Australian to have the opportunity to start their own business, and to succeed or fail on merit, without fear of being crushed by predatory tactics used by large corporations taking advantage of their greater market share or greater financial resources. Effective laws to prohibit Predatory Pricing are essential in fostering an entrepreneurial culture, which is vital to the future economic prosperity of the nation. It is a fact that those small businesses that make up rural and regional Australia in parhisticular are always at the mercy of many issues and it is very difficult for them to represent their own needs. It is through COSBOA and many others that they can have some sense of justice. Basically, COSBOA is saying that the government's proposed changes to the Trade Practices Act reinstate both the market power test and the take advantage test. In the past, these tests operated as an escape clause, not as a clause to sort out predatory pricing but as an escape clause for large corporations to hide behind to destroy competition with predatory pricing practices. Big business wants these terms reinstated into the Birdsville amendment because they know that their predatory pricing will not be captured under these tests as the High Court has very narrowly interpreted such concepts. This is the reason for the insertion of the Birdsville amendment to section 4: to give small businesses the opportunity to be able to function. COSBOA also supported the changes made by the former government to introduce a new test of market share for predatory prices cases to overcome the High Court's narrow interpretation of the concepts of ‘market power' and ‘take advantage'. COSBOA says that small business prefers the market share test as the market power test and take advantage test are just too difficult, and the federal government is not making these tests any simpler. COSBOA is not convinced that government's proposed changes to reinstate these tests will strengthen the act in any way and is concerned that these changes would in fact weaken the act. So it is an absolute issue for that organisation that represents small businesses. We continue to go along in significant terms about the issues that are currently being faced and are related in many instances. There is no doubt that more competition brings down the prices for the consumer, whereas market centralisation allows the dominant players to exploit the consumer, the grower and the farmer. Less competition means higher fuel and grocery prices for consumers, and this all adds to inflation. Less competition means that farmers get less and less for their meat and their products, which would have dire consequences for the livelihoods of many. Our small businesses are an integral part of any economy, especially in rural and regional areas. In Australia in 2006, small businesses accounted for 58 per cent of the private sector jobs growth and generated an estimated 30 per cent of the nation's economic production. In Australia small businesses employ around four million people, which represents over 45 per cent of the workforce, much of this workforce in rural and regional Australia. Our small businesses are the backbone of our local communities. They are always the first port of call to support our charities, especially when they are having fund-raising ventures and the like, and small businesses are always there to support other local clubs with sponsorship and donations. The small businesses in our rural communities are already doing it tough because they have often been set up solely as a support for those rural communities and they have come to depend on these consumers to purchase their products. It is a very courageous effort to set up a business. You often risk your family, your home and your possessions in order to provide your service and goods to the community and also to provide employment opportunities. What we have seen and what I have demonstrated here today is the fact that Mr Samuel has publicly said on many occasions that the ACCC's role is to protect competition, not competitors. But I say to you, Mr Speaker, there is one issue here that cannot be denied: the ACCC's protection of competition has been a resounding failure, more so in the last nine to 10 months than it ever has been before. It has been a resounding failure and an entirely new strategy is required. As I said, the ACCC report into our GroceryWatch was an absolute indictment on the fair go for the Australian person, on the fair go for the Australian business. I stand here in this House today to say I have no confidence in the ACCC; I have no confidence in the ACCC chairman; and I suspect that future businesses in Australia will be severely impacted upon as a result of what takes place in this House over the next few weeks in respect of this piece of legislation.",40

16,Mr RUDD,PARALYMPIC GAMES,"On indulgence, I would like to note that Australia's Paralympics team has left to compete in the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games. At this year's Paralympic Games in Beijing, Australia will take a total team of 170 athletes and 121 support staff-our biggest ever team to go to an away games. I was honoured to be at the announcement of the team in Parliament House on 29 July and to meet some of the athletes. The Paralympic Games is the pinnacle of sporting achievement for athletes with a disability, and Australia has a long and proud history at these games. In fact, Australia has participated in the Paralympic Summer Games ever since they commenced, back in Rome in 1960. We Australians take great pride in those who represent our country. We love to see our teams compete on the world stage. Not too many people get to reach the level of excellence where they can wear the national colours of Australia and compete against the best in the world in their chosen sport. The nation will be cheering our Paralympians on in Beijing when their competition starts next week. Our Paralympians inspire all Australians. The example they set goes an enormous way to motivating other Australians to get active, to participate in sport and to be the absolute best that they can. They are role models, not only as sports men and women but also as extraordinary individuals. We will be watching, we will be cheering and we will be proud of their every achievement. NA NA",43
17,Mr RUDD,ELECTION,"On indulgence on another matter: last Thursday night in Denver, Colorado, Senator Barack Obama accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party as the candidate for the upcoming US presidential election. I would like to congratulate Senator Obama on his nomination. I would like to note the significance of his nomination, not least because it took place on the 45th anniversary Martin Luther King's famous ‘I have a dream' speech. His acceptance of the nomination was a milestone in US presidential election campaigns. We have an African American now as a presidential candidate for a major political party in the United States, more than 150 years after the Civil War. This week there will be another milestone. The Republican Party will hold its convention and Senator John MCCain will accept his party's nomination as presidential candidate. I want to offer my congratulations to Senator MCCain on his imminent nomination. It is a great thing to watch the workings of one of the world's great democracies. We wish both candidates well and both their parties well for the upcoming presidential election. It will be hard-fought. But whatever the outcome, should the Democrats or the Republicans prevail, Australia will have a great friend in this upcoming presidential election because our relationship-Australia and the United States-goes beyond the partisan divide; it is a relationship which has endured through the generations and will endure for the generations.

18,Dr NELSON,PARALYMPIC GAMES,"On indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister in cheering on our Paralympic team as it heads off to Beijing today for the commencement of the Paralympic Games on Saturday. We are sending 175 athletes, and behind every one of those men and women is a story of remarkable courage in the face of adversity, supported by the love of families, by administrators, trainers, doctors, physiotherapists and a variety of people who have made it possible for them to go to the Paralympics. Their sacrifices as Paralympians indeed are an inspiration to the entire nation, only a week after we welcomed back the Australian of Olympic team. Their speed, their strength and their skills do not materialise overnight and are the product of years and years of hard work. These men and women exemplify the best of the Australian spirit. What each individual achieves is limited only by their own dreams and the extent of their effort, discipline and sacrifice. Australia consistently finishes in the top five sporting nations in the Paralympics. Let us hope that it is the same on this occasion. join with the Prime Minister in wishing our Paralympic team all the very, very best in representing the finest ideals of being an Australian, the finest ideals of sport and the finest ideals of overcoming adversity in life to be your very, very best.

19,Dr NELSON,GUSTAV,"On indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister in recognising the importance of the United States democratic process and the election of Senator Barack Obama as the Democrat presidential candidate. I also recognise that Senator John MCCain, the Republican candidate, has chosen Sarah Palin as the first female Republican vice-presidential nominee and only the second ever female vice-presidential nominee, behind Geraldine Ferraro for the Democrats in 1984. Sarah Palin is a 44-year-old mother of five, including a son who will soon go to Iraq and a four-month-old son with Down syndrome. Both the presidential candidates have the very best interests of not only the United States but the world at stake, and both are very, very familiar with Australia and its strategic interests. In relation to the United press the concern that all Australia have for the possible impact of Hurricane Gustav as it sweeps across potentially five states in the United States, affecting up to 11½ million Americans and in particular the almost quarter of a million people in New Orleans who have already been evacuated. NA Interest Rates",45
20,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why I are interest rates coming down when inflation is going up?",45
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Reserve Bank sets interest rates, and one of the things it sets interest rates on the basis of is the state of overall inflationary pressures in the economy. One of the things that the Reserve Bank is entirely mindful of is the extent to which those inflationary pressures have endured over time. If you look carefully at the minutes of the most recent Reserve Bank meeting, it has concluded that these inflationary pressures have continued for some time. Furthermore, it has noted, as I believe has the IMF recently, that there has also been a moderating influence brought to bear on fiscal policy through the right settings which have been adopted by the government through its management of the budget.",45
22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,45
23,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For those who scoff opposite, I would draw their attention to the most recent statement to this effect by the International Monetary Fund. If you are able to bring your fiscal policy into balance with your monetary policy, and to ensure that you have got the right settings overall, you make the job of the Reserve Bank easier to bring down interest rates over time. That has been one of the core organising principles which we have sought to bring to bear in the debate States, I also exon the economy. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the key thing is that it is the Reserve Bank which sets rates. I note with interest, on that score, that the Leader of the Opposition had something to say to this effect this morning. He was disputing the proposition that the independence of the bank should be respected. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition began speaking about a particular requirement of the bank to bring in a 50 basis point decrease. A journalist said to the Leader of the Opposition: ‘You have made a case for 50. If you are Prime Minister, does that give you carte blanche to tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements-cuts or increases in the future?' Mr Nelson replied, ‘Well, the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the government of the day is obviously to make sure that we get the economic settings right, to talk up the Australian economy, not to talk the economy down, to speak responsibly about the inflationary challenge that we face.' All fine and dandy. We go on. Journalist: ‘Would you like to see the Prime Minister say what you have said?' That is calling on the bank for a 50 basis point decrease. Mr Nelson: ‘No, I'm not going to comment on that at all.' Journalthis ist: ‘But you're the alternative Prime Minister as well. If Prime Minister, does that that you will tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements?' Answer: ‘No.' So what we have is the Leader of the Opposition going out on the doors this morning, saying to the Reserve Bank that there should be a defined decrease of a particular quantum in the cash rate, while we on this side of the House respect the independence of the Reserve Bank. But then he is asked the key question: ‘You've said that as Leader of the Opposition. If you're elected as Prime Minister, are you going to say that as well?' He says no. Ms Julie Bishop-It's a different job.",45
24,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The interjection says it is a different job. I hear constantly the Leader the Opposition stand at the dispatch box and say he speaks as the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, and therefore his pronunciaThis, tions on monetary policy are those of the alternative Prime Minister-that is, that the Reserve Bank should act in a particular way. What we now have is the new Nelson doctrine: what I say in opposition has nothing whatsoever to do with what I do in government. In other words, the overall dictum of those opposite is to say anything, to do anything, to promise anything in order to get themselves a headline. How can the Leader of the Opposition stand credibly in the parliament today and speak about responsible economic management when he goes out one morning and says, as Leader of the Liberal Party and as alternative Prime Minister, that the Reserve Bank should take a particular course of action on rates and, in the same breath, say that if he were Prime Minister he would not say that or do that? That is where we have got to with the Leader of the Opposition. The credibility of the Leader of the Opposition on this entire debate on interest rates-quite apart from how we have got to position in the first place, given that we have had 10 interest rate rises in a row under mean the Liberal Party-collapsed on the doors this morning when he said, ‘I, Brendan Nelson, will be opportunistic and say what I like on this, but I, Brendan Nelson, as alternative Prime Minister, would not do this.' The Leader of the Opposition does not know whether he is coming or going. Economy",46
25,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is steering Australia through these tough global economic times?,46
26,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we know, in Australia we are facing tough global economic times. This is because we are dealing with the impact of of the global financial crisis, the impact of changes in global credit markets and also the impact of falls on global stock exchanges. of course, has been compounded by the oil price hike and the food price hike, and the result is that we have seen across the world both business and consumer confidence take a pounding. You see that in the numbers generated out of the various OECD economies, where five of the seven economies have generated either zero or negative growth in the most recent quarter. These global economic challenges have been compounded for Australia by the domestic economic circumstances which this government inherited. To recap for those opposite",46

30,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the member for Higgins has come to life, yet again, having been out on the town with some others on Friday night in Melbourne talking to a few folk. The cumulative impact of those interest rate changes over time-that is, 10 interest rate rises in a rowMr Costello interjecting",47
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Higgins does not like this number-on a $247,000 average mortgage, means that we have a $400 a month interest rate hit as a result of the Costello interest rate regime-$100 a week. So if you calculate it on the basis of average mortgage and the impact of 200 basis point increases in official interest rates10 interest rate rises in a row-that is where it leads you. That is the practical consequence for working families-a Costello $400 a month interest rate hit or the Liberals' $400 a month interest rate hit. The question that the parliament rightly asked itself is: what is the correct economic strategy in response to this? The first element is responsible economic management, and that is why we have brought down a $22 billion budget surplus. The second, of course, is to ensure that we have a program of comprehensive economic reform to deal with declining productivity growth in the Australian economy. These are the matters about which the Deputy Prime Minister and I have spoken in recent days-the productivity revolution and the education revolution which is necessary to fuel long-term skills growth. Then there is the challenge of nation buildingand I will come back to that in a minute. And, of course, to assist working families, pensioners and carers on the way through this difficult period, there is our policy of a $55 billion Working Families Support Package and $7.5 billion to assist with extra payments to pensioners and carers. But the real challenge is how we take this entire economic agenda of the nation forward to deal with our real, long-term challenges: responsible economic management; acting on the productivity challenge for the education revolution; and implementing a program of nation building. This government stands proudly behind the fact that it is about to embark upon the single largest nationbuilding program in the Commonwealth's history. We have committed ourselves to a $76 billion Infrastructure Investment Program focused on our roads, our rail, our ports, our communications and our other an critical infrastructure. The government will be investing $26 billion in roads and rail infrastructure through 2008-09 to the end of the AusLink 2 period; $20 billion in infrastructure, through the Building Australia Fund, on transport and also on other key infrastructure priorities; up to $5 billion on a national high-speed broadband network; $15 billion in education infrastructure through the Education Investment Fund on trades training centres, computers in our classrooms and investing in our universities; and $11 billion in health and hospitals infrastructure as well. Beyond this national infrastructure plan for Australia, the biggest national infrastrucHouse ture plan in the history of the Commonwealth, a $76 billion plan, we also look with keen interest to what the private sector is doing in the period ahead. If we look at the most recent capex data produced by the ABS, we see that there are significant plans out there in the private sector to boost their investment in capital outlays into the future as well. This is a significant plan. When we add what is canvassed in the capex data, we see businesses planning to invest more than $100 billion in 2008-09. The way ahead through these difficult economic times is to have a clear and positive plan-a clear and positive plan of responsible economic management, a clear and positive plan on productivity growth through an economic reform agenda anchored in the education revolution and, on top of that, a $76 billion nation-building plan for the future. This separates us out from those opposite, who, I fear, in recent days, have seen to their political advantage to begin talking the economy down rather than coming up with a positive plan for the economy's future. This government is about the economic future. Those opposite continue to revel in the past and are consoled by their inertia in the past as well.",47

36,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer explain to the House why he is anticipating a fall in official interest rates when inflation is expected to rise to five per cent over the year to December and unemployment is expected to rise to 4.75 per cent?,48
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, because this is a decision which is taken by the independent Reserve Bank. We on this side of the House respect the independence of the Reserve Bank. From day one, when we came to ofit fice, we did take responsibility for dealing with and tackling the inflation problem that was left to us by those opposite-16-year high inflation in October, November and December",48
38,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,48
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,48
40,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which produced 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberal Party. But we put up our hand and said we would accept responsibility for dealing with it, and dealing with it we are. We are dealing with it through responsible economic management, by building a strong surplus, a $22 billion surplus, that those opposite want to vandalise. We are also dealing with it by attending to the capacity constraints that those opposite ignored for 12 long years, thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation. On top of that, now we have the worse global conditions in over 25 years. All of these things are taken into account by the Reserve Bank, but one thing we did in our budget was that we made room to move. We made room to move for the Reserve Bank. They will take their independent decision tomorrow. But of course, if those opposite had their way, there would be no room to move for the Reserve Bank, because they want to vandalise the surplus. Do they have one single coherent answer to the problem of inflation, to do something about inflation and interest rates? Of course they don't. There is not one consistent economic policy coming from any of those opposite who pretend to know something about economic policy. I was talking here last week about the ‘Three Stooges' on the other side. There was the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are asking very simple, factual questions. In this case, it was a factual question about official interest rates being likely to fall when inflation is expected to rise to five per cent over the year to December and unemployment is projected to rise. I ask you to bring the Treasurer back to the question that was asked.",48

42,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am dealing with inflation, I am dealing with interest rates and I am dealing with employment. The Leader of the Opposition was asked at the doors today whether, as Prime Minister, he would instruct the Reserve Bank governor to do what he had just advocated a couple of minutes earlier. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said at the doors in answer to the question, ‘If Prime Minister, does that mean you will tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements?' He answered, ‘No.' He admitted that his policy in opposition is too irresponsible to be put in place in government. That is how irresponsible this Leader of the Opposition is.",49
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Has the Treasurer concluded? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Again, the Treasurer was asked a specific question about what he is doing about the economic challenges facing the nation. I ask that you bring him back to the question that was asked.",49
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The wording of the question asked the Treasurer to explain. The Treasurer will be very mindful of the question and make his answer relevant.,49
45,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly, Mr Speaker, and because it was a question about who was responsible for interest-rate movements, absolutely. And what we had this morning from the second stooge, the member for Wentworth, at the doors, was that he walked out there and said that the government was responsible for interest rates going up, and in the next breath he said that if they came down we would not be responsible. He cannot have it both ways. On top of that, we had the third stooge",49
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will refer to members by their titles.,49

55,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. The Rudd government is dealing with the most complex set of global economic circumstances in over 25 years. And on top of that we have inflation at 16-year highs, bequeathed to the people of Australia by those opposite.

What is the government doing at home to respond to the impacts of the slowing global economy?",50
58,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are very serious issues for the country which were not taken seriously by those opposite when they were in power. They were not taken seriously at all12 years of neglect. We are dealing with these issues, and we will not be deflected by their economic vandalism in the Senate as we deal with them, because this country is dealing with the most complex set of global economic factors in over 25 yearsMr Baldwin-You can't handle them!",50

60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Paterson is warned!,50
61,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The largest developed economies are struggling to grow. The UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy all recorded zero or negative growth in the three months to June. And this problem combined with the impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, left to the country by those opposite, is slowing our economy. But there are grounds for optimism in all of this because we have a substantial budget surplus and, of course, as we have seen today from the latest figures from the bureau, commodity prices are also at a record high, and that is a good thing. And, as we saw from the capex figures the other day, business is continuing to invest. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we also have $40 billion put away in our investment funds to invest in the productive capacity of the future, to lift the productive capacity of the economy, and to deal with the inflationfor ary challenges that this country faces. So what we will do is to control those things that are under the control of domestic governments. What that means is a disciplined fiscal policy. It also means investing in the productive capacity of the economy. Of course, that is more difficult when those opposite want to use the Senate to punch a hole in the budget surplus. But, as the Prime Minister said earlier, we on this side of the are absolutely determined to invest in nationbuilding projects, to lift the productive capacity of the economy and our international competitiveness, because what we are battling here is 12 years of neglect from those opposite. But we have put up our hand to accept responsibility for fixing it, and we are putting in place a long-term strategy for the future. We will not make the same mistake that those opposite made. They celebrated prosperity but did nothing to achieve it into the future. Economy",50
62,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why have real wages dropped by one per cent since the election of the Rudd government?",51
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you look at the data contained in the budget papers, we projected that there would be a softening in employment in 2008-09, and therefore an increase in unemployment from 4.75 per cent. Furthermore, parallel to that, we also projected in the budget papers that there would be softening economic growth. As a consequence of that, we are dealing with softer and more challenging economic times. We have been upfront about that. We have not sought to be evasive about it; that is just the truth. fore, that has an effect on all working families. Because of the cost pressures I have run through before at the dispatch box, it also has an effect on, in particular, pensioners and carers, who are trying to make ends meet. What I also say to those opposite on the question of the employment conditions of working Australians is that the biggest impact over time on the take-home pay of working families is the industrial relations system under which people work. Therefore, noting that we have got softening global economic circumstances, and noting also that we have upwards revisions of unemployHouse ment-these are facts-I would ask those opposite: would workers who are, for example, in some of the businesses referred to by those opposite last week, where there have been closures and where people have lost their jobs, prefer an industrial relations system where redundancy payments were guaranteed or one where redundancy payments were signed away? I say that there is a fundamental difference between those opposite and those who stand as members of the government-the fundamental difference about which we fought the last election-which is that we believe, whatever circumstances a business finds itself in, people should have a right to proper redundancy payments. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was, ‘Why have real wages fallen by one per cent since the election of the Rudd government?' It was not a question about employment; it was about real wages.",51
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Infrastructure,51
65,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister outline for the ThereHouse how members of the public and the business community can put forward their ideas for infrastructure projects of national significance?",51
66,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. Today Infrastructure Australia is releasing two discussion papers, the first on public-private partnerships and the second calling for submissions from the public and the business community on nationally significant infrastructure. Submissions will close on 15 October and it is indeed important that the community have input into this debate because infrastructure is vital to people's everyday lives. Often it is not noticed until it does not work-until families are stuck in traffic jams or until people cannot get access to high speed broadband. That is why infrastructure needs to be a national priority for nation building. That is why we built a surplus with a purpose. It is a surplus with a purpose in the short term: to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. It is a surplus with a purpose in the long term: to put aside $41 billion into nation-building funds. But you cannot actually put this money aside for long-term nation building if the surplus is diminished and if the surplus has a $6.2 billion hole drilled in it by those opposite. We must remember this: every single time that those representing the opposition in the Senate say no to a budget bill, they are saying no to proposals to unclog our ports. They are saying no to proposals to deal with urban congestion. They are saying no to proposals for better public transport. When you look at a budget, you actually have to look at priorities. For this government, our priority has been dealing with the pressures which we have been dealt-the 16-year high in inflation and the international circumstances of the credit squeeze and rising petrol pricesnot only by producing a surplus but also by putting aside these funds for long-term nation building. But those opposite will in coming days have to make a decision about their priorities. For example, is it more important to maintain an industry start-up concession for condensate that came in 24 years ago or is it more important to deal with nation building, to deal with infrastructure and to deal with the capacity constraints that were identified by the Reserve Bank in 20 separate warnings? The people of Australia are interested in infrastructure and they will judge those oppositeMr Irons interjecting",51

71,Ms MARINO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why has household wealth declined by more than five per cent since the election of the Rudd government?,52
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is pretty interesting when it comes to the use of economic data by those opposite. I am reflecting on the question which was asked just before about wage growth. I am just talking to Business indicators, Australia",52
73,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,52
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"whether you are interested in this or not. Wages and salaries grew by 2.3 per cent in the June quarter. I thought they said something that was the reverse. Let us reflect carefully on the data which has put forth by those opposite. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. He is answering the last question. Could he come to this question?",52
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,52
76,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, consistent with reflections made by various members of the front-bench on questions posed by those opposite, we will always examine in due course the statistical underpinnings of the propositions being put at their dispatch box. I draw attention to one such inconsistency. On the question which has just been put, if you face what we have had in recent times-a global economic meltdown which has impacted on global stock exchanges and which, in turn, has impacted on the investments of shareholders-that obviously impacts on calculations of wealth.",52
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,53
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,53
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That follows as night follows day. If you look across the global economy, you see stock markets across the world with very large corrections heading south, whether it is in the United States, the United Kingdom or continental Europe. The flowthrough impact that has on individuals' overall wealth calculations is therefore automatic. The key question is: what is a credible strategy for the future? The credible strategy which this government advances is: (1) responsible economic management; (2) investing in long-term productivity growth; (3) ensuring that you have a plan for nation building, because that is essential to deal with long-term constraints on growth; and (4) that you assist also with pressures being faced by working familiesMs Marino- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. I just wonder whether the Prime Minister would like me to read my question again.",53
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening very carefully to the Prime Minister and he is responding to the question.,53
81,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, the critical thing is that you have an economic strategy for the future, given the constraints which we inherited from the international economy, the challenges which we inherited from the domestic economy and the roll-through impact-the member for Forrest laughed to herself at the impact-of 10 interest rate rises in a row or Costello's $400 a month interest rate hike for working families across Australia. If you want to know what impacts on overall wealth and overall prosperity for Australian families, think very carefully about the cumulative impact of the interest rate regime prosecuted by those opposite: 10 interest rate rises in a row-a $400 interest rate hike per month imposed on working families. I would suggest that those opposite get with the government's economic agenda being proposed in the Senate and act responsibly with us in building long-term national infrastructure; hence our proposal that we put forward in the parliament today. Get with us on the challenge to boost long-term productivity growth and get out of the way in the Senate of a responsible budget surplus which provides this nation with a buffer for dealing with critical economic challenges which lie ahead. Interest Rates",53
82,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on recent movements in the cost of living interest rates?,53
83,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Yesterday, Wizard Home Loans announced that it would be cutting its standard variable home loan rate by 25 basis points and, of course, this will be welcome relief for those Australians who have a mortgage with Wizard. Wizard has thrown down the gauntlet to all of its competitors. I guess we expect, as all Australians expect, all banks to pass on, within a reasonable amount of time, in full, any official RBA interest rate cut. The government expects it, the people of Australia expect it and, in particular, those people who have been receiving interest rate rise after interest rate rise expect it. Something like 740,000 Australians have taken out their first home loan in the past 7½ years and those 740,000 Australians have never experienced an official cut in the RBA rate, so they most certainly will be expecting the banks to pass on any relief in full. tant Governor Lowe of the Reserve Bank has made it very clear; he has said that banks simply have no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down. We do understand that families are doing it tough. We understand that 10 interest rate rises under those opposite, 12 interest rate rises in total, have put families under tremendous financial pressure. We also understand that we are not out of the woods here yet. That is why it is so important that banks do the right thing and follow the Reserve Bank decision down, if that is the way it goes when the announcement is made tomorrow. If the official rate does come down, it important that banks pass it on in full so families get the relief they deserve. Economy",53
84,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and it asks why inflation in Australia has increased by 1.5 percentage points since the election of the Rudd government.,54
85,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again the government has sought to be transparent with the Australian community-which we have been-through the budget papers by indicating that, when it comes to our CPI projections, those projections would increase over time before coming back into correction in 2009-10. Let me explain to the honourable member why CPI goes up. There are supply-side factors and there are demand-side factors. On the supply side, it is like this: problems with infrastructure bottlenecks and skills shortages produce a supply-side constraint in the economy, which produces an inflationary effect. That is economics 101. But that economics 101 was the subject of 20 separate warnings to those opposite through the Reserve Bank, each of which they comprehensively ignored. The impact over time of ignoring each of those warnings, year in, Assisyear out, is that spread over many years those inflationary pressures build, and that is precisely what has occurred. It is not just on infrastructure, but it is also on skills. I read through these warnings from the Reserve Bank again this morning; they make for quite stark reading. Time after time, year after year, the Reserve Bank was warning those opposite about the need to act on the skills shortages in the economy and to act also on other capacity constraints. If the honourable member wants to understand, therefore, why the government is so wedded to its strategy of a nation-building plan and an education revolution, it is beis cause it goes to the heart of the inflation that question which the honourable member has just posed. That is, if you are going to effectively deal with infrastructure bottlenecks, you do not just wave a hand and say ‘not my problem'; you do not just wave a hand over there and say ‘it's a matter for the states'-or for the pixies at the bottom of the garden. No, it is something that you have to invest in and have a plan for doing. That is why the government stands behind its $76 billion national infrastructure plan, which I spoke about in answer to an earlier question. We do not believe that you can just be silent and idle on these questions; you need a plan of action and you need the funds to back it, which is what we have outlined in the most recent budget. Similarly, on the skills agenda, we have created Skills Australia in addition to Infrastructure Australia. We have created an $11 billion Education Investment Fund. We have radically increased the number of training places in the economy, in our eight to nine short months in office. The reason for doing so is that we have sought to act on these skills shortages, which form the other part of the inflation equation which the honourable member has spoken of. All of that is on the supply side. Then there is the demand side. As the honourable member for Melbourne, the Minister for Finance, has pointed out time after time at the dispatch box, the real rate at which public demand was increasing under the previous government was four to five per cent a year. This is a huge impact. In fact, if you look at where those numbers would go over time had we sustained expenditure increases of the order of magnitude which the government was running in 2007-08, it would have cost taxpayers an extra $23 billion. There was 5.2 per cent growth in outlays in the 2007-08 period, and we have brought that down to one per cent. Why is all this important? Had we been following the same reckless course of action of those opposite, we would have created a set of circumstances which would have made it much more difficult for the Reserve Bank to bring about a revision to the upwards movements in interest rates that we have seen in recent years. So my answer to the honourable member's question is: here are two sets of supply-side factors which have helped to fuel inflation over a long period of time. One is infrastructure and one is skills shortages. We, the government, are acting on those. In our nine months in office, we have sought through concrete plans to begin to turn back 12 years of inaction on the part of those opposite. On the demand side of the economy, we have also sought to act not simply to fuel the fires, which those opposite did through their five per cent real increase in outlays last year, but to provide policy space for the Reserve Bank to act and also, therefore, to bring about downwards pressure on interest rates. That has driven the government's overall economic agenda. That is how we have sought to tackle the inflation challenge. It is a challenge which will take some time to implement and to properly effect over time. But I say to the honourable member: it is far better to have a coherent strategy for dealing with a problem than to have 12 years of sweeping aside 20 successive warnings of the Reserve Bank that there was a problem. Education",54
86,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. What steps is the government taking to lift literacy and numeracy results of Australian students to boost long-term productivity?,55
87,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and note her deep interest in all matters related to education, and particularly school education in her electorate. The more than decade of neglect of our education system by the Howard government is over, and not a moment too soon. I regret that I have to advise the House of some very disturbing statistics emerging from the National Report on Schooling in Australia 2007. These statistics show what happens when you have a national government that engages in more than a decade of neglect of education, as the Howard government did. For six of those long years the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had the education portfolio. This report shows that numeracy achievement across the years of primary school actually goes down-that is, the number of students who fail to meet adequate benchmarks increases the further that they go on in primary school. Mr Tuckey interjecting",55
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know it is going to be complicated for the member for O'Connor to understand, but if he would just try to stay with the program. Year 3 students are showing a result that 93.2 per cent of them are achieving the numeracy benchmark. By year 5 that falls to 89 per cent, and by year 7 it falls to 80.2 per cent. Mr Simpkins interjecting",56
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think I am being asked: whose fault is it? You might want to have that conversation with the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the people who served as education ministers in the Liberal Party for the last six years.,56
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will ignore the interjections. The interjectors will cease.,56
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, the number of students obtaining numeracy benchmarks",56
92,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. I did think the member from her side asked what the Rudd government was going to do about education. We have listened long enough to some issue of history. In fact, the issue of benchmarks that she refers to did not always exist.",56
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question asked was about what steps the government was taking to lift literacy and numeracy. The Deputy Prime Minister will be relevant to the question.,56
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pointing to the need to lift numeracy standards because we are seeing results like that. Then, having results like that, we are also advised of some of the things that would make a difference to numeracy attainment. The National Numeracy Review commissioned by the Council of Australian Governments and released in July this year concluded that the systematic teaching of numeracy in the early years of schooling, in maths lessons and in the wider curriculum, is essential to numeracy development. It went on to recommend that all jurisdictions should work towards a minimum of five hours per week of mathematics for students in all primary schools. That important piece of information is joined by new research from the United Kingdom in the form of the 2008 Independent Review of Mathematics Teaching in the Early Years Settings and Primary Schools. The United Kingdom report recommended that every primary school should have a specialist mathematics teacher. So there we have the problem defined: numeracy standards and the number of students obtaining benchmarks going down over their years in primary school. We have work which suggests that more focus on numeracy development and specialist teaching can make a difference in primary school. I am pleased to advise the House, and I am sure this will please the member for O'Connor, that the Rudd Labor government is responding to the lack of maths teachers in our schools. We made an election commitment, which we delivered in the recent budget, to have HECS for people who got maths or science qualifications and then went teaching. On the weekend it was my pleasure to announce that we have expanded that program so that it also covers primary school teaching. If maths graduates from our universities in particular choose to go teaching, they will experience a 50 per cent HECS reduction. That can be worth $1,500 each year to them. This is part of dealing with the seen numeracy challenges that face this country when we are returning statistics like that. Of course, no one thing fixes this challenge entirely. It takes quality teaching. It takes quality schools. It takes a new focus on disadvantage. It takes a new focus on transparency. It takes a new investment in making sure that we have teachers in our schools who have the kinds of skills that we need to ensure that we see numeracy formation. The Rudd Labor government are engaged in a series of practical steps to make a difference for Australian students because we want to see a quality education for every Australian child. We want to see every Australian child able to read, able to write, able to count and able to do numbers. Unfortunately, the legacy of the former government's neglect is that we do not see these standards in Australian schools. We are getting on with the job of fixing it and getting the basics right. Economy",56
95,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Why has the quarterly rate of economic growth halved since the election of your government?,57
96,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, if you go to the budget forecasts, we indicated quite clearly that there would be a moderation of economic growth down to 2.75 per cent in the 2008-09 period, recovering to three per cent in the 2009-10 period. That is a fact. We acknowledge it and we said so at budget time. That is quite clear. The real debate here is what has caused it and what do you now do about it? Two sets of factors have caused it: one over which we have very little controlthe state of the global economy. I went through those factors at some length in my earlier answers today in question time. The other set of factors is the cumulative effect of 10 interest rate rises in a row. Those opposite throw their hands in the air as if 10 interest rate rises in a row did not happen or they had nothing whatsoever to do with it. The member for Higgins is smirking up there, second from the back. He says, ‘Nothing to do with me.' He would only claim responsibility for a good thing that happened and never claim responsibility for anything bad thing that may have happened. I say to the member for Higgins and those who have inherited his economic legacy on this question of interest rates: if you have bequeathed the people of Australia, working families, a $400 a month interest rate hike, that is not just a bit of loose change. That really affects your ability to balance the family budget. Costello's $400 a month interest rate hike, the Liberals' $400 a month interest rate hike, has a real effect not just on the cost of living but on the real economy over time. It actually slows the economy down. That is what has been happening. Interest rates went up year after year in the period that they were in office but without any clear strategy for creating the circumstances to enable the Reserve Bank to start heading in the other direction. That is why I say to the member for Higgins, following his very enjoyable evening last Friday, and the member for Wentworth, with whom he has such a convivial relationship, and the Leader of the Opposition, with whom they both have such a convivial relationship that the key thing is: do you have a strategy to deal with this challenge in the long term? In January this year we said, ‘Here is our five-point plan of attack on inflation. Here is our attitude to public demand in the economy. Here is our plan of attack on skills. Here is our plan of attack on the question of infrastructure.' Each step of the way those opposite have ridiculed each element of this strategy. Those opposite gave us 10 interest rate rises in a row and now say they had nothing to do with it. We, the government, having been in for eight to nine months, have said, ‘Here is a strategy for dealing with these challenges for the long term.' Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition and those who would support him, and even those on the benches opposite who do not support him: get with the government's program in the Senate and allow the passage of the government's financial bills so that not only will budget surplus remain intact but we will have the capacity to make the investments in this government's $76 billion national infrastructure plan, which is so much a part and parcel of dealing with the inflation challenge and dealing with Australia's long-term productivity growth.",57
97,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Will the minister advise the House on Australia's recent trade performance?,58
98,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I can advise that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June quarter current account figures today and they show a current account deficit of $12.8 billion for the June quarter, compared to a deficit in the March quarter of $19.8 billion. This has come about despite the slowing global economic growth. In these figures we have seen a 20 per cent increase in our export earnings; some $9 billion growth in that offset by only a three per cent increase in what we have paid for our imports. These figures still at 4½ per cent of GDP indicate a very sizeable current account deficit, but it is the lowest current account deficit since the September quarter of 2002. Encouragingly, our external accounts are starting to move in the right direction. This also the first quarterly trade surplus since March quarter of 2002. Whilst these signs are encouraging, we still have a long way to go; but I am confident that we are going in the right direction. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have reminded the House that this is a government that inherited very high inflation. We also inherited an appalling trade performance from the previous government. This was a government that squandered the opportunity to sustain our export performance into the the future. It was content to simply ride on the back of the resources boom. It was a government that recorded 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits. No previous government in Australia's history presided over such a woeful trade performance. This had the cumulative effect of contributing to a record current account deficit of almost $67 Trade billion for 2007, along with record foreign debt of close to $600 billion. This is the legacy that we inherited and that we are seeking to turn around. We started that task in the May budget with the commitments, which have been referred to constantly since then, to investment in Infrastructure Australia and investment in skills formation in this country. We also saw that budget increase the commitment to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. This week I will be receiving the Mortimer review, which will advise us on ensuring that our trade policy into the future becomes much more integrated as part of the broader economic policy. We have already commenced our commitment to the twin pillars approach of trade policy-trade liberalisation at the border and market reforms behind the border. I said last week in this House that I remain confident of the breakthrough in the Doha Round. Last week Australia negotiated and is concluded with New Zealand the most comthe prehensive free trade agreement ever entered into by the ASEAN countries. This is Australia's largest free trade agreement ever negotiated and, given the collective contribution of the ASEAN economies, they are Australia's largest trading partner. This is good news. It is good news for underpinning these figures that point us in the right direction. We will leave no stone unturned in turning around the woeful trade performance of the previous government. Employment",58
99,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the expected reduction in the number of working families over the next year as a result of a slowdown that we did not have to have?,59
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Consistent with the production of economic data and forecasts in the budget, you will see that again the forecast for unemployment is to rise to 4.75 per cent in 2008-09. Consistent with what I have said both about growth and about the CPI, and similarly with the unemployment data, the government has been transparent through the budget papers in the budget which the Treasurer brought down in May. I think what we see evident on the part of those opposite is a bit of a theme. We have had about six or seven questions now in question time-and what is the theme? The theme is talking the Australian economy down. What we have had from those opposite is a series of questions aimed at creating a negative sentiment and aimed at talking the economy down, and doing so pretty selectively against the available economic data. I said last Thursday, I think, in a question from the Leader of the Opposition in question time, ‘Why is it that those opposite in framing their questions do not bother to draw attention to, for example, the capital expenditure data which came out of the ABS last week?' That capex data projected capital expenditure investment by Australian corporations of some $100 billion for the year ahead. That seems to be missing from the narrative of those opposite. What is also missing from the opposition's narrative is the matters just referred to by the Minister for Trade. The Minister for Trade just went through what we have just had by way of the latest balance of payments and balance of trade statistics. A $559 million trade surplus in the June quarter 2008 was the first quarterly trade surplus in over six years.",59
101,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked about people, about working families losing their jobs. Could he please come back to that.",59
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,59
103,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Surprisingly missing from the economic narrative of those opposite, which is about talking the Australian economy down, is any reference to capital expenditure data from last week, any reference to today's balance of trade data or any reference to the fact that, in their period of office-if I recall the number correctly from the Minister for Trade-there were 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits. Mr Crean-No other government has done that!",59
104,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No other government in the history of the Commonwealth has knocked up 72 in a row. We all know the history of the trade balance and the trade cycle and we always know that for Australia this is a chalresponse to lenging set of circumstancesMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. Could we have an answer about working families and jobs rather than more waffle.",59
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,59
106,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For those opposite, I responded specifically to the question of unemployment data at the beginning of my answer. Coming in right on cue is the member for Menzies, the author of Work Choices, the workers' friend, he who presided over a set of industrial arrangements in this country which, based on their own survey data, meant that 89 per cent of AWAs surveyed by them resulted in one award condition less. Thirty-one per cent of those AWAs took away rest breaks, 49 per cent took away overtime loadings, 63 per cent took away incentive based payments and bonuses, 65 per cent removed penalty rates and 70 per cent took away shiftwork loadings. Despite the level of bleating from the member for Menzies, that is his contribution to working families. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on vance. Perhaps the Prime Minister can add the 300,000 jobs that were created.",59
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Menzies is warned.,60
108,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite clear that those opposite are not just ideologically committed to Work Choices but that, given half a chance, they would bring it back. Work Choices is etched deep into the heart and soul of those opposite, and they stand at the dispatch box and bleat about the concerns they now profess to have about the circumstances faced by working families. I say to those opposite-particularly to the everinterjecting member for Curtin-that, when a person is facing the prospect of losing their job, one thing they would like is to have some certainty about redundancy payments. Redundancy payments are one of those things stripped away by the now very bored, very yawning member for Menzies, who regards this as trivial. The problem with those opposite is that their economic narrative not only is designed to talk the economy down; it also fails to deal equally and in a balanced fashion with the positive economic news that is out there. That concerns capital expenditure data, the data which was produced today on corporate profits and the data on the trade account, which the Minister for Trade referred to. What I would say for the period ahead is that this will be a period of great economic test and challenge, not only for our country but for other countries going forward. There are going to be bumps along the road. When you have the set of global economic circumstances that we face at present, that is unavoidable. The challenge is this: do you have a strategy of action for the future on thisand we have a clear-cut course of action-or do you have, as we do from those opposite, a simple strategy with one objective, which is releto talk the economy down? In six questions from the opposition today there has not been a single reference to a policy, not a single reference to an alternative solution, not a single positive suggestion about anything. They have a simple strategy designed to talk the economy down and they hope that they get from themselves a cheap headline on the way through. Qantas",60
109,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister outline the very important results of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's systematic review of Qantas's engineering and maintenance control?",60
110,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government's first priority in aviation is safety. Australia has a safety system that is second to none, with internationally respected agencies in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. These three agencies have independent oversight of aviation safety in Australia. On 3 August, the CEO of CASA, Bruce Byron, ordered a systematic safety review of Qantas. CASA's review followed an incident on 25 July when a Qantas Boeing 747 flying from Hong Kong to Melbourne was forced to divert for a safe landing in Manila as a result of an explosion that tore a hole in the fuselage. This incident was followed by a number of incidents relating to maintenance of Qantas planes. To Qantas's credit, and consistent with its absolute commitment to safety, Qantas was open with CASA and fully cooperated with it during this review. This afternoon CASA announced the result of its review of Qantas's engineering and maintenance controls. CASA's review did not find any direct link between recent incidents, including that on 25 July, nor did CASA find any increase in the monthly rate of incidents. CASA found that recent incidents were unrelated and that there was no apparent common cause. CASA has recommended that Qantas review its management structure to better align responsibility and accountability for safety. CASA has recommended that Qantas take action on a range of safety and maintenance issues. I am advised that CASA will now move to carry out two additional intensive audits of Qantas. The first audit will focus on Qantas's 737, 747 and 767 fleet and involve a physical check of the planes as well as a check of maintenance documentation. The second audit will focus on Qantas's maintenance systems and internal procedures relating to airworthiness directives. This ongoing action sends a signal to the aviation industry and to the travelling public that CASA and Qantas are very serious about maintaining Australia's high safety standards. Australia can deed be proud that we have a rigorous, world's best practice safety regime and that Qantas is rightly regarded as an airline with a per cent. reputation for safety that is second to none. My No. 1 priority as the minister for transport will always be safety. The government will never be complacent about safety. Economy",60
111,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that the Reserve Bank may lower interest rates because the economy is slowing sharply? Is it not also the case that, while inflation continues to rise under your government, Australians are losing their jobs in parallel with a massive collapse in business and consumer confidence? Prime Minister, in plain language, why are Australians worse off since the election of the Rudd government?",61
112,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Working families, pensioners and carers are under real financial pressure, and therefore it is important to have a consistent and comprehensive strategy for dealing with the pressures that they are under. One of the pressures faced by working families is the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row. If you do the numbers on an average mortgage of something like $246,000 in total and the impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, you will see that the flow-through effect is that the Liberals, as a consequence of their high interest rate policy, have given those working families $400 per month in interest rate hikes. That is a simple fact. When those opposite ask why we have real pressures on the cost of living for working families, that is a big fact: $400 per month. The other impact on many working families is how to deal with pressures like the increase in childcare costs that they face. in- That is why the government, consistent with its pre-election commitment, increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50",61
113,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,61
114,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite said it is ridiculous. Ms Julie Bishop-No, you are ridiculous. Mr Hockey-You're ridiculous.",61
115,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney just interjected and said it is ridiculous that we have increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. They are the people who are out of touch with the basic needs of working families, including the need for us to make sure the childcare tax rebate keeps pace with the extraordinary costs which those families are bearing, with higher interest payments off the back of the rises I described before, higher childcare costs and other costs which families face. The government, in response to these challenges, has sought to do at least three or four sets of things, one of which is to deal with the extraordinary pressure on inflation and interest rates which has existed in the economy over a long period. The absolutely killing effects which those 10 interest rate rises have had on working families seeking to balance their family budgets have been huge. That is why we have taken this agenda as the absolute core priority of the government-so that we could create a set of policy circumstances to make room for the Reserve Bank to start moving in the other direction. That is point 1. Point 2",62
116,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,62
117,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members opposite laugh again at the impact of 10 interest rate rises a row. I would say that $400 a monthCostello's $400 a month interest rate hike for working families-is no laughing matter, other than for the Liberal Party. Through the budget we have also sought to honour our pre-election commitments on tax. The taxation reductions that we brought about through the budget, totalling some $44 billion, are designed to assist families under pressure. Added to that are the additional family support payments-I refer to the childcare tax rebate-and also the education tax refund, which parents are requested to begin collecting receipts for this year so that claim-back can occur from 1 July next year. These are significant initiatives, together with the $7.5 billion that we have allocated for additional payments for pensioners and carers. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about the setting of interest rates. The Reserve Bank independently does that, consistent with the economic policy settings of the government of the day through fiscal policy. That is why we have acted responsibly in that direction. I again return the Leader of the Opposition to his extraordinary statement on the doors today. How could he go out on the doors and-presumably trying to make a big headline for himself tomorrow-call for a 50 basis point adjustment and then, in answer to the first question, ‘If you were Prime Minister, would you make that call on the government?' say no? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister was asked a question about why Australians are worse off since the election of his government. He was not asked about anyone else's government, just his own.",62
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.,62
119,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, in terms of the in response to the real cost of living challenges which are being faced by working families, pensioners and carers, the government's strategy is clear. What is not clear is the strategy of those opposite. They had one foray into policy this week, and that was to go out on the doors, through the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, and say that the Reserve Bank should bring about a 50 basis point cut tomorrow. And then in the next breath, when asked whether that would be his position as Prime Minister of Australia if he were so elected, he of course said it would not be. What does that say? It says that the alternative government-as they describe themselves-have a view that the policies they put forward in opposition are far too reckless to be implemented in government. That is what they are saying. I would suggest to those opposite that if there is an alternative explanation for what the Leader of the Opposition meant on the doors this morning, everyone sitting here in this chamber is Frankly, if you go out and say, as the alternative Prime Minister, ‘I am calling for a 50 basis point cut,' and then ‘I am not calling for a 50 basis point cut,' the world would to know the reason. Russia",62
120,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the status of Australia's civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia?,63
121,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fowler for her question. There has been a safeguards agreement in place with Russia since 1990 for the limited use of Australian uranium, and that agreement continues in force. Last year, under the previous government, Australia entered into negotiations to complete a new bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation. That new agreement was signed in September 2007, during the APEC summit in Sydney, by the previous government. It was tabled in the parliament by this government in May of this year. The agreement is currently before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Indeed, the committee had one of its four public hearings on the agreement in Canberra this morning. The government believes that the agreement meets Australia's long standing safeguards requirements and promotes the highest international standards in this area, including involvement and oversight by the international regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The government will, of course, be interested in the views of the committee and will consider the committee's report and take that into account. But, once the committee has reported on the agreement, the government will then move to consider ratification of the agreement and the government will make a decision on ratificaall ears. tion at the appropriate time. I make clear to the House, as I have publicly stated today, and as government officials have stated privately to the Russian like Ambassador to Australia, that when considering ratification the government will take into account not just the merits of the agreement but recent and ongoing events in Georgia and the state of Australia's bilateral relationship with the Russian Federation. Members will recall that last week I detailed to the House the government's view so far as events in Georgia are concerned. I relayed those views to the Russian ambassador subsequent to that advice to the House. Without repeating them, all of those points remain current. And, as I have indicated today, at my instruction officials of the government have relayed to the Russian ambassador that, when the government come to consider ratification of the civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation, we will take into account not just the merits of the agreement but events which have occurred in Georgia, ongoing events in Georgia, and the state of Australia's bilateral relationship with the Russian Federation. Rural and Regional Australia",63
122,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. With urea prices hitting record highs over the weekend and the drought continuing to wreak havoc across Australia, does the Prime Minister agree with Australian of the Year Lee Kernaghan that he has abandoned the bush and farming families?",63
123,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of fertiliser prices, this is something that the government has been presented with by farming groups right across Australia. Fertiliser prices have gone through the roof, and it is a huge impost in terms of your ability to earn a quid out of the family farm. It is a challenge which both the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and I have been presented with in meeting after meeting. I would also say to the honourable member for Maranoa that these representations did not begin in December last year. If he were honest about it, he would know that the problem with the cost of fertiliser has been around for a long, long, long time. My understanding is-and I would look for guidance here from the minister for agriculture-that there is a committee involving Senator Heffernan and others who are looking at this matter and they will be very mindful of recommendations which come forward in terms of future action. Recently at the Pacific Islands Forum I actually raised these matters with the President of Nauru-Nauru, as you know, being a continued source of significant superphosphate in terms of international and regional fertiliser supplies-and what could be done on the supply side out of that small country vis-avis some of the problems that exist in global fertiliser markets. I will not for a minute tend that the prospects coming out of that meeting had any immediate solution to the problem but I have to say that this is a dialogue that we intend to now pursue withAn opposition member-That's the important thing for you, isn't it-you are talking about it?",64
124,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would say to the honourable gentleman interjecting that the problem of fertiliser prices did not begin on 24 November last year. For those opposite who are seeking to say that for 12 years they were out there at the forefront of rearrangements of the global fertiliser market to ensure a better deal for Australian farmers, I do not think that he is being fair dinkum about it. I do not think the honourable member for Maranoawho I have got a bit of a soft spot forbelieves in his heart of hearts that it is a fair dinkum question. He knows as well as I do that the fertiliser price has been a problem for a long, long time. This government will do what it can within its powers to assist farmers who are dealing with this challenge. It is a real problem in terms of on-farm costs. It is something that the minister has been engaged in dialogue with the NFF and others on. Let me assure the House that any practical measures that can be undertaken by government to draw these pressures off working farmers who are dealing not only with the ravages of",64
125,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,64
126,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true. Are those opposite assuming that farmers do not work? We assume they do work-and they work very hard. They are among the best and most effective farmers in the world, and when it comes to standing up for their interests and their rights, including making the economic policy settings of Australia more conducive to interest rates heading down than going up, prewe will stand up for the farmers of Australia any day. Mr Bruce Scott- Mr Speaker, I appreciate the Prime Minister's answer, but he failed to respond to my question in relation to Lee Kernaghan, the Australian of the Year.",64
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Maranoa knows that that is not a point of order. The member for Maranoa will desist from those sorts of things. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry",64
128,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister update the House on work done during the parliamentary recess to develop the agriculture, fisheries and forestry portfolio?",65
129,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for the question. I will refer to some of the work with respect to sustainability and the building of export markets, but I think I should first mention that I did have the chance during the break to catch up with the member for Maranoa in his own electorate. We gathered together because Lee Kernaghan was visiting. The member for Maranoa would remember very, very well what Lee Kernaghan had to say about the work of the government in the electorate of Maranoa. He will remember very well what the Australian of the Year had to say on those issues and the support that he gave for the review of drought policy that this government is undertaking. Make no mistake: the current position on drought policy that is being adopted by this government is identical to the drought policy that was adopted by the previous government. Not only that but the assessments are being done by a panel, the members of which are all appointees of the previous government who have had their terms extended. In the face of that, there is no doubt that, even though it has always had bipartisan support, it is true that we have not been able to get drought policy in a good enough state for the needs of rural Australia. There is no doubt about that. The Leader of the Nationals has said that in this very place. That is why the policy is being reviewed, that is why I made the comments that I made in the seat of Maranoa-the third time. I have managed to visit that seat since I got this job-and that is why the government supports Lee Kernaghan's concerns that drought policy needs to be reviewed. It is also true that during the break I had a chance to look at some of the sustainability issues with respect to our fisheries and forestry, including in Tasmania. I met with some of the key fishing operators out of the electorate of Bass and, in South Australia, from Arno Bay and Elliston, with some of the key aquaculture operators there, trying to find a path through to be able to continue to increase production without causing sustainability to have a hit. Also, with respect to forestry, in addition to Tasmania, where we were able to deal with the production side of the responsible end of that, I visited both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, where we do have real concerns about working with those governments in combating illegal logging. Over the break I was also able to deal with some of the export issues regarding the export of wheat, horticulture and, in particular, the live trade. I would like to take this opportunity, given that I have been to Riverwood Station, Kilto Station and Lamboo Stationan Indigenous-run cattle station in the north of Western Australia-and then had a look at some of the feedlots in Indonesia where that trade goes, to reaffirm the support of this government for the live trade and to reaffirm in this place, for the first time that I have had the opportunity to do so, that the live trade does occupy an important role in this nation. We expect world's best practice. The sector has been delivering that, and it continues to have the support of the government.  of order. I ask the minister for agriculture to table the diary of his travel arrangements so that we can all see the places he has been on his ‘Lonely Planet guide to agriculture'!",65
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,65
131,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Consistent with his commitment to transparency of government, will the Prime Minister immediately release the urgent advice his government received on 18 June in relation to immediate steps that can be taken to provide water to the people of the Coorong and Murray lower lakes, where there is an unfolding economic, environmental and social tragedy?",66
132,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unaware of the document to which the honourable gentleman refers. That is my honest answer. I think all members of this House would be united in their concern for the problems of the lower lakes. That is why I went there with Senator Wong, the Minister for Climate Change and Water, to have extensive discussions with those in the lower lakes about the particular challenges which they face. The government's response to that has been on multiple levels. The first is this: for the first time the Commonwealth's history the buyback of water entitlements will commence. Those opposite talked about it all the time but did not spend a brass razoo on it. We have actually gone ahead with it and so far we have expended $50 million to purchase back entitlements, from memory, of some 37 gigalitres from the system. This is a small start but a necessary start. Subsequent to that, at the cabinet meeting in Adelaide, the government agreed to the release of further significant funds for the purchase of entitlements across the Murray-Darling system. That is one part of the challenge. The other part of the challenge is what you do to improve the overall efficiency of the irrigation systems which currently draw water out of the Murray-Darling system. Apart from the fact that the water has been overallocated to hell over the last 100 years, these irrigation systems are often antiques in Water their own right. One of the figures we have been presented with suggests that there is something like a 30 per cent leakage from these irrigation systems as they pump water from the river system onto farm properties. That is obviously a practical area where we can work. That is why, again, in the first few meetings of the Council of Australian Governments, the government have allocated literally billions of dollars in programs to the states for the improvement of irrigation systems applying to farm properties across the system. The third thing we have done is this: through the Council of Australian Governments, we have created a single Murray-Darling Basin authority. This has been talked about, again, for many months and for many years by those opposite but was never brought to fruition. At the first meetings of the Council of Australian Governments, we were able to bring about agreement on the in establishment of this authority. Why is that important? For the first time in the history of the Murray-Darling Basin, we have therefore a single authority empowered to create a basin-wide plan for the proper use of the resource. In the past, that was Balkanised across the various states and territories of Australia and could no longer be sustained. These are practical steps forward. Mr Turnbull-Not taken by you.",66
133,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those opposite again interject in the most partisan of fashions.,66
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,66
135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I rest my case. I would have thought that the Murray-Darling should exist as a challenge beyond partisan politics. I would have thought the entire nation wanted to see politicians cease squabbling about the Murray-Darling,66

137,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and get on with a practical plan of action to do something about the Murray-Darling, to make sure that we can actually look the next generation of Australians squarely in the eye and say, ‘We did all that was physically possible to save this most threatened, challenged and pressured of river systems.'  ago?",67
138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt is warned!,67
139,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would suggest the Leader of the Opposition reflect very carefully on when the crisis in the Murray and the flowthrough of waters actually began. Is he again suggesting-consistent with the question from the member for Maranoa last time round, who now returns to the chamberthat this problem mysteriously erupted on 24 November last year? I would say to the honourable members opposite, including the Leader of the National Party, how much did the Leader of the National Party authorise in payments to buy back water entitlements from the system? A big, fat zero. We saw 12 years of systematic inaction on a river system under gross challenge, delivered off the back of climate change and record low inflows, year after year after year. Those opposite, led by the ‘Captain of the Cow Cockies', have the audacity to come into this parliament and say, ‘Why haven't you fixed this problem in nine months?' I think the people of Australia would ask those opposite to get real with this. We have a plan of action when it comes to the Murray-Darling. We have achieved more in our first nine months in office than those opposite achieved in 12 years. We will prosecute this program of action. It is a practical course of action and our first point of reference is what can be practically done to save the lower lakes. Grocery Prices",67
140,Mr GIBBONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. What action is the government taking to promote competition in Australia's grocery industry?,67
141,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We all know that vigorous competition means a better deal for consumers. People battling for our dollar as consumers means that all consumers will be better off. In relation to groceries, this was confirmed in the recent ACCC report, which found: Australian consumers would significantly benefit if Coles and Woolworths faced more competitive threats that encouraged more aggressive pricing strategies. At the last election, the Labor Party promised to clarify and enhance the powers of the ACCC to deal with incremental or creeping acquisitions-something the previous government declined to do. Today, I can update the House on the implementation of that important election commitment. Incremental acquisitions are purchases by a large firm of small outlets which might not lead to competition concerns in and of themselves but over time when taken together do lead to competition concerns. The Trade Practices Act, as it is currently devised, does not give the ACCC the proper legal framework to intervene in these instances. Today, I have released a discussion paper which outlines two options for legislation-action which those opposite failed to take over 12 years-which are the aggregation model or the model for a new power under the Trade Practices Act. This is an election commitment and this government will implement the legislation. Those opposite failed to do anything on this over 12 years. The new law will apply across the economy, not just in relation to groceries and supermarkets but across the economy, wherever the ACCC believes that creeping acquisitions are a problem. It may be the childcare industry or the supermarket industry or any other industry where creeping acquisitions are a problem. This reform is not about protecting small business in itself; it is about protecting consumers to ensure vigorous competition so that consumers can benefit from small business and big business competing against each other and so that one player does not swallow up small players in an anticompetitive way. This is part of our suite of competition policy reforms that we have embraced since the election: freeing up the foreign investment laws so that more retailers can compete for the Australian sumer's dollar; using COAG to ensure that the planning system promotes competition and does not inhibit competition; and introducing jail terms for serious cartel conduct, which the ACCC called for 15 times and the member for Higgins ignored every time and reneged on his commitment to implement. These are the biggest reforms to the Trade Practices Act in 25 years to do with predatory pricing, which I envisage will pass the House later today. These are reforms that we are moving on with alacrity because they are long overdue and because Australian consumers will be the winners from them. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, could you please ask the Prime Minister to attend a jargon management course. I think it might help the conduct of the House.",67

143,Mr SLIPPER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",68
144,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,68
145,Mr SLIPPER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,68
146,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,68
147,Mr SLIPPER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I proceed on the basis of misinformation from a Defence Force source published in articles by Glenn Milne in the Brisbane Sunday Mail, the Adelaide Sunday Mail, the Sydney Sunday Telegraph and possibly other Murdoch papers. Although Mr Milne gave me the courtesy of commenting, there are a number of misrepresentations. The misrepresentations relate to a bipartisan ADF parliamentary deployment during which time was spent on HMAS Stuart in the con- northern Persian Gulf. The first misrepresentation in all papers is that I insisted on using the ship's satellite phone system-almost a demand. There was no insistence; the truth is that I asked politely to use the phone and permission was immediately given. The second misrepresentation in the Sunday Telegraph and the Adelaide Sunday Mail is that my calls deprived sailors of precious satellite time to talk with loved ones. The fact is that I am advised that my calls and those of another member did not deprive sailors of any calls. The next inaccuracy is a claim in all papers that I divulged key information regarding the location and operations of the ship and that in doing so I put the lives of Australian sailors at risk. This is not the case and I distinctly recall saying, on a call, that I could not say where I was for security reasons. The fact is that everyone, including the Iranians and possible hostile forces, knew exactly where HMAS Stuart was as part of Australia's contribution to gulf security and protection of Iraqi oil platforms. We have been there for these purposes since the early 1990s. While I may have mentioned that I had visited an oil platform, and with the benefit of hindsight it probably would have been better if I had not, there is no way that as a result the lives of Australian sailors were placed at risk. The next misrepresentation is an implied suggestion that the sailors on HMAS Stuart were put at similar risk to that of British trol boat sailors taken into custody a year earlier. Given the differences in the sizes and respective locations of the two vessels, this comparison is ludicrous. The fifth misrepresentation in all papers is that the delegation was read the riot act by an intelligence officer on the ship. This is not the case. There was a routine briefing by the intelligence officer, as occurs with all delegations. Naturally, security was discussed but no riot act was read. The delegation also had other routine briefings with other officers. The last misrepresentation that I want to rebut is in relation to a claim that a planned boarding of a tanker had been abandoned as a result of my phone calls. I do not believe this to be true. We were permitted to observe the boarding of an Iraqi boat from an American patrol boat at very close quarters so that we could see the professionalism of Australian sailors. I understand that it was not sible for us to board the Iraqi boat for security reasons not associated with any calls I made. I applaud our Australian sailors and I thank the House for listening to this explanation. NA Reform of Employment Services in Australia",68
148,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The Rudd government believes that the key to addressing the barriers to obtaining employment experienced by many Australian job seekers is to provide them with the vocational skills and other means necessary to find and keep a job. We recognise that this is crucial, not only to the well-being of those Australians who are looking for work but to improve the economic and social circumstances of their families and of their communities. It is also critical to our future productivity growth and pa- the economic prosperity of the country. Given the ageing of our population we need to lift the total number of people participating in the workforce, and we need to invest in improving the skills of Australian workers. This is vital to employers and to the economy as a whole if we are to remain internationally competitive. The Job Network established by the previous government a decade ago has not and cannot meet these objectives. Over the last 10 years, skill shortages have worsened, dramatically hampering productivity and growth. Projections by the Centre for the Economics of Education and Training at Monash University suggest that unless something is done, in the area of VET-qualified workers, we could be looking at a shortfall of up to 240,000 workers by 2016. Over the last 10 years many thousands of job seekers have become increasingly depos- tached from the labour force. The Job Network has failed disadvantaged job seekers who have needed assistance to overcome barriers to employment and to gain the skills that employers need. This is starkly illustrated by the proportion of people on unemployment benefits for more than five years, which has increased from one in 10 in 1999 to almost one in four today-an increase from 74,000 people in 1999 to more than 105,000 people now. It is unforgivable that these job seekers and their families have been denied economic and social opportunities and the dignity that comes with having a decent job. This adds up to a powerful case for change. This month, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will release a $3.9 billion request for tender to deliver fundamentally reformed employment services from 1 July 2009. These new services are the result of extensive consultations with job seekers, employers, peak welfare and community organisations and employment service providers. Consultations that commenced in January this year have assisted us to understand why the existing system isn't delivering and what needs to be done to fix it. The current system was criticised during the consultations for being a one-size-fits-all, time based approach. Job seekers were described as part of a production line-each receiving the same assistance as everyone else, regardless of their individual needs. Under the new employment services, each job seeker will be placed by Centrelink into one of four streams, where they will receive a level of assistance commensurate with their level of disadvantage, and tailored to their individual needs. Importantly they will be able to receive assistance at a time better suited to their needs, not after some preordained fixed period. Job seekers presently have to negotiate a bureaucratic maze, ‘bouncing around' between Centrelink and multiple providers of different programs. Many employers have also told us they find the maze of programs confusing and don't understand how the Job Network system works. The new employment services system replaces seven separate programs with a more integrated service. Under the new arrangements employment services will be a onestop shop for job seekers and employers. This will also have benefits for those who deliver employment services. Providers have complained about time-consuming processes and weighty administrative burdens. The new employment services will achieve significant efficiencies by having a single contract, a simplified fee and outcome structure, and a single performance management framework instead of the multitude of arrangements under the current system. Further benefits will be obtained from reduced manual processing, and simplified acquittal processes for service fees and most purchases from the Employment Pathway Fund. Cutting red tape and reducing unnecessary administration is not an abstract goal. It will free up providers to spend more time focusing on the help that job seekers need. Job seekers with entrenched disadvantage fared worse under the current system. Take the case of a person suffering from depression and multiple health issues who is at risk of homelessness and has a history of unemployment. Under the current system, this person could be among the 27,000 disadvantaged job seekers waiting for up to two years to receive assistance through the Personal Support Program. When such a job seeker does get into the program, there is a real danger that they will be effectively ‘parked'. In fact their provider is paid whether or not the job seeker is assisted to find employment. This is not so much a reflection upon the performance of the providers; it is a criticism of the contractual shackles imposed by the previous government. Under the new employment services the same job seeker would begin to receive tailored assistance from the day they walk through their provider's door. Employment service providers will now be able to work with job seekers to develop an individually tailored employment pathway plan, supported by a flexible pool of funds. Compared to the underutilised job seeker account, providers will be able to use the Employment Pathway Fund to address barriers to employment for more job seekers with a wider range of training and other services able to be purchased. For example, in addition to training, a provider will be able to purchase non-vocational services, such as mental health support services, counselling and rehabilitation services. The employment pathway plan and the fund will enable providers to work creatively to identify the best combination of skills development, work experience, personal support and other assistance a particular job seeker needs to find sustainable employment. Sustainable employment is crucial. Many job seekers have been churning in and out of employment services and are not receiving the assistance necessary to leave unemployment behind for good. This is reflected in departmental research which shows that almost half the people on benefits in 2001 were still unemployed in 2007. For young women with little education the situation was even worse-three in four were on benefits in 2001 and still on benefits in 2007. This is a consequence of the previous government's narrow approach, an approach not supported by international evidence. The OECD, in its Employment Outlook 2007, suggested that an approach like this ‘involves risk that job seekers may have to accept jobs too quickly, resulting in lower wages or more rapid return to unemployment'. Earlier, in its 2005 Employment Outlook the OECD endorses intensive employment services, individual case management and mixed strategies. The Rudd government recognises the importance of both training and work experience in helping job seekers achieve sustainable employment. Job seekers accessing the new employment services will be able to participate in training when it is judged most helpful to them, and will have access to an extra 238,000 opportunities to receive training as part of the Productivity Places Program, with the government investing $880 million over five years. Training will also support self-employment opportunities, with the Productivity Places Program providing up to 18,900 business training places over three years to support small-business start-ups in areas of skills shortage, and by disadvantaged and Indigenous job seekers. And, unlike the previous system, where there was little incentive to place job seekers in training, providers will be rewarded for placing job seekers in employment after they have completed accredited training. They will also be rewarded for placing job seekers into apprenticeships in areas of skill shortages. Training through the Productivity Places Program will be driven by employer demand, with Skills Australia analysing emerging skills needs and demands across industry sectors, and identifying the training gaps required to be filled. The government is also addressing the issue raised by ACCI in its submission to the review of employment services that: Better linkages with employers and the needs of business and industry will assist employment service providers and job seekers to better tailor training. This new focus on what employers need will be a hallmark of the reformed employment services. To encourage employment service providers to better understand the needs of employers and to genuinely help them find the workers they need, providers will receive increased fees when they work with an employer and place a job seeker in a job with that employer. Further, as ACCI reflected in consultations: ... some Job Network providers do not have sufficient specialised industry knowledge to make a satisfactory placement so opportunities for real to be employment outcomes in industry are lost. In response, the government has committed $6 million over three years to fund employer brokers. These brokers will work across employment services and training providers to meet the needs of individual employers, or groups of employers within specific industries. Employer brokers will need to demonstrate an ability to provide real assistance to employers facing skill or labour shortages. Importantly, for employers, the new system is focused on developing a work culture. Work experience will support the greater acquisition of work readiness skills that employers need, but do not get from the present system. Training and work experience will be able to occur at the same time, and will be an integral part of the overall plan for a job seeker's future. Consistent with the greater flexibility in the new employment services, providers and job seekers will have a much wider range of work experience options to choose from, although it is expected that the largest number of job seekers will continue to undertake their work experience through Work for the Dole activities that are combined with skills acquisition and focused on the job seeker ultimately getting work beyond the dole. We are also creating a more work-like ‘No Show No Pay' compliance model to replace the ineffective regime designed and implemented by our predecessors. The current compliance regime is an unproductive failure. Since the current rules were introduced in July 2006, more than 350,000 people have failed to meet their requirements and more than 50,000 job seekers have had an eightweek non-payment penalty imposed. Rather than encouraging job seekers to find and maintain employment, the compliance system has resulted in many of the most vulnerable job seekers disengaging completely. This is counterproductive and results in enormous costs to the individuals concerned, their communities and the nation. The new employment services will be supported by a fairer and more effective compliance system designed to secure participation and engagement. Job seekers will lose a day's income support for every day they fail to attend a required activity without a reasonable excuse, just as they would in the workforce. The government recognises that while most job seekers do the right thing, those who do not must face consequences. This is why we are retaining the eight-week non-payment penalty for persistently and wilfully non-compliant job seekers. However, job seekers will be encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and, if they participate in an intensive activity, can have their income support reinstated. The previous government may have been content to sit back with a counterproductive compliance system, but this government will keep working in partnership with stakeholders to improve employment services and to help the most disadvantaged job seekers obtain and retain employment. To support this goal, providers will be encouraged to develop new and better practices through a $41 million Innovation Fund. This will allow the development of place based solutions to address barriers to employment for groups of highly disadvantaged job seekers. One of the particular objectives of the innovation projects will be to assist highly disadvantaged Indigenous job seekers as part of the government's commitment to halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous employment outcomes by 2020. Employment services will also improve access to the small business program, NEIS, for Indigenous job seekers and provide increased funding for those Indigenous job seekers living in remote areas. Equally importantly, the government is considering how to reform the CDEP and Indigenous Employment Program as part of a broader Indigenous economic development strategy. These reforms will complement the bold commitment to the Australian Employment Covenant that will ask corporate Australia to guarantee 50,000 jobs for training-ready Indigenous Australians. I am also reforming Disability Employment Services with a review of the Disability Employment Network and Vocational Rehabilitation Services. This will be informed in part by the National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy which I am presently working on with Parliamentary Secretary Shorten. This strategy will ensure a coordinated, national approach to deal with the barriers that people with disability and/or mental illness face in finding and keeping work. The new employment service will provide a tailored, individualised response to each job seeker. It will focus on the most disadvantaged job seekers neglected by the previous government. It will emphasise training and work experience. It will deliver the work-ready job seekers employers need. For too long job seekers, employers and providers have had to endure a complex and rigid employment service structure. The Rudd government is determined that this will not continue. The government recognises that work, along with family and community, gives meaning to life. It creates opportunities for financial independence and personal fulfilment and benefits for local communities, regions and the broader economy. Families and communities are more prosperous and cohesive when those who can work are working. I look forward to working with employers, job seekers and employment providers in the lead-up to the implementation of the new employment services, employment services that will support job seekers to gain and sustain employment and employers to fill vacancies with the skilled workers they need. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Boothby to speak. Leave granted.",69
149,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Dr Southcott speaking for a period not exceeding sixteen utes. Question agreed to.,73
150,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this ministerial statement on the reform of employment services. I want to start by looking back, and then I wish to look forward. Looking back at last year, what were some of the important measurements of employment and unemployment? The unemployment rate fell to 4.2 per cent. That was at that time the lowest level of unemployment since November 1974. It was its lowest level in a generation; it was the lowest unemployment rate in over 33 years. We had a participation rate over 65 per cent. That was then the highest ever participation rate. There were more people working in Australia than ever before. Since 2002, employment growth has been 2½ per cent, which has created about 250,000 jobs a year. Last month, the latest Statement on monetary policy from the Reserve Bank predicted that average employment growth over the next 12 months will slow to less than one-third of what it was over the last five or six years-that is, to three-quarters of a per cent. This has led analysts to conclude that 100,000 Australians are likely to lose their jobs over the next 12 months. The budget, which came down in May, had already forecast that Australia would lose 134,000 jobs over the next 12 months. The Job Network was a fundamental reform of employment services undertaken by the Howard government. Unemployment was 8.1 per cent when the Howard government replaced the inefficient Commonwealth Employment Service with a privatised Job Network on 1 July 1998. We saw unemployment fall from 8.1 per cent to four per cent under the Job Network. There was an oraside in the budget estimates about the name of the new Job Network; the departmental min- people did say that there will be a name change. I was disappointed not to find out what the new Job Network will be called, but we do have one suggestion from the Labor side. Victorian Labor Senator Gavin Marshall has suggested ‘Commonwealth Employment Service' may be a name you want to consider, minister. That is a suggestion from your own side. The Job Network saw the introduction of a work based welfare system focused on a work-first approach. A privatised employment services model which assessed and rewarded performance based on the achievement of outcomes allowed for a competitive market and offered greater choice for job seekers. Australia really pioneered this area of employment services. There is enormous interest around the world in how Australia has delivered a very cost-effective employment services system. Mutual obligation, known best in the community through signature programs such as Work for the Dole, has been very important in allowing people to give something back, in building a work culture, in learning workplace skills and in building a sense of self-esteem. The track record of the Job Network speaks for itself. The most recent net impact study in 2006 indicates that the suite of vices offered by the Job Network is comparable or exceeds the level of high-performing programs internationally. In particular, Job Search Training delivered a net employment impact of 11.2 per cent; one-on-one Customised Assistance delivered a net employment impact of 10.1 per cent; Work for the Dole achieved a net employment impact of 7.3 per cent; and Mutual Obligation achieved a net employment impact of 8.2 per cent. All four of those programs achieved a high level of net employment impacts. It remains to be seen whether the replacement employment services model will be able to sustain these employment outcomes and employment impacts. When we examine the 2008 budget and the new employment services model, we see that there will be 134,000 fewer people in the labour force over the next 12 months. Based on the Reserve Bank's forecast, 100,000 Australians are likely to lose their jobs over the next 12 months. At the same time that we have information that there will be a lot more job seekers requiring employment services, the government are providing $279 million less for employment services over the three years of this contract. This is the equation: there will be more job seekers and less money to help them find a job. The new employment services model was designed in an entirely different economic environment to the one we face only six months later. It was designed at a time when labour growth was strong, when unemployment was at its lowest in 33 years and when the economic outlook was still positive. As we know from the Reserve Bank's latest Statement on monetary policy, the outlook now is far less rosy. With predictions that upwards of 100,000 Australians are set to lose their jobs within the next 12 months, the sernew employment services model falls well short of offering these workers early intervention and appropriate support. This is one of the key departures from the Job Network: there is a much lesser emphasis on early intervention under Labor's proposed employment services model. Under the new model, job seekers will be streamed into one of four streams. Those with recent work experience are most likely to be streamed into stream 1. The exposure draft released by the government indicates that 53 per cent of new job seekers will be referred for stream 1 services. What does that mean? The services offered to job seekers in stream 1 will be little more than assistance in writing a resume and provision of a brief overview of local labour market conditions. There is no incentive for employment service providers to get those job seekers back into work quickly. What we see is that only 12.8 per cent of the funding available will be spent on that 53 per cent of job seekers, which is more than half the total number of job seekers; and only 27.4 per cent of funding for employment services is allocated for people in stream 1 and stream 2 taken together-people who are judged less needywhich is 77 per cent of job seekers. So the second simple equation is that three-quarters of job seekers will be receiving one-quarter of the funding for employment services. Early intervention is very important in getting people back into a job as quickly as possible. Given that we are now facing a climate of job insecurity, a big risk is being taken by decreasing early intervention with employment services. At a time when 100,000 workers are set to lose their jobs, new employment services model shows a remarkable lack of foresight and inflexibility. When we look at compliance-this has been a very important part of what we did through Work for the Dole-under the new model, we see that mutual obligation has been substantially watered down. Under Labor's proposed new model, job seekers will not have to undertake Work for the Dole until they have had a minimum of 12 to 18 months assistance from an employment services provider. At present, job seekers undertake Work for the Dole or another mutual obligation activity after six months, as Work for the Dole gives job seekers a work-life like experience and it can give them the skills that they need to engage or re-engage in the labour market. The compliance regime has been further weakened by the Rudd Labor government, with the Minister for Employment Participation and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations writing to employment service providers requesting an end to the participation reporting of noncompliant job seekers. Employment service providers have been written to and have been asked not to breach people who do not attend interviews, who do not attend meetings with their employment service providers, who do not attend work experience placements and who do not attend Work for the Dole. These measures were only introduced by the Howard government to respond to a growing concern with deliberate work avoidance. Under the new regime, we may well see the revival of the dole bludger. When we look at the integration in the employment services model, we support, in principle, the integration of the seven programs into the one contract. Ultimately, had we been re-elected last year, this is something that we would have considered, althe though the opposition believes that an argument can be made in favour of keeping the Personal Support Program and the Job Placement Employment and Training Program, JPET, separate, because they are different in nature from the other five programs; these are more in the nature of preemployment programs that are targeted at people who are victims of domestic violence, who are homeless, who have mental health issues-those who have a number of barriers to employment and who need a lot of help to get them into the position of being ready to go into an employment program. Still on the topic of the Personal Support Program, it needs to be said that, whilst the minister in his statement did point out that 27,000 job seekers remain on the waiting list for this program, the government did nothing in the last budget to alleviate this. Under the former coalition government, the 2007 budget provided funding for an additional 2,000 places. It was open to the government to do this in the 2008 budget, but they did not. The Productivity Places Program is Labor's new training program to provide training for people outside the workforce. It also provides upskilling for existing workers but, as we are considering employment services, I will leave ‘upskilling' for another day. The Productivity Places Program has been troubled since its inception. From the outset, it was plagued with delays and an inability by the federal government to get the states and territories to sign up to it. We have had reports that some of the best training providers have not tendered for this program. We have also had reports from employers who are still sceptical of the value of the Productivity Places Program. So I think the jury is still out on the Productivity Places Program. I think there are some teething problems that the government needs to address with a remedial program. It would be a very cynical exercise if this program were about providing only increased qualifications without enhancing people's ability to get a job from it. The opposition support the concept of employer brokers; we think it is a good idea. We believe that greater involvement of employers in the area of employment services is positive and should be welcomed. Having said that, I would say also that employer brokers, as conceived in this model, represents $6 million of a $3.7 billion employment services contract. It is just a little bit that has been tacked on to the top. It is not integral to the model. It is a good idea, is really a very small part of and not central to the whole model. In summary, this employment services model has some good parts, which the opposition supports. We think the integration and rationalisation of several programs is a good idea, as is the idea of employer brokers and the innovation fund; we had a similar fund under Job Network. However, our concern is that, when 100,000 workers are likely to lose their jobs over the next 12 months, we believe that the government is moving to a model which will have poorer employment outcomes. The opposition would like to see the modelling of the projected employment outcomes to be satisfied that this replacement is as good as the Job Network was in finding job seekers a job. One demonstration of this is that three-quarters of job seekers will now be receiving only a quarter of the assistance that they received previously in finding a job. Also, we believe that the Productivity Places Program was poorly conceived. It has been poorly implemented; it will not work as it has been presently conceived; and it needs some remedial work done to it very quickly. In conclusion, the government is planning to spend less money on employment services-$279 million less-over the three year employment services contract at a time when unemployment is projected to rise. The opposition does not think that is a good idea. Surely more will be spent on employment services as we see the number of jobless and job seekers rise. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",73
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the but it honourable member for Dickson has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,76
152,Mr RIPOLL,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. This bill is a very important and major piece of legislation. It will go a long way to creating a truly competitive economy and business sector. The reforms contained in the bill are long overdue. It has taken the election of a Rudd government and its strength and foresight to see these changes implemented. This attitude is contrary to that of the opposition, which always espouses that it is somehow the true friend of small business. But, historically, always seems that Labor governments make the great reforms and do the work necessary to ensure that small businesses can thrive in this country. Once again, we are in that position. And, once again, that is why we are moving these legislative changes. As members in the House have come to realise, it has only been Labor governments that have driven competition policy and that have sought to continuously reform, improve and clarify key components in the act so as to foster better promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. These concepts work hand in hand and are important for the future of our economy, for the prosperity of small businesses and for the fair treatment of all consumers. This bill sends a clear message to the business community that the government is committed to providing them with a competitive and fair environment. It also provides business with an environment that works in the good economic times as well as in the more challenging and difficult economic times. Let me put this commitment into some context. The Australian Labor Party was responsible for the introduction of the Trade Practices Act in 1974-let us not forget that. It was Labor that made substantial improvements to the act in 1986, as well as instigating National Competition Policy in the early 1990s. These have all been very important steps toward providing the right economic environment to ensure that small businesses, the backbone of this country, have had the right equipment and tools to carry on with their business. Let us remember that, when it comes to any kind of major competition reform in this sector, the Labor Party has been the driving force. Today's bill looks to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 and to clarify a number of terms-in particular, the term ‘take advantage'. The bill also seeks to address problems it of predatory pricing which relate to the prohibition of misuse of market power in section 46 of the act. The bill will also extend the jurisdiction for section 46 cases to the Federal Magistrates Court. Where the previous government has failed over the past decade to act on important parts of the Trade Practices Act and for the business environment, we are now acting. The proposed amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act are predominantly aimed at promoting competition in the industry and at cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour by powerful businesses. It is the Rudd's government intention to continue to stand up for small business and defend them from predatory pricing. What is predatory pricing? Basically, it is when a company sets its prices at a sufficiently low level with the purpose of damaging or forcing a competitor to withdraw from the market. This in turn leaves the company with less competition. It can then disregard market forces, raise prices, exploit consumers and, over time, drive those other businesses out of business. Price cutting or underselling competitors is another form of advantage taken by predatory practices. However, price cutting is not always necessarily predatory pricing. Larger businesses that are able to legitimately use their size to reduce their costs and the prices at which they sell their products to consumers are acting in a pro-competitive way. So we should be careful to make a distinction. There are genuine businesses, large and small, that are fair, open and competitive in the market. They compete properly and try to drive down costs and provide better services to consumers. Then there are predatory businesses which act only to get rid of their competition and in a manner that ensures that, over a period of time, they will be either the only competitors or amongst a small group of competitors that can control prices and, in the end, exploit the market. Businesses that exploit market power to eliminate or damage competitors are anticompetitive and that is a misuse of the market power that they enjoy. These are not the only major changes that the government is proposing in this bill. There is also a significant need to give small businesses a permanent voice within the ACCC and to simplify the process of prosecuting businesses which engage in anticompetitive behaviour. They are important factors which ensure that our regulatory watchdog, our competition watchdog-the ACCC-actually has the right advice, the right people and the right environment itself to ensure that these practices do not go on. This will ensure they have a representative voice on their own team. It is high time that small business had a seat at the table. They have been waiting for a long time. We are going to give them that seat at the table and we are going to give them the voice they deserve. With these reforms, and a requirement for at least one of the ACCC deputy chairpeople to have small business expertise, small business will now have a permanent voice within the ACCC. Giving small business a permanent voice within the ACCC will improve the understanding of the special circumstances and difficulties confronted by small businesses every day when dealing with anticompetitive behaviour by more powerful businesses than their own. So far we have debated the merits of the proposed amendments and identified the necessity for a number of things. If anything, the debate has been going on for too long. There is no better time to act than the present, which is what we are doing. We want to ensure that victims of predatory pricing will not need to prove that the predator has the ability to recoup losses after participating in an anticompetitive, below-cost pricing strategy. This is an important factor in trying to address the after effects of what happens when large businesses take on uncompetitive predatory pricing strategies. We want to clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' in section 46. That will address specific concerns raised by business and the ACCC. At present, the meaning of that term has prevented section 46 from capturing anticompetitive behaviour. It is important to define, clarify and give more weight to the definition of ‘take advantage' so that it is not just included in the act but serves a useful purpose which can be properly used to not only prevent and deter anticompetitive behaviour but give the ACCC the power to act within the terms of the law, if need be. I would also like to indulge the House for a brief moment and talk about the previous government's approach to competition policy and the mess they ultimately created. I am sure that people here recall what happened with the two-track process for predatory pricing. It was a process developed under the previous government and it caused considerable confusion amongst businesses because they focused on fundamentally different concepts of market share and market power. It is time we removed the unnecessary uncertainty that has arisen following the two-track process for predatory pricing. I recall at the time that the ACCC voiced particular concern about this scenario. That is why we need to act to provide clarity and certainty for the business community. It is the least we can do in providing the right regulatory environment to ensure that they can get on with their business of acting in good faith. While speaking about the ACCC, it is important that we also give our consumer watchdog the powers it needs to assist those who will require its continued support. These reforms will provide the ACCC with new information-gathering powers, which will enable it to fully investigate suspected breaches of the law-something that I know has been a complaint of many small businesses in the past when they have tried to take action through this particular process. The government will also extend the reach of the ACCC by removing the arbitrary monetary threshold currently applicable to allegaenvironment tions of unconscionable conduct, enhancing the protection of small business from transactions involving such things as undue influence. Again, that is a very important part it will remove an obstacle to ensure that the letter of the law not only can be met but can be followed through. The process is not only about having it codified or written in law but also about following through with the action needed so that those who participate in the system actually understand that the law has weight and that action can be taken. These amendments will deal with predatory pricing while allowing businesses to engage in genuine competition and discounting, to the benefit of consumers. It is an imlies portant step forward and one which is long overdue, and one that I know that all businesses around the country should be more than satisfied with. Small business certainly will be satisfied because it will offer them more protection and more genuine competition in the market, but also it will give certainty to the way any large business operates with its own competitors-large business against large business. So this is a win legislative amendment for all those in business. I have mentioned that these reforms are long overdue-and they are. That is not because the previous government did not know about the underlying problems within the act; it is because they decided that it just was not important enough, not high enough on the agenda, and that it was not a priority in the 12 years they were in government. During question time today, we heard opposition members asking questions such as, ‘What have you done in the past nine months?' and I just kept thinking, ‘What did you do over the past 12 years on some really fundamental, important key factors to ensure that small business had a fair, competitive and could get on with its job?' I recall small business screaming out for assistance and for clarification-for the ACCC powers to be enhanced to ensure that they and could have some assistance and support when they needed it. But those calls fell on also deaf ears. The former government, the now opposition, completely ignored all those calls for significant reform. I suspect that was because, while they mouthed the words that they are the friends of small business, in the end they are not; they are the friends of the big end of town. I will have more to say about that in a moment. I also believe that the previous government lost touch with the broader constituency-the mum and dad investors, the famithat invest not only their time and energy but also their hearts and souls into running a small business, a family business, and into making a major investment. All they are seeking is a fair go, a competitive environment, a chance to operate, a chance to create jobs and a chance to return something to some their own family. It is the Rudd government's fundamental belief that competition policy is at the core of a good economic winagenda. This government believes that being pro-business and pro-competition delivers the best results for consumers. Those opposite simply do not have the same concerns for consumers or for small business. At every opportunity they side with the big end of town. In opposition we decided that we would strengthen the Trade Practices Act to restore its original 1986 intention. I think that is portant to note. Those opposite, when they were in government, ignored those key reforms and amendments on a number of occasions quite deliberately. Members might recall sitting here in 2004 for the review of the Senate Economics References Committee. That committee conducted a review entitled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business, which detailed a number of concerns about the effectiveness of section 46 at that time. So, when I say they ignored it, it was not just a case of them ignoring it because they did not have the information at hand or because they were not informed. In fact, there were committee reports and recommendations that specifically directed the then government to these particular issues that needed to be addressed. One of those issues, which remains today-although not for much longer-was whether the Trade Practices Act gave sufficient guidance as to what constitutes ‘substantial power in a market'. The report also focused on whether the Trade Practices Act provided sufficient guidance as to what constitutes ‘taking advantage of market power'. It also referred to whether the Trade Practices Act provided sufficient protection against predatory pricing or whether the financial power test should be introduced. It went further to say that there should be an examination to proscribe the misuse of market power in a second market. It examined whether the Trade Practices Act provided sufficient protection against the use of coordinated market power and also whether an effects test should be included as an addition to or substitute for the current purpose test. These were all very good outcomes of a good committee and a good committee report, but they were ignored by the Howard-Costello government. I am sure people have picked up that there seems to be a recurring theme-whether in imthis debate on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill, in debates on other bills and in questions during question time today or as a theme that has evolved over the past nine months. Let me give people a small indication of how that theme might read, and maybe they will tune into what I am getting at. When we talk in this place about schemes like a Fuelwatch scheme to give consumers some choice and some information-very much like the Fuelwatch scheme which the big end of town, the big oil companies, run very privately for themselves-and when we try to extend that sort of scheme to the ordinary consumer, to give them some choice and some market power of their own, we see the opposition backing big oil. That is the recurring theme. When we try to talk about GroceryWatch, about grocery pricing, about competition in shopping and groceries and about national pricing schemes, the opposition ridicule us. When we try to look after the consumer, when we try to give them some market power back in terms of the prices they pay for their shopping goods, again we see the opposition siding with the big end of town. When we talk about industrial relations law in this place and we look at trying to redress some issues of balance, we see the opposition siding with the big end of town again. The theme continues and continues. When we talk about interest rates and banks, about passing on interest rate savings, putting downward pressure on inflation, and about putting as much pressure as we can in this place on the banks to pass on interest rate cuts, what do we see the opposition do? They actually back the big banks in keeping interest rates high. When it comes to the Medicare surcharge levy, a levy which has not changed in almost a decade, when we see about moving that levy upwards to save consumers money, what do we see the opposition doing? We see them backing the private insurance companies, backing the big end of town to make sure they reap more rewards. When we see a rebate exemption scheme for condensate off the Western Australian shelf-an exemption on a tax that has been in place for about 25 years-and when we are in a position where we can remove that fairly and pass on those savings to consumers, again we see the opposition backing the big oil end of town and saying that the exemption should remain in place and that the taxpayer should forfeit the hundreds of millions of dollars that would be coming their way. It is a recurring theme and one that people can spend some time thinking about in terms of the changes we are making to support small business and to make sure there is proper competitive behaviour and that we are doing the job that has not been done for the past 12 years. While we support the changes that we have indicated in this amendment bill, there is more to be done and more that we will continue to do. Labor has a strong legacy of competition reforms, having been responsible for the introduction of the Trade Practices Act in 1974. We will continue to do that-to look after and enhance the welfare of all Australians through the promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. Interestingly, it is not just us saying it; also the peak bodies. They are saying that they are overwhelmingly in favour of our reforms and our moves. They are saying that it is long overdue and they are saying ‘thank God' that we are doing it. They support Labor's stance. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive, Peter Anderson, has stated that it will be easier for small business and the ACCC to take action where there is predatory pricing. The Motor Trades Association of Australia also welcomes the moves, as does the Australian Retailers Association and a number of other distinguished bodies, including the Council of Small Business of Australia, who give similar support to the amendments proposed in this bill. The ACCC also think that these moves will be profound and will give them more ability to protect small business and ensure there is more competition. This bill strengthens section 46 and section 51A(6), and I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",76
153,Mr KATTER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I have looked at the wording of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, which was-let us not beat around the bush-the subject of a fight to secure some action from the previous government on the issue of Woolworths and Coles. This place amazes me. If we added up the number of studies we have done on the water resources of Northern Australia we would find that about $300 million has gone up in smoke. There were two $40 million studies that I know of, and absolutely nothing has happened. We just finished another inquiry, with the ACCC coming out and making the motherhood statement that it would be nice if we could get more competition. It was good of it to say that; I believe in motherhood too. As I said in the debate on the MPI, the head of the ACCC, in a most extraordinary statement, said there has been no increase in it is the difference between what the farmer gets paid and what Woolworths and Coles charge. He said that in the report and in the national media. This is the only country in the world that has allowed more than 30 per cent of its food retailing business to go into the hands of two companies. Those who have read Fair market or market failure?, the 1999 report of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector, which included members of all parties, including the Australian Democrats, know that the report mentioned six other countries and there was not one that came near Australia. The next closest was Britain. In the other four or five countries mentioned there was something like 45 per cent market share. We had 68 per cent held by just two corporations. The report effectively gave us another round of motherhood statements and another round of ineffectual proposals. I went to that committee and I had numerous discussions with the Queensland National Party senator and Senator Chris Schacht. Everyone on that committee knew that there were only three things that you could do. The first was capping and divestment, which was effectively what Theodore Roosevelt did to Rockefeller, and he became so famous that his face went up on Mount Rushmore. Capping and divestment was what NARGA, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia, requested. The second was to make really tight laws inside the ACCC's portfolio of enabling legislation. I was there when Senator Schacht put the three proposals up. The committee knew that there were three proposals and proceeded to make a recommendation that it do absolutely nothing. We have a farmer committing suicide every four days because they are being paid nothing. I went to a meeting of one of the leading farmers' representative groups in the north. There were 15 farmers at the meeting. They had asked along the acting local mayor because they all wanted subdivisions; in other words, they all wanted to get out of farming-yet this was one of the most active groups in Australia. I have been to Swan Hill and Shepparton. I know they are all getting out. Farming in this country is simply closing down. I met with the prominent economist Mark MCGovern and a senior journalist here at will Parliament House, and Mr MCGovern said: ‘I know the best argument to use with the Prime Minister. He is worried about ethanol, for example, because it may result in food shortages in the world. Food shortages are imminent throughout the world, and the countries that will be worse off when food shortages come will be those that cannot feed themselves now. Australia, of course, will be in that category.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I keep saying this here and no-one seems to be interested. They do not really care whether or not Australia can feed itself. The last time. I did the sums, I worked out that within nine years this country will be a net importer of food. This government was elected on the basis of collective bargaining. The only thing this government has done since it was elected is to remove from the wheat farmers the right to collectively bargain. If the Labor Party is a party of principle, I am rather curious to know what the principle is. It can hardly be collective bargaining. The unions are now finding out that maybe this government does not believe in collective bargaining. Certainly its attitude towards the farmers would indicate that. The only thing we can say about the other mob is that they make no secret of the fact that they are totally opposed to collective bargaining. And obviously they do not read many history books, because they always accuse me of wanting to go back to the 1960s. I say, ‘It's a hell of a lot better than going back to the 1860s.' Laissez-faire capitalism is a phenomenon from a century ago. For those who do not read history books, little six-year-old children with dog collars went down into the coal mines on all fours. That was a result of that sort of approach. England was the most successful slavetrading nation on earth, and that was a result of those sorts of laws. Half of the Matabele tribe was slaughtered in Africa to make Cecil Rhodes rich, and that was a result of those laws. If you believe in free markets, what happened in India? What happened in Africa? A hundred thousand people died in the Boer War-28,000 women and childrenunder the free market policies. If you say you want free markets, then have a look at what happened in the world when we had that situation previously. As I have said on many occasions to trade union groups throughout Australia when I have addressed their meetings from time to time: what will happen to you is what happened to the farmers. I will not go into all of the deregulations; I will simply say what happened in dairy. What happened was that we all went, under collective bargaining, to a tribunal. Some objective people-judges and those sorts of people-decided what was a fair thing for farmers to be paid, what was a fair thing for the retailers to be paid and what was a fair thing for the consumers to pay. We went into collective bargaining and it was decided what was a fair deal. It was decided that consumers should pay around $1.15 a litre, I think it was, for milk. The farmers got of figure? around 58c a litre for milk, and the rest of the consumer dollar was taken by the people in between. That was a fair thing. Within four weeks of deregulation, my farmers got a letter in the mail that said, ‘As a result of deregulation, you will no longer get 58c. Now you will get 39c.' That is not a free market. That is the operation of an oligopolistic marketplace. That bears no relationship. Does no-one here have any economics training? If you have a market where, the minute you deregulate, the price goes down 30 per cent, then clearly you do not understand what you are talking about if you say that we have now achieved a free market for milk. Clearly we have not. Clearly there is a total elasticity of demand if is that you suddenly move from 58c a litre down to 39c a litre. For the consumers, it went from about $1.15 up to about $1.80 over the next two or three years. Didn't Woolworths and Coles have Christmastime! If you multiply that by the litreage in Australia, that is a thousand million dollars of extra profit that went into the pockets of those people-as a result of actions taken by this place. I came in here last week and I brought five of the most common grocery items that I could find. If you were to ask anyone to name the most common items, they would probably include beef-and we could not get pricing on beef; that is very complicatedbut apart from beef they would say ‘sugar, milk and potatoes'. These are just ordinary, average items. On each item there was a 320 per cent mark-up! Heavens, when it was a fair thing in dairying it was less than 100 per cent. It was about 60 or 70 per cent mark-up; it was most certainly less than 100 per cent. Now there is a 300 per cent mark-up. Does anyone think it is fair that little Mrs Housewife out there, who is desperately trying to make ends meet, should be paying this sort Let me come back to the bill. I do not want to disparage the good senator. God bless him for getting something through: his Birdsville amendment. God bless him for trying. But at the end of the day it is a fairly pathetic sort of effort if that is the best that the last government could do. It was passed 12 months ago and in that period of time Woolworths, in their report this year, claim that they have increased their market share by 10 per cent. So much for the effectiveness of the Birdsville amendment. But God bless the senator from Queensland for at least trying. That is what we have until we get serious in this place, pass some serious legislation and there is an effort to try and get a fair the situation share in the marketplace. There is no question about the 80 per cent that Woolworths and Coles hold. There is no question about that. ACNeilsen did a series of surveys, and in 1991 they found that Coles and Woolworths had 50.5 per cent of the market. When the inquiry was undertaken, an interparty inquiry, in 1998, the inquiry unanimously agreed that, whether you looked at the ACNeilsen survey or whether you looked at the ABS survey or whether you looked at the survey the committee did themselves, you came up with between 64 and 68 per cent of the market. So it had grown from 50.5 to 68 per cent in the space of seven years. Without going into all the CPIs and allowing for GDP growth and all of those things, that works out to about 2½ per cent growth a year. A very interesting story in itself is why ACNielsen series was discontinued. I rang up certain people who published it and they said that it had been discontinued because ACNielsen refused to do it anymore. I said, ‘Why?' and was told, ‘We wanted it done, but there are obviously forces at work which have said that they won't continue the series.' But you know that it is two per cent a year. If Woolworths are out there claiming that they have had 10 per cent market growth, it is not as if they are denying that they have that share of the marketplacethough when they are under attack they will of course deny it. But wouldn't someone in the ACCC or someone in the government say, ‘Hey, listen. In 2002 you told us that the growth in your market share was 11 per cent, Mr Woolworths, and you tell us this year that it is 10 per cent market growth.' I have not checked the years in between, but I will bet London to a brick that they will make similar claims for the years in between. So they are telling one thing to their shareholders and they are telling another thing to people in this place. It will be rather interesting to see when this place actually decides to stop them. They have taken over all the service stations and they have taken over all the liquor outlets. In fact, you cannot get a job in this country unless you work for them-and unless you work for peanuts as well. God help those people game enough to get out there in the marketplace and have a go. In my home town they closed both the florist shops. I think they closed five butcher shops in Charters Towers. And then we have the corner store. The state government in Queenslandthose wonderful friends of the poor-the ALP government in Queensland, have announced that they are considering open trading hours. So all the corner stores will close. So much for the poor people who do not the have cars and cannot drive to the shopping centre. Too bad for them! Too bad for the little single mother with three or four kids whose husband has walked out on her. Too bad for her. She cannot afford a car. She will just have to walk or get a taxi to go to the shopping centre. But this place here does not seem to worry about any of those people. This place does not worry about the farmers, with a suicide being committed every four days. It does not worry about poor little Mrs Housewife with food costs skyrocketing through the roof. It does not worry about them. It does not worry about the pensioners who no longer have their corner store. Every single move this place has made has been in the interests of Woolworths and Coles. That was true of the last mob and it appears that it is true of this mob. This legislation purports to make it easier for government to restrain Woolworths and Coles. That is not my opinion. I have had a look at the Birdsville amendment and I have had a look at the proposal here, and I will be voting against the proposal here. I will be putting my money on the Birdsville amendment. But I do not do that because it is effective. Clearly, it is not effective. Clearly, effectiveness can be read in the annual report of Woolworths, where they have claimed they have another 10 per cent market share. And then we have the question of what happens if you go to unlimited trading hours and if you own all of the service stations, which Woolworths and Coles effectively do. They have bought 1,100 outlets. I say to young people, ‘Don't look at the class of politician you've got now-please don't look at them-because you will be disheartened, you will be cynical, you'll be hateful and you will cut yourself off and alienate yourself from the system. Remember that, once upon a time, there were people in this place who had guts.' Once upon a time, there was a man called Doug Anthony who stood up in this place and said, ‘ Mr Shell and Mr BP, you will be limited.' He and the much maligned Malcolm Fraser stood up in this place and took the oil companies head on and said, ‘You will be restricted to 400 outlets.' So I say to young people, ‘Don't look at what you've got now-cowardly, spineless people who come in here and serve the interests of big corporations and couldn't care less how many people commit suicide in Australia or how many little mothers go hungry because they can't afford to buy enough food for their kids. Look at the great men who were once in this place who had the courage to stand up on these issues and did not fight about some obscure wording in a piece of legislation that won't make any different to anything.' We should come into this place and do things that seriously need to be done. Before you go to bed at night or when you get on your knees and say your prayers to the good Lord up there, all of you should ask yourselves whether, by continuing to support the growth of these people, you have done the right thing in this place. In all conscienceunless you are a self-deceived person-you its will have to say to yourself, ‘I have not done the right thing by the people of Australia; in fact, I have done terrible things by the people of Australia.'

154,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The purpose of the Trade Practices Act 1974, as section 2 of the act makes clear, is to ‘enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection'. This bill, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, which I support, will further that purpose by restoring the intended effect of the provision of the act which prohibits various trade practices that are anticompetitive conduct. That provision, section 46, has been undermined in recent years by a series of court decisions, which I will go to. Before doing so, though, it is worth recalling that the Trade Practices Act was introduced in 1974 by a Labor government, under Prime Minister Whitlam, and substantially improved by another Labor government, the Hawke government, in 1986. Labor also introduced, in a similar vein, the National Competition Policy in the 1990s. Labor has a very long standing commitment to promoting competition. It is also worth remembering that the 1986 amendmentsMr Katter-It has gone from 50.5 per cent under you to 82 per cent, and you are telling me that you have done a wonderful job!",85
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy should know that interjections are disorderly.,85
156,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I will start the sentence again. It is also worth remembering that the 1986 amendments were also focused on section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, the subject of this amending bill. The 1986 amendments deleted the requirement of control so that, instead of applying to corporations which were ‘in a position to substantially control a market', the prohibition was to apply to corporations that have a ‘substantial degree of power in the market'. The House will note that the 1986 amendments, like this bill, were focused on ensuring that the Trade Practices Act is an effective deterrent to antithe competitive conduct. The member for Kennedy asks rhetorically what principle Labor stands for, and I would have thought that this bill makes clear that in this area of economic regulation Labor stands for the principles of competition, of deterring anticompetitive conduct and of eliminating unfair trade practices like predatory pricing. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I just want to ask him if he thinks 85 per cent of the market is fair.",85
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Order! The honourable member for Kennedy should not address the Deputy Speaker in that way. If he wants to take a point of order he can, but he has made his contribution to the debate.",86
158,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Labor's commitment to the principle of competition has played a very large part in the strong economic performance of our country over the last decade and more, and it is a commitment which is reflected not only in the Trade Practices Act introduced by Labor in 1974 and strengthened by Labor in 1986 but also in the many structural economic reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments. This bill contains amendments which are very long overdue. That is a familiar theme that we have heard in this parliament all through this year, where we bring to the parliament legislation that has been overdue for several years because the former government simply did not do the jobs that it was meant to do, particularly the kind of overhaul that from time to time is needed for major pieces of legislation like the Trade Practices Act. The amendments are intended to deal with an approach to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act taken by the High Court in several decisions which has produced a very narrow interpretation that has dramatically reduced effectiveness of the section. I refer, of course, to the decisions of the court in Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd, a 2001 decision; Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a February 2003 decision; and Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a decision handed down by the High Court in December 2003. Justice Kirby was in dissent in these decisions, and in characteristically clear language His Honour identified the problem with the approach of the majority. In the third of these cases, the Rural Press case, Justice Kirby said: This is the third recent decision of this Court (Melway and Boral Besser Masonry … being the other two) in which a majority has adopted an unduly narrow view of s. 46 of the Act. In effect, it has held, in each case, that the established large degree of market power enjoyed by the impugned corporation was merely incidental or coincidental to the anti-competitive consequences found to have occurred. Notwithstanding the proof of market power, the Court has held that the impugned corporations did not directly or indirectly ‘take advantage' of that power to the disadvantage of competition in the market. In my view, the approach taken by the majority is insufficiently attentive to the object of the Act to protect and uphold market competition. It is unduly protective of the depredations of the corporations concerned. It is unrealistic, bordering on ethereal, when the corporate conduct is viewed in its commercial and practical setting. The outcome cripples the effectiveness of s. 46 of the Act. It undermines this Court's earlier and more realistic decision in Queensland Wire. The victims are Australian consumers and the competitors who seek to engage in competitive conduct in a naive faith in the protection of the Act. Section 46 might just as well not have been enacted for cases like these where its operation is sorely needed to achieve the purposes of the Act. Judicial lightning strikes thrice. A novel doctrine of innocent coin- power. cidence prevails. Effective anti-competitive threats can be made without the redress which s. 46 appears to promise. Once again I dissent. I am pleased that by these amendments the well-expressed and powerful dissent of Justice Kirby-a long time ago now, in 2003is finally being acted on. Following these three High Court decisions, the Senate Economics References Committee in 2004 conducted a review entitled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. The review detailed several important concerns about the effectiveness of section 46. Relevantly to this bill, the review looked at whether the Trade Practices Act provides sufficient guidance as to what constitutes taking advantage of market power and whether the Trade Practices Act provides sufficient protection against so-called predatory pricing. The Senate committee received detailed submissions and recommendations from the ACCC and many business groups, who were all concerned about the narrowness of the approach of the High Court and how that had undermined what was intended to be the effect of section 46. On the ‘taking advantage of market power', the Senate committee expressed great concern about the High Court's interpretation, particularly in the Rural Press decision, in which the High Court had defined ‘take advantage' very narrowly, by holding that a test of whether the company had taken advantage of its market power was whether it could have acted in that way in the absence of market power. This ‘could' test looks at physical or business capacity rather than rationale or intent. It seems to produce a situation where corporations may use their market power to engage in proscribed conduct with impunity as long as they could also undertake that conduct in the absence of such It is worth recalling what the former government's response to the Senate committee's recommendations was. What was the response of the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins? The Senate committee recommended in no uncertain terms that there should be a declaratory provision outlining the elements of ‘take advantage' for the purpose of section 46 and, at length, indicated what the contents of that declaratory provision might be. I will not take up the time of the House by going through it, but the Senate committee indicated that the provision should refer to such matters as whether the conduct of the corporation was materially facilitated by its substantial degree of market power, looking also at the intention of the corporation. The response of the government was this, in bald terms: The government does not accept this recommendation. It is not accepted that the interpretation of ‘take advantage' requires any statutory clarification. On the other matter relevant to this bill, the Senate committee made some very clear recommendations about predatory pricing. The Senate committee recommended that the act be amended to provide that, without limiting section 46, in determining whether a corporation has breached section 46, the courts may have regard to the capacity of the corporation to sell a good or service below its variable cost. It also recommended that the act be amended so that, where the form of proscribed behaviour alleged under section 46 is predatory pricing, it is not necessary to demonstrate a capacity to subsequently recoup the losses experienced as a result of that predatory pricing strategy. This question of the degree to which recoupment, or potential recoupment, is to be considered has been the subject of a great deal of comment in the last four or five years, but here again the former government and the former Treasurer said only this: ‘The government accepts this recommendation in part.' Even this, regrettably, was an empty pretence because the former government and the former Treasurer, the do-nothing member for Higgins, did nothing at all until 2007 and even then did not in any real sense adopt the recommendation that I have just referred to. In 2007, what we instead had produced by the former government and the former Treasurer was the so-called Birdsville amendment. This was some three years after the Senate Economics Reference Committee had reported in 2004. Really, this so-called Birdsville amendment should be called the Costello-Joyce amendment because it was introduced by the member for Higgins, the former Treasurer, apparently after being produced on the back of an envelope by Senator Joyce. The former government and the former Treasurer have never explained why they took so long to do so little in response to the Senate committee's report and have also never explained why the government failed to consult with industry bodies the ACCC before introducing the amendments that they did in 2007. Mr Katter interjecting",86
159,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The 2007 amendments ignored the detailed submissions and recommendations of the ACCC. I can hear from the member for Kennedy's interjections that he has completely failed to understand the role that the ACCC plays in regulating anticompetitive conduct in this country. What needs to be borne in mind is that the 2007 amendments were resoundingly criticised after their passage through this parliament. will start with the comment made by Peter Armitage, a very senior solicitor from Blake Dawson Waldron in Sydney. He was the practice head for competition and consumer protection last year when he made these comments. In respect of the Costello-Joyce amendment that those opposite seem keen to defend still, Mr Armitage said: Make no mistake; this law is bad for consumers and bad for competition. This warning will be dismissed no doubt as special pleading by a lawyer who acts routinely for the big end of town. Unfortunately for Australia's consumers, shooting the messenger will not alter the truth of the message. It is a fundamental requirement of good law that it can be understood by those who must comply with it. This is not the case with the Birdsville amendment. Under this amendment, no company will be able to safely know whether it has a ‘substantial share of the market', what the ‘relevant cost' will be for assessing its price-cutting and how long is a ‘sustained period'. Mr Armitage went on: Not only will consumers suffer but a great many businesses across the country, including mini businesses that may think of themselves as small, will be at risk. For example, a pharmacist whose company operates one pharmacy in a remote country town that has only other pharmacy will be at risk of breaching the Birdsville amendment if it engages in repeated loss leading as part of a vigorous attempt to attract customers and get the or with better of its competitor. To complete Mr Armitage's comments, he said: These amendments are a fundamental attack on the process of the competition and the benefits it delivers. There were others who commented. Professor Bob Baxt, a former chair of the Trade Practices Commission, had this to say about the Costello-Joyce amendment: Far from protecting small businesses, this amendment is likely to prove unwelcome to them as well as to others, as increased complexity will I lead to litigation and lengthy appeals. Not only will the small business sector not enjoy any real success as a result of these amendments but, most importantly, consumers will suffer significantly companies abandon any attempt to discount in situations where they have any degree of market share. The former chair of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, was also very critical of the Costello-Joyce amendment, saying that it may drive up consumer prices. The Law Council of Australia was intensely critical of the Costello-Joyce amendment. Indeed, I can say that, looking at the Costello-Joyce amendment, it is apparent on its face that its language is unclear. Most importantly, it uses different concepts to the terms and concepts already used elsewhere in the Trade Practices Act and particularly in section 46. As such, it is wording which is guaranteed to produce extensive legal argument and almost guaranteed to produce judicial disagreement. Certainly the amendments that were produced by the former government did nothing to add any clarity and wereMr Katter-I agree with that.",88
160,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"And we have agreement from the member for Kennedy that they did nothing to add clarity. They also did nothing in any sense to add to consumer protection in this country. Mr Katter- Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Slipper, I rise on a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented.",89
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,The honourable member may well claim to be misrepresented and I will certainly give him the call after the honourable member has finished his speech. But the member for Isaacs is entitled to finish his speech and then I will call the member for Kennedy.,89
162,Mr DREYFUS,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"In the debate on this bill, we have heard members opposite persisting in the defence of the 2007 amendments with absurd statements like that of the member for Fadden, who told the House that as there had not been enough time for the amendment to operate and, ‘It needs time to work its way out'-whatever that was meant to mean. The member for Riverina also sought to defend the 2007 amendments. The member for Dickson has moved an amendment calling for recognition of: ... the impact on small business of the Government's proposed changes to the ‘Birdsville Amendment' ... To that, I would say that the only impact will be a good one and that is what should be recognised as the force of these amendments. Those opposite have chosen not to engage at all with the cogent criticism that has been expressed by so many business groups, by commentators, by lawyers and by the ACCC of the amendments passed last year. Not only do those opposite fail to meet the criticisms of their muddled and ineffective reform from 2007, but they fail to acknowledge the manner in which the reforms contained in this bill have been welcomed by Australian business, welcomed in particular by small business groups, welcomed by commentators and welcomed by the ACCC. I notice the time, so I might quote simply from the Daily Telegraph-not a noted supporter of the government. In April this year, it stated: The Federal Government's reforms to the Trade Practices Act might seem basic enough, but they're long overdue. The proposed changes will be music to the ears of small businesses that now stand a chance against much larger and more powerful companies. Currently it's too easy for big firms to undercut smaller enterprises and drive them out of business. The government's reforms will make it easier to investigate and prosecute businesses engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. Strengthening the consumer watchdog, the ACCC, will also provide more protection for consumers, who are disadvantaged by a monopoly in any market. With those words from the Daily Telegraph, I commend the bill to the House.",89
163,Mr KATTER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",90
164,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,90
165,Mr KATTER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,Yes.,90
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,Please proceed.,90
167,Mr KATTER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The previous speaker said that I agreed with what he was saying. I agreed with his comment that it was ineffective; I did not agree with his comment about clarity and the fact that the Birdsville amendment was not a move in the right direction. I have specifically said on a number of occasions that I believe it was a move in the right direction. The ineffectiveness part of his comments I agreed with, but only that part.",90
168,Mr BRADBURY,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise in support of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. I note that there have been a considerable number of contributions from both sides of the House on this bill and the points of difference between the approaches that have been adopted by both sides, I think, are now clear. On the one hand, those on this side of the chamber have sought to place this set of amendments within the broader context of the Australian Labor Party's long-term commitment to delivering greater competition within markets right across the economy. It was the Labor Party that introduced the Trade Practices Act and the Labor Party have played a significant role in all of the significant competition reforms that have occurred certainly since that time. In relation to the bill before us, a range of measures are proposed and they have been set out by speakers previously. To summarise the items that I wish to comment on, I wish to make some comments in relation to the proposals to clarify the definition of market power, which of its nature involves comment on the so-called Birdsville amendment as it currently exists within the existing legislation. I also will be commenting on the efforts of this bill to clarify and legislate in respect of the issue of recoupment of losses and to make it clear that recoupment of losses should not be necessary in order to make out a case in respect of predatory pricing. Another important element of the bill relates to the provision of more guidance in relation to the definition of ‘take advantage of', which is something that, in the absence of any legislative detail, the courts have been left to interpret. The parliament now has an opportunity to provide some guidance that might overcome perceived inadequacies in the interpretations that the courts have previously had applied in respect of that definition. I also wish to make some comments in relation to the legislative requirement for a deputy chairperson of the ACCC to be someone with knowledge of or a background in small business. That brings me to the issue of small business generally. Certainly those on the other side have sought to hide behind some belief in the merits of their case being advantageous to small business as being one of the primary arguments that they have mounted in this debate. It is interesting that just about every speaker from the coalition that has spoken on this issue has said, ‘We are the party of small business'-that is, the coalition, and presumably that includes the National Party as well. On that basis, they cannot support these amendments. Sometimes it is just as interesting to reflect on what is not said as on what is said. I reflect upon the fact that the shadow minister for small business, the service economy and tourism has not made a contribution to this debate. I think that is telling. I think it also exposes as a fig leaf the argument that the opposition is opposed to these amendments on the basis of its commitment to small business. I note an article on 29 April 2008 in the Australian: Opposition small business spokesman Steve Ciobo said the coalition would back the amendments “in principle”",90
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,The honourable member ought to refer to the honourable member for Moncrieff by the title of his electorate and not by his actual name.,91
170,Mr BRADBURY,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I am sorry; I was quoting from the article. The member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister for small business, is on the record in April as saying that the coalition supported the amendments ‘in principle'. We should not be surprised, because the coalition had a position back before the legislation was previously introduced-until Senator Joyce got his hands on it. A recurring theme that seems to be emerging in a number of the debates that I have been involved with in the last little while has been the increasing dominance of the National Party in driving economic policy from the opposition. I think that is a matter of grave concern and I will explore that a little bit further in a few moments. In terms of what small business really thinks of this, I heard a number of people on the other side say, ‘We are standing up for small business on this,' but there were not all that many comments by people who genuinely represent small business introduced into the debate. I saw a quote in the Australian on 28 April of this year: Tony Steven, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, said the Rudd Government had gone further to protect small business than the previous government, with the changes sending a much clearer message to the courts. I think Mr Steven is well placed to represent small business; certainly, his endorsement of this bill is one that is not lost on those of us on this side of the House, because we are committed to ensuring that the things that we do in this place are going to assist small business and at the very least not hamper their efforts to get on with doing what they do-that is, generating so many jobs throughout our economy. I also noticed that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Peter Anderson, said that the competition reforms were ‘a balanced package'. We see further endorsement of these measures by industry and representatives of business-in particular small business. It really does pose the question: if small business is at least largely supportive of these measures-and certainly, on the basis of those quotes, it isand if defending small business is the argument that is being presented as the basis upon which those on the other side are opposed to the amendments, what is their reason for opposing them? I turn to the predatory pricing provisions and in particular to the question that clearly emerges in the debate about this bill: whether or not we should retain the very new definition that came in as a result of the so-called Birdsville amendment, which favours this notion of a share of market, as opposed to market power, as being the formulation of words by which we can ascertain whether or not these predatory pricing provisions should apply. Clearly, if the definition is as restrictive as market share then there is a certain possibility, and it has been noted by speakers on all sides that these matters have not yet been tested before the courts. I have to say I find it rather peculiar that those in the opposition are suggesting that there is some benefit in us pursuing this through the courts, that somehow leaving these things to the courts is how really good law emerges. I happen to think that one of the motivations for many of us to come into this place is to make the laws and to do it in a way that is going to provide some certainty to those citizens and businesses within our community, our society and our economy so that they can operate on the basis that they are either complying with those laws or they are not. It is an absolute absurdity to suggest it is good law to come into this place, to acknowledge that something is unclear and uncertain and to abdicate our responsibility to the courts. If you listen to those on the other side, that is what they would have this place do. On this side we are very much committed to meeting our responsibility as legislators, and that is why we would like to provide greater clarity in the market power definition. On the share of market versus market power debate, we have seen-at least from the example of the Safeway case-that market share, of itself, does not necessarily onstrate market power or potentially taking advantage of market power. If we look at the Safeway case in 2006, the Federal Court imposed penalties totalling $8.9 million on Safeway with respect to four breaches of section 46(1) and other anticompetitive conduct. This was despite Safeway having only around a 16 to 20 per cent share of the relevant market. Those on the other side have said that one of the great virtues of the market share test is alcohol. that it is easily ascertainable to those who might be willing to meet their obligations because you can quantify someone's market share. You can quantify someone's market share, but what remains a mystery, to me and to all of those citizens out there wanting to meet their obligations under this legislation as it currently stands, is what level of market share gets you over the line. Is it 16 per cent? Is it 20 per cent? Is it 25 per cent? Is it 50 per cent? This is just one of the questions that remains unanswered as a result of the so called Birdsville amendment. I understand the Birdsville amendment was conceived in a hotel in Birdsville by Senator Joyce. On occasion I have certainly seen some good ideas, some inspired thoughts, emerge over a cleansing beer at the that local hotel. But, thankfully, on most occasions those inspired thoughts wash away with a Berocca the next morning-they do not find their way into legislation. The unfortunate reality here is that this proposal, which was ill-conceived, made it through the Senate on the last occasion because the government of the day required the support of Senator Joyce.",91
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Just before I vacate the chair to the relieving Deputy Speaker, I should point out to the honourable member that I hope that he did not intend to cast a reflection on dem- the senator from Queensland.",92
172,Mr BRADBURY,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Certainly not. Thanks, Deputy Speaker; I was merely seeking toMr Baldwin-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The previous occupier of the chair made a very light directional invitation to the member to withdraw the comments asserting that Senator Joyce's development in the Birdsville amendment occurred because he had consumed too much",92
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"There is no point of order. A comment was made by the chair which I heard on my entry. It was not a direction. Mr Baldwin-With due respect, Madam Deputy Speaker, you were not in chamber to hear what was said.",92
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I did hear what was said, and I heard the Deputy Speaker invite the member to consider his statements. It was not a direction to withdraw.",93
175,Dr EMERSON,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"On the point of order: I simply make the point, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the shadow minister has just reflected upon the chair in a rather adverse way. It was completely unjustified.",93
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I thank the member for the intervention, but I think we can proceed with the debate.",93
177,Mr BRADBURY,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Thanks, Madam Deputy Speaker. I certainly was not seeking to make any such implication. What I was merely attempting to draw the House's attention to was the ill-conceived nature of these proposals. I think it is demonstrative of the fact that the National Party are now increasingly driving the economic policy of the coalition. I can understand why they might have given into Senator Joyce back in the previous parliament, where they really needed his vote in the Senate, but what absolutely bewilders me is why they continue to pay homage to this amendment, which I note has been criticised roundly in many circles. I note that Australian Industry Group spokesman Peter Burns said of the Birdsville amendments: They were silly. It is sensible They have created a lot of uncertainty. I note that Professor Alan Fels, who was the previous chairperson of the ACCC, said in the Australian Financial Review on 25 September 2007: The pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. These are eminent and respected commentators criticising the outcome of that particular ill-conceived thought, the result of an illconceived process which occurred in the Birdsville Hotel. We are all familiar with the term DUI, driving under the influence. It seems to me as though-and I say this without casting any aspersions on Senator Joyce-this is LUI, legislating under the influence of the National Party. We have seen the once-great Liberal Party caving in, when it comes to key economic policy decisions, to the demands of the National Party-in the same way as the then Treasurer, who, when the previous amendments were introduced, was not from the outset prepared to countenance these proposals, ended up having to give in. The shadow minister for small business was not able, unfortunately, to get his policy through the opposition party room, and we can only speculate that that may be the reason he has chosen not to speak on this particular debate, which those on the other side have consistently reminded us is on a critical set of amendments affecting small business. In relation to recoupment, it is critical that these amendments be passed. They ensure that the case law that has developed, which runs counter to the intention of the parliament-or certainly counter to what this parliament believes was the intention of the law at the time-will be rectified and there will be no such requirement to prove recoupment in order to make out a case under these proto get rid of them. visions. In relation to the definition of ‘take advantage of', it is critical that these proposals are adopted. The courts have been left with the expression ‘take advantage of', and they have interpreted it in a certain way. It is imperative that, if the parliament believes that that is not the correct interpretation or that the courts have not always ended up with the correct interpretation, there be rectification of the statute to ensure that greater guidance is given to the judiciary when these matters come before them. Importantly, these proposals ensure that a very strong voice is always present for small business within the institutional arrangements of the ACCC. I think ensuring that a deputy chairperson of the ACCC is someone that has knowledge and experience from a small business perspective will ensure that, in the continued deliberations of the ACCC, the needs of small business will be taken into account to a greater extent. Once again, it strikes me as strange that the shadow minister for small business has chosen not to make a contribution to this debate. There are a range of other amendments contained within this bill, but, to summarise, what we have seen with this bill is in large part a consolidation of the great commitment of those within the government, the great commitment of the Australian Labor Party, to ensuring greater competition within the marketplace. Greater competition is not something that we pursue as a goal in its own right; it is something we pursue to get a ter deal for consumers. There are many consumers, I am certain, within electorates such as mine that will benefit greatly from these amendments when they are passed by the parliament. I commend the bill.",93
178,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The Labor government is committed to promoting competition and cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour by powerful companies. I am therefore very pleased to rise to speak in support of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The bill will facilitate our objective by improving the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting competitive processes in the Australian economy. The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the act to clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' and to address problems in relation to predatory pricing in the context of the prohibition on misuse of market power in section 46. In addition, the bill will extend the jurisdiction for section 46 cases to the Federal Magistrates Court. It is the government's view that a series of court decisions have undermined the operation of the act, section 46 in particular. The government's amendments strengthen section 46 and crack down on anticompetitive behaviour by: first, ensuring that victims of predatory pricing will not need to prove that the predator has the ability to recoup losses after participating in an anticompetitive below-cost pricing strategy; second, clarifying the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' in section 46 in response to concerns that the present meaning of that term has prevented section 46 from capturing anticompetitive behaviour; and, third, removing the unnecessary uncertainty that has arisen following the two-track process for predatory pricing that developed under the previous government. The ACCC has said that the dual-track bet- process has caused considerable confusion because it focuses on the fundamentally different concepts of market power and market share. The Law Council of Australia stated that this process deters corporations with substantial market share from discounting to low prices for what may be genuine competitive reasons for fear of action from the ACCC. These amendments will deal with predatory pricing while allowing businesses to engage in genuine competition and discounting for the benefit of consumers. The bill forms a key part of the government's economic reform agenda, giving the ACCC the tools it needs to promote competition and fair trading and to protect consumers. The government will extend the reach of the ACCC by removing the arbitrary monetary threshold currently applicable to allegations of unconscionable conduct, enhancing the protection of small business from transactions involving such things as undue influence. The ACCC will be required to have a deputy chair with knowledge of small business, and the act clarifies the commission's information-gathering powers, which will strengthen its ability to fully investigate pected breaches of the law. Giving small business a permanent voice within the ACCC will improve understanding of the special circumstances confronting small businesses and the difficulties that they face in dealing with anticompetitive behaviour by more powerful larger businesses. These reforms will make it easier to prosecute businesses engaging in anticompetitive behaviour, give small business permanent representation on the ACCC and allow small business to access cheaper and more efficient judicial processes. Allowing small and medium businesses in appropriate circumstances to have their cases heard in the Federal Magistrates Court, rather than in the Federal Court, will save considerable costs. The amendments undertaken by this government strengthen the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to curtail misuse of market power by addressing the real impediments that have prevented the law from functioning properly. The Motor Trades Association of Australia have acknowledged that the bill will assist small business operators in seeking redress against predatory behaviour while also ensuring a diversity of competitors and choice for consumers. They have commended the government for recognising the need for these reforms. The Australian Retailers Association has also supported the bill, stating that the amendments distinguish predatory pricing from legitimate competitive discounting, which was previously unclear. This allows retailers to get on with business and provide benefits to consumers without being concerned they are breaching the Trade Practices Act under recent amendments. The ACCC has stated that the reforms by the government to section 46 continue the process of providing the regulator with the tools it needs to vigorously protect competition while not falling into the trap of protecting suscompetitors from the impact of that competition. Small businesses can be at a distinct competitive disadvantage in the market. This bill will give them a fair go when in competition with those businesses with considerable market power, providing them with what I believe is the greatest protection in 30 years against predatory pricing and the misuse of market power. Working families will also benefit from the government's reforms because they will facilitate effective competition, which should result in lower prices, greater choice and better quality products and services. In the tradition of Labor governments, this bill makes a substantial contribution to the legacy of competition reforms-and we can go back to the introduction of the Trade Practices Act in 1974, to tariff reform, to deregulation of the banking sector in the 1980s and the National Competition Policy in the 1990s. This stands in stark contrast to the opposition, who are either economic reform plodders who covet as their own the economic dividend that previous Labor government reforms delivered in the form of low inflationary economic growth, or who are, on the other hand, reform extremists, as was demonstrated with Work Choices and the disadvantage this inflicted on ordinary workers. This government has competition policy as the centrepiece of its economic agenda. This bill is no exception to our intention to make markets work more efficiently, with consumers and small business being the ultimate beneficiary. I want to commend to the House the Small Business Charter of Fairness recently produced by the Fair Trading Coalition. The Fair Trading Coalition comprises an impressive range of small business representatives, including the various motor trades associations around the states, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Newsagents Federation, the Australian Motor Body Repairers Association, the Civil Contractors Federation and many more. There are many things proposed in the Small Business Charter of Fairness which I would commend to the attention of my parliamentary colleagues, but there are two which are particularly relevant in the context of this debate. The first is this: The strengthening of section 51AC (unconscionable conduct) of the Trade Practices Act to proscribe ‘take it or leave it' contracts and the termination of contracts at will without just cause. Too many small businesses are subjected to unfair business practices, including the use of ‘nonnegotiable' contracts and termination of contracts at will without just cause. Section 51AC should be amended to proscribe these practices. The second is this: Access to justice for small business. To ensure that all businesses have affordable cess to the protection and remedies available der the Trade Practices Act: the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court should be extended to deal with contraventions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act including misuse of market power, contravention of industry codes and unconscionable conduct matters; and the ACCC should be able to seek compensation for victims of breaches of the Trade Practices so that individuals don't have to take their own action and there should also be effective and expensive scope for victims of breaches of the Trade Practices Act to use sections 82 and 83 of the Act following successful prosecutions by the ACCC. I think that these are important things for the House to consider. In the time. I have been a member of the federal parliament, I have experienced representations from small businesses who have been the victims of rough handling from large businesses. I remember, in particular, cases involving retail tenants who were in dispute with shopping centre landlords and, back in the 1990s, some of the disgraceful ways in which retail tenants were being treated by those landlords. I remember cases involving petrol station franchisees and their dealings with the large oil companies. I remember motor accident repairers and their struggle to get fair value for work done. On each occasion, in seeking to assist them, I would find that the previous federal government, the Howard government, was essentially unsympathetic to small business concerns and was on the side of large corporations. That is typical. On any given issue, whether we are talking about industrial relations laws, Fuelwatch, grocery prices, banks passing on interest rate reductions, the Medicare levy surcharge or the levy on condensate, given an opportunity to support small business, to support workers, to support consumers, the Liberal Party always passes by on the other side. It always supports large corporations. It always supports big business ac- at the expense of small business, at the exun- pense of workers, at the expense of consumers. That is why it has fallen to a Labor government to introduce the legislation before the House here. To return to some of the detail of the bill, part IV of the Trade Practices Act promotes competition by prohibiting anticompetitive Act conduct. Section 46 in part IV prohibits unilateral anticompetitive conduct, most notably in- by prohibiting corporations from misusing substantial market power to harm or eliminate competitors or competition generally. Part IVA of the Trade Practices Act promotes fair trading by prohibiting unconscionable conduct. In particular, section 51AC of part IVA prohibits unconscionable conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services to or the acquisition of goods or services from a corporation. Labor in opposition indicated that we would strengthen the Trade Practices Act to restore it to the original 1986 intention. bill strengthens section 46 and section 51AC as part of our ongoing commitment to improve trade practices laws in Australia. These really do constitute the biggest reform to the Trade Practices Act legislation in over 20 years. I mentioned that the bill amends the Trade Practices Act to require that at least one of the deputy chairpersons of the ACCC have knowledge of or experience in small business matters. I think this is a very important reform. Those opposite say that they support small business, but effectively they get the support of small business on false pretences. They never do anything to help them and they certainly do not do anything to help them in their struggles with big business. Section 46 contains two prohibitions against unilateral anticompetitive conduct. Firstly, subsection 46(1) prohibits a corporation with a substantial degree of market power from taking advantage of that power for a prescribed purpose. This bill amends the prohibition on predatory pricing in subsection 46(1AA) to align it with the prohibition on the misuse of market power in subsection 46(1). Consistent with the findings of the Senate inquiry, a specific prohibition against predatory pricing makes predatory pricing a clear target of section 46. The bill also incorporates four nonexclusive factors into section 46 which may be considered by a court in determining whether a corporation has taken advantage of its substantial market power. Importantly, the amendment ensures that, in addition to considering whether a corporation could have engaged in the relevant conduct in a competitive market, the court may also consider whether that corporation would have been likely to do so. I turn to the question of jurisdiction. Concerns have been expressed about the costs This and delays associated with bringing section 46 matters. If the costs associated with privately pursuing section 46 claims are prohibitively high, then it will not be as effective in addressing anticompetitive conduct. The bill addresses these concerns by conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to hear private matters arising under section 46. By doing so, the bill improves access to justice for businesses in cases arising under this important provision in appropriate circumstances. Schedule 3 repeals the price thresholds that currently limit the protection afforded by section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act against unconscionable conduct in business transactions. In doing so, the bill implements a recommendation of the Senate inquiry. It enhances the protection afforded by section 51AC by focusing the prohibition on the wrongdoing involved, rather than arbitrary monetary thresholds. The ACCC chairman, Mr Graeme Samuel, stated on 11 June this year that, as a result of the amendments contained in the bill, small businesses will soon enjoy their greatest protection in 30 years against predatory pricing and the misuse of market power. I also want to comment on the Birdsville amendment, given that the coalition have indicated they will be voting to keep it. I want to point out to the House that the Birdsville amendment is not supported by the ACCC. It is not supported by the former ACCC chairman, Professor Alan Fels-for whom I think there is high regard right around the country in terms of his commitment and expertise in this area-and it is not supported by Bob Baxt, the former chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. The present reference to market share has given rise to uncertainty and may reduce procompetitive price competition in markets. The ACCC has publicly stated that subsection 46(1AA), as currently drafted, adds considerable confusion to the law and should be amended to clarify the protection it provides. This bill achieves this by aligning the Birdsville amendment with the long standing prohibition in subsection 46(1). In particular, the bill amends subsection 46(1AA) to focus it on a corporation's market power as opposed to its market share. The size of a firm, including its market share, will, however, remain a relevant factor in establishing a corporation's market power for the purposes of the revised prohibition. Subsection 46(1AA) presently operates in relation to firms with ‘a substantial share of a market'. This is inconsistent with the long standing prohibition in subsection 46(l) which operates in relation to firms with ‘a substantial degree of market power'. The concept of market power allows a court to consider all the relevant characteristics of a market in determining whether a firm has acted in an anticompetitive fashion. Such factors would include the size of a firm, as well as the size and number of its competitors. The concept of market power has been effective in targeting unilateral anticompetitive conduct. I heard this example mentioned in the House previously, but in 2006 the Federal Court imposed penalties totalling $8.9 million on Safeway with respect to four breaches of section 46(1) and other anticompetitive conduct. This was despite Safeway having only around a 16 to 20 per cent share of the relevant market. I think this is a good bill. It is a bill which is good for small business; it is a bill which is good for consumers; it is a bill which continues the Labor tradition of providing assistance to small business and providing assistance to consumers. I commend it to the House.",94
179,Ms NEAL,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak to the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 before the House today. This bill will amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage'. It will also address problems in relation to predatory pricing in the context of the prohibition on misuse of market power in section 46. In addition, the bill will extend the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court to include section 46 cases. This bill forms part of the Rudd government's agenda to make the Trade Practices Act 1974 work more effectively. The amendments will promote competition and fair trading in the Australian market, and they reflect the importance that this government places on competition policy and the protection of small business. This competition policy agenda builds on a strong tradition of Labor initiatives and reform in this area. The Labor Party introduced the Trade Practices Act in 1974 to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition, fair trading and consumer protection. Labor again made improvements to the act in 1986, as well as establishing a National Competition Policy regime in the 1990s. The National Competition Policy put in place many of the policy settings that have resulted in Australia's strong economic performance over the past decade. The Rudd Labor government has a fundamental belief that competition policy is at the core of the government's economic agenda. Unlike those opposite, the Rudd Labor government believes that a pro-business and pro-competition approach to small business will bring benefits to business operators and consumers alike. In my own electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales, small business forms the bedrock of the regional economy. In Robertson, there are approximately 4,500 small businesses that employ staff and 11,700 nonemploying small businesses. This economically vital and rapidly growing sector makes a huge contribution to our local economy and constitutes one of the mainstays of my area and its job creation. Labor supports reward for effort, risktaking and entrepreneurship in small business. Above all, I believe it is vital that ernment allow small businesses an opportunity to grow and prosper. Personally, I have spent most of my life in small business. I know that many of those on the other side believe in the stereotype that Labor people are employees and that all Liberal Party members are employers, but that is just not the case anymore. I think it is about time that those on the other side understood it. I have spent the majority of my life working as a small business person and employing people, with all the joys and risks that that includes. think we need to take a more mature look at this debate. The opposition needs to understand and accept that there is broad experience and understanding of small business on this side of the chamber and that we can debate these issues in a mature and more complex way. The amendments before us today will ensure that the small business economy of the Central Coast-and, indeed, small businesses across Australia-will continue to grow. There is an increasing trend in the Australian economy, particularly noticeable in the last few decades, in which previously employed people are setting up business entities. This trend also involves the establishment of an increasing number of nonemploying small businesses, as well as independent contractors and other microbusinesses. These businesses employ a significant number of Central Coast people, and the number is growing and will continue to grow. I have undertaken quite a lot of work in the small business area in Robertson, particularly in relation to issues of tenancies in major shopping centres, but also a large range of other businesses have consulted with me and spoken to me about their issues. There are increasing pressures on many small businesses in my area, as there are across Australia. This bill offers more effective measures gov- to deal with anticompetitive behaviour and unconscionable conduct that will be welcomed by many business operators in Robertson. It focuses on increasing competition in the Australian business economy and promoting fair trading, which should be welcomed by both business and the public. The Trade Practices Act itself-in particular, part IV of the original Trade Practices Act 1974-promotes competition by prohibiting anticompetitive conduct. Section 46, in part IV, prohibits unilateral anticompetitive I conduct, most notably by prohibiting corporations from misusing substantial market power to harm or eliminate competitors or competition generally. Part IVA of the Trade Practices Act promotes fair trading by prohibiting unconscionable conduct. Within that, section 51AC prohibits unconscionable conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services to or the acquisition of goods or services from a corporation. However, it is the government's belief that a series of court decisions have undermined the operation of the act, in particular section 46. It is not just the government that believes it; the ACCC has made this point for several years. The ACCC has been operating under severe restrictions upon its ability to regulate anticompetitive conduct. So, despite all these attempts at reform, concerns remain that section 46 does not achieve its purpose of prohibiting the misuse of market power. In the bill before the House today, the amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act are aimed at promoting competition and cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour by powerful businesses. The government intends to enhance the legitimate interests of small business by protecting them from predatory pricing and giving them a permanent voice in the competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. This package will ensure genuine competition for the benefit of consumers and small business. The bill covers four significant areas of reform. The specific areas to be amended and reformed are set out in the schedules as follows. Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 46, ‘Misuse of market power', of the Trade Practices Act to promote competition in Australia. This enhances the prohibitions against anticompetitive unilateral conduct in business transactions. The amendments contained in this particular schedule seek to dress predatory pricing, clarify the role of recoupment in predatory pricing cases, clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' and confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court for section 46 matters. In particular, the schedule amends section 46(1AA) away from the terminology placed in it by the Birdsville amendment, changing it from ‘share of the market', which was the amendment accepted while the clause was in the Senate in 2007, to ‘degree of power'. I am somewhat concerned that I heard indicated earlier that the opposition intends oppose the amendment put forward by this government to rectify the dangers created by the Birdsville amendment. I find it somewhat surprising, in the light of some of the commentators' comments in relation to that. I draw the House's attention to a number of comments made at the time. These may have been raised previously, but I feel that it provides benefit to the House to draw the attention of the opposition to them again, bearing in mind that it is considering opposing the amendment in this bill. In the Australian Financial Review on 19 September 2007, in relation to the Birdsville amendment to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, Bob Baxt said: What is equally disappointing is the fact that the government on this occasion has not consulted with a significant number of bodies from which it had previously sought views on amendments to trade practices law and in particular the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) (2007) earlier in the year. Also, in the Australian, again on 19 September 2007, in relation to the amendment that the opposition is still intending to try and retain in this bill, Martin Collins said: JOHN Howard has single-handedly destroyed the entire premise of the Trade Practices Act through his predatory pricing amendment, which will have the effect of killing price discounting, to adthe detriment of small business and consumers. In other words, the Prime Minister's amendments have the real threat of hurting the very people he misguidedly thought he was helping in accepting the amendment, proposed by Queensland senator Barnaby Joyce and radio shock jock Alan Jones. I guess everyone makes mistakes. But what concerns me is that, some 12 months after the original mistake, the opposition have not seen fit to carry out the consultation that they should have carried out and to reconsider their position. I urge them, on this occasion, to to think a little bit more and accept the fact that they may have made a mistake and that they should reconsider and support the government, because this government is doing what they should have done on the first occasion, and that is to enhance competition for the benefit of small business and consumers. Looking further on, schedule 2 of the bill seeks to promote competition by enhancing the prohibitions against anticompetitive unilateral conduct that are contained in the Competition Code. It makes amendments to the version of section 46 found in the Competition Code which applies to all persons in the states and territories by virtue of the plication of legislation in those jurisdictions. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Trade Practices Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to extend the protection against unconscionable conduct in business transactions. The amendments contained within this schedule will require that one of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's deputy chairpersons have knowledge of or experience in small business matters-something that I think will provide great benefit. The amendments in this schedule also repeal the thresholds for unconscionable conduct cases under section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act and section 12CC of the ASIC Act. There are also some other amendments contained in this bill which clarify the ACCC's information gathering powers under section 155 to facilitate the effective enforcement by the ACCC. In conclusion, this bill makes the Trade Practices Act significantly more effective in its primary objective, which is to improve the competitive processes in Australian markets. Importantly, it enhances the interests of small business and provides the ACCC with the tools it needs to protect competition, promote fair trading and protect the interests of consumers. The amendments in this bill will clear major impediments that have prevented the law from functioning effectively and have prevented more cases under section 46. The Chairman of the ACCC, Mr Graeme Samuel, stated on 11 June this year that, as a result of the amendments contained in this bill: Small businesses will soon enjoy the greatest protection in 30 years against predatory pricing and misuse of market power ... More cases will now be eligible to proceed and this represents a win for all those who depend upon the Trade Practices Act to protect the competitive process. This bill conap- tains some of the most significant reforms of the Trade Practices Act in a long, long time. I do not say this is the end; I think we still need more protection, particularly for small business, and I am particularly concerned about the power relationship between large shopping centres and the retail sector. But certainly this is a step in the right direction, and I urge the opposition to support the bill.",98
180,Ms HALL,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the legislation that we have before us, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge the role that small business plays. Small business is the largest employer in our communities. Small businesses are also the lifeblood of our nation and a very important part of our economy. The government acknowledge their contribution to our economy and our society. We have the fundamental belief that competition policy is at the core of a government's economic agenda. The legislation that we have before us today looks at that very issue. The government believe that being probusiness and pro-competition delivers the best results for consumers. Those opposite do not have the same concern for consumers. We on this side of the parliament know that those opposite are the slaves of those who put them in this place and we know that, when it comes to weighing up the issue of whether or not they are concerned about protecting consumers, always they come out on the side of their bosses. The member for Robertson raised a very important issue-the anticompetitive behaviour that exists with shopping centres and those people who are tenants within them. This issue has been of great concern to me for a very long time. It is an issue that with on a regular if not daily basis within my electorate. Wherever there is a redevelopment in a shopping centre or any change within a shopping centre, it is always the tenants who come off second best. These are tenants who have invested their life savings in their businesses and they stand to lose everything. Currently, there is a redevelopment of a shopping centre within my electorate and an added burden has been placed on small business owners of being caught between a franchisor and the business. The franchisor obviously wants to have a good relationship with the shopping centre management because they are reliant on them to be able to get good positions not only in one shopping centre but in shopping centres throughout the nation, so they need to negotiate and stay in favour there. On the other hand you have the franchisee, who needs to have a relationship with both but is often the victim in the power relationship that exists; they are the least powerful. And I hope that, as a government, over time we revisit this. At the moment I am advocating very strongly for a number of businesses within my community and I will not rest until they get a fair deal. It is very hard to sit back and see people who have invested their last cent in a business lose rything. It is something that government needs to address and I, along with the member for Robertson, will be advocating for that in this parliament. Schedules 1 and 2 of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 2008 promote competition in Australian markets by enhancing the prohibitions against anticompetitive unilateral conduct in the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the competition code. Schedule 3 makes additional amendments to the TPA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 46, I deal which relates to the misuse of market power-and I once again relate that back to the issue I have just raised-to address predatory pricing, to clarify the role of recoupment in predatory pricing cases, to clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' and to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court for section 46 matters. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the TPA and the ASIC Act to require that one of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's deputy chairpersons have a knowledge of or experience in small business matters. I think this is a very important change and one that I would have hoped members on the other side would support, because I do not think that small business has the voice that it deserves. The voice of business is disproportionately vested in larger businesses. As small business plays such a vital role in our economy as an employer, it is absolutely imperative that this change is made. Schedule 3 also repeals the threshold for unconscionable conduct cases under section 51AC of the TPA and section 12CC of the ASIC Act, and it clarifies the ACCC's informationgathering power under section 155. The government intends to further defend small business from predatory pricing and give it a permanent voice in the competition watchevedog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I have heard members on the other side of this parliament speak very disparagingly of the ACCC and Graeme Samuel. Under the previous government, the ACCC was made, in effect, a toothless tiger. The government of the day did not support the ACCC in any shape or form. The government recognise that the ACCC is a very important body; we are about giving power to it, not making it a toothless tiger. If members on the other side of the parliament had been prepared to stand up when they were in government to try and turn that around in order to give the ACCC the powers it needed to be effective then the criticisms they are now directing at it would not have any veracity whatsoever. There have been many times that I have referred cases to the ACCC and they have been outside of its jurisdiction purely because of the Howard government did to it. This legislation will be cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour by powerful businesses. The new rules make it easier to prosecute businesses engaging in anticompetitive behaviour. They ensure that victims of predatory pricing will not need to prove that the predator has the ability to recoup losses after participating in an anticompetitive, below-cost pricing strategy. The previous rules made it very, very hard. The legal issues that were involved were quite complex. This legislation will clarify the meaning of the term ‘take advantage' and remove the unnecessary uncertainty that has arisen following the two-track process for predatory pricing that developed under the previous government. As I have said, the reforms will also strengthen the role of the ACCC by enhancing its information-gathering powers, enabling it to fully investigate suspected breaches of the law-something that the Howard government sought to ensure it did not have. The government will also extend the reach of the ACCC by removing arbitrary monitoring thresholds currently applicable to allegations of unconscionable conduct and by enhancing the protection of small businesses regarding transactions involving such things as undue influence. These amendments will deal with predatory pricing while allowing business to engage in genuine competition and discounting for the benefits of consumers. That is for the mums and dads, the families and the pensioners in our communities; that is what it is about. Those on the other side of parliament should realise that. As I have mentioned, the fact that small business will have a much greater voice on the ACCC is very, very beneficial. One of the things that I find quite interesting is that the legislation that the previous government introduced-in particular, the Birdsville what amendment-created significant uncertainty. Birdsville is a great place to visit: it has the Birdsville races, a great little pub and a strong community. But I do not know whether it is really appropriate for the Prime Minister of the day to sit down in the Birdsville pub and-over a couple of beers with a senator who might not support him in everything he needs support for-say, ‘Okay, that sounds like great policy.' This is the way the previous government did business and, unfortunately, the Birdsville amendment appears to have been quite flawed. We have Graeme Samuel stating that there was enormous uncertainty around the Birdsville amendment. We have Peter Armitage, the practice head of Blake Dawson Waldron's competition and consumer protection team in Sydney, supporting what I have said. He says that many fine ideas have been conserved in the Birdsville pub, but the predatory pricing amendment to the Trade Practices Act that was accepted by the government of the day-the Howard governmentwas a mistake. He goes on to show just why it was such a mistake and how it will work against competition. One example he uses is of a pharmacist whose company operates one of the two pharmacies that exist in a remote country town; that pharmacist will be at risk of breaching the Birdsville amendment. Another example I read of, which was even more damning of the Birdsville amendment, is where a newsagent in a small country town sells biros and a service station in that same town also decides to sell biros. If the newsagent then decides to reduce the price of their biros, they breach the current Birdsville amendment. So not all things that happen in the Birdsville pub should be embraced by the parliament. Martin Collins in the Australian points out that the predatory pricing change was made without consultation with the business community. That would suggest that, if the previous government, led by Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello, had really been serious about making changes to support business, it would have consulted with the community and also with consumers. It is the same with every piece of media that I have looked at. The Australian Financial Review states ‘abandon all hope of discount'. Once again, the Australian Financial Review talks of ‘competition changes rile big business'. The Australian Financial Review, which I would see as the Bible of business, reports that ‘suppliers will feel the squeeze'. Finally, we see, again in the Australian Financial Review, ‘pricing reforms go too far with Fels'. The previous government let down business and consumers; but this government, through this legislation, will deliver amendments that will make for a more competitive environment and will make it work for all Australian people.",101
181,Mr BOWEN,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.26 pm)-It gives me great pleasure to sum up debate on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The passing of this bill will be a significant event in the development of trade practices law in Australia. It represents the biggest reforms to the Trade Practices Act in 22 years. I thank all honourable members who have made a contribution to this debate-the member for Shortland and all those who went before her. These reforms put beyond doubt the intention of the parliament, first expressed by Lionel Bowen in the 1986 reforms, for a strong law to deal with predatory pricing. This bill will at last deal with the problems created by the various court decisions, most notably the High Court in the Boral case of 2003. Importantly, this bill strikes the right balance. Competition law is a very nuanced thing. It is very easy to have anticompetitive consequences when you are trying to have pro-competitive results, and getting competition law just a little wrong can have very, very serious impacts throughout the economy-and I will return to this point a little later in my contribution. Importantly, this bill implements a key election commitment outlined by me in the House almost exactly 12 months ago in response to the previous government's trade practices reform bill. The two most important elements of this bill are the removal of the necessity to prove the ability to recoup losses in predatory pricing cases and the clarification of the ‘take advantage' element in the abuse of market power cases. In the Boral case, the High Court held that it would be necessary to prove that a firm would be able to recoup its losses when pricing below cost in order to damage a smaller firm. On any objective reading, in my view, the reforms that Attorney-General Bowen pushed in 1986 were designed to show the courts that it was the intention of the parliament that this would not be a relevant evidentiary burden. It is most concerning that the High Court put this evidentiary burden in these cases, although how their Honours interpret the law is up to them. But what is much more concerning is that the previous government allowed that situation to continue and did not clarify the law. As a result of that court case, the ACCC immediately dropped all the predatory pricing cases it had been working on, because it would have been a waste of taxpayers' money to continue them, as the evidentiary burden could never be met. The previous government was prepared to see the neutering of predatory pricing law in this country. The Senate Economics References Committee recommended, in 2004, that the necessity to prove the ability to recoup losses be removed, and the previous government refused to act. By requiring proof that a firm could at some time in the future recoup its losses if successful in driving a smaller firm out of operation, the previous government gave predatory pricing a green light. The ACCC has made it clear that this reform is necessary. In addition, many commentators have made this very clear. For example, Smith and Trindade put it this way: ... the High Court has introduced what amounts to a threshold dominant test and failed to provide a proper framework for distinguishing between conduct which the act is designed to foster and that which the community expects it to present. It is up to the High Court to interpret the law but it is up to the parliament to make our will clear. This amendment makes our will clear. It is four years after it should have been made clear, but we make it clear tonight. The second important reform contained in this bill is the clarification of the term ‘take advantage' in relation to taking advantage of substantial market power. On the face of it, this might not seem like such an important thing-but it certainly is important. To be found to be in breach of section 46, a firm must be found to have taken advantage of its market power. ‘Take advantage' has been defined by courts in different ways, in different cases. But most concerning is that, in the Rural Press case, the High Court defined ‘take advantage' in a very restrictive way, focusing on whether the firm in question could have undertaken the action in question in the absence of market power. Justice Kirby, in his dissent ruling, described this interpretation as being based on a ‘narrow, formalistic and substantially verbal ground'. The bill clarifies the term ‘take advantage' in a more expansive way than the High Court defined it, breaking down the other big barrier to the effectiveness of section 46 of the act. Again, this is an overdue reform. There are other less significant but still important components of this bill. It expands the information gathering powers of the ACCC and enshrines the role of the small business deputy chairman in the bill. It also adopts the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics of 2004 to give the Federal Magistrates Court some jurisdiction over section 46 cases. I do not consider it likely that many section 46 cases will be brought in the Federal Magistrates Court; nevertheless, if a small business wishes to bring a section 46 case and not leave it to the ACCC, they should have the ability to do so in a low-cost jurisdiction. The Federal Magistrates Court will retain its ability to refer complex cases to the Federal Court, and the normal limits on damages in the Federal Magistrates Court will apply. Importantly, the conciliation mechanism in the Federal Magistrates Court could be useful in assisting small business. Most small businesses, if subject to predatory pricing, simply want it to stop. They do not necessarily want to run a big, complex and expensive law case; they simply want a mechanism which helps them stop the predatory pricing from occurring. I would now like to turn to the so-called Birdsville amendment. After years of telling the Labor Party and every other commentator that there was no problem with the operation of section 46 of the act, the previous government at five minutes to midnight, with zero consultation, introduced the Birdsville amendment. It is called the Birdsville amendment because it was conceived by Senator Joyce in the Birdsville Hotel. Like the member for Shortland, I have nothing against the Birdsville Hotel-it is a lovely place-but it is not where I would write trade practices law. The amendment was rushed through by the previous government as part of a deal to secure Senator Joyce's support. There was no consultation on its effects, and it was greeted with amazement and incredulity by the vast majority of experts in competition law. The Birdsville amendment replaced market power as the threshold test in predatory pricing cases. One word can make lot of difference. Given that it was the only change that the previous government was willing to accept, the Labor Party did not oppose the change. However, at the time, we expressed our misgivings and the view that it would be much better to implement the recommendations of the numerous inquiries, implement the recommendations of the ACCC and improve the operation of market power rather than throwing market power out the window and introducing a whole new test. Now that the government is restoring substantial market power to a more appropriate test, a pre-Boral test, there is no good reason to keep the market share test. But the reasons for getting rid of the Birdsville amendment go much deeper. The Birdsville amendment, I accept, is designed to help small business. I accept that is its intention. But it could very well harm small business. There is also contained in it the potential to harm consumers. It puts Australia in breach of the OECD guidelines on the appropriate test of dominance, which is quite concerning. The OECD guidelines state: Market share data continue to be the high priest in assessing whether a firm has substantial market power. Although the limitations of market shares as a proxy of market power are widely acknowledged. Further, they state: Entry barriers are arguably the single most important factor in assessing whether a firm has substantial market power. If other firms can enter or rivals can expand, the firm will not be able to maintain market power in the long run; hence, its market power will not be durable. The market share test was ill-conceived, rushed, poorly drafted, and it creates considerable problems. By introducing a new concept into the act, it creates considerable uncertainty. I can understand the superficial attraction of market share as being a simpler dominant test-but it is far from simple. Who knows what substantial market share is? No-one from the opposition has been able to say in this debate what substantial market share would be. It could be 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent or 70 per cent. It would take years of court cases to determine what a substantial market share would be regarded as by Australian courts, and to do that would be to perpetrate a substantial disservice on Australian businesses, both big and small, and on Australian consumers. My second concern is that, by making market share the test, we will potentially be bringing into the purview of section 46 small businesses that are not meant to be in its purview. If the courts define substantial market share at a low level of, say, 20 per cent, then businesses which have a reasonably large market share, for instance, a hardware store in a small country town which has 20 per cent of the market, could be prosecuted for being in breach of the predatory pricing law. Almost every academic and expert commentator in this field agrees with the government that this is an ill-conceived clause. In fact, the only academic I can find in all my research who supports the Birdsville amendment is the one who helped Senator Joyce draft it. Not one other prominent academic in Australia supports the Birdsville amendment. I will share with the House some examples of the views of experts on the Birdsville amendment. Julie Clarke of Deakin University said that, if small business was defined, for example, at 20 per cent, which I referred to before: Small business could thus be exposed to liability was it to challenge a larger rival by aggressive and sustained price cutting. So the opposition say they are trying to help small business but, in fact, the view of a large number of expert commentators is that they could be harming small business. Arlen Duke of the University of Melbourne said: The Birdsville amendments introduced considerable uncertainty into the law by introducing the concepts of ‘substantial market share', ‘sustained period' and ‘relevant cost'. Bob Baxt, who I regard as the pre-eminent trade practices commentator in this country, said: Those who support the Birdsville amendment ignore the fundamental basis upon which competition law operates. He went on to say: The Birdsville amendment is apparently based on a simplistic and unprincipled evaluation of how competition law should operate. That is a pretty powerful indictment of the views of the previous government, the current opposition. Professor Stephen Corones, professor of law at the Queensland University of Technology, said of this government: The government is to be congratulated for attempting to fix a significant problem that is working to the detriment of Australian consumers, including small business, every day that it is on the statute books. So we have a consensus of every expert commentator in the country bar one that the Birdsville amendment is erroneous, illconceived, poorly drafted and will have adverse consequences on Australian consumers and on Australian small businesses. Not one of the written submissions to the Senate inquiry, which expressed some sympathy for the market share test, recommended that the market share test be retained at this point. When you look through those submissions, whether they be from NARGA or the Consumer Action Law Centre in Victoria, none of them said that it is urgent and important to keep the Birdsville amendment in place but rather called on the government to monitor the situation to ensure that our amendments have the desired effect. So the case for keeping the Birdsville amendment is very thin indeed. The opposition have indicated they will oppose removing the Birdsville amendment-although, I must say, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you would not know it from the shadow minister's second reading speech. I had to get to the amendment at the end before I found any reference to this bill whatsoever in his contribution. The shadow minister joins us in the House now. I must say, with due respect, that his contribution to the second reading debate was an insult to the House. To talk about the most substantial trade practices reforms in this country in 22 years, in representing the opposition, and not make one reference to those reforms in his opening remarks in this debate was an insult to the House. I gather that the opposition will be opposing the changes to the Birdsville amendment. I gather that because I have had made available to me the coalition joint party submission from the shadow minister. It is a particularly flimsy document. If I took such a submission to my caucus room, I would be laughed out of the building. This submission from the shadow minister, the member for Dickson, makes the case to the coalition joint party room that the changes to the Birdsville amendment will return a level of uncertainty to the Trade Practices Act to the detriment of small business, as the threshold test will change from market share to market power, as the definition of market power that has been defined by the High Court following the Boral case in 2003 is a very high threshold which essentially applies to only monopolists or near monopolists. So the whole basis on which the opposition has decided to oppose the removal of the Birdsville amendment is in error. The shadow minister's submission to his joint party room ignores the fact that these amendments do not return the market power test to the Boral situation but to the pre-Boral situation and that the government's amendments return the market power test to the test envisaged by Attorney-General Bowen in 1986. So I fear what we have is the opposition playing cheap politics and attempting to garner the small business lobby when every qualified academic commentator in the nation says that this has the capacity to hurt small business. It certainly has the capacity to chill competition and, over time, reduce discounting, and yet the opposition thinks it is acceptable to oppose the removal of the Birdsville amendment. I understand the politics of this are difficult. I understand there are various views in the opposition shadow cabinet and in the opposition party room. There are various views in my party room on this, but this is a matter on which you have show leadership. This is a matter on which you have to say the Birdsville amendment, which was rushed through the parliament with zero consultation as part of a cheap deal 12 months ago, simply will not work. We should stand as a parliament and say to the small business lobby, the small business groups in this country, that we are united in restoring the market power test to its proper 1986 test. That is what the opposition indicated they would do when we first announced this policy, but they backflipped. Mr Dutton-Why didn't you vote for Birdsville back in September?",104
182,Mr BOWEN,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The shadow minister asks me why I did not vote for it in September. If he had been here earlier, he would have heard me say that we supported this because that was all the previous government was prepared to do and we said at the time it would be better to adopt the recommendations of inquiry after inquiry of the ACCC. All of those submissions and all of those inquiry recommendations were completely ignored, year after year, by the previous government until five minutes to midnight, and then they introduced the Birdsville amendment with zero consultation with small or large business. At the time that was regarded as having considerable adverse impacts on competition in this country, and we still have the view that it has considerable adverse impacts on competition in this country. You do have to show leadership on this issue and that is what the government have done. We have restored the market power test to its pre-Boral position. It is an appropriate test, once those anomalies have been corrected. The opposition can continue to engage in cheap political stunts, but they do so as a disservice to small business. They create so much uncertainty that the only people who will be happy about this are the to trade practices lawyers, who will be arguing it in the High Court for years to come. They will be arguing over what substantial market share actually is; whether it is 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent or 70 per cent. The opposition are doing the small business community and consumers in Australia a considerable disservice by allowing a position to be the law of this nation which every expert commentator says will chill competition, will reduce discounting and will be a disservice to small business. The shadow minister and the opposition should hang their heads in shame.",108
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"The original question was that this bill be read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Dickson has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133 the division is deferred until after 8 pm. Debate adjourned.

The 2007 bill introduced by the coalition government was a result of the outcomes of the Little children are sacred report that followed an inquiry which involved regional mass meetings and extensive submissions. The bill was introduced to ensure the survival and development of children by protecting them from abuse and exploitation-a protection which is part of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. At no time was the bill introduced as a way of separating rights for different racial groups, as some are alluding. The bill presented to the House in 2007 was about protecting children irrespective of race or creed. The inquiry listened, learned and drew on the knowledge of others to find ways to better support the families and protect the children. I would like to congratulate the board on their handling of the inquiry and the way they created an environment which enabled people to feel safe, enabling the very painful bill and confronting truth to be exposed. A lot was learnt from 45 community visits, 65 written submissions and over 260 individual meetings. Let me say again that this is about protecting children, children who are powerless to defend or protect themselves. I find it incomprehensible that the Rudd Labor government has made amendments to the 2007 bill which will make it possible for communities in prescribed areas to have access again to R18+ material. The Little children are sacred report clearly stated that subscription based R18+ pornography provided through pay TV suppliers appeared to be easily accessible to minors. An article in the Age on Thursday, 20 September, last year stated that complaints were made by Indigenous women about adult programs on cable and free-to-air television. According to the report, it appears that the availability of pornography is a way to groom children for sex. Having worked with many families, children and adult survivors impacted by sexual abuse, let me make it clear that, if a strong stand is not taken, is exactly what will continue to happen. The amendments to the bill mean a ban would only be considered at the request of the community and, following that, there must be adequate community consultation. I support community consultation but, when this consultation has the potential to put children and women further at risk and the potential to remove protections, I have concerns. The safety of a child is far more important, and that should be the priority. I have concerns about the term ‘adequate community consultation' under the proposed new section 127B. What percentage of the community must come forward for a request for a ban to be granted? What happens if key leaders in the community who are enabling children to have access to pornographic material and grooming the children for sex threaten and bully other community members, including children, who want to come forward but cannot for fear of retribution? How long would the consultation take before an outcome regarding the ban request could be determined? Is there an appeals process? How many children will be affected because of the delay in having the ban put in place as a result of the proposed changes by the government? The damage done to these children will be significant. Part of the discussion paper entitled Youth and pornography in Australia looked at the effects on young people of being exposed to pornography. This discussion paper concluded that, when exposed to sexual content, young people had greater acceptance of pre-, extraand non-marital and recreational sexual relations, greater factual knowledge of sex and increased belief that one's peers are sexually active. When exposed to pornography, young children showed increased attitudinal support for sexual aggression, particularly in the context of this the use of violent pornography; increased likelihood of sexually aggressive, coercive or harassing behaviour, particularly in the context of high-frequency consumption of pornography or exposure to violent pornography; emotional disturbance associated with seeing non-mainstream sexual behaviours; and inappropriate acceptance of nonmainstream sexual practices. Is this what the new Labor government want for the children and young people in Indigenous communities? The next generation in these communities and their potential future will be lost. Not placing value on children and young people will have a generational impact. Also included in this discussion paper is the principle of the obscenity law which was based on the notion of harm to minors, which expressed the idea that young and impressionable minds are vulnerable to harmful thoughts which can lead to harmful acts. What is the Labor government thinking? A ban on X-rated material goes beyond subscription TV. We need to look broader than that. We need to look at future-proofing technological advancements and changes which see many pay-per-view style formats already on mobile phones or access to various X-rated material on mobile phones with internet access. Many studies have been undertaken on the commonality between children exposed to child pornography and the child's link to being sexually abused. However, there is minimal empirical research which explores the commonality between a child's exposure to adult pornography and abuse. Research must be conducted in order for us to fully understand the commonality between a child exposed to any type of pornographic material and the link to sexual abuse. It is only when research such as this is done that we as a community can truly understand the long term effects this has on a vulnerable child and what needs to be done to prevent abuse. I would suggest that such research be supported by the new government, with specific targeted funding. I strongly support the recommendation by the alternative government to amend the bill in line with the original blanket ban on all R+ rated pornography. I also call on the Australian government to support the alternative government's recommendation to amend the bill in line with the coalition's original policy, which prohibits the transportation of all pornographic material through prescribed areas. There is nothing to stop a person who does not care about what is in the best interests of children ping off in a prescribed area and providing prohibited material and then continuing on their way to an area outside the prescribed area. The inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs also found that drugs and alcohol played a major role in the abuse of children. Allowing any type of prohibited material into a prescribed area indeed opens the door for abuse. This is a risk that cannot be taken. I say again: this is about protecting children and if it means a total ban then that is what needs to happen. Over the years I have observed what I call gutless behaviour. Many families have walked through my door with children who have observed behaviour that one could not mention in this place. Other professionals have felt sympathy for the perpetrator, with no understanding of the impact of confronting unacceptable behaviour and of protecting women and children. The government wants to reinstate the permit system for major Indigenous communities and to give power to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to provide certain people with access to Aboriginal land. How will the minister know who is and who is not safe? The minister may think she has a crystal ball or some capacity to be omnipresent. I think not. Warren Mundine, a well-respected Aboriginal leader, was quoted in the Weekend Australian as saying: The permit system didn't stop crime. In fact, if you look at all of the reports that have come out in the last few years, crime has flourished under the permit system, so it's a fallacy to say that it helps law-and-order problems. He further stated, ‘It actually embedded, and will continue to embed, these problems because some powerful people were able to get away with things without being watched.' stopThis amending legislation will not reduce crime. It will enable criminal behaviour to be hidden. Many isolated communities rely on one central location for all their goods, often referred to as community stores. A number of these communities are located alongside or close to what are commonly known as roadhouses. They provide grocery items, drinks and often petrol. The Australian government has recognised the coalition government's policy on community stores. I am pleased that this policy, which formed part of the coalition's initial policy of 2007 and which ensured that a roadhouse which substantially provides a community with groceries and drinks may be licensed as a community store, is to remain. Mr Deputy Speaker, 38 per cent of the Northern Territory's Aboriginal population is under the age of 15. These children are our future and we cannot neglect them or let them down. As a nation we have a responsibility to protect our children, irrespective race or creed. I have to question how genuine the Labor government are when it comes to having the best interests of children This so-called new policy will result in behaviour currently being engaged in flowing through to the next generation. I fear that if the bill proceeds in its current form the women and children of Indigenous communities will experience another decade or longer in pain and their voices will not be heard and their tears will not be seen. The Australian dated Friday, 21 September 2007 focused on the Northern Territory intervention. Former Australian of the Year Galarrwuy Yunupingu, one of the nation's most prominent Indigenous leaders, was noted as saying that he agreed to support the then government's approach, following a discussion with the then Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough. During the discussion, it was acknowledged that the aim of the government was to improve people's lives. I have grave concerns about the proposed amendments. Instead of moving forward to improve people's lives, behaviour already hindering next generations from reaching their full potential will be systemically entrenched in communities by the failure of this Labor government to take a stand. I would like to state again the amendment put forward by the alternative government: (1) calls on the Federal Government to impose a blanket ban on all pornographic material in prescribed areas; (2) calls on the Federal Government to prohibit the transport of pornographic material through any prescribed area; and (3) urges the Federal Government to leave in place the permit system amendments that have enabled access to public land. The additional recommendations proposed of by the opposition need to be included in this bill. The welfare of these children and the future of Indigenous communities depend on at heart. doing what is right. Mr Forrest- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",109
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Is a quorum required? Mr Forrest-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker.",112
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I am afraid, Member for Mallee, there is no provision for calling a quorum between 6.30 pm and 8 pm.",112
188,Ms PLIBERSEK,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (6.58 pm)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am able to sum up for the government at this stage, but I believe that there are a couple of opposition members who are also keen to make some comments. I am not sure how strict the provision is that a quorum is not possible at this time.",112
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,I thank the minister. I understand the situation.,112
190,Mr FORREST,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Mallee) (6.59 pm)Having had only a few minutes notice that a government member is now not speaking, we are attempting to summon opposition speakers to attend the chamber. We need to organise a few minutes grace until they arrive.",112
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"May I suggest that the member for Mallee, if he knows something about this bill, might speak to it, and that way we will manage to continue the work of the chamber until the next scheduled speaker arrives.",112
192,Mr FORREST,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I thank you for that opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very mindful of the challenges confronting the nation with respect to meeting the very serious needs of our Indigenous communities. Mallee, of course, has a huge number of Indigenous constituents on its roll and there are equal challenges confronting us in meeting their needs. The situation is nowhere near as serious as it is in the remote communities we see in the Northern Territory, in Queensland and in Western Australia, but it very much assists me to be mindful of their needsparticularly in the community of Robinvale. That is a community of around 4,000 people and it has a very cosmopolitan population. Its main economic activity is associated with horticulture. We have a very strong table grape industry associated with Robinvale. I would thank you for any assistance with regard to being relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker.",113
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,The member for Mallee can be assured that I will be fairly liberal in my interpretation of relevance at the moment.,113
194,Mr FORREST,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Thank you very much. It is a community that I am immensely proud of, but the challenges are immense. Even in a community like Robinvale, which has access to all the support services that a bill like this addresses, the associated difficulties are very much the same. I watched with interest the discussion that the former government had with regard to the intervention and activity, and I am very pleased that the new government has taken it up in a non-partisan way. It was complemented by the very momentous events we saw in this chamber, with the apology to Aboriginal Australians. What that has done for my own communities is to remove what used to be an excuse-that mainstream Australia had not recognised the real root of their many social challenges and they tended to lean on that to some extent. I now say to my Aboriginal communities, whose leadership I do admire, that there is no longer an excuse. We are now in genuine partnership. That particular difficulty we had as a nation is now behind us, and I challenge the Indigenous leadership within my own constituency now to work together and not make excuses. For example, the government recently announced that it would introduce a guest worker program associated with the Polynesian nations. I know that Robinvale and all the other horticultural communities along the Murray Valley strongly support that concept because of their need for labour. It was suggested by Warren Mundine, a very strong Aboriginal leader, on my local radio station that we should include a program similar to this for Indigenous Australians. I immediately agreed with him, live on radio, and invited him to come and see me so that we could work together. There is no better way to lift the esteem of any individual-no matter what their circumstances-than to give them full-time employment. They feel that they are making a contribution, that they are accepting their mutual obligation and, whilst they might still need other measures of support to assist them, there is no better way to lift a person's self-esteem. I will be looking forward to where this new legislation takes us. I am hoping that all the errors of the past can now be forgiven and put behind us and that we can work in a determined way towards a program to meet these enormous challenges. The Indigenous constituents I represent have my respect and admiration. I remember when I was a local government councillor on the Swan Hill City Council, in my formative political years, I was the portfolio councillor for Aboriginal affairs. At that time Swan Hill's Indigenous population would have been close to 800. If they are listening now, hope that I have earned their respect and that they will be willing to work with me as their local member to make sure their needs are met. I do thank you for your considerable indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. Ms Plibersek- Mr Deputy Speaker, I was wondering whether the member for Mallee has ever visited the Northern Territory and what his impressions were of the Northern Territory when he was there.",113
195,Mr FORREST,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I thank the member for Sydney for that question. Yes, I have. I remember at the election of the coalition into government in 1996 I was nominated as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. At that time the former government had been conducting an inquiry into Aboriginal health and we as a new government wanted to continue that inquiry. In fact, it continued over another term of government, because it was like a work in progress. I was deeply struck by those visits to those remote communities. I can remember the member for Scullin and I-I think at that stage he may have been deputy chair-were in a remote Aboriginal community in northern South Australia. We had our accommodation organised and early in the morning I went for a walk and I found the member for Scullin, who is now the Speaker of this great debating chamber. We were both deeply moved by what we were seeing and we made a determined effort to do what we could to progress the issues, like health issues that are eminently preventable, based on very simple concepts of hygiene, emotional status and so forth. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have managed to pad out the time. The relevant member to speak is now present in the chamber.",114
196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Before I call the member for I Flinders, I must say that I am sure that the House is grateful for the contribution that the member for Mallee made on this debate.",114
197,Mr HUNT,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I extend my congratulations to the member for Mallee. His is a contribution with which I associate myself fully and I commend his words. In rising to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008, I wish to start with some of my own experiences in the Northern Territory and in Indigenous communities around Australia. These are communities for which the old Dickensian line ‘these are the best of times and these are the worse of times' is the prime model. In my former role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, I was fortunate to have had responsibility for Indigenous protected areas. As I visited these Indigenous protected areas, as well as the community surrounding Uluru, which is the Mutitjulu community, I saw Indigenous communities which were successful-albeit imperfect but which were models for community development, models for the way in which we would hope an Indigenous society could progress-and I also saw examples of societies which represented many of the great disappointments which people on both sides of this chamber share in relation to Indigenous communities. Let me start on the positive side. In Arnhem Land, in particular the Gove or Nhulunbuy area, I visited Yirrkala and, near to Yirrkala, the Indigenous protected areas of Dhimurru and Laynhapuy. What I saw in those communities was a model of self-help. In these communities there was a level of discipline and purpose which was in part derived from the Indigenous rangers programs that accompanied Indigenous protected areas. These programs represent the best of what we seek to achieve in working with Indigenous communities in Australia. At the time. I wrote pieces for the lian and other forums where I set out the notion that the Indigenous protected areas model-in particular, the Indigenous ranger model-is a way forward for giving Indigenous communities a sense of purpose, meaningful work through connection with the land, training which is relevant to young children in those communities from an early age and a way forward right from the outset. I think that is a model that must be long term and that accompanies all of the elements which we sought to implement through the intervention in the Northern Territory. On the other hand, at Mutitjulu, for example-and I say this with a heavy heart, not with any condemnation-on the edge of Uluru, the community there has suffered. I say this because the women of that community asked me to speak up at the time and asked me to speak up on subsequent occasions. They said to me that, yes, there were positive examples but, more importantly, there was a systemic flaw in that community. That was the systemic flaw which, in many cases, saw alcohol abuse, petrol sniffing, ganja and other forms of illicit drugs as the staples of day-today existence for young people and, in large part, for the adult male community. There were many, many dysfunctional males and the impact on that community and on each of those individual lives was tragic. They talked to me about the problems of not only drugs but also pornography and, most importantly, the sexual abuse of young children, of minors and even of young women of age. This was said with a great and heavy heart. Of course, through the parks authority at the time, all steps were taken for immediate action, but it was an example of the very reason behind the intervention in the Northern Territory. It is why I supported the intervention wholeheartedly Austra- and with every fibre of my being. The intervention was not about some sort of heavy-handed colonialism, as some would present it, but about the chance for these communities to break out of a stunningly vicious cycle. It was about the chance for many of these Indigenous communities to move away from a failed and, in my view, catastrophic system. Perhaps most importantly, it was about giving a chance to younger people who, as reported in the Little children are sacred report, had been made vulnerable to the most horrific of circumstances. That situation, of course, has the universal condemnation of everybody within this House and all right-minded and rightthinking people within Australia. There is no question or debate about that. Some will question the approach-and that is their right, their duty and their responsibility-but it is an approach which, having met with the women of Mutitjulu and having met with those in other communities which were more successful, I believe was the right approach. I believe that, to the extent that this bill waters down many of those elements, it is making a mistake. I am not some great moralist in relation to many of these issues. I try to recognise that there are different views within our society and people have a right to take different approaches, even on things with which I personally disagree. But in relation, firstly, to the question of pornographic materials, I think that this bill sadly and misguidedly waters down the protections which were put in place in the initial intervention. That was a careful approach. It was a considered approach. I believe that this bill puts in the hands of those who are most likely to perpetuate the abuse the ability to ride roughshod over a community and to reinforce that abuse. That, I believe, is a fundamental flaw. It a reason why we must have serious reservations, because it empowers the very people, in my view, who have previously misused that power. It perpetuates a structure within a community which of itself is dangerous and damaging, given the nature and vulnerability of the community, and it perpetuates a power imbalance and reinforces that imbalance within that community. So I respectfully take issue and disagree with some of the changes made there. In my view, they are inappropriate. There are many other elements, but I wanted to speak firstly about the broad concept of the intervention and secondly about a way forward. For me the positive way forward is about the expansion and development of Indigenous protected areas-or, as some have called them, Indigenous national parks-and in addition to that the allied principle of Indigenous ranger programs. I mentioned those at the outset, but for me these programs are a fundamentally important part of the next five, 10, 20 and 30 years within the Indigenous landscape. My view is that the Indigenous ranger program teaches respect for the land and respect for the culture and gives people hard-work skills. Let me give an example. In Dhimurru and Laynhapuy in the Nhulunbuy area, south-west of Yirrkala in the Blue Mud Bay area, there are turtle recovery programs, dugong recovery programs, feral animal eradication programs and landscape protection programs. This is real and meaningful work which begins with junior rangers, moves through those programs, gives people training and certification and ultimately, I believe, gives people the full status and the opportunity to have a lifelong career as practical land managers-as fully equipped, coached, trained and prepared park rangers-but over their own land. That long-term is approach is not the answer in and of itself. It is no substitute for law or for health, but it provides a fundamental sense of community development. One of the other areas of discussion and concern is urban communities. Let me deal for a little while, because I have been looking for the opportunity to speak on this, with urban Indigenous communities in Australia. Having spent some time in my own area of Flinders with the Bunurong people, and in particular those folks who have lived on the Mornington Peninsula and in towns such as Hastings and Rosebud, there is a sense that Indigenous identity is lost in these urban communities. Of course, there is an age-old debate with regard to assimilation versus identity. I am one who strongly believes that, where Indigenous people are either forced or caused to lose their identity, there is a great sense of resentment. So we need to twin mainstream education in the urban environment with a sense of pride in Indigenous origin and heritage. On that front, I want to commend two programs to this House. The first is in relation to the developments which are ongoing at Point Nepean on the Mornington Peninsula. I put this in the context of protecting families through the objectives, goals and aspirations within this bill. At Point Nepean on the Mornington Peninsula, we have set up on what was formerly Defence and quarantine land a long-term program to work firstly on marine education but secondly on Indigenous education. The former government funded students, in particular primary and secondary students, to do heritage training on land which it is believed has some of the most significant artefacts in all of Victoria. This land has become an iconic site. It is a unique opportunity to twin the needs of Indigenous communities with those of the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria and Australia more generally. I say that because what we have here is a parallel program in which there is an interchange. On the one hand you have the National Centre for Coasts and Climate, which is to be run by the University of Melbourne to engage in the study of the land and the coast. On the other hand you have a long-term objective of an Indigenous studies centre, alongside and in collaboration and cooperation. What does that mean in practice? It means that young people who are from the Indigenous community will come from the Mornington Peninsula to do training and study in Indigenous heritage on their own lands, in their own area, with pride in what they are doing. This bill is primarily about the Indigenous communities of remote and rural Australia, but it is only part of the story. second part, of course, is the urban communities. The first of the ideas around the urban communities is, as I say, this notion of parallel study and development that we have seen at Point Nepean. Carolyn Briggs of the Bunurong has been an extremely important person in driving forward this project. Why has she been important? She was one of the first to identify the absolutely critical historical artefacts and the relevance of Point Nepean to the Indigenous people not just of the Mornington Peninsula but of Victoria and Australia more generally. I commend her work. She drove the establishment of an Indigenous studies centre as part of the work at Point Nepean. I say to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Glyn Davis: if you take the work that Melbourne university is doing and provide specific places for Indigenous primary and secondary students, in conjunction with the tertiary students, so as to help train and teach and use the honour that has been given to the university, if you give that same opportunity to the primary and secondary Indigenous students of the Mornington Peninsula, that will be a great service in terms of training and also in building identity and pride. I also mentioned that there is a second urban element in my own area on the Mornington Peninsula that is providing a way forward by giving Indigenous students a sense of pride in their culture through what they do with their communities. We have to move away from the situation that I have seen in Hastings, Rosebud and Tootgarook, where, in some circumstances, there is a downwards spiral of alienation and disenfranchisement which comes about from a lack of work. This lack of work for the parents has been perpetuated through the generations. We need to focus very closely on the idea of targeted work and education programs over two genThe erations simultaneously. For the parents, we have to focus on the work now in the Indigenous urban environment, and we have to give the children a sense of culture. I want to give an example that I have seen of the training of young kids on the New South Wales coast. They are going through an urban junior rangers program, giving them Indigenous education coupled with a sense of pride and a sense that they could have lifelong work. I thank the House for this opportunity to talk about what I have been working on for a reasonable period now-the urban work, which is the corollary to the rural work. I commend the communities of the Bunurong people on the Mornington Peninsula. I recognise the challenge. They have made great strides, and I am delighted that they will be able to participate in the Point Nepean program. But I do know that we need to help with work opportunities and with the sense, for young people still at primary and secondary school, that they cannot be caught in a cycle of lifelong unemployment.",114
198,Mr SLIPPER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"It is obvious in 2008 that, regardless nic origin, one ought to be entitled to certain basic rights. The LNP, when in office prior to the last election, took a very important step forward with respect to intervening in the Northern Territory to guarantee Indigenous Australians who live in the Territory rights that other Australians regularly have. I am pleased tonight to have the opportunity of joining in the debate on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008. This bill makes amendments to two pieces of legislation that were introduced year for the purpose of affording improved protection for Indigenous children in the Northern Territory of Australia. The Liberal-National Party government introduced restrictions and tougher guidelines to act as an improved safety barrier against the exploitation of Indigenous people and, specifically, Indigenous children. These measures were designed to assist the communities of the Northern Territory, but, sadly, the changes in this bill proposed by the government tend to undermine those very important reforms. The bill suggests a watering down of the strict conditions proposed by the Liberal-National Party government in relation to the broadcasting into these communities of pay TV programming that has an R18+ classification. The LNP team introduced legislation that banned pay TV pornography-an important restriction that aimed to help to prevent situations that we have read about in the media in which young children are exposed to sexually explicit programming in order to desensitise them and to groom them for sexual abuse. No-one on any side of the parliament would support such action. It is well known that those who are mistreated in this way when they are young are highly likely to have problems when they are older and quite often become of one's eth- abusers themselves. The widespread ban on pornographic programming has a sensible and long-reaching benefit, a benefit that would actually reach through time and offer protection to potential victims who may not even have been born yet by helping to break the chain of abuse that is often handed down from one generation to the next, often through explicit videos and TV programs. However, this bill which we are debating tonight-the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) last Bill 2008-modifies that ban so that it becomes only a partial ban. The changes in this bill mean that pornographic pay TV programming will only be restricted to the community at its request. Unfortunately, this opens the doors for communities to allow pornography, with decisions on this issue quite possibly to be made by those who have little regard for the safety and health of the children. The Liberal-National Party is concerned that there is little detail about any appeals processes that are available to those members of the community who are opposed to any decision to allow the R18+ programming. The bill goes further, sadly, in that it removes a total ban on the transporting of banned material through certain prescribed areas. This is a ban that could be regarded as the ultimate of safeguards against pornography and other banned products in that it helps prevent such items falling off the back of a truck in an area in which they are deemed to be unwanted and unhelpful. I would argue strongly that that would be in all areas. The provisions of this bill allow certain items to be transported through a restricted area if they are proven to have as their final destination a location that is not within the restricted, prescribed area. The change is akin to introducing a physical loophole that may result in restricted and banned material in fact finding its way into communities that would otherwise have bans in place. These two changes outlined above do not assist in the overall aim of affording protection to the most vulnerable in Indigenous communities. Thirdly, this bill reintroduces a requirement for permits to be acquired before access can be gained for certain areas of significant land. The previous Liberal-National Party government had reduced the restrictions for access for some 0.2 per cent of Aboriginal land, or about 1/500th of that land. Permits were no longer required for larger public townships, connecting road corridors and common land in the community. The list of people who were allowed into and allowed to remain on Aboriginal land was increased, and the Liberal-National Party government introduced a ministerial power to allow authority to be given to a specified person. legislation also ensured that sacred sites those covered by leases remained protected and that cultural ceremonies were afforded appropriate restrictions and safeguards. Sadly, the changes provided for in the bill before the chamber repeal that permit system and reintroduce the restrictions for access the land. This comes in the light of a discusdoes sion paper released by Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs that suggests that the restricted access supported by the permit system has not prevented abuse, violence and drug trafficking in these communities. There are suggestions that the permit system helped to close the communities to certain levels of outside scrutiny. Finally, the bill enacts an initiative that mirrors exactly a policy initiative of the government of last year, in which roadhouses could be recognised as community stores in those areas in which local community members rely substantially on the roadhouse for groceries, drinks and other essential items. This is a sensible initiative in that it improves the convenience for those who live in remote regions and do not have the same ready access to shopping centres and grocery stores that is taken for granted in other parts of Australia. The LNP suggest a second reading amendment to this bill to maintain the blanket ban on pornographic pay TV programming, keep the blanket ban on the transport of prohibited items through restricted areas and maintain the LNP initiative regarding permits. We do, however, support the provisions to recognise roadhouses as community stores. We cannot support the bill, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams-as you yourself would understand-unless this amendment is accepted.",118
199,Mr LINDSAY,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I will be speaking on a matter similar to this The later on tonight in the Main Committee, but and in a wider context. As many of you will know, I have 8,000 Indigenous people on the electoral roll in my electorate, and I have moved very widely in the Indigenous community. I have Palm Island, which is in the Guinness book of records as the world's to most dangerous place, in my electorate. It not deserve that title, but it has it nevertheless. Over the years I have come to despair about Indigenous Australia. I applaud what the Howard government has done and what the Rudd government is continuing on with as an effort to make a difference, because, if we do not make a difference, we will come back here in 100 years time and find that nothing has changed in Indigenous Australia. LNP That would be a crying shame. I was somewhat distressed by some comments made yesterday by the retiring Governor General, because I do not quite agree with what he has said in relation to the status of Indigenous communities. I do not agree that we are doing enough, and I do not agree that Indigenous Australia is doing enough to help itself. I will outline my views on that later this ning. I support the opposition's second reading amendment on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008. It is made for the right reasons. It is made in the interests of Indigenous Australia. I would hope that the government would find its way to be able to support that amendment as well.",119
200,Ms PLIBERSEK,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (7.34 pm)-I am here representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, summing up the debate on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008. I would comment that, in the contributions that I have listened to this evening, I am very commitment. happy with the generally bipartisan attitude that most speakers have taken. I would particularly like to reassure the member for Flinders, who mentioned Indigenous rangers, that in fact there is a $90 million measure in the May budget for employing 300 additional Indigenous rangers to protect and manage the environment as part of the $2.2 billion Caring for our Country initiative. There has also been a tripling of funding for Indigenous protected areas, investing $50 million over the next five years, also through the Caring for our Country initiative. I thought I had also better reassure the members for Greenway and Fisher that their concerns are unwarranted when it comes to rolling back protections against R18+ material. In fact, this legislation strengthens protections in those communities. This consolidation bill makes changes to the legislative framework of the Northern Territory emerevegency response. In particular, it implements the government's election commitment in relation to the permit system for major communities in the Northern Territory and extends the pornography measure. Whereas the previous government enacted provisions to abolish the requirement for people to obtain permits before they visited Aboriginal communities, the Rudd government believes that these provisions do not in fact contribute to the emergency response. Those provisions would actually make it easier for drugs and alcohol to enter communities, a view supported by the Northern Territory Police Association. The government believes that Indigenous people, like other Australians, should be able to decide who can enter their land. We made an election commitment to revoke the public access permit changes legislated by the previous government, and this bill gives effect to that The power of the minister to authorise people to enter Aboriginal land will also be clarified by this bill. After the bill is passed, the government will, through a ministerial authorisation, ensure that journalists can access communities for the purpose of reporting on events in local communities. We have been liaising with land councils and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance on the conditions which will apply. The government has tabled two further amendments to the permit scheme. Following a suggestion by the minor parties in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the bill, the government has agreed to make explicit in the legislation that the minister may not authorise entry to a sacred site under the ministerial authorisation power. The government has also agreed with a request from the Northern Territory government to extend the existing exemption from permit requirements for candidates for federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections to include candidates for local government elections. This amendment will facilitate the upcoming elections for the new shire arrangements in the Northern Territory. The 2007 legislation included prohibitions on the possession, control and supply of certain pornographic material in prescribed areas. The Little children are sacred report mentioned a further area of concern expressed by Aboriginal people in this area. This related to R-rated material that is available through pay television subscriptions. This bill now amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 to address that concern. A new class licence condition will be established to prevent subscription television narrowcasting service licensees from providing subscribers in a community declared by the Indigenous affairs minister with access to a subscription television narrowcasting service declared by the communications minister. Only services that transmit more than 35 per cent of R18+ program-hours over a seven-day period can be declared for this purpose. Communities cannot have their access to the television service restricted unless they are in prescribed areas under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 and the Indigenous affairs minister is satisfied, following proper consultation, that it would be appropriate for the service to be restricted. Consistent with the 2007 pornography amendments, this arrangement will include a five-year sunset provision. The government has tabled amendments to the banning of Rrated pay television to make minor workability improvements recommended by the industry and raised by the Senate community affairs committee. The amendments cut red tape by allowing industry to self-declare an R-rated service and improve the recordkeeping requirements. A further measure in the bill will amend the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 to permit the transportation of prohibited pornographic material through a prescribed area to a destination outside the prescribed area. These amendments ensure greater consistency with the alcohol bans and are intended to allow industry members to transport goods lawfully in the conduct of their business to areas that are not prescribed. An offence for possession or supply would not apply if the person proves that the material was brought into the prescribed area for the sole purpose of transporting it to a place outside the prescribed area. Consequential amendments are also made to the seizure provisions in the pornography prohibition legislation. These amendments will provide that prohibited material will not be seized if the material is only being transported through a prescribed area. However, if the material is seized, it can be returned to the owner if the material is not prohibited material or is only being transported through the prescribed area. The last measure in the bill refines the new community stores and licensing regime which is designed to ensure that community stores meet minimum standards and to provide assurance that stores have the capacity to participate in income management. If a community substantially relies on a roadhouse in a remote area for grocery items and drinks, the roadhouse should be able to be part of the scheme applying to community stores. This will enable the roadhouse to be properly treated as a community store in having to meet the new licensing standards. Otherwise, roadhouses will continue not to be regarded as community stores. Finally, I make some observations about aspects of the 2007 legislation. As has been made clear, notably by the Prime Minister at the beginning of the new parliament, the government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on life expectancy, educational achievement and employment opportunities. The government is keen to work in partnership with Indigenous communities and the Northern Territory government to tackle the problems of child abuse and improve the prospects of Indigenous children and their families. We are also committed to evidence based policy. We have commissioned an independent review of the Northern Territory emergency response for completion by the end of September 2008, to determine whether the response is improving education, health and employment outcomes. The existing legislation for the Northern Territory emergency response contains provisions for income management, changes to land and housing arrangements, improving law and order and improving the safety and well-being of children and their families. The legislation also contains provisions which deem the measures to be special measures and exclude them from the operation of part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Given our commitment to maintaining the overall direction of the emergency response until the completion of the review, and to focus on effective implementation, the bill contains some amendments to existing measures which continue to be covered by the operation of the racial discrimination provisions in the legislation for the Northern Territory emergency response. Importantly, the bill contains no new provisions which exclude the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. The new R18+ measures have been designed as special measures and do not have a provision excluding the operation of part II of the Racial Discrimination Act. We will give further consideration to the racial discrimination provisions in the legislation enacted by the previous government following the independent and transparent review of the Northern Territory emergency response. The opposition's decision to oppose the legislation is further evidence of their continuing subjugation to ideology over clearheaded analysis. In contrast, we are committed to evidence based policy which focuses clearly on what works. We are committed to the fundamental objective of the emergency response, which is improving the life chances of residents in remote communities, particularly women and children. This bill is designed to advance those objectives.",120

202,Mr TRUSS,HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY,"The Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 seeks to include the horse industry as a party to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, EADRA, of 2002. It proposes a mechanism for collecting a levy from the horse industry so that industry can participate in the emergency animal disease response arrangements and contribute financially as its obligations may arise. The Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement was put in place in 2002 as an agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and territories, and peak livestock industry councils. EADRA replaced the old Commonwealth-states cost-sharing agreement and it provided a role for industry in disease eradication responses not only in a financial capacity-by sharing the costs of that work-but also by giving them a seat around the table when important decisions were being made about the nature of a response to any kind of disease outbreak. The negotiations to put in place this agreement were very extensive. I happened to have the privilege of being the minister at the time, and I can vouch for the fact that those negotiations were conducted in good spirit, with a consciousness right around the nation that there needed to be improvements to the way in which state, territory and Commonwealth governments responded to disease outbreaks and the way in which the industry was involved in that process. We needed a better way to address the diseases which also recognised the shared responsibilities that industry and governments had for these kinds of incidents. The real purpose of the discussions and the negotiations was to concentrate less on who was to blame for an outbreak and more on how we could respond promptly and appropriately to deliver the best possible outcomes. Of course, the decisions that need to be made about a disease outbreak vary. Sometimes it is possible to intervene early and eradicate a disease or pest which has entered the country, and that is clearly the best possible outcome in the event of such an incident. But in some cases it is very difficult indeed to combat a disease once it has entered the country, and a decision might be made that the economic benefits do not justify a large-scale-or even, for that matter, a small-scale-intervention. We have had some remarkable success stories in Australia in relation to the elimination of diseases, both in the plant sector and in the animal industry. There have been occasions when the experts have suggested it could not be done, but there was a sufficient determination to do it and we have been successful. An obvious example of that is the papaya fruit fly outbreak in North Queensland. I think few would have believed it was possible to eradicate a fruit fly once it had entered the country but, with some of the new technology that was available, that effort was successful. It is a real credit to the industry and to the science in Australia that that objective was achieved. More recently and freshest in people's memories is the equine influenza outbreak. Again, many thought that it would be impossible to eliminate this disease, but, in a time much shorter than most of those with expertise in the field thought possible, that disease has in fact been eradicated. From time to time we will have diseases come into this country, and we will need to respond and decide the best way in which to deal with the issues. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes it will not be practical for one reason or another to eradicate the disease or a decision will be made that the economic benefits do not justify the effort. But, in cases, our pestand disease-free status, wherever it exists, is a precious asset and we want to maintain it wherever we can. I will always be an advocate of having a go at getting rid of a pest or disease if there is a modicum of scientific evidence that it is achievable. We should try, put in a maximum effort and endeavour to achieve the objective. Perhaps one example of a pest that has been more difficult than anticipated to eradicate is the fire ant in Queensland. In fact, I suspect that if the other states and even the Commonwealth knew how difficult and costly that exercise would end up becoming, we may not have started it in the first place. But the Queensland minister of the day was very persuasive; he was on television very regularly telling everybody what he was achieving. As the minister at the time, he copped a fair bit of criticism from his state colleagues because they were bearing a share of that cost. But, in the end, the decision was made that we would proceed and, whilst the fire ant has not yet been eradicated, substantial progress has been made. I think most believe now that it is at least possible and that the investment made to date needs to be extended. There are examples of Australia leading the world in successfully eradicating disease. We should be proud of that. There are occasions when we have been successful where others have failed. Part of our capacity to deal with some of these issues is to do with the quality of our science, but I think, particularly over recent years, there has also been a much better spirit of cooperation between the states, the Commonwealth and industry to achieve that objective. Often there had been an unwillingness by various states-particularly as you go back over past decades, when a lot of these issues were other wholly state responsibilities-to work constructively together; therefore, these eradication campaigns would inevitably fail. Frankly, pests and diseases do not know state boundaries. If they are carried in the wind, they can be across a couple of states in a relatively short period of time. For that reason, there does need to be a national focus and a national effort to address these issues. The Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement was negotiated with the goal of establishing a mechanism to facilitate rapid responses for the control and eradication of or the containment of certain animal diseases, with the costs for the response then shared between governments and industries according to a formula based on economic and other benefits from the eradication. These formulae have often also been the subject of some degree of criticism and controversy; that is not surprising. Indeed, there will be ongoing debate about how the cost should be weighted in particular instances. Clearly, in some instances, the major beneficiary of the elimination of a disease is the industry itself. But, in some instances, the industry has little to lose from the introduction of a disease and the real impact falls on other sectors of our biological diversity or, for that matter, the national economy. In those cases, it is reasonable that governments bear a bigger share of the eradication costs. I think the principle behind both the animal disease eradication program and the plant eradication program is very worthwhile. Both of these programs depend upon a mechanism being in place, in the event there is a cost to be met, to collect the industry's share through some kind of levy arrangement. In fact, again, if I may revert to my time as minister, I always encouraged industries in good times to put aside a bit of money-kick their levy into place-so that they would have a little bit of a fighting fund for when an outbreak of a disease occurred. Once a disease outbreak occurs, particularly if it is a large-scale event, the industry will be in a weakened state financially at the very time it is expected to collect levies to pay off its share of the costs. So I think the idea of developing reserve funds is a sound one. I regret the fact that more industries have not taken up the opportunity that is provided under both of these programs to have in place some kind of funding that they can use in the event there is an outbreak of disease. This particular bill is about the way in which the horse industry should be involved in the disease eradication program. The Australian Horse Industry Council, Harness Racing Australia and the Australian Racing Board are the peak horse industry representative bodies; they are the horse industry bodies that are eligible to become signatories to EADRA. Upon commencement of EADRA in 2002, the Australian Horse Industry Council was unable to secure a suitable mechanism to raise funds to cover potential liabilities; thus, it is not currently a party to the agreement. So, whilst there was a degree of support for the industry to be involved, those organisations were not able to agree on an appropriate mechanism. I think it is beyond doubt that the horse industry should be in EADRA; I think the industry itself recognises that it should be there. The EI outbreak is a demonstration of how it is important for this sector to be a of a disease eradication program. But this bill is not about whether the horse industry should be in EADRA; it is about the way in which its levy should be collected-and that is what is controversial. The mechanism proposed by this bill for collecting the horse levy has not been warmly received by the industry, and the coalition will be opposing the bill for that reason. We support the involvement of the horse industry in disease eradication programs, but there must be a levy collection system which is fair and equitable and has the overwhelming support of the horse owners who would become liable to pay any future levy. The bill gives no weighting to the potential risk of outbreak of disease applicable to each sector of the Australian horse industry or, for that matter, their capacity to pay. There is potentially a higher risk associated with the thoroughbred sector. This is associated with imported racehorses and shuttle stallions with the mandatory requirement for live joining as opposed to domestic-use-only horses. Despite the potential risk of exotic disease introduction and spreading being higher with the number of movements, both internationally and domestically, associated with the racing industries, the bill proposes that all registered horses be subject to an equal levy. The RIRDC did some research on horse numbers in Australia and concluded that there are about 1.2 million. Of those, around 300,000 are feral horses. I am not sure who should be responsible for paying the levy on feral horses, but I suggest that it would be rather difficult to collect, as the responsibility, if it were to belong to anyone, would rest with state governments, who generally pasture these horses on national parks or state reserves and the like. We should not overlook, however, the significance of feral horses in any disease eradipart cation program-and that applies not just to the horse industry; it is equally true of wild pigs or other wild animals, which can, indeed, be significant conveyers of disease across the country. Had EI, for instance, escaped into the feral horse population, we would have had an uncontrollable problem. I wonder why, therefore, we do not make a greater effort to eradicate many of these feral animals-feral horses and, in particular, feral pigs. They are destructive to our environment and are often enemies of our native wildlife. For that reason, they have little value in the order of things in our environment. I think that, whilst it is a totally rate issue from the bill we are debating today, there does need to be a much more enthusiastic effort, at both the state level and the local level, to get rid of some of these feral animals. Of the 1.2 million horses in Australia, the total number of horse registrations a year, including pony club registrations, is estimated to be between 50,000 and 60,000. In the 2005-06 breeding season, 29,070 thoroughbred mares produced 17,854 foals, of which 13,618 were registered. Considering that there are 1.2 million horses in Australia, the fact that so few were registered demonstrates what a small proportion of the horse population would be covered by the mechanisms proposed in this bill. Something like 20 per cent of the total number of horses registered nationally are coming from the largest commercial group in the Australian horse industry and yet many other parts of the sector would not be picked up at all by the mechanisms proposed in this bill. An analysis of total horse registrations veals that the majority of horse registrations-approximately 80 per cent-are with breed associations or pleasure performance riding groups, such as pony clubs, cutting, reining and campdrafting et cetera. The unfairness of these bills is demonstrated by the fact that 80 per cent of the levy collected would come not from the upper end of the industry-the thoroughbred producers or breeders-but from pony clubs, pleasure and performance horse owners and families that own just one horse. They would be paying 80 per cent of the total levy collection. I have already mentioned that the levy collection itself would cover only a very small proportion of the horse population. So this bill will place a heavy load on just one small sector of the horse owners of Australia. Let me point out another anomaly in the levy arrangements proposed by the governsepament. The levy would pick up certain thoroughbreds, quarter horses and horses of breed societies et cetera; it would pick up horses that are registered with these groups. However, most of these groups have international registries. So you could simply avoid the levy by registering your Australian born horse in a register somewhere in another part of the world, and there would be economic benefits in so doing. It will be easy for horse owners to get around their levy obligations by registering their animals in another part of the world. The legislation that we have before us is fundamentally defective because it fails to place the burden on the industry equally. It leaves loopholes that will enable most horse owners, except those who own their horse for pleasure purposes, to avoid the arrangements that are proposed to be put in place. It is an ineffective mechanism and, for that reason, it cannot be supported. The government has claimed that the three peak national horse representative bodies support the passage of this bill, but that is not re- really correct. The president of the thoroughbred breeders association, in a letter to the minister on 13 August 2008, said: TBA supports passage of the bill through the parliament in the spring session on the understanding that the government will consult with industry to establish a fair and equitable registration scheme to ensure the burden of the levy does not fall on too few horse sectors. The reality is that that has not happened, because this bill places the burden on a restricted part of the horse industry. Mr Burke-They're not one of the three bodies",123
203,Mr TRUSS,HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY,"I will get to the others. This is conditional support at the very best. It depends upon the government reviewing the collection method-the purpose of the billto make it fairer and more equitable. AHIC has written in support of the bill, even though many of their member organisations strongly oppose it. An AHIC survey of their member organisations, reported in July 2008, found that, while the majority of respondents supported the industry becoming a signatory to EADRA, the proposed collection method based on horse registration was not supported. Again, the basic fundamental of the bill was not supported by the peak industry organisations. Individual AHIC members have also expressed strong opposition to the bill. In fact, as little as two out of 16 of their member organisations have indicated support, and both of those have ways in which they can get around paying their fees. They can register their horses internationally and, therefore, avoid their obligations to the Australian levy arrangements. The Queensland Horse Council general meeting on 15 July 2008 passed the following motion: The QC is not in favour of signing an emergency disease response agreement or committing to any associated levy at this time. The National Campdraft Council of Australia opposes the signing of EADRA due to the financial impost that would be placed upon their members. Pleasure horses and hobby horses are not the industry. The industry, in this instance, is those who support them-such as the farriers, the feed suppliers, the vets, the events operators and the track equipment suppliers. They would be the ones who would probably bear the greatest financial burden under any disease outbreak. The recent EI outbreak highlighted that EI caused significant social disruption as well as economic impacts. The EI outbreak also highlighted the inequities inherent in the government's proposed collection methodology. The Callinan report found that, while the cause of the EI outbreak could not be definitively determined, the most likely cause was a failing within quarantine processes. Under the proposed bill, 80 per cent of the cost to industry of the EI outbreak would have been passed to the pleasure performance and hobby sector, with only 20 per cent to the racing sector, and most horses in Australia would not be covered by the levy collection arrangements at all. The pleasure performance and hobby sector, as the minister would well know, were somewhat critical of the assistance measures that were provided to the industry following the EI outbreak and also of the emphasis that was placed on the racing sector when it came to introducing vaccines to eliminate the disease. So priority for eradicating the disease was given to a sector that will contribute a very small proportion of the levy income. It can also be strongly argued that some sectors of the industry have a greater capacity to pay than others. We would all recognise that people who own a pony for their children often have a much lower capacity to pay than those in the multimillion-dollar horse racing and thoroughbred breeding sector. This is a major industry. I think it employs 80,000 people. So it has substantial substance. It is one of the great Australian industries. Yet it would contribute the same amount per horse as someone who owns a pet pony. I do not think that those sorts of arrangements can be characterised as being fair. We have learnt a lot from the EI outbreak, but I do not think that, with this legislation, the government has learnt from that experience. The legislation was brought in some little time ago and, correctly, the government delayed the debate until after the Callinan report. But there have been no changes to the bill as a result of the Callinan report and, clearly, the issues associated with the way in which the levy is to be collected have not been resolved. The government's only action was for the minister to write to the horse owners on 11 June, where he directly threatened horse owners by refusing further assistance in the event of a disease outbreak such as EI if the industry failed to sign up to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement. Let me repeat again: I think the industry should be in the agreement, like all other sectors that may face a disease entry at some time. They should be in there, but the mechanism to collect the levy has got to be seen to be fair and equitable. I do not think that what is being proposed in this legislation enjoys any of those characteristics. It is for that reason that the opposition will not be supporting the bill. Instead, it will be our plan in the Senate to refer this matter for ther investigation. We want to look particularly at the level of support for the proposed collection mechanism within industry groups. We need to investigate alternative levy collection methods. I have already pointed out that, in my view, this bill does not pass the test. There are other ideas out there. For instance, the concept of a levy on horseshoes was debated and enjoyed quite a degree of support. I acknowledge that it also had some deficiencies. What we are probably going to need is some kind of multitiered collection which also recognises the capacity of an industry to pay. By using a series of collection mechanisms, it might be possible to introduce a greater degree of fairness and equity in the system. We also need to investigate the suitability of the EADRA collection guidelines as they apply to the unique nature of the Australian horse industry. It is clear that we do need to do a lot more work on devising a system that will be successful for the industry, that will be fair to all and that will collect an appropriate amount of funds in the event of there being a requirement to be involved in a disease eradication program. I do not believe that this bill meets those criteria. So, whilst supporting the involvement of the equine industry in the disease eradication agreement, as we support the involvement of other industries, the levy mechanism must be fair. This bill fails that test. Debate adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",127

207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"It being past 8.30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Adelaide: King Street Bridge To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned people resident in the Australian Electoral Divisions in South Australia, comprising of Western and Greater Adelaide, the Adelaide Hills and Regional South Australia, draws attention to the House of the value of the King Street Bridge, King Street, Glenelg North, South Australia, Australia to: 1. Retaining a vital link for the elderly to the surrounding services and community, in surrounding metropolitan councils, 2. Provide greater scenic access to the sea West of Adelaide, in the Gulf of St Vincent, and the area immediately North of Glenelg, including the Patawalonga River, which is home to numerous public spectacular events, especially those on water, 3. An important South-North Adelaide coastal corridor, facilitating interstate and intrastate trade and commerce, and family travel, The King Street Bridge is in grave and urgent need of funding for its replacement or repair: Your petitioners therefore requests the House to fund the replacement cost, or full and complete repairs, of the King Street Bridge in Glenelg North at your earliest convenience, for the present and posterity of all South Australians, and Australians, decades to come. by Mrs Irwin (from 1,050 citizens) Australia Post: Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Australia resident in the City of Tamworth area of New South Wales and elsewhere draws to the attention of the House: the lack of an Australia Post retail outlet in the shopping centre complex undergoing redevelopment and nearing completion in North Tamworth, known as the “Northgate Shopping Centre”. We therefore ask the House to respectfully request Australia Post to establish a new, full retail outlet in the newly renovated Northgate Shopping Centre at North Tamworth in view of the large, existing residential population in close proximity to the Centre as well as the nearby St. Andrew's Retirement Village, two private schools and new residential subdivisions already established or being established in the local area. by Mrs Irwin (from 441 citizens) Olympic Dam To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that there are plans to build a 3 kilometre wide and 1 kilometre deep open uranium mine at the Olympic Dam site near Roxby Downs, 500 kilometres north of Adelaide. If built, radon gas will affect all our cities and country towns. If the government allows the building of this mine we will have problems for thousands of years. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to step in and halt the expansion of the Olympic Dam site. by Mrs Irwin (from 53 citizens) Sri Lanka To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. NA HOUSE: The Sri Lankan government, ignoring pleas by the United Nations and its Agencies, the International Community, Human Rights and other Organizations to solve the ethnic problem by negotiation, continues to resort to and encourage acts of Genocide, War Crimes and Human Rights Violations. Such acts include: - Murder, including those of Tamil Parliamentarians & journalists, extrajudicial killing & abduction - Aerial bombing of civilians - Virtual imprisonment and starvation of Jaffna residents by closing the only trunk road preventing movement of food and medicine - Attacks on places of worship These acts are contrary to International Law and Conventions and are crimes under Chapter 8, Division 268 of the Criminal Code Act (1995) of the Commonwealth of Australia. Peaceful resistance by Tamils over 35 years met with violent reprisals by the government, including State sponsored riots against Tamils causing death and destruction, and several pacts between the government and Tamils for minimal devolution of power were later unilaterally abrogated by the government, giving rise to Tamil militancy and demand for self determination. REQUEST FOR ACTION BY THE HOUSE: 1. Stop all aid and supply of arms to Sri Lanka, refuse entry visas to officers of the Sri Lankan government and armed forces concerned with crimes against humanity and human rights violations, and 2. Assist in the establishment of an appropriate constitutional structure, recognizing the principles of equal rights and self-determination of the Tamil People, in accordance with international law. by Mrs Irwin (from 2 citizens) Canberra International Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the Canberra and Queanbeyan regions draws to the attention of the House that: Our community will pay a high price if Canberra International Airport is allowed to develop a 24 hour freight hub, and to become Sydney's second airport (as outlined in its draft Master Plan 2008). The cost to our quality of life will be unacceptable because of a massive increase in Canberra's noise and carbon footprints, as well as the associated planning and infrastructure nightmares. Your petitioners therefore request the House: - To introduce a night time curfew to protect our sleep; - To not allow Canberra International Airport to be developed as a 24 hour freight hub and the second Sydney airport; - To not allow the proposed construction of a parallel runway. by Mrs Irwin (from 20 citizens) Canberra International Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region draws to the attention of the House that: The Canberra Airport's draft Master Plan 2008 proposes that Canberra Airport become Sydney's second airport and a 24 hour international freight hub. It also proposes a parallel runway and in excess of 280,000 flight movements per annum. This equates to more than one aircraft arriving or departing every 2 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This will place an unconscionable burden on the residents of Canberra and Queanbeyan. Your petitioners request the House to introduce an 11:00pm to 6:00am night time curfew at Canberra Airport. by Mrs Irwin (from 3,226 citizens) Renerio Arrogante III To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the family members, friends, associates and neighbours of the late Renerio Arrogante III and other concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: the matter of the brutal murder and alleged political assassination on 9th March 2008 of Renerio Arrogante III, commonly known as “Jun” or “Gogong”, an Australian citizen and former resident of Miranda NSW 2228, who was shot by a gunman at point blank range in front of his wife and son, at Daanbantayan, Cebu, Philippines. We therefore ask the House to: call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request the government of the Republic of the Philippines to investigate the murder of Renerio Arrogante III, with the purpose of determining the perpetrators of the crime and subjecting them to legal action as deemed appropriate by Philippine law. In support of this request, it is our opinion that the perpetrators of this crime are officials of the Local Municipal Government in Daanbantayan and their family members, who collectively have considerable control of the local police and the local legal system, and using this control have “covered up” their involvement in this crime. We therefore feel that any investigations and prosecution carried out by local Daanbantayan or Cebu City based police authorities or legal systems will be compromised. For these reasons we ask the House to call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request high level intervention by the Philippine Government in Manila, in order to bring about a just conclusion. by Mrs Irwin (from 2,188 citizens) Mr Richard Manthorpe To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of RICHARD MANTHORPE, citizen of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, presently residing in Australia under terms of the subclass 410 visa (for retirees) Draws to the attention of The House, that, under the rules governing this visa, my wife and myself are barred from becoming permanent residents and citizens of Australia. We therefore ask The House, giving due regard to (i) our unbroken residence in Australia since May 1994, (ii) although not meeting the “balance of family” test demanded of some migrants, we are members of a larger family group, including our son, twin grandsons, my wife's sister and family, my wife's brother and family, and other, more senior, citizens, all of whom are permanent residents of Australia, (iii) our intention to continue to live in Australia, (iv) our “self funded retiree” status resulting in no call on centrelink benefits, (v) during my career in the public service occasional duties alongside A.D.F. personnel, to grant myself and my wife leave to apply for permanent residence and, subsequently, citizenship of this country. by Mrs Irwin (from 2 citizens) Whaling To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that - The slaughter of whales for any reason is totally unacceptable We the undersigned therefore request the House - To ban all whaling vessels and weapons from entering Australian Waters; refuse any requests for help to all whaling vessels; stop the hunting and slaughter of whales in Australian waters and in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary by the Japanese Government. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will - Take immediate action to protect rare and endangered whales and take whaling countries to the International Court. by Mrs Irwin (from 696 citizens) Marriage Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petitioners and citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House that 1. In 2004, the Commonwealth Parliament amended the Marriage Act 1961 to define marriage as “the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life”. 2. This reinforced the Biblical norm of heterosexual marriage, which has been the cornerstone of every civilization since the beginning of humanity. 3. The word ‘marriage' is thus appropriate only for legally united heterosexual couples, who are able to model dual-parenting that is balanced (providing both father and mother role models), natural (as to male-female physical union), and morally acceptable to God (bringing up children within the marriage bond).* 4. The establishing of Relationship Registers in the States and Territories will inevitably expand the above definition of marriage (para. I) into meaninglessness, and so compromise the purpose of the Marriage Act. Your petitioners therefore pray that, with the powers vested exclusively in the Federal Parliament under Section 51 (xxi and xxii) of the Australian Constitution, you amend the Marriage Act 1961 to invalidate any present or future States' or Territories' Relationship Registers. * Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4-6; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:18-27 by Mrs Irwin (from 37 citizens) Northern Territory Intervention Strategy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the many well known public figures of this country who have publicly rejected the actions of the current Federal Government in its Northern Territory Intervention Strategy and Legislation and expresses our deep concern about it because: - the Government's strategy has been implemented with no consultation with Indigenous community leaders; - the bulk of the $587 million allocated is to spent on administration and bureaucrats rather than directly assisting Indigenous Communities; - quarantining of welfare payments will result in many families, who are already struggling, being worse off; - removal of the entry permit system exposes communities and children to further risk. We call on the incoming Federal Government to revisit the Northern Territory strategy and legislation in consultation with Indigenous leaders as a matter of urgency and to review its appropriateness for the goal of protecting Indigenous women and children in the Northern Territory or any other part of Australia. by Mrs Irwin (from 23 citizens) Sunshine Coast: Palliative Care and Hospice Facilities To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the Naval Association of Australia Maroochy Waters Sub-Section draws to the attention of the House: a lack of palliative care and hospice facilities on the Sunshine Coast. We therefore ask the House to: consider providing such a facility or funding to provide palliative care and hospice accommodation for citizens and in particular war veterans. by Mrs Irwin (from 37 citizens) Hyperhidrosis To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of hyperhidrosis sufferers of Australia draws to the attention of the House: the fact that botox treatment into the armpits of sufferers of hyperhidrosis is a proven and the most preferable treatment for hyperhidrosis sufferers. Hyperhidrosis is a mentally and physically debilitating condition which affects 1-2% of the population, it involves hyperactive sweat glands which cause the sufferer to sweat extreme amounts, usually under the armpits, for no apparent reason. The be cost of the botox itself for the treatment is around $600, the procedure then costs about $200. It is not currently covered by the PBS scheme or Medicare rebate. The treatment lasts from 6 - 18 months, so it has to be repeated. Other treatments include invasive surgery which has risks and undesirable side affects. We therefore ask the House to: take action to bring this treatment for hyperhidrosis sufferers under the PBS scheme and the Medicare rebate scheme. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: WHEREAS the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following Motion: “That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking litical asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national gations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil & Political Rights.” WE, therefore, the individual, undersigned dees petition the House of Representatives in support of the above mentioned Motion. AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Irwin (from 19 citizens) Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of the certificated Personal Care Assistants (PCA's) working at Belmont Community Nursing Home draws to the attention of the House: Nursing homes operating on an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) should receive such additional Federal funding as is commensurate with the PCA's pay rise contained in a new EBA and for the release of this additional funding to coincide with the commencement of the new EBA. We therefore ask the House to: Arrange for nursing homes operating on an EBA to receive such additional funding as is commensurate with the PCA's pay rise contained in a new EBA and for the release of this additional funding to coincide with the commencement of the new EBA. by Mrs Irwin (from 15 citizens) Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: po- This petition of the certificated Personal Care Assistants (PCA's) working at Belmont Community Nursing Home (Belmont) draws to the attention of the House: Nursing homes should have a recognised benchmark to indicate the minimum ratio of PCA's to residents to achieve clinical governance best practice. obli- We therefore ask the House to: Recognise the Belmont benchmark to indicate the minimum ratio of PCA's to residents to achieve Atten- clinical governance best practice is: Morning shift - Five (5) residents to one (1) PCA in a seven (7) hours shift period. Afternoon shift - Ten (10) residents to one (1) PCA in a six (6) hours shift period. Night shift - Seventeen (17) residents to one (1) PCA in a ten (10) hours shift period. by Mrs Irwin (from 15 citizens) Petitions received. Responses Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Iraq Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2008 regarding a recently submitted petition about Australia's involvement in Iraq. The Australian Government is fulfilling its long standing policy to withdraw Australian combat troops from Iraq. Australia's 550 combat troops from Overwatch Battle Group-West based in Tallil will be withdrawn at the end of their current rotation in mid2008. Other elements of Australia's military participation will remain-including maritime, air, logistics and the detachments guarding the Australian Embassy. The withdrawal is being undertaken in close consultation with the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Iraq. The Government remains committed to supporting Iraq, and in the 2008-2009 Budget allocated A$165 million for an expanded capacity building and humanitarian program for Iraq over the next three years. Measures in this program will focus on three principal areas: responding to the basic humanitarian needs of refugees and internally displaced Iraqis; supporting international efforts to provide reconstruction assistance; and strengthening government capacity, especially in public financial management, agriculture and police forensics and leadership. The Australian Government is concerned about the level of violence in Iraq. Australian officials have raised and continue to raise this and other human rights concerns, such as reports of persecution of members of religious and other minorities, with the Government of Iraq. The Australian Government has underlined to the Government of Iraq the need for progress on reconciliation and population security for all religious and ethnic groups, in order to build a stable, prosperous and unified Iraq. In recognition of the critical resettlement needs of Iraqi refugees, in 2008-09 the Humanitarian Visa Program is being increased to 13,500 places, with 500 places in 2008-09 specifically set aside to assist Iraqi refugees. Australia has also recently announced a visa program for locally engaged employees and their families at risk because of their engagement with the Australian Government. Iraqis who have worked with Australian troops in southern Iraq will be eligible for humanitarian resettlement in Australia, subject to health, character and national security checks. I would be grateful if you could inform the petitioners accordingly. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 17 March by The Speaker (from 1034 citizens) Dental Health Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 enclosing a petition in relation to the re-establishment the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme and Commonwealth funding for dental care.

I trust that the above information is of use. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 3053 citizens) Ipswich Motorway Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 28 May 2008 referring a petition regarding the Ipswich Motorway and the Goodna Bypass. As you will be aware, the Australian Government is committed to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, from Dinmore to Rock1ea. We have already allocated nearly $1 billion to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway between Goodna and Darra, and $1.14 billion to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway between Dinmore and Goodna. The section from Darra to Rocklea will be upgraded in the future, potentially funded from the new $20 billion Building Australia Fund, following assessment by the new advisory body, Infrastructure Australia. An infrastructure project of this size is generally undertaken in stages. The construction schedule is determined in consultation with the Queensland Department of Main Roads to minimise the impact on commuters while construction takes place. In this case the Dinmore to Darra upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is being undertaken in three stages. Construction commenced on the Ipswich Mot01'way/Logan Motorway Interchange in February 2007. The Australian Government is providing $255 million to ensure the upgrading of this two kilometre stretch of the Motorway between Goodna and Gailes. This project is expected to be to completed in early 2009 and will provide improved traffic flow between the Ipswich and Logan Motorways. Site work has also recently commenced on the Wacol to Dana section of the Motorway. The Australian Government will provide $700 million to increase this five kilometre stretch from four to six lanes. Stage one of this project will upgrade from Dana to Sandy Creek, including the Centenary Highway Interchange, and stage two from Sandy Creek to Waco1. Planning is currently underway for the upgrade of the Dinmore to Goodna section to upgrade to six lanes. The Australian Government allocated $5 million in the 2008-09 Budget to accelerate the planning process. Construction is expected to commence in early 2009 with project completion anticipated by late 2012. These works will result in improved safety on the Ipswich Motorway through increased capacity and improved design. The upgrades will also allow free-flowing access for inter-regional freight movements to the Brisbane Markets, the Port of Brisbane and the export industries hub being developed at the mouth of the Brisbane River. Regarding the Goodna Bypass, within weeks of being appointed, I met with the Hon Warren Pitt MP, Queensland Minister for Main Roads and we agreed that work on this project would cease. Thank you again for referring this matter to me and I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 184 citizens) Latvian Pension Entitlements Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 about a petition presented by the Speaker of the House on 26 May 2008 about access to pension entitlements from Latvia. I am pleased to inform you that Australian and Latvian officials are negotiating a proposed Social Security Agreement between Australia and Latvia (the Agreement). The proposed Agreement will coordinate the two countries' social security schemes to provide improved social security coverage for people who have lived and worked in Australia and Latvia. The Agreement will, among other things, seek to ensure people living tralia can access any Latvian pension entitlements they may have. Officials in Australia and Latvia are continuing work collaboratively to finalise negotiations. Once finalised the proposed Agreement must be submitted to both Governments for approval. I am hopeful that this will occur in 2008-09. Thank you again for writing. Dear Julia Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 27 May 2008 about the petition submitted to the Committee regarding pension entitlements from Latvia. Australian and Latvian officials are negotiating a proposed bilateral Social Security Agreement that will coordinate the two countries' social security schemes. Negotiation of such agreements is the responsibility of the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to whom I understand you have also written. In view of this, I ask that you refer to the written response being provided by the Hon Ms Macklin. Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 34 citizens) Australia Post Dear Mrs Irwin Australia Post-petition request for post office at Jewells NSW Thank you for your letters dated 27 May 2008 and 2 June 2008 concerning petitions submitted for the Committee's consideration requesting a post office at Jewells, NSW. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation, including all operational matters. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent in Aus- with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that senior management from its NSW administration met with the to petition sponsor, Ms Jill Hall MP, in late March to discuss her interest in the establishment of a postal outlet within the Jewellstown shopping centre redevelopment. I understand a further meeting has taken place with Ms Hall, as well as ongoing discussions between Australia Post and the owner/developer and leasing agent. Another on-site meeting with the owner/developer and leasing agent is scheduled for 25 July. Australia Post has also advised that it has received few direct approaches, including from the local business community, requesting a postal outlet at Jewellstown. Australia Post has also informed me that, at this stage, no decision has been reached. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, to a petition presented on 27 May and 3 June by The Speaker (from 1530 citizens) Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, enclosing a petition about the shortage of residential aged care beds and Community Aged Care Packages (CACPs) in the Hunter and Central Coast aged care planning regions of New South Wales. Your letter has been referred to me as the Minister for Ageing. The Australian Government is delivering a number of election commitments directed at improving the provision of aged care services, particularly in areas of high need. The New Directions for Older Australians: Improving the transition between hospital and aged care package committed to provide up to $300 million in zero real interest loans to residential aged care providers to build or expand residential aged care and respite facilities in areas of high need. The aim of the commitment is to find new ways to get proven providers through low cost finance to establish aged care services in which they were previously unlikely to invest. On 22 March 2008, I released details of the plan to give effect to the commitment and the areas of high need. These high need areas include the Central Coast aged care planning region. Applications for the 2008 Loans Round closed on 6 June 2008 and the results of the Round are expected to be announced in August 2008. The aged care planning region of Hunter was not identified as an area of high need for the 2008 Loans Round because this region is already highly contested during the course of the annual Aged Care Approvals Rounds. In the 2007 Aged Care Approvals Round, all 165 residential aged care places that were available for allocation in the Hunter aged care planning region were allocated, together with 100 CACPs. Some 420 residential aged care places and 110 community aged care places are estimated to be released to the Hunter region over the next two years. The petition also raises the issue of the sufficiency of capital and recurrent funding. ernment has demonstrated its commitment to the long-term viability of the aged care sector by increasing the level of the Conditional AdjustAged Care ment Payment (CAP) by 1.75 per cent from 7.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent of the basic aged care subsidy, meaning an additional $407.6 million over four years for the aged care sector and bringing total CAP payments over the next four years to $2 billion. Over the next four years, funding for aged and community care will reach a record level of more than $40 billion; with total Commonwealth investment in residential aged care subsidies up to $28.6 billion. This includes the $1.13 billion (over four years) in additional funding flowing from the reforms to the residential aged care system introduced on 20 March 2008. Under these changes, aged care homes that provide high care will receive more money in accommodation payments from the Government, some residents, or from a combination of both. Homes use this money to provide buildings and amenities for high care and other residents. The introduction on 20 March 2008 of the new Aged Care Funding Instrument, which replaces the Resident Classification Scale, will also streamline the ongoing assessment of residents, thereby allowing the delivery of better care and significantly reduce red tape. The petition also raises the issue of wages within the aged care sector. The Government is not responsible for determining wages and conditions for staff in the aged care sector. In general these are agreed between employers and employees under a variety of industrial instruments. This means that the pay rates of aged care nurses and other staff can vary from employer to employer in aged care homes. In addition, the base pay levels for nurses in aged care homes can vary between States and Territories. These variations across different States and Territories are not due to differences in Australian Government funding for aged care, as aged care payments do not vary according to State or Territory. I trust that the above information is of use in responding to the petition. from the Minister for Ageing, Mrs Elliot, to The Gov- a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 16 citizens) Child Soldiers Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 27 May 2008, regarding a petition recently submitted for consideration by the Standing Committee on Petitions. This letter responds to the petition, as required by Standing Order 209(b). Regarding the three specific requests made by the petitioners, I am advised that the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act), which is administered under the portfolio of Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, requires all free-to-air commercial broadcasters ensure that 55 per cent of their content broadcast between 6am and midnight is Australian programming. The Act also provides for the identification and resolution of inappropriate content. There is no provision in the Act to specify content beyond this and no scope for the Government to insist on broadcasters running programs or advertisements on specific matters. The broadcasting of . specific programs or advertisements is a commercial matter. More generally, the Australian Government shares the petitioners' concerns about the plight of child soldiers in Uganda, Sudan, Somalia and Algeria, and is committed to promoting and protecting children's rights through international forums such as the United Nations. Australia has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Convention), and its two Optional Protocols, as well as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. These treaties have benefited children by establishing standards against which international behaviour can be measured and scrutinised. Australia continues actively to encourage all States to commit to children's rights and to ratify the Convention and its Optional Protocols. Most recently, Australia co-sponsored resolutions on the rights of the child at the seventh session Human Rights Council, in March 2008, and at the United Nations General Assembly, in December 2007. On 12 February 2008, Australia's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ambassador Robert Hill, delivered a strong country statement indicating broad support for the United Nations Secretary General's report on children and armed conflict, at a United Nations Security Council open debate. In his statement, Ambassador Hill encouraged Member States that had not yet done so to ratify both the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the International Criminal Court's Rome Statute, without delay. Australia's international development program (managed through the Australian Agency for International Development) supports a number of programs to mitigate the impact of conflict on children, and these practical efforts complement our advocacy work in the United Nations. For example, Australia provides aid to Uganda - one of nine African countries targeted for Australian assistance - to help ease the burden of conflict and to mitigate its appalling effects on civilians. The over AUD$6 million of Australian aid provided to Uganda in 2006-07 included AUD$1.5 million funding for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), for the protection of women and children displaced by conflict and to prevent and respond to gender based violence in northern Uganda. In addition to the work being undertaken in Uganda, Australia also actively funds programs to counter the problem of child soldiers in the Asia Pacific region. Current programs are active in the Philippines (through UNICEF), East Timor, and Nepal. We will continue to look for opportunities to counter the use of child soldiers in Uganda, Sudan, Somalia and Algeria. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 127 citizens) Homelessness Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 2 June 2008 in relation to a petition about funding for Supported of the Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) services, emergency accommodation and public housing. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the petition. I received a copy of the petition from Ms Cathy Crawford of North Queensland Combined Women's Services on 4 March 2008 and I responded to her directly. As you are aware, many Australians are struggling with the high cost of housing. Recent NATSEM research on housing affordability commissioned by the Australian Government showed that levels of housing stress are critically high in northern NSW and throughout QLD. This research is supported by the number of signatories on the petition sent to me by Ms Crawford. The Government is very concerned about the effect of rising rents on low and moderate income. households across Australia. Rents are increasing because there are not enough rental homes available, with vacancy rates at or below 2 per cent in all capital cities. To increase the supply of affordable rental accommodation the Government is investing $623 million over four years in a new National Rental Affordability Scheme. The new Scheme will provide institutional investors with the incentive need to build more affordable rental accommodation. The Australian Government will provide annual tax credits of $6,000 on 50,000 new rental properties to be offered to low and moderate income earners. State and Territory Governments have agreed to contribute a further $2,000 per property, either as cash or in kind each year. Rent for these properties will be 20 per cent below market rates, and tenants will still be eligible for Rent Assistance - making it even more affordable for individuals and families. If demand for rental properties is still strong, a further 50,000 properties will be built from 2012 onwards. Addressing homelessness is also a major priority for the Australian Government. We have already announced an additional $1 SO million to build new homes for homeless Australians. As you know the Australian Government released a Green Paper on Homelessness, Which Way Home? A new Approach to Homelessness in May to promote discussion about how to reduce homelessness. We are now developing a White Paper to set the agenda for tackling homelessness to 2020. The White Paper, to be released in September 2008, will include a comprehensive, national action plan to reduce the number of homeless Australians. I strongly believe these initiatives, over time, will reduce homelessness and address the housing affordability crisis. I trust this information is of assistance to the committee. from the Minister for Housing, Ms Plibersek, to a petition presented on 2 June by The Speaker (from 1498 citizens) Water Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letters of 17 March 2008 to the Hon Penny Wong concerning petitions regarding Green, Dock and Natimuk Lakes. The Minister has passed your letters to me for reply. I apologise for the delay in replying. Under the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline project they agreement with the Victorian Government up to 3,000 megalitres per year of water savings are to be allocated for recreational lake use. The allocation of this water to the recreational lakes and weir pools in the region is the responsibility of the Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water Authority (GWM). The allocation of water to the lakes has been the subject of ongoing community consultation by GWM. GWM have provided advice that in consultation with the Reservoirs Review Stakeholder Working Group they are undertaking further investigation and modelling in relation to operating scenarios for Dock and Green Lakes. In relation to Natimuk Lake, GWM announced in May 2008 that it would not be supplying water as supplementary water supplies are not practical. However, the decommissioning of water supply channels in the Natimuk Lake catchment will aim to maximise the return of storm water run-off to the catchment. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, to a petition presented on 17 March by The Speaker (from 3754 citizens) Nuclear Waste Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 concerning a petition regarding nuclear reactors and waste dumps. The Government has no plans to allow the construction of nuclear power plants in Australia. As Australia does not have a nuclear power industry and does not produce high level radioactive waste, no high level radioactive waste facility is planned for Australia. Successive Australian Governments have agreed that Australia should not accept the radioactive wastes of other countries. The Government's position is based on the clear principle that countries deriving benefits from nuclear power should expect to make their own arrangements to safely dispose of their nuclear waste. The Government has not made any decisions on a site for a low-level or intermediate-level radioactive waste facility. We will not make any decisions on a radioactive waste facility without appropriate consultation, including with relevant state and territory governments and Indigenous and local communities. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism is currently preparing a submission on these issues for consideration by the Government. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 11 citizens) Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 2 June 2008 to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government about a petition submitted for the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville. The Minister has forwarded your letter to me as I have portfolio responsibility for regional development issues. Funding of $10 million towards the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville has been identified as an election commitment made by the Australian Government and will be managed by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (the Department). A set of guidelines to administer the election commitments is currently being developed. The Government is committed to complying with its statutory obligations relating to approval of projects and their funding. The Government has to ensure that when it implements election commitments, its exposure to risk and the efficient and effective use of public money is closely managed in line with the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) good practice. The Department will be contacting the Townsville City Council to obtain the information necessary to undertake an analysis of the project. I understand that this project has significant support from the Queensland State Government, which is contributing $14.61 million towards the construction cost and $2.5 million per year for five years towards the cost of running a supercar event. I understand that the petition relates to objections of certain Townsville residents to fund the V8 Supercar racetrack in Reid Park, Townsville and they will be considered as part of the Government's consideration of this project. Any concerns Townsville residents have about the appropriate use of parklands should be directed to the Townsville City Council and the Queensland Government. from the Parliamentary Secretary for ReTownsville gional Development and Northern Australia, Mr Gray, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 5 citizens) Middle East Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 25 June 2008 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Fundamental to the Australian Government's Middle East policy is a commitment to a two-state solution to the conflict, based on Israel's right to live in peace within secure borders, and in recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for their own state. Australia supports a negotiated solution to the conflict conof sistent with UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. The Government calls on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to implement their Roadmap for Peace obligations announced in 2002 and remain focused on the negotiations launched at Annapolis, which offer a path towards a peaceful and settlement. The important question of Palestinian refugees is formally recognised in the Roadmap for Peace as a key issue in the ongoing negotiations between the parties. Australia and Israel enjoy a strong relationship and dose and vibrant community links, as reflected in the Parliamentary motion on 12 March. Links with the Palestinian authorities are also strong. The humanitarian situation of Palestinians remains of deep concern to the Government. The renewed violence is affecting civilian populations in both Israel and Gaza and undermining the peace process. In December 2007, the Government announced the doubling of aid to the Palestinian Territories to $45 million for 2008. The assistance includes $25 million in assistance to Palestinians affected by the humanitarian situation in Gaza, the West Bank and surrounding countries, and $20 million to support the implementation of the Palestinian Authority's Reform and Development Plan. Our aid will incorporate assistance to deliver health and education services as well as support for emergency assistance to Palestinian refugees. The Government continues to look for opportunities to provide practical port to the peace process. Thank you for referring this petition to me. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 23 June by The Speaker (from 4900 citizens) Workplace Relations Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008, enclosing a petition on job security and working conditions presented to the House of Representatives on 26 May 2008. I apologise for the delay in responding. I note that the petition is dated 2007 and the intent the petition is to draw attention to the adverse impact on Australian employees of the previous government's workplace relations laws, including Work Choices. The petitioners call on the Australian Government to reverse those changes and to produce instead a plan for a fair workplace relations system. just The Government understands the concerns of the petitioners and, is addressing the specific issues raised in their petition. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Act 2008 came into effect on 28 March 2008. The Government has put in place transitional arrangements to ensure a sensible and measured phasing in of a new workplace relations system based on the Government's election commitments as set out in Forward with Fairness and the Forward with Fairness Policy Implementation Plan. Later this year, further legislation will be introduced into the Parliament to ensure that a new, fair and balanced workplace relations system is fully operational by 1 January 2010. A number of important Forward with Fairness election commitments, together with key provisions in the Transition to Forward with Fairness Act, cover the specific concerns raised by the petitioners. Rights for Australian workers who are unfairly dismissed The previous government's Work Choices laws included an exemption from unfair dismissal protection for employees in businesses with 100 or fewer employees. The Government will ensure supthat all employees have protection from unfair dismissal but will also balance the needs of employers, particularly small business employers, to manage their workforce with a simpler, faster system for making and resolving unfair dismissal claims. A strong safety net of minimum awards and conditions The previous government's changes to the workplace relations laws allowed individual Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs), to undercut the award safety net. The Government, has already passed the Transition to Forward with Fairness Act, which does not allow any new AWAs to be made and has put in place a genuine no disadvantage test for all workplace agreements to provide better protection for employees. The benchmark for the new no-disadvantage test is the full range of entitlements in an earlier collective agreement or award. In the Government's new workplace relations system the safety net will be in two parts. All Australian employees will be protected by a legis- tion lated safety net of 10 National Employment Standards (NES). On 16 June 2008, together with the Prime Minister, I released the final version of proposed new NES after a period of extensive consultation. NES will ensure that all employees are protected by a strong safety net of fair minimum conditions that cannot be stripped away. Modern and simple awards will provide additional protection for award covered employees. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has already commenced award modernisation. An independent umpire to ensure fair wages and conditions and to settle disputes The Government has committed to establishing a new independent umpire to be called Fair Work Australia. Fair Work Australia will oversee the new workplace relations system and promote fairness and flexibility in Australian workplaces. It will be established as a one-stop-shop to provide employees and employers with information about their rights and responsibilities and will help them resolve workplace disputes and grievances. The right for employees to bargain collectively for decent wages and conditions Under the previous government's Work Choices laws, even where a majority of employees at a workplace wanted to collectively bargain, their employer could simply refuse to collectively bargain with them. There is currently tion for an employer to sit down with employees to have a discussion about the working conditions and arrangements that apply at their workplace. Collective agreements based on bargaining at the level of the enterprise will be at the heart of Government's new workplace relations system. Where an employer refuses to bargain collectively with its employees, Fair Work Australia may determine the level of support for collective bargaining amongst employees in the workplace. If a majority of employees at the workplace want to bargain collectively, their employer will be required to bargain collectively with them in good faith. The right for workers to reject individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representaThere will be no AWAs or any other statutory individual employment agreements in the new the workplace relations system. The Government has already prevented the making of new AWAs during the transition to the Government's new workplace relations system. Individual Transitional Employment Agreements may be made but are available only in limited circumstances and for a limited time to ensure a smooth transition to the new workplace relations system. The right to join a union and be represented by a union Freedom of association is a basic democratic right for all Australian workers. In the new workplace relations system, all employees will be free to decide whether or not to join a union. It will be unlawful to try to stop a worker from exercising free choice by threats, pressure, discrimination or victimisation. Employees will have the right to seek advice, assistance and representation from their union in the workplace. I trust this information on key aspects of the new workplace relations system is of assistance to the Standing Committee on Petitions. from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, to a petition presented on 23 June by The Speaker no legal obliga- (from 16 citizens) Robertson Electorate: Mobile Phone Services Dear Mrs Irwin Telecommunications issues the Thank you for your representation dated 8 May 2008 regarding the concerns of residents of the Robertson electorate about Next G coverage and payphones. I appreciate the residents' concerns in relation to this important issue and apologise for the delay in replying. Closure of Telstra's CDMA network Following my decision in January to postpone the CDMA closure, Telstra responded quickly to put in place a rectification plan to address my concerns. Specific actions arising from Telstra's rectisets. fication plan included: - the establishment of a dedicated hotline to assist customers not receiving equivalent handheld coverage; - an accreditation program for Telstra shops and other major stores selling Next G products to train staff to better assist customers, provide better customer information and ensure stock availability; - the engagement of Telstra Coverage Advocates to contact and/or visit customers at their premises with regard to Next G issues; and - proactive mobile health checks to assist Next G customers with high levels of call dropouts. Telstra reported on 20 March 2008 detailing the effectiveness of the measures contained in its rectification plan and also provided supplementary information. I also considered stakeholder submissions, contacts from consumers and responses from state, territory and local governments. I notified Telstra on 15 April 2008 that I was satisfied it had sufficiently rectified the problems I identified in January. Telstra closed its CDMA network on 28 April 2008. Telstra operated its dedicated Next G hotline until 1 July 2008. The service is now available from Telstra's complaint line on 12 51 11. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will monitor the Next G network call drop-out rates and congestion levels over the next year and report any problems to me. Parliament House, CANBERRA ACT 2600 I Tel 02 6277 7480 I Fax 02 6273 41541 Email minister@dbcde.gov.au. It is important for customers to understand that different mobile phones have different capabilities and how each phone performs on the network is dependent on both the network coverage and the particular device. Telstra labels Next G handsets that it recommends for rural handheld coverage with a ‘blue tick', to make it easier for customers to choose the right handset. Sensitivity also varies within the range of ‘blue tick' handCDMA customers need to do a ‘like for like' upgrade by ensuring that, if they were using a car kit or external antenna with their CDMA handset, they use a car kit or external antenna with their Next G handset. I encourage consumers with Next G queries or difficulties with their Next G equipment and services to contact Telstra in the first instance. If consumers' problems are not resolved by contacting Telstra's hotline, they could contact the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (the Department) by phoning freecall1800 883 488. Mobile phone coverage The Australian Government appreciates the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. However, the decision to provide mobile phone coverage is primarily a commercial matter for mobile phone carriers. In making the decision to extend coverage to a particular area, a mobile phone carrier will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. Telstra has advised it has no current plans to extend mobile phone coverage between Mangrove Mountain and Wisemans Ferry. One option for residents of the Robertson electorate may be to discuss their telecommunications needs with other mobile phone carriers, including drawing to carriers' attention the potential users of the services in the area. Contact details for the major carriers are attached. It should be noted that it is not possible to obtain terrestrial mobile phone reception in all areas of Australia. There are a number of factors that can interfere with mobile reception and therefore affect a user's ability to obtain or maintain a mobile phone signal at any given time or in any particular place. These factors include mountainous or hilly terrain, road cuttings, buildings, tunnels and electromagnetic energy from other sources. While not all potential sources of interference can be overcome, consumers' service providers should be able to advise them about ways to minimise interference. One effective way to increase coverage, particularly along country highways and in rural locations, is to use a properly installed in-car kit an external antenna. The most appropriate antenna may vary between networks, and prices vary according to the quality. An antenna's performance depends on where it is fitted on a vehicle. To assist with maximising network performance and coverage, the antenna should be installed on the car roof. The roof provides sufficient height and stops the car from blocking the signal. These accessories can be readily obtained from mobile phone shops and dealers. In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population and are available from a number of providers. Residents of the Robertson electorate may be eligible for assistance under the Government's Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme (the Scheme) if they are unable to access terrestrial mobile phone networks. The subsidy provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, and up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend significant periods in noncoverage areas. Information about the Scheme, along with application forms, is available on the website of the Department www.dbcde.gov.aulsatphone.Aninformation kit can be obtained by contacting the Scheme administrator on free call 1800 674 058 or via email satphone@dbcde.gov.au. Public payphones The Universal Service Obligation (USO) provides that all people in Australia, wherever they live or work, should have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to payphone services. Telstra, as the primary universal service provider, is responsible for meeting the USO. The Telstra Standard Marketing Plan (SMP) sets out how Telstra will meet its obligations under the USO in terms of installation, removal and relocation of payphones, as well as service quality and fault rectification standards. The SMP and information on Telstra's payphones is available at www.telstra.com.aulpayphoneserviceslindex.htm. with ACMA is responsible for monitoring Telstra's compliance with its SMP. The criteria for the provision of payphones are specified in clause 3.8 of Telstra's SMP. Telstra will provide and maintain payphones on an equitable basis considering all reasonable financial and siting implications. Telstra assesses requests for payphones on a case by case basis. While the siting criteria are flexible, Telstra has an obligation to provide payphones, even if they are unprofitable, within approximately: - 1 km of residential communities (including caravan parks and holiday units) in cities and towns with low home phone connection; - 40 km of small villages and towns (including holiday areas); - 100 km of state or national parks, where there are permanent facilities and regular park staff visits; - 250 km of small service centres on highways and major roads in rural and remote areas where there is adequate mobile service; - 200 km of small service centres on highways and major roads in rural and remote areas where there is inadequate mobile service; and - small remote communities, including Indigenous communities if as a general rule the at community has a permanent population of more than 20 adult residents, or 50 people in total. According to Telstra's payphone locator there are up to ten payphones within 40 km of the Mangrove Mountain region. These are predominantly located on the Pacific Highway and Wisemans Ferry Road. However, four of the payphone locations are directly located within areas of concern to the petitioners at: 1590 Pacific Highway, Peats Ridge; 3468 Wisemans Ferry Road, Somersby; Morgans Road, Marlow; and 10 Wisemans Ferry Road, Spencer. There are a further two locations in Wisemans Ferry itself at 2 Settlers Road and 2 Old Northern Road. Regional telecommunications review The residents of the Robertson electorate may be interested to know that the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee (the Committee) is conducting a review of the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. The outcomes from this review will play an important role in shaping future Government telecommunications policy, particularly for regional Australia. The Committee is due to report to the Government in August 2008, potentially identifying areas that Government may consider for further action. The Committee held an extensive public meetings program throughout regional Australia to inform it of the views and experiences of consumers, businesses and other organisations in these areas. Contributions from a broad range of stakeholders will help the Committee deliver a report that reflects the views of regional Australia and provides meaningful advice to the Government. More information on this review can be found on the website at www.rtirc.gov.au or by phoning free call 1800 064 851. Thank you for bringing the Robertson electorate residents' concerns to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, to a petition presented on 19 March by Ms Neal (from 1070 citizens) Olympic Dam Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 concerning a petition on uranium mining at Olympic Dam. The proposal to expand the Olympic Dam mine requires my approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. My delegate determined on 8 November 2005 that the impacts of this proposal will need to be assessed by an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This means that the potential impacts of mine, including the impacts of radioactive waste material, will need to be rigorously examined in the EIS and subjected to review through a public comment period. The proposed development also triggers state legislation and requires approval from the South Australian Government. The Australian Government assessment is being undertaken in collaboration with the South Australian Government. Joint guidelines for the EIS were finalised in January 2006. The proponent, BHP Billiton, is responsible for the development of the EIS. Once the EIS has been developed, it will be released for public comment for a period of eight weeks. Its release the and the call for public comments will be advertised. I encourage those who have signed the petition to make their views known through the formal review process when it occurs. In the meantime I have asked my Department to note the concerns in the petition for reference during the formal assessment process. from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 70 citizens) Education Funding Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding Commonwealth funding for public schools. I apologise for the delay in responding. The Australian Government provides funding to both government and non-government schools as part of a funding partnership involving state and territory governments and parent communities. Under the existing funding arrangements, government schools are primarily resourced by state and territory governments with the Australian Government providing supplementary funding. The Government is the primary source of public funding for non-government schools. The Government will implement its election commitment to continue the existing funding the arrangements for all schools for the next funding period (2009-2012) to provide funding certainty to schools. These arrangements will be reviewed with an open and transparent process anticipated to conclude in 2011. This review is intended to ensure that the strongest possible platform is for long-term investment and improvement in educational outcomes beyond 2012, the year the next funding period concludes. At the same time, the Council of Australian Governments has agreed to develop a new plan for school reform. As part of this plan, governments will work together, and with the Catholic and independent sectors, to identify disadvantaged school communities regardless of the sector in which they operate or where they are located. The aim of this national approach is to focus additional resources to where the greatest impact and the most improvement in outcomes and school quality can be achieved so that every Australian child has access to a first-class education. Through its Education Revolution, the Australian Government has made a commitment to lift educational standards across all schools and provide funding on the basis of need. It aims to ensure that schools, particularly those in greatest need, are resourced so that children can achieve better outcomes and schools are better placed to meet the National Goals for Schooling in Australia. This commitment is made as part of a funding partnership involving state and territory governments, non-government school authorities and parent communities. In addition to the significant amounts of funding provided in general recurrent and capital grants for schools, the provision for broadband connection to all schools and the Education Tax Refund for parents, there are a range of new Australian Government initiatives providing additional resources to both government and non-government schools. In 2008-09 more than $813 million in additional funding will be provided by the Government for computers in secondary schools, trade training centres, investment in new shared school facilities and improvements in literacy and numeracy, languages and a national curriculum. The Government is also investing in a range of measures aimed at improving teacher quality, including prioritising teacher professional development in ICT and its integration into other key learning areas in the Australian Government Quality Teacher Program (AGQTP). In 2009, $11.25 million of AGQTP funds will underpin schools-based activities related to let professional built development for teachers and school leaders. I trust this information is of assistance in responding to the terms of the petition. from the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, to a petition presented on 23 June by The Speaker (from 162 citizens) War Crimes Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 17 March 2008 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, enclosing a petition to the House of Representatives about the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. The Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf. Australia is a strong advocate for human rights and raises human rights issues both bilaterally and through international organisations. The Australian Government works with the international community to encourage Bangladesh to observe internationally accepted standards of human rights. Consistent with this approach, the Australian Government regularly raises such issues with the Government of Bangladesh, through the Australian High Commission in Dhaka. To encourage a more comprehensive approach to human rights in Bangladesh, officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Attorney-General's Department recently hosted a delegation from the Bangladesh's Law and Justice Ministry to advise on the creation of a national human rights institution in Bangladesh. DFAT has also met representatives of the Bangladesh community in Australia to discuss human rights issues of concern in Bangladesh. In the case of the events referred to in the petition, the Australian Government considers such matters should be dealt with by the Government of Bangladesh and notes that Bangladesh's Foreign Adviser, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, has recently raised this issue with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I should be grateful if you would inform the petitioners accordingly. from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith, to a petition presented on 23 June by The Speaker (from 104 citizens) Federal Funding Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 26 June 2008 to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, about the two petitions regarding funding approved by the previous government in the electorate of Makin, for the Tilley Reserve Building Refurbishment!Additions project (RP03296) and Harpers Field Development project (RP03256), under the Regional Partnerships program. The Minister has forwarded your letter to me as I have portfolio responsibility regional development issues. As you may be aware, the Australian Government had to close the Regional Partnerships program in response to the Australian National Audit Office's three-volume, 1,200-page report, which found that “the manner in which the program had been administered...had fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration”. However, it was clear from discussions with various community organisations and local councils that many were led to believe that funding agreements had been finalised with the previous government. This has placed them in a difficult situation. I wrote to all not-for-profit and local government organisations with an approved and uncontracted Regional Partnerships project, which included the Tilley Reserve Building Refurbishment/Additions project and Harpers Field Development project, offering them the opportunity to finalise their contract with the Commonwealth subject to the following conditions: 1. the project still meets the Regional Partnerships program criteria; 2. money had already been spent or commitments entered into in good faith based on advice from the previous government; the conditions of the original funding offer can be met; 4. finalise contract negotiations and sign a contract by 31 July 2008; and 5. projects that involve construction or require a tender process have until 31 December 2008 to commence the project and/or have the tender process completed. All other projects must commence within six weeks of contract execution. A total of 86 projects were offered the opportunity to meet the conditions. Following advice from the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government that the projects met the relevant conditions I wrote to Mr Murray, General Manager of Infrastructure and Mr Burke, Manager of Property Assets from the City of Tea Tree Gully on 29 May 2008 offering them the opportunity to finalfor ise their contract negotiations with the Commonwealth. Contract negotiations for both these projects have now been completed and funding agreements (contracts) for both projects have been signed. I trust this information addresses the requirements of the committee. from the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, Mr Gray, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 4576 citizens) Statements",130
208,Mrs IRWIN,REASONS FOR PETITIONING THE,"Fowler) (8.38 pm)Tonight marks another step in the evolution of the way in which petitions are dealt with in this place. I am delighted that the House agreed to a sessional order in June providing for petitions to be presented by the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions and also allocating 10 minutes for the presentation of petitions and responses, as well as comments on petitions by the chair and one other member of the committee. Over the coming months I the look forward to bringing to the attention of the House a number of aspects of the petitioning process and the petitions we have received. Given the large number of petitions and the significant number of ministerial responses presented, time is at a premium this evening. Therefore, the committee agreed that on this occasion I would use the time to speak about the operations of the new petitions Committee and the work it has been doing. It is our intention on future occasions that all members of the committee will have an opportunity to speak about petition matters of interest to them. Before looking at the work of the Petitions committee over the last six months, I would like to place on record the committee's appreciation for the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure in the previous parliament. That committee took a long hard look at how petitions were being dealt with and made a number of recommendations to try and reinvigorate the petitioning process. One of those recommendations, of course, was the establishment of a committee to respond to petitions on behalf of the House. I would also like to commend the government for supporting the establishment of the petitions committee. As members would be aware, petitioning is a very practical and direct way in which the community brings its concerns to the House. A lot of time and effort goes into collecting signatures and gathering support on particular issues, and we are very keen for petitions to have the maximum impact possible. To this end the committee has been very active in trying to educate not only the public but also our colleagues about the new arrangements for petitions. The committee is happy to provide advice to people on the technical aspects of what is required for a petition to be presented. Information is also available from the committee website, and brochures are available for use in electorate offices. I would like to say a few words about ministerial responses to petitions. In the past all petitions were sent to the relevant minister but there was no formal requirement for a response-and in fact only three ministerial responses to petitions were received over a 10-year period. Now, under the new arrangements, there is an expectation that ministers will respond within 90 days of the petition being presented. As you will see from the list of responses presented to the House this evening, most ministers have been very diligent in meeting that time frame. I commend the way in which ministers have engaged in this process. The responses have been informative and provide valuable feedback to petitioners, even if the response may not always be what the petitioner might have wanted. Today is also significant in that we held our first public hearing in Canberra this morning to discuss a number of petitions in more depth and provide an opportunity for an update on responses. This information will similarly be publicly available and provided to petitioners. The committee will also be holding hearings in the states and territories, speaking to petitioners and again providing a forum for their input into the policy development process. I have been very pleased with the first six months of operations of the committee and thank all of the members for their enthusiasm and hard work. We have embarked on an inquiry into electronic petitions, and that will complete the range of recommendations arising from the Procedure Committee inquiry. I look forward to briefing the House on other work of the committee on future occasions. NA NA NA AUSTRALIA BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Dr Nelson.",150
209,Dr NELSON,COORONG REGION OF SOUTH,"The Emergency Assistance Fund for the Lower Lakes and Coorong Region of South Australia Bill 2008 seeks to establish the Lower Lakes and Coorong Assistance Scheme, which will provide $50 million in emergency assistance to the Lower Lakes and Coorong region communities. The bill requires the responsible minister to determine written guidelines for operation of the scheme. In order to develop guidelines for the scheme, the minister must consult with the local people, local businesses and local communities of the region. This consultation will determine how to allocate the $50 million, ensuring that this assismarkets tance is for local people and driven by local people. The $50 million assistance scheme will provide real and immediate assistance for local people, businesses, communities and wildlife to deal with the ongoing record low levels of water in the region. The local farmers can no longer access water for domestic and stock purposes, let alone irrigation, and many in the viticulture industry have been similarly affected. Boat ramps, jetties and moorings are stranded, posing significant challenges and hardship to the fishing and boating industries. There is a flow-on effect to the businesses dependent on farmers and the boating industry, such as machinery and boat dealerships, boat builders and repairs, to mention but a few. There has been a substantial fall in visiing tors to the area, and consequently reduced cash flows to small businesses and local communities. Local wildlife is dying due to the associated impacts of the lack of water and declining water quality, such as the Murray turtles, which are being attacked by saltwater tube worms. I have seen all of this first hand and I, along with the opposition, have been calling for financial assistance for the local communities since my visit to the region in early April. These are communities who have for generation after generation provided the backbone of the region's economy, who have asked for little to nothing from the Australian people and the Australian taxpayer. It is time to give them something back. This assistance could be used for the carting of water for domestic and stock use; assistance to establish a rescue plan for the Murray turtles; assistance to schoolchildren who have been trying to save the turtles; a boat lift; assistance for small business in the form of rent relief, or in developing new or products and services; and assistance for retraining and skills development. It is time for the Prime Minister and his government to stop watching and start acting. They can do this by supporting this bill and supporting $50 million of real and immediate action for the lower lakes and Coorong communities. Unfortunately, wall-towall Labor has meant wall-to-wall failure to take decisive action on the Murray-Darling Basin and on the lower lakes and the Coorong. Through a process of committees, reviews and political game-playing, Labor have stalled for nine long months, while the viability of the region slowly ebbs away. The Prime Minister and those opposite need to support this $50 million assistance fund, and the Prime Minister needs to immediately convene an emergency COAG meetto sign a fresh intergovernmental agreement that refers state and territory power over the Murray-Darling Basin to the Commonwealth, as the coalition first proposed in January 2007. After all of the hot air, after all of the talk, we still in Australia in 2008-nine months into the Rudd government-do not have full Commonwealth control of the Murray-Darling Basin system. There is much else that the Prime Minister and Senator Wong need to do, not least of all to release the urgent advice on options for the lower lakes and Coorong region, which the minister sought on 18 June and yet it has not been released to the Australian community. In the interests of the Murray-Darling Basin communities, the environment and particularly the lower lakes and Coorong region communities, it is time to stop watching; it is act. It is time to put $50 million into the lower lakes and Coorong communities. It is time to make real decisions that deliver water, relief and much-needed assistance to these men and women, who are struggling in the midst of an environmental, economic and social disaster.

211,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following reports of the committee: Report 411: Progress on equipment acquisition and financial reporting in Defence; and Report 412: Audit reports reviewed during the 41st parliament. Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",153
212,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"I will confine my comments to report 411. Defence, the largest of all Australian government departments by budget and personnel volumes, is an immense and complex portfolio. Over the last decade it has been the subject of a great deal of public and parliamentary scrutiny, with good reason. At the same time as it has been the beneficiary of generous funding, Defence has suffered from major deficiencies in its financial reporting and in its capacity to acquire major equipment both on time and on budget. Defence has been under intense pressure to make effective changes. Two significant Defence related reports were published in 2003. The first, a Senate committee report into materiel acquisition time to and management in Defence, provided a snapshot of progress since the restructure of the Defence Materiel Organisation. The second, the Defence procurement review, or the Kinnaird review, recommended a number of important reforms to processes around developing and maintaining capability. The year 2003 also saw the initiation of a comprehensive financial remediation program to address Defence's financial management challenges. In March 2006, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit decided it was time to take stock of the progress that has been made by Defence since those important reviews. To that end, it resolved to conduct Report an inquiry into financial reporting and equipment acquisition at the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation. The committee received 20 written submissions, including from the Department of Defence, Defence industry representatives as well as private individuals with an interest in the inquiry. The committee took evidence at public hearings during 2006 and 2007 and two inspections were conducted at Qantas Airways Ltd to compare stores and procurement management processes. The evidence suggested that Defence has undertaken a substantial amount of work to remediate its financial management practices. Likewise, both Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation have worked hard to implement the recommendations of the Kinnaird review. The committee commends the commitment of Defence's senior leadership teams to driving these reforms through the department. However, there is more work to be done. The committee found three key areas were still deficient. First, while it is clear the naird review recommendations have been implemented, it is not clear if the intent of the reforms is adequately reflected in performance outcomes. The intent of the Kinnaird reforms was to make the DMO a more business like, outcomes focused organisation so that optimum capability was realised. The extent to which this has occurred can be best determined through careful monitoring of acquisition projects outcomes. Second, given the significant investment Defence has made in reforming its processes and practices, it is imperative that Defence develops techniques to evaluate the outcomes of its reform agenda, including documenting lessons learned. These techniques need to include creating and applying metrics to gauge the impact of the Kinnaird reforms on cultural change across the department. Embedding best practice into ongoing performance remains a major challenge. Linking these first two elements is the final area of concern-that of improving transparency and accountability in capability procurement across Defence- (Time expired) Primary Industries and Resources Committee",153
213,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, I present the committee's report entitled Down Under: greenhouse gas storage-review of the draft Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",154
214,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, I have the pleasure of presenting our Kinreport entitled Down Under: greenhouse gas storage-review of the draft Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill. This report assesses the proposed legislation introduced into the parliament by the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, the Hon. Martin Ferguson MP, on 18 June 2008. The bill provides for the storage of greenhouse gas substances in offshore Commonwealth waters. Through the titles and rights established by the bill, proponents will set up commercial operations to permanently store captured carbon dioxide, and as such abate a proportion of Australia's emissions. The committee have reviewed the proposed legislation and largely find in favour of it. With the recommendations we suggest, the committee believe that it will be important, successful legislation. It will provide a much-needed mitigation option for Australia's carbon dioxide emissions while also allowing for the continued exploitation of our coal reserves-so important to our energy security. The proposed management of interactions between greenhouse gas storage proponents and pre-existing petroleum titleholders was of particular interest to the committee during Report its deliberations. The potential for conflict between these two parties was identified, especially with regard to the protection afforded pre-existing petroleum titleholders, which could potentially frustrate the establishment of greenhouse gas storage activities in some areas. It was felt that, while the bill largely strikes an appropriate balance between these two key parties, further improvements could be made. As such, the committee recommends in this report that the best solution would be for the legislation to include a clause to provide the responsible Commonwealth minister with the power to direct both parties to come to commercial agreements in good faith. The cost of establishing greenhouse gas storage operations is likely to be vast. It will require new technology, specialist expertise and significant time frames in order to become effective. As such, the committee has recommended financial incentives from the government to both promote investment in and encourage uptake of this important new industry. Also, to encourage the early injection of carbon dioxide, the committee recommends in this report that those proponents who can demonstrate an available carbon dioxide stream be favoured for acreage release. Through its inquiry process the committee also identified the large and possibly vital role the petroleum industry is likely to play in the uptake of greenhouse gas storage in offshore Commonwealth waters. The petroleum companies currently hold most of the technical knowledge and expertise required for the establishment of greenhouse gas storage. They are also current tenement holders in offshore Commonwealth waters. Therefore the committee has recommended that petroleum titleholders be offered a chance to combine a greenhouse gas storage title with their production or exploration permits. The issue of long-term liability was also identified by the committee as highly significant. Due to the extensive time frames over which the carbon dioxide is to be stored, the question of liability is particularly complex. The bill as it stands is silent on liability, ing it entirely to common law. The committee recommend in our report that long-term liability be transferred from the operator to the government after site closure conditions have been met, as this is likely to act as an incentive for greenhouse gas storage proponents to maintain high management standards as well as create greater investment certainty. The committee congratulates the minister for this pioneering legislation and acknowledges that it sets the scene for Australia to lead the world in this new technology, which has great potential to make deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions while continuing to support our energy security. The committee supports the proposed legislation and believes that it provides an appropriate groundwork for the establishment of a national greenhouse gas storage industry in Australia. I would like to express, on behalf of the committee, our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry; to the staff of the secretariat who were involved in preparing the report Bill Pender, John Miller and Sophia Nicolle; and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, for your involvement and commitment to getting this good work done. To my deputy chair, the member for Hume, I thank you for all the work you did as well, during a difficult time for you. On behalf of the committee I commend the report to the House.",154
215,Mr SCHULTZ,COMMITTEES,"I rise in support of the Chair of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources to speak on the review of the draft Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008. The committee's report, entitled Down Under: greenhouse gas storage, has made some recommendations to the draft legislation to promote the legislation's leaveffectiveness. Recommendations include refinements to: ensure that the extraction of petroleum and the storage of carbon do not preclude other activity occurring nearby; provide the minister with the power to insist that, where respective titles overlap, the ties negotiate in good faith; ensure that all regulations and guidelines under this proposed legislation are released to industry and the public as a matter of urgency well before the legislation is passed; and establish a process for the transfer of long-term liability from a greenhouse gas operator to the government, after strict site closure criteria are met, in order to create business and investment certainty. This bill will establish a new range of shore titles providing for the transportation by pipeline, and injection and storage in logical formations, of carbon dioxide and potentially other greenhouse gases. The Offshore Petroleum Act 2006, as amended by the bill, will continue to apply only in the Commonwealth offshore jurisdiction. The new titles will therefore be located in the area between the outer limits of the state and Northern Territory coastal waters and the outer limit of the Australian continental shelf. A licence will authorise the injection and storage of a ‘greenhouse gas substance'. This will initially mean carbon dioxide, together with any substances incidentally derived from the capture or injection and storage processes, including added chemical detection agents to assist the tracing of the jected substance. There is a power by regulation to extend the meaning of ‘greenhouse gas substance' to include other substances. This regulation-making power is not expected to be used until such time as the protocol to the London dumping convention is amended to permit geological storage of those other substances. Under the proposed legislative model, the Australian government will be primarily responsible for administering the regulation in Commonwealth waters, rather than the current joint authority arrangements applying to the petroleum industry. The responsible Commonwealth minister will have ultimate parregulatory responsibility. This approach is consistent with industry's preference for a consistent and harmonised national approach and will improve the efficiency of project approvals and minimise administrative duplication. The bill establishes three categories of ‘storage formation', with increasingly specific descriptors that correspond to the titleholder's improving level of knowledge about the formation: (a) a ‘potential greenhouse offgas storage formation', (b) an ‘eligible greenhouse gas storage formation' and (c) an geo- ‘identified greenhouse gas storage formation', which is an ‘eligible greenhouse gas storage formation' that is declared by the minister to be an ‘identified greenhouse gas storage formation'. An injection licence authorises the injection and storage of a substance into an ‘identified greenhouse gas storage formation'. Once injection operations cease permanently in an injection licence area, the licensee must apply for a site-closing certificate. This triggers the commencement of the siteclosing period, during which the injection licensee will be required to carry out a work program corresponding to a petroleum decommissioning process, but potentially with inadditional requirements. The application must be accompanied by a written report setting out the licensee's modelling of the behaviour of the GHG and relevant information and analysis; the licensee's assessment of the expected migration pathways and shortand long-term consequences of the migration; and the licensee's suggestions for post site-closing monitoring and verification. These processes may take months or years. As is the case with petroleum decommissioning, the injection licensee will be required to plug wells, repair damage to the seabed and remove or otherwise deal with property and equipment. The minister may refuse to give a certificate if the substance is not behaving as predicted or there is a significant risk of a significant adverse impact on other potential resources. Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, I support this acknowledgement and thank all of the people involved in putting this report together, including your considerable learned contribution.

220,Mr SECKER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's report entitled The way forward: inquiry into the role of the National Capital Authority, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",157
221,Mr SECKER,COMMITTEES,"The committee, through this inquiry, has examined the current planning arrangements with a view to reducing red tape and confusing duplication but at the same time ensuring that the Commonwealth has a direct and enduring role in the future planning of Canberra, the nation's capital. The committee focused on the administration of the National Capital Plan, the governance arrangements of the National Capital Authority, the level of oversight required to maintain the highest standards of design in the Australian Capital Territory, opportunities for greater cooperation with ACT government planning authorities, and the promotion of the national capital. The committee believes that the National Capital Authority should continue to exist but is in need of structural renewal. The committee has proposed that the governance arrangements be changed to give more independence to the National Capital Authority board commensurate with its status as a statutory authority. Persons appointed to the board should have qualifications or expertise relevant to a field related to the National Capital Authority's functions. Transparency and accountability to the parliament would be enhanced through the chairperson of the board appearing twice a year at public hearings before this committee. The most important feature of the report is the future planning framework. The princiReport ples and policies that define the Commonwealth's interest in the national capital can be enhanced by their inclusion in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act. The National Capital Plan is in need of updating to respond to the modern challenges of climate change and ecological sustainability as well as providing for more effective consideration of future transport needs. In this way, the Commonwealth continues to set the framework for future planning. The committee recommends the development of a single integrated planning document which comprises the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan, with agreed definitions and clear geographic boundaries between the two plans. Where possible, these boundaries should be based on the objective that land administration be aligned with planning jurisdiction. In this way, proponents, stakeholders and the community would deal with just one planning authority. There was a great deal of goodwill expressed by both the National Capital Authority and the ACT government to achieve such an alignment of the respective plans, as contained in their submissions. However, it became clear that there were many important details to be ironed out. Many witnesses and submitters to the inquiry were not able to express a view or contribute to the discussion about the proposals because the inquiry represented the first public exposure of the ideas. The committee recommends a working group comprising the National Capital Authority and the ACT Planning and Land Authority, or ACTPLA, should prepare detailed proposals of an integrated, cooperative approach which would be considered as part of a broader package of updating the National Capital Plan and any legislative amendment. It is envisaged that this process could take around 18 months. The committee, therefore, has proposed that, as an interim measure, in order to resolve planning duplication the Commonwealth consider amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act to permit the National Capital Authority and ACTPLA to negotiate a memorandum of understanding to delegate the planning jurisdiction for territory land which has designated status. The National Capital Authority and ACTPLA will also have the opportunity to receive advice on a range of planning matters through the creation of the National Capital Consultative Council, or NCCC. The NCCC would consist of representatives from the Commonwealth and ACT governments, the community and business and be co-chaired by the responsible Commonwealth minister and the ACT Chief Minister. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I thank all groups, organisations and individuals who contributed to this inquiry. The interest in, passion for and commitment to their national capital by so many Australians was inspiring and uplifting throughout the course of the inquiry.",157

223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Yes.,158
224,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,COMMITTEES,"and I am sorry about that I just want to note my participation in this inquiry and I want to thank the chair, Senator Lundy, and Senator Gary Humphries, who, along with other members of the committee, put a great deal of effort into coming up with a bipartisan report. There is no doubt that, at the beginning of this process, this inquiry was seen to some degree to be controversial within the ACT. However, Canberra is a very well-planned city, one of very few in the world that were planned from their inception. Of course, the Commonwealth had full planning responsibilities up until 1989. Self-government in 1989 has meant that since then we have had a dual planning process. It was very timely that this inquiry came along at the point that it did because, after 20 years, we really needed to look at dual planning, at duplication, at the removal of red tape and, most importantly, at the governance and administration issues that affect the NCA and their ability to carry out their work. I want to thank the staff from the committee secretariat for the work that they did in pulling this report together and the wonderful work they did in collaborating with the members along the way. And I want to thank the members of the Canberra community who, through organisations or individually, took the time to put in submissions and to appear at public hearings for this tant report. I suggest that anybody who has an interest in the ACT and Canberra as the national capital should read this report to understand as fully as possible the importance of a really good, proficient, proper planning process so that not only Canberra as a community but, more importantly in this regard, Canberra as the national capital has every possibility of continuing to be one of the most highly regarded planned cities and communities in the world. The range of information and advice that the committee was able to take really meant that we could come up with a hard-worked-at but good product in the end. As I said, this is a bipartisan report. Its 22 recommendations go to the thrust of governance and planning work within the NCA, as well as to an understanding of the relationship between the federal role in the NCA and the ACT role through the ACT planning role. As I said, we have made 22 recommendations. One point that needs to be made is that the committee found that the NCA has endured financial cuts that went far too deep, and that this has meant that the NCA did not have the ability to discharge their duties in ways that would assist in reducing red tape or to help make the organisation more effective and more role focused. I want to particularly make that point. That was the finding of the committee after hearing the evidence and listening to a broad range of opinions within the Canberra community that the NCA should be able to do its work. I am pleased that the recommendation is that the NCA will remain. It will have a slightly different focus in the way it is structured. And the Commonwealth is, by this report, suggesting that it has a continuing role in planning as well in the national capital.",158

I also want to thank the secretariat, Mr Geoff Dawson, Mr Andrew Bomm and Ms Laurie Cassidy for all their hard work and effort in all the work that the committee does. The report covers a number of issues relating to ASIC's regulatory responsibilities. These include their regulation of financial markets, ASIC's recent strategic review, their continuing response to property investment scheme collapses, financial planner issues and banking and credit regulation. In particular in relation to financial regulation, a topic of some great attention in recent times, share market volatility has brought a lot of attention to short selling and margin lending practices, and whether ASIC is monitoring these issues adequately. ASIC told the committee that they had issued public warnings about false and misleading rumours on share trading, and recommended improved disclosure rules on short selling, which the government has agreed to. The committee has encouraged ASIC to maintain greater cooperation with the ASX to crack down more effectively on insider trading and market manipulation. ASIC is in the process of making some changes to the organisation following its recent strategic review. The committee supports these restructuring plans. They are aimed at making ASIC more responsive to emerging regulatory challenges by better understanding the markets they regulate and taking a more far-sighted and less reactive approach. This is to be achieved by reordering priorities and shifting resources to where they are most needed. ASIC told the committee that they would seek to meet their objectives within the existing budgetary allocation, but may need increased funding if they are given additional regulatory responsibilities. ASIC has also put a number of measures in place to reduce the chances of another Westpoint-style property investment scheme collapse along with a range of others that took place at that time. These include tougher restrictions on debenture advertising, requiring issuers to disclose against eight benchmarks on an ‘if not why not' basis, and posting issuers' disclosure documents on their website. It is encouraging to see ASIC giving this issue the serious attention it deserves, though it has been tardy in doing so in the past, and something that I know conmarket sumers will be very appreciative to see change. In terms of financial planners, a number of issues relating to financial planners were discussed with ASIC, such as the compulsory professional indemnity insurance for planners which has been introduced, and ASIC told the committee that the availability of insurance cover in the marketplace has so far been adequate. The adequacy of compensation available to investors under the Financial Industry Complaints Service was again raised. ASIC suggested that the limit should be raised from $150,000 to $280,000. ASIC has now also responded to the committee's requests to conduct another shadowshopping survey on superannuation advice from financial planners. In our view it should not have taken so long, but will now be conducted in the 2009-10 financial year, and the committee asked ASIC a range of questions around that. In the area of banking and credit regulation, the government's green paper on financial services and credit regulation posed a number of queries about the effect it will have on ASIC and a number of options. Finally, reverse mortgages were again raised with ASIC. They told the committee that although there had been few complaints to the regulator about them, likely problems with these products have yet to emerge. But the committee believes that any exposure ASIC can give to this issue in the mainstream press would also be beneficial.",159
228,Mr ROBERT,COMMITTEES,"Fadden) (9.15 pm)ASIC is Australia's corporate, markets and financial services regulator, and I rise to speak to the recent ASIC report. ASIC, of course, is an independent Commonwealth government body set up to administer the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act, which requires them to improve the performance of the financial system and the entities within it. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services held a public inquiry on 18 June, which included a range of discussions with respect to ASIC's regulatory responsibilities. Five key areas were covered. The first was the regulation of financial markets, and particularly of issues relating to short selling and margin loans. ASIC informed the committee that it was working with the ASX to hasten action regarding alleged misconduct within and by the ASX. Questions still surround the effectiveness of ASIC, especially regarding margin lending, directors' compliance in letting the market know about their margin lends, short selling, share loaning, disclosure and, of course, targeted short selling to cover margin calls and the manipulation of the market to cover such calls. Secondly, ASIC shared its strategic review, including the next three to five years. will focus on better understanding the stock market, looking further ahead to assess risk, better explaining its actions, getting clearer priorities and making a range of changes to ensure this occurs-all of which the committee supports. Thirdly, ASIC explained its response to a recent property investment scheme collapse. It responded by implementing more stringent measures to protect consumers, focusing on better disclosure and improved advertising standards for issuers of unlisted and underrated debentures. Whilst this is applauded, it is important that parliament understands that ASIC has been slow to act. The committee is looking forward to ASIC taking a more strategic role in protecting investors in the future. The fourth area that was covered related to the regulation of financial planners and the introduction of professional indemnity insurance for negligent advice. Compulsory PI insurance for financial planners has been introduced, although concerns remain over the adequacy of cover that will be available in the insurance market. From 1 July this year until 1 July 2010, licensees must hold a minimum standard of cover. This is pleasing, and the committee looks forward to continued ASIC oversight in this area. Lastly, the fifth issue raised by ASIC concerned banking and credit regulation and the implementation of the government's green paper proposals. The government's green paper on financial services and credit regulation has outlined options for a federal takeover of consumer credit regulations. The options include a federal takeover of the regulation of all credit products; regulating mortgages and leaving consumer credit to the states; or maintaining the status quo. The transfer of regulatory control will require the It states' agreement. But the fact that this discussion is being had is an indictment of the Labor states; they have failed spectacularly in their oversight task in this area. If this is indicative of what wall-to-wall Labor can produce, I cringe for the future of regulatory and financial oversight in the country. I look forward to the committee's further oversight of ASIC and especially to ASIC's oversight to deal with the issues of short selling and margin loans. The committee will continue to provide oversight of ASIC. NA",160

237,Mr JOHNSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I move: That the House: (1) recognises the strategic importance of India to 21st century global geo-politics; and (2) encourages the Australian Government to reverse its short-sighted decision to cancel Australia's uranium sales to India. Tonight I want to speak about the greatness that is India, a country of profound importance to Australia. Before I continue with my contribution in the parliament tonight, I want to acknowledge the Honorary Consul of India in Brisbane, Professor Sarva-Daman Singh, who very kindly invited me to the 61st anniversary celebrations of India's independence that were held in the Ryan electorate. Professor Sarva-Daman Singh is a constituent of Ryan and a very distinguished Ryan resident. He is very learned and works at the University of Queensland, where his reputation is very significant. I also want to take the opportunity to thank and endorse my friend the member for Mitchell. I know that he has a very large number of constituents of Indian descent in his electorate. I am sure that they will continue to support him for his strong representations on behalf of the Indian community in the Mitchell electorate. India is a country rich in culture and tradition. This is a country of over one billion people. This is a country that is the world's largest democracy. This is a nuclear power. This is a country strategically located in South Asia. India holds memberships of international councils, including the UN, the Commonwealth, the WTO and the East Asia Summit. This is a country whose economy is growing. Mr Singh, the Prime Minister of India, in 2007 said of his country: Today, India is very different from the India of 1991. It is now a vibrant market-place. Our entrepreneurs are aggressively investing overseas ... We have a US$700 billion economy that is growing at 7–8% ... So, clearly, this is a country that is on the move. This is a country that matters today in global politics, but it will matter even more in the foreign policy decisions of all countries in the decades ahead. Indeed, India is a country that will play its part in shaping geopolitical landscape and architecture of 21st century. Therefore, as the federal member for Ryan-having a very good relationship with the hundreds and hundreds of Ryan constituents of Indian descent and certainly having a deep interest in the views of the Indian community-I want to say very clearly on the record here in the House of Representatives that I am certainly for India, and Australia must certainly be for India. The Howard government was certainly for India, with its decision to enter into an agreement last August to sell it Australian uranium. The Rudd government makes much of its international expertise and its vision, but it is the Rudd government that cancelled the agreement forged by the Howard government. The Rudd government must now state clearly and publicly whether it believes that Australia should sell our uranium to India. In a positive move-I want to acknowledge it as a positive move-the Foreign minister, Mr Smith, indicated at the August 21-22 meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group that Australia would support the deal. If Australia had opposed India at the IAEA or the NSG-where, because we have the world's largest reserves of uranium, we are a significant voice-it would have been a savage blow to the Australia-India relationship. But, as we now know, most regrettably, on 24 August, the 45-member NSG refused to lift its 34-year-old embargo on nuclear trade with India. Why is this important? It is important because, under the Nuclear Suppliers Group rules, all nuclear trade with India is banned. Critically, uranium sales to India would allow it to develop its civilian energy capacterest, ity. This, of course, would help combat global warming by allowing the world's largest democracy to develop zero-emissions the polluting nuclear energy. Notwithstanding the the collective decision of the NSG, the next step for the Rudd government is to reverse its ideological opposition to selling uranium to India, and I call on the Rudd government to do this. Supplying uranium to India and helping it to move more to nuclear energy would be the single greatest course of action that this country could take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the world's largest democracy. It seems, however, that the Rudd government is stubborn and implacable; it remains ideologically opposed to uranium sales to India. (Time expired)",162
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Haase-I second the motion.,163
239,Mr DREYFUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The rise of Asia, in particular China and India, is one of the defining features of the 21st century. It is an exciting development for Australia, for the region and for the world. India has turned outwards and is engaging at an intensity not seen in the second half of the last century. Although India still faces many challenges, its liberal democracy, free press and independent judiciary as well as vibrant civil society give enormous reassurance that it can overcome the challenges that it faces. What we are seeing is remarkable. The commercial genius of Indian entrepreneurs is being released, with stunning results. India has established rates of economic growth of seven to eight per cent per annum. One can only applaud this incredible transformation that we are watching unfold: the return of India to the centre of global industry and commerce. India's rise will inevitably make it a strategic power. It has begun to focus on Australia's area of traditional diplomatic inEast Asia, as a market and as a key area for its security interests. Australia welcomes India's rise and its greater interest in East Asia. The government has stated publicly that it supports India's permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council as part of the United Nations reform. We welcomed India as a founding member of the East Asian Summit and we will support India's membership of APEC when the moratorium ends in 2010. We are moving to steadily strengthen our defence cooperation with India. Australia has also made as a priority the raising of bilateral relations with India to a new, higher level. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade have hosted their Indian counterparts. The Prime Minister has indicated that he wishes to visit India later this year, and other senior ministers are likely to visit over the coming months. Australia has also been invited to be an observer in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, SARC, which is a clear indication of our growing standing in India and in its region. The government is committed to taking the relationship to a new, higher level and we are determined to bring it to the front rank of our bilateral partspecifically nerships. Perhaps I could say something now about uranium, the second point raised in this motion. The member for Ryan has clearly failed to understand the important responsibility that Australia bears in holding the world's largest reserve, of uranium. It is incumbent on this nation to act responsibly as a secure supplier of energy resources to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to lead by example in the application of strict nuclear safeguards to uranium exports. This government strongly supports the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. In line with this support, it is this government's policy to supply uranium only to those countries which are parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and with which Australia has concluded a bilateral safeguards agreement. This has been a long standing position of the Australian government. It is worth remembering that, as long ago as 1976, in considering the development of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory, the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry under Justice Fox considered the complex issue of ensuring that adequate safeguards existed against diversion of uranium exports to weapons making. In his report, Justice Fox recommended: No sales of Australian uranium should take place to any country not party to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. Export should be subject to the fullest and most effective safeguards agreements, and be supported by fully adequate backup agreements applying to the entire civil nuclear industry in the country supplied ... It is worth remembering that this recommendation was accepted by the then Fraser government. India is not a party to the NPT and, on this basis, Australia will not supply uranium to India. This is a policy of principle. It is a long standing policy. It is not directed at India, but it is important that we approach this issue with consistency. Australia's influence in the international arena is dependent on our credibility-we must behave in accordance with our stated aims. To do otherwise would undermine our credibility and risk Australia's standing in the region. NA",163
240,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Diabetes",164
241,Mrs MOYLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Pearce) (9.30 pm)Tomorrow, some of our pre-eminent researchers and medical practitioners will come to Parliament House to continue a dialogue about diabetes, which builds on the Futures Forum held in this parliament last year. It is therefore timely to talk about one of the serious complications of diabetes: diabetic foot syndrome. Recently, I had the benefit of visiting Berlin and Hamburg to examine the German government's plan to trial KCI Medical's topical negative pressure treatment. This issue is very relevant following a report from Access Economics on 22 August 2008, which revealed that the obesity epidemic is costing Australia $58 billion. We know that obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes. There are many health complications for those diagnosed with diabetes and one of them is diabetic foot syndrome, which can lead to limb amputations. In fact, the International Diabetes Foundation estimates that, every 30 seconds, one person somewhere in the world loses a limb from amputation due to diabetic sores or ulcers. This issue requires urgent attention. Thanks to companies such as KCI, much headway has been made in treating diabetic foot syndrome. This treatment benefits diabetics as well as bedridden patients and others with lesions that will not heal unaided. Diabetic foot syndrome is a risk amongst patients with type 2 diabetes-diabetes mellitus or sugar diabetes as it is commonly known-and that risk increases where they also have peripheral neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Such patients have an increased risk of amputation resulting from diabetic foot syndrome. Foot lesions affect more than 10 per cent of patients with diabetes mellitus at some point in their life and are amongst the most dreaded complications of this disease. They can cause prolonged periods of immobility and discomfort. In fact, some never heal and some are life-threatening. Year-after-year in Australia, one in every 200 diabetics loses a leg. The cost of foot ulcerations to the individual and to society is considerable. The aetiology and progression of foot lesions in diabetics requires careful management. During my visit to Berlin and Hamburg, I was able to hear first hand from experts in the field that a comprehensive disease management program requiring all diabetic patients to undergo a foot examination, including neuropathy and pulse status checks at least once a year, reduces the risk of complications leading to amputation. Patients at risk also have a shoe-wear check on a quarterly basis. Complementing its disease management program for diabetic foot syndrome, the German ministry has agreed to a three year trial of KCI's topical negative pressure treatment. This treatment is a vacuumassisted closure for diabetic wounds. From discussions during my visit to Germany, both in Berlin and Hamburg, there is strong support for the use of topical negative pressure treatment for the treatment of complex chronic wounds, within hospitals, in ambulatory patient care and in multiple settings outside the hospital environment. The German health ministry trials will emphasise the need for appropriate training and quality systems. This is an essential component of success for those who deliver and manage patient care both within and without the hospital environment. I am grateful for the opportunity KCI afforded for me to speak to the health ministry and other specialists in Germany and to hear of the successful operation of these procedures, which can be lifesaving and certainly save people from a long and painful recovery from complications arising from diabetic foot syndrome. The disease management program is preferable to having to implement expensive treatment programs once a lesion occurs. For some time now the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, a bipartisan group, has called on the government to ensure that people with diabetes have their feet examined regularly. I once again raise this matter in the parliament in the hope that it will come a policy in the future so as to avoid terrible complication of diabetes in this country. Werriwa Electorate: Homelessness",164
242,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (9.35 pm)Recently, in my electorate of Werriwa, I held a forum on homelessness and a number of people, including homeless people, service providers and community organisations across both the Campbelltown and the Liverpool regions attended. They all made a great contribution to the national debate on homelessness. The organisations and agencies represented included the New South Wales Police, Liverpool and Campbelltown city councils, Allawah House, Ingleburn Rotary Club, Macarthur Diversity Services, St Vincent de Paul, Marcia Women's Refuge, Uniting Care Burnside, Stepping Stone Community, the Parramatta Mission's Miller Campus and various elements of the local media. The forum identified the challenges faced by both our local people who find themselves homeless and the various providers who are committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness. Of particular relevance to the forum was hearing from two young women, Lynette and Nazhia, both 17 years of age, who for different reasons had found themselves homeless. Both girls spoke very bravely about their circumstances and ended by taking the opportunity to thank the local community for their support and understanding. However, during this forum, the point was made that no single service for homelessness is available in south-west Sydney for young males. Earlier this year, when visiting the crisis accommodation provided at Allawah House, I was fortunate in having the opportunity of spending time talking with the two young women I have mentioned alreadybe- this is where they had been accommodatedthis and some of their colleagues there. These young women described their backgrounds and also expressed their concern for their brothers and male friends who had nowhere to go, even though these young men had found themselves homeless for a reason almost identical to that of the girls, which was domestic violence. Early intervention is critical because the last thing we want to see is the police arresting young boys and then committing them into the juvenile justice system. Quite frankly, increased policing is not the answer for homelessness. Alarmingly, one of the main concerns contributing to homelessness that was raised during the forum was the rate of domestic violence that we are experiencing in the south-west of Sydney. Extraordinary pressures are being placed on our local service providers. The local police readily verify what the New South Wales crime statistics show-that there is an unacceptably high number of apprehended domestic violence orders in Sydney, as they apply in the outer metropolitan areas of Sydney in particular. Of importance to the service providers was the availability of appropriate funding to ensure that there are sufficient qualified social workers, personnel and trained volunteers to assist particularly young women and children in crisis. We need to ensure that victims of domestic violence are not the potential subjects of recurring homelessness. This needs to be done at all levels of government in order to address this issue. Assistance for young people to take part in education, training and employment services was also seen to be a vital component in the strategy to fight the root causes of homelessness for young people. The emphasis on education is critical not only in building and establishing one's position in the community but also in building self-esteem and broadening the options for young people. Young people facing homelessness need extra support to participate in education and training. As a couple of homeless kids indicated to me, the normal assistance provided by parents, such as helping with homework et cetera, is taken for granted. In their when they were living in a refuge, they felt they needed extra support in order to keep up with the rigours of normal education. In respect of that support, I would like to mention Michael and Robin Kidd, who are both members of the Ingleburn Rotary Club. More importantly, they both retired as the principals of two local high schools last year. They now go and visit Allawah House and Harold Lodge and tutor young kids in their homework in order to keep them engaged in the education system. This is an issue of major concern. When I look at the statistics in my immediate area, I see that there are some 200 to 400 young people who are homeless at night. This is something that we must focus on, and we must do it now. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Football and Netball",166
243,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to pay tribute to and to honour the work of the football and netball clubs within the electorate of Flinders. I do this the basis that these clubs are mendous social support and a great virtue for people from across the electorate with regard to society, exercise, health and discipline. As we approach the grand finals across the various leagues, this is an opportunity to acknowledge the work of the leagues, the executive members who volunteer in the clubs, the members who volunteer to do work for the clubs and, above all else, the mums and dads who help with the junior clubs. I want to speak about the extent of both football and netball clubs within the electorate of Flinders. There are five leagues across Flinders. Firstly, there is the Alberton league, which includes the Dalyston Football and Netball Club, the Kilcunda-Bass Football and Netball Club, the Stony Creek Football case, and Netball Club, and the Phillip Island football and netball clubs. Secondly, there is the Casey-Cardinia football and netball league, which includes the Devon Meadows football and netball clubs and Tooradin football and netball clubs. Thirdly, there is the Ellinbank and district football and netball league, which includes the Catani football and netball clubs, the Koo Wee Rup football and netball clubs, the Lang Lang football and netball clubs, and the Nyora football and netball clubs. Fourthly, there is the Nepean football league, which includes the Crib Point Football Club, the Dromana Football Club-of which I am the proud holder of the No. 1 ticket-the Pearcedale Football Club, the Red Hill Football Club, the Rosebud Football Club, the Rye Football Club, the Somerville Football Club, the Sorrento Football Club and the Tyabb Football Club. Fifthly, there is the Peninsula football league, Clubs of which Hastings is our representative. I add to that list the A-grade RecLink, which helps those who are disadvantaged and down on their luck. In Hastings, the Westernport Waron riors are the proud representatives of the a source of treMornington Peninsula. I acknowledge, in particular, the work of the clubs on four fronts. Firstly, in relation to health and exercise, these football and netball clubs are fundamental in helping kids and young adults have an outlet for a healthy attitude, to be engaged in sport, to be engaged in competitive sport and to be engaged with all the rigour, discipline and personal training. Secondly, as I mentioned at the outset, they are a source of great society. We see the community coming together. On Saturday I attended the preliminary final between my club, Dromana, and Frankston, in the Nepean league. There were probably well over 1,000 people in attendance at the game. It was a tremendous example of the community coming together. It was done in good spirit and it was an outstanding result, with Dromana proceeding to the grand final with both the seniors through and the reserves already through. I wish them all the best. Thirdly, it is training for young men and women in leadership. It is the provision of personal discipline, of giving them a sense of resolve, purpose and meaning. It does not substitute for other areas of life, but it is fundamental outlet and area for personal development. Fourthly, there is the role played by volunteers. These volunteers may be at the level of the league executive, at the executive level of individual clubs or at the organisational level of senior or junior clubs. They could be mums and dads who run the barbecue or the stalls. But in these clubs across the peninsula, across Western Port and across the Bass Coast, you see people of great generosity giving their time to help young people. It is a great way forward. Finally, I wish all of the teams the best they go into grand finals over the coming two weeks. Most of the grand finals are two weeks from now; however, this weekend the Nepean football league will see Sorrento versus Dromana. Whilst I wish Sorrento well, I hope Dromana prevails in the firsts. In the seconds, we have Dromana versus Frankston, and my allegiances are well known there. Whether they are football or netball clubs, they are great clubs with great people running them. We need to do all we can to provide services and support. There are a series of things that we can do. I congratulate and thank all of those involved in these great volunteer organisations. Skilled Migration",167
244,Mrs IRWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"In April 2005 I was able to attend the InterParliamentary Union meeting in Manila. On the agenda of that meeting was the issue of global labour markets. There were calls by delegations from countries including India and the Philippines for countries such as Australia to open our labour markets to people from those countries. In speaking to the conference I explained that Australia has a long tradition of accepting migrants to our country rather than guest workers. I did, however, indicate my private view that there a would be mutual benefit in allowing seasonal guest workers to come to Australia from South Pacific nations. As it happened, the conference in Manila was followed by a bilateral visit to the Solomon Islands and that gave me the opportunity to see first hand some of the ways in which the development of South Pacific nations could be assisted by allowing limited guest worker placements in Australia. Apart from providing much-needed remittances to families at home and the potential to save to improve private business opportunities, work as in industries such as agriculture, forestry, tourism, hospitality and health care would greatly improve the economic and social development of Pacific states. I have been pleased to see that the Labor government appears keen to trial guest worker arrangements for some Pacific states. I was also pleased to note that during last week's visit to Australia by the Prime Minister of East Timor, Xanana Gusmao, the topic of guest worker programs was discussed. This came as a particularly pleasing development to me, as an earlier rebuff on the issue had led me to believe that guest worker programs were of less interest to developing states than I had at first thought. As it happened, shortly after the IPU meeting in Manila and the visit to the Solomons, I attended an East Timor Independence Day function in my electorate. The guest of honour at the function was the then foreign minister of East Timor, Jose Ramos-Horta, who is now the President. Having recently discussed the topic of guest workers from developing countries, I took the opportunity of using my speech to extend the idea to East Timor. I told the gathering that such an arrangement with one of our nearest neighbours could have great benefit to both nations. I pointed out that participants would be able to develop a potential tourist industry, learn skills in tality and catering, and improve English language skills. To my surprise, when RamosHorta rose to speak, he rejected the proposal out of hand, insisting that East Timor look to Portugal and Europe for language and skills and that Australian involvement was not welcome. It seems, therefore, that the government of East Timor has had a change of heart, and there is hope that suitable programs can be developed which will lead to many young East Timorese benefiting from employment opportunities in Australia. As I said at the beginning, Australia has traditionally preferred to supplement its workforce with permanent migration rather than guest workers, and I believe there remains a preference for migration. It follows that guest worker programs should be relatively small in scope and be seen to provide economic and social benefits to the nations providing the guest workers. I have spoken about this issue to young people in my electorate, where there remains a stubborn pool of youth unemployment. The concern of many is that we should be providing employment opportunities for our own before admitting other young, unskilled workers. But, provided the schemes do not disadvantage young Australians, the benefits in promoting growth and stability in our neighbouring countries far outweigh any downside. Through our armed forces, Australia has played a major role in bringing stability to our region. However, the best prospects for future security depend on economic growth and the development of civil society in countries that are our near neighbours. Wellplanned and administered guest worker schemes which include training and protect the interests of participants as well as Australian youth can play a major role in the economic and social development of our region. hospiThere is much to be gained by all parties involved, and I would hope that trials of guest worker schemes can proceed in the near future. Education FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen) (9.50 pm)-I rise tonight to speak about an issue which I am sure I share with you, Mr Speaker, with every member of this place who is a parent and with all of the parents listening to this broadcast. The issue is probably one of the most difficult decisions that parents have to make, and that is the choice of education for their children. I count myself extremely fortunate in the sort of education I had-in my primary, secondary and tertiary educationwhich my parents made sacrifices for. I know that the parliamentary secretary on duty tonight, the member for Bennelong, and I went to the same school in Brisbane and received an excellent education from the Sisters of Mercy. Prior to the last election, parents around Australia were promised an education revolution. I guess if we think of the term ‘revolution' we think of a change of power, a change in the structural organisation, and when we hear the term ‘revolution' we think this is change that will happen quickly. Well, there has been no storming of the Bastille, as far as the delivery of the educational changes that were promised goes. I think it is fair to say that, prior to the last election, the only real detail that we had about the education revolution was that every senior student, from year 9 upwards, was promised a computer. I have been on a bit of a hunt across my electorate of MCEwen trying to find whether we have any of these computers in any of the hundreds of schools that I have in my electorate. I have identified a couple of schools which have been informed that they will get some computers, but the trek to find the computers has revealed a sparse trail. Since the election we have been told about a little bit more flesh being put on the bones of this education revolution concerning trade training centres. We have found out that there is less than $1 million for these schools. Although these schools were promised the earth, in fact, once again, nothing has been delivered. It would appear that schools will be lucky to get an upgrade of an oven or some extensions or renovations to the woodwork centre-nothing like what is really needed to equip young people with the sorts of skills that they need to work and the sort of environment in which they would want to develop trade skills and certification. The latest thing we have heard about, as another tranche of the education revolution, is school funding based on teacher performance. Once again, as a parent I do not disagree at all with that. But this is where I strike a problem, because I am very concerned about the sorts of schools I have across my electorate. Mr Speaker, you would know a number of these schools. Tonight, I will give a couple of examples. I highlight the Healesville High School and the Alexandra high school, in particular. You probably would find this difficult to believe, Mr Speaker, but in the Alexandra high school there are exposed heating pipes inside classrooms. If this were a factory site, the unions would close it down on OH&S grounds, yet we expect the teachers there to perform at their best and motivate young students. Surely, if we are talking about making payments to highly qualified teachers, we are not talking about an even playing field here. The schools in our rural areas are at an enormous disadvantage. How will this matter be addressed? I want the very best for my daughters and, in turn, what my parents wanted for me. Parents want the very best for their children, and the education revolution is not delivering. (Time expired) Climate Change",168
245,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the central plank of our government's efforts to confront the impact of climate change on the Australian economy and on our environment, The scheme, as outlined in our green paper, aims to reform and transform our economy as we move to a more carbon constrained future, bearing in mind Labor's long-term target of reducing greenhouse emissions by 60 per cent of 2000 levels by 2050. In the words of Sir Nicholas Stern, ‘the greatest market failure the world has seen' has come about because there has been, up until now, no cost attached to producing carbon pollution and no limit as to how much we produce. It is true that economic growth has been fuelled by a huge reliance on carbonproducing fossil fuels, but the cost of that is now being realised across the globe. If we are going to effectively tackle climate change we need to harness the power of the market. In essence, our proposed scheme will set limits on how much carbon pollution industry can produce, with the government selling permits up to that limit, thus creating the incentive for business to look for cleaner energy options. Under our scheme, companies can buy and sell permits between themselves and in so doing provide the market mechanism to find the most efficient ways of reducing carbon pollution. We recognise of course that there is no cost-free way to tackle climate change. The effect of putting a price on carbon will be profound and cannot be ignored. That is why it is proposed that moneys raised from the selling of permits will be used to help business and households in moving to a carbon constrained future. Assistance will also be provided to the most heavily emissions intensive trade exposed activities. This is of particular importance to my region, which is heavily reliant for its economic output on coal mining and steelmaking. The green paper recognises that trade exposed industries may not be able to pass on costs, as they face prices set in international markets and currently compete against companies that will not have comparable carbon constraints. The government are very conscious of the risk of industries choosing to relocate elsewhere. Certainly, carbon leakage is counter to our objectives. Our current preferred position is to allocate of permits to emissions intensive trade exposed activities. It is proposed to provide transitional assiswish tance in the form of a share of free permits to the most emissions intensive trade exposed activities. BlueScope Steel, located in my electorate of Throsby, will fall within this category. There is, however, a continuing concern of that company about the availability of transitional assistance to cover future expansion and growth in production. Similarly, there are some outstanding issues of concern to the local coal industry. They have raised with me the issue of fugitive emissions and whether they can be objectively accounted for, particularly in our local underground mines which provide coal for our steelmaking. They argue that no current emissions trading scheme incorporates fugitive emissions in the mining sector. They have also raised with me that the formula in the green paper, which uses tonnes of emissions per million dollars of revenue, may not be the best measure, as their recent high revenues are largely the result of the huge hike we have seen in commodity prices. I am confident that these concerns will be further explored in the ongoing discussions between industry and a range of our ministers. In a recent speech, the Minister for Climate Change and Water emphasised: … the precise thresholds, proposed rates of assistance, the structure of assistance and the preliminary list of activities that would be covered are indicative only. Ultimately, we need global action to tackle global climate change. However, developed economies should be showing the way. We need to move to a low-pollution economy in an economically responsible manner and in a way which protects our national interest, our industries and our jobs. However, we all need to accept that the longer we delay action the harder it will be and ultimately the up to 30 per cent more it will cost. Petition: Forrest Electorate",170
