2,Mr SA WFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Last Sunday marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new era for the Port Adelaide Football Club. The Port Adelaide footie club is the most successful footie club in Australia. It won its 34th premiership,13
3,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,A second-rate competition.,13
4,Mr SA WFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Well, it will move next year into the Australian Football League. Unlike the West Coast Eagles, who are just an amalgam club, Brisbane, Sydney, Fremantle or the Adelaide Crows, Port Adelaide is the first real club to be entered into the Australian Football League. Tomorrow in Port Adelaide the new coach, John Cahill, and the board will announce the first inaugural list of players who will front up for Port Power in 1997. By the way, it is interesting to note that the Port Adelaide Football Club has won 34 premierships in 68 grand finals in 126 years. It is by far the most successful club in Australia. We wish Port Power and its new organisation every success next year. I notice that the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is here. He was at the match; he, of course, has a family connection with Port Adelaide Football Club. We probably disagree on every matter except football. Perhaps he might add something as well.",13
5,Mr EOIN CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to highlight the case of a couple in my electorate who had their car stolen last week. Thankfully, it has now been recovered but with a little bit of damage. What concerns me is that my constituent was advised by the police that, from looking at the way the car was hot-wired, the perpetrators would have got the instructions from the Internet. I therefore did a search on the Internet of the words 'hot-wiring'. There are 68,000 entries. Obviously, I have not read each and every entry, but there is a web page with the title 'How to steal cars and get away with it'. It is of immense concern that illegal activities can be promoted and demonstrated on this public information highway. We have had kids injured by people building bombs from instructions on the net. Now we see that people are having their cars stolen, thanks to instructions being bandied about on the net. While I normally do not like to advocate censorship, there is an obvious need for there to be some regulation or control of what can go out on the net to prevent this sort of information being sent everywhere around the world. I am not saying for one minute that the Internet users are criminals. But we cannot allow this information to be made publicly available without any regulation. Australian Government Solicitor's Office: Parental Leave",13
6,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise a concern on behalf of Karen Laino of Landells Road, Pascoe Vale, who is employed as an ASO officer with the Australian Government Solicitor. She works in the legal administrative support area and was due to return from maternity leave on 13 May this year. She wrote advising that she wished to return on a part-time basis. She was told by Ms Lee Merwood that she would not be able to return on a part-time basis and that her only options were to return to work full-time or to take additional leave. She has lodged a regulation 83 grievancenot surprisingly-because the Australian Government Solicitor has an explicit obligation under the permanent part-time work Internet agreement to make permanent part-time work available to staff returning from parental leave. I find it extraordinary that the Australian Government Solicitor and this government should not be allowing her to return to part-time work, given that the Attorney-General's publication has said: We recognise that benefits to all parties will flow if our permanent part-time work positions are applied to a wider cross-section of our staff, subject to operational needs .... to allow better balancing of work and family commitments, whilst enabling them to pursue their careers. It is extraordinary that the government can give us this rhetoric about the value of permanent part-time work, yet not allow people in practice, like Karen Laino, to find part-time work when that is precisely what she wants. Port Adelaide Football Club",13
7,Mr WAKELIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is a pleasant coincidence indeed to support the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in our mutual enjoyment of that wonderful sport-Aussie rules. It was a great spectacle on Sunday, where the SANFL had decided to switch the match forward from the normal Saturday, and the South Australian public got right behind it. I wish Port Adelaide well in the AFL. Part of their club will remain in the SANFL competition, albeit in a different form. Port Adelaide's record speaks for itself. member for Port Adelaide has summarised that very well. I would like to come from a regional perspective this morning: the region that I come from is where Port Adelaide recruits many of its people from. The tradition that they have brought to our region and to Alberton as well augurs well for their future in AFL. I am sure that, within a year or two, we can expect great success. Trust Bank Tasmania",14
8,Mr QUICK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Tuesday was a very sad day for Tasmania, because the Trust Bank Tasmania, which holds a very unique position in Tasmanian history, made an appalling decision to close 10 of its branches throughout Tasmania. There were several in my electorate. The township of Geevestown, which is almost as far south in Australia as you can go, had its last remaining bank branch closed, placing an enormous social dislocation on the people of that area. There is no bank in Dover; there is now no bank in Geevestown. That area has an ageing population as well as having a very large unemployed population. Those people now have to use a very inadequate bus service to get to Huonville. One would assume that banks do have a social conscience. The managing director, Paul Kemp, has been attacked by me for the greedy profit driven position that the bank has taken in closing not only the Geevestown branch but also the Bridgewater branch in my electorate. I think it is something that the banks should take into account. It is not all profits. Some social responsibility should be shown by banks. Tuesday's decision was a very sad day for Tasmanians. People do access EFTPOS and the plastic card but this is not the only way banks should go. Over-the-counter trading is a unique part of banking and should be retained. The people in my electorate have been disadvantaged by an appalling decision by the Trust Bank to remove 10 of those branches. National Crime Authority",14
9,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 listened with interest to the speech by the honourable member for Kooyong (M: Georgiou) last The night on the National Crime Authority. I am pleased to see that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is sitting at the table. The measure used by the member for Kooyong of the NCA's performance over the years has been to divide the number of arrests by the budget and then extrapolate from that the success or otherwise of the NCA's performance on the basis of what it has cost per prosecution. Then there is the other assertion that the NCA ought to be somehow wound up or have its powers taken from it because it lost a particular case. If one were to use this analogy across the board one could say that one ought to wind up the Carlton Football Club because they failed to win the premiership this year or, in the case of police forces around the country, because in certain instances their performance may be down, or as a result of a number of circumstances they ought to be scrapped. Clearly that argument is nonsense. It is important that we recognise that the NCA is now performing a very valuable service, particularly in relation to other law enforcement agencies around the country. I can only urge the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority to support my proposal that the commmittee hold a full scale national inquiry evaluating the NCA's performance, its powers and whatever changes or otherwise may be necessary to ensure that the NCA is able to perform its duties to the best of its ability and perform its services to the nation effectively. MCGinty, Mr J.",14
10,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This morning I take the opportunity to pay tribute to a state parliamentary colleague and friend of mine, the Hon. Jim MCGinty, who this week resigned as leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party. It is always difficult to come to the view personally that one ought to resign a position of leadership. It is clear from the circumstances which have attached to this situation that Mr MCGinty came to that view by himself. We have one of those most unusual circumstances in politics where we have a leader who has tapped his deputy on the shoulder rather than the reverse, which occasionally occurs. I wish Mr MCGinty all success in his future career in the state parliamentary party as Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia and I wish Mr Gallop, a long standing friend and colleague, success and all the best as he endeavours to move from being leader of the state parliamentary party to Premier of Western Australia. Child Care",15
11,Ms HANSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to speak about the operational subsidy that has been withdrawn by the government from community based organisations and child care. In 1995 the operational subsidy cost $131 million. These are community based people who are trying to help their community with child care. Child-care assistance costs the government $745 million. Sole non-working parents are entitled to 55 paid child-care hours a week. We must stress the fact that it is the responsibility of sole non-working parents to care for their children, not the taxpayer's. I would like to see this figure reduced to 12 hours a week paid for by the taxpayer and not the proposed amount, 50 hours. Flood Mitigation",15
12,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is rather ironic that, having found it necessary to stand in this place on a number of occasions since being elected to complain about the government's decision to revoke drought assistance in the Hunter electorate, I now find it necessary to talk about flooding in my electorate. In about February this year the small town of Murrurundi was inundated by flood waters and, unfortunately, only a week or so ago the flooding occurred again. I understand that there has been some winding back by the government in the budget in the area of flood mitigation assistance to rural areas. These problems are not only confined to rural areas but, indeed, affect the urban areas of our cities. I understand that the Chairman of the Hunter Catchment Management Trust, Mr Harold Stembeck, is in Canberra today to visit a number of ministers and government members of this place. I implore all of those whom Mr Stembeck and his delegation will be speaking to to reconsider their approach to flood mitigation and understand that this is an important issue both in urban and rural Australia and one that has the potential to devastate the lives of people and devastate small towns. So I implore all those who will be meeting with Mr Sternbeck and his delegation today to listen carefully and to extend a sympathetic ear. Drug Trafficking",15
13,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise a matter of great concern in recent times, and that is the influx of the drug Ecstasy into Australia from overseas. Recently I had the opportunity to visit the National Criminal Intelligence Service in the UK and Interpol in Lyons, France. I was interested to learn of the enormous expansion in the manufacture and trafficking of the drug Ecstasy, particularly in the United Kingdom and spreading on the European mainland. There are some strong links between the UK and Australia in terms of visitors and transactions. It is a matter of grave concern that we are seeing now some substantial importations, and this is only what we are able to detect from the cursory customs service that we have at the moment. We are seeing now a serious influx of Ecstasy into Australia manufactured in the United Kingdom, in Holland or elsewhere. All I can do, with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) present in the chamber, is to ask the government to seriously reconsider some of the cuts it has made in relation to the fight against drug trafficking on the part of the Australian Federal Police and in the case of the Customs Service. The Customs Service is Australia's first barrier in the fight against drug trafficking. Western Australia, it is estimated, has up to $1 billion of illicit drugs coming in over its frontier each year. That is a matter of grave concern, not only to Western Australians but to all Australians. I can only urge the government to seriously rethink its customs strategy.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 9.45 a.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 9 October 1996 the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Petrol Industry",16
15,Mr LATHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve for the direction of the petrol industry under this government. Unhappily, the oil majors, the 'four sisters' in Australia, have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in their pocket. He is their lap dog. As the government frames its response to the ACCC report, one thing is certain: as sure as night follows day, the big oil companies, the big end of town, will be the big winners. Collins Street Costello will defend their interests at any cost, at the expense of consumers, at the expense of workers in the industry, especially tanker drivers, and at the expense of small business-the service station owners, the franchise holders, the distributors. In question time on 19 September, the Treasurer ducked a genuine decision on the petrol industry by deferring the government's response to the ACCC report until an unspecified later time. The longer the Treasurer delays, the more comprehensively he breaks the government's election promise to guarantee cheaper petrol prices in country areas. The most important thing in the petrol industry is to defend the interests of consumers, employees and franchise holders against the four sisters' oligopoly. The Treasurer also foolishly contradicted himself by claiming that oil terminals were continuing to open to downstream access, yet the Laidley agreement prevented access. Just one day earlier, at a Senate estimates committee hearing, an ACCC representative said: It has long been the view of the commission ... that Laidley, in more recent years, has not really existed. This confirms a key finding of the ACCC petrol industry report which the Treasurer, sadly enough, has failed to read. In truth, the oil companies control terminal access in this industry across Australia. When the Treasurer talks about access, it is small 'a' access. He is trying to use Laidley as an alibi for avoiding the big 'A' access issues in the industry, that is, the type of downstream access which would facilitate wholesale price competitioncompetition which would benefit service station operators and ultimately consumers, especially in the bush. The significance of access is to create an active market at the point of wholesale pricing, not necessarily to change the physical means by which petrol products are distributed in Australia. For more than 20 years, federal and state governments have been commissioning and receiving reports about petrol pricing. This has primarily been in response to community concern about pricing volatility and differential city-country pricing. These reports have not been successful because, by and large, they have failed to address the core anticompetitive structure of the petrol industry in Australia. This is a straightforward case of an oligopoly of multinational oil companies, the four sisters-Texaco, BP, Mobil and Shellfunctioning within a vertically integrated industry structure to achieve anti-competitive market outcomes. I have a diagram that has been prepared by the MTAA which I shall seek leave to incorporate in Hansard at the conclusion of my remarks. This demonstrates succinctly and effectively the structure of the industry. It shows the extent of industry integration between the refinery, terminal and service station stages-that is, the production, distribution and retail sectors of the petroleum industry. Consumers and service station operators need protection in this industry from the anti-competitive practices of the four sisters. This is an industry where regulation works much better than deregulation; where regulation is more effective than deregulation. This government, of course, to its lasting shame, has failed to move quickly on the Beazley bill, the measure which would amend the Trade Practices Act to outlaw the harsh and oppressive conduct of big business against the interests of franchise holders. It is a key reform for the petrol industry because there is an imbalance between market strength-the big oil companies against the franchise holders, the service station operators. They require effective protection under the Trade Practices Act. They require the passage by this House of Representatives of the Beazley bill as soon as possible. It should not be referred away to some House committee chaired by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). It should not be referred away for a report which will be ineffective in its implementation by the government; it should be acted on. There is a bill before the House and it should be debated and carried by this House of Representatives. Those small business interests and consumers in the industry also require strengthening of the sites act, not its abolition, as recommended by the ACCC and endorsed by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). They require an active market at the retail stage, not the development of these multi-site franchises across the petrol retail sector. Real competition in the retail sector, not oil major dominance, should be government policy. The Shell multi-site franchises, where 35 stations are being aggregated under company control in Sydney's west, for instance, should be outlawed. We should have an active market and genuine small business competition and industry development in the petrol industry in Australia. Why should stations in western Sydney, in the seat of Lindsay at Penrith in particular, be allowed to close? Why should we have the rationalisation of this industry according to anti-competitive multi-site franchise arrangements by Shell? Why should jobs be lost? Why should services be lost? Why should consumers in western Sydney face less competition and the medium term prospect of higher prices because of the aggregation of those Shell service stations? This government needs to step in right now. It should not wait for the report produced by the member for Cowan; it should not delay any further. The AC<;i:C report was delivered to the Treasurer on 15 August. It is two months since that occurred and all he has done is sit on his hands. His response in question time a few weeks ago was no response. All he said was that the government has these things under consideration and he sought an alibi out of Laidley. It is a fraudulent alibi to talk about the Laidley agreement as a problem in the petrol industry. It has not been in operation for quite some time. I am very supportive of the Shell National Action Group and the letter that they have sent to all members of the House of Representatives urging proper regulation and proper Trade Practices Act amendment to protect the interests of Shell service station operators against these insidious multi-site franchises. I am pleased to quote from that open letter as follows: The companies intend increasing their profitability by increasing their involvement in the retail sector of the petrol industry not just for petrol but for everything sold at service stations. Shell in particular has made no secret of the fact that they want to replace all of their 600-plus independent franchisees with approximately 17 company operated networks each containing about 35 service stations. The other oil companies have indicated that they will be following Shell's lead. Furthermore, when the other oil companies follow that lead, the temptation for retail price collusion between these network managers will be greater because it will be easier to achieve and the effects will be both immediate and spread over a wider geographical area. These company operated networks are not just a minor adjustment to Shell's franchise arrangements, they are a major step towards achieving the goal which the oil industry has been relentlessly pursuing in Australia for 20 years-vertical integration. And this is not in the best interests of Australian motorists as it removes the only Australian equity now present in the petroleum industry-Australian franchisees who make their investments here in Australia. Mr Henderson, who chairs the Shell National Action Group, concludes as follows: I believe that the oil companies should be stripped of their newfound retailing powers prohibited from any further involvement in country beyond the wholesale level. I could not agree more with that approach to public policy for the petroleum industry: an active retail market with the outlawing of multi-site franchises so that small business interests are genuinely protected; the passage of the Beazley bill which outlaws harsh and unconscionable conduct against franchise holders by these big, multinational oil companies; and access, not small 'a' access using Laidley as a false alibi but access that leads to price competition in the wholesale market. Pricing competition is the key: not some National Party obsession with physical access to terminals with some pegged price at the and t-rmi?al gate, but actual real price competithis tIon m the wholesale market. That is the direction in which the government should be moving: not sitting on this report, with the Treasurer sitting on his hands for two months. He should actively defend the interests of consumers and small business in places like Penrith in western Sydney and guarantee that the government will fulfil its election promise to give country petrol consumers a much better deal.

16,Mr RICHARD EVANS,MTAA,"Today I grieve for the Australian taxpayer-those taxpayers that toil every day, be they in the PAYE tax system or a small business operator. I grieve for the larger businesses that pay their fair share of tax and I grieve for those in the community who believe that the Australian tax system should be fair for all-because clearly it is not. Last week at the politics-free tax summit it was agreed by the parties present that a review of the tax system was needed: a review to bring equity to the tax system; a review to make it fair for all; a review to bring those in the community that do not pay their share of tax to account; and a review to ensure a system that is fair, honest and easy to understand. It is clear that this is not the case in Australia at the moment. Too many people, businesses included, are not paying their fair share of tax. Indeed, there is an article today on the front page of the Herald Sun about the Taxation Office wanting to catch up on tax dodgers. I am sure there is not one member in this House that would disagree with the notion that we need to pay for the services that governments provide for the community. To do this we need a tax system. But we need a fair tax system. During the last federal election the then government, now the opposition, identified some Australian scoundrels that were not paying their fair share of tax. In fact they were hoping to pick up many millions of dollars cracking down on these Australians who were not prepared to pay their fair share-a very honourable thing and I am sure this attitude would be supported by many taxpayers in the community. But there are other tax avoiders within our community not paying their fair share. And it is these tax avoiders, using a quirk within the tax act, that I wish to talk about today. These tax avoiders would argue they are doing nothing wrong and meeting their tax liabilities, and I would have to admit that they would be absolutely right. However, this does not mean that their avoidance of tax is fair and just for the remainder of the Australian community, particularly those that have suffered and are suffering from their very commercial operations. Just because the system is abused does not make it right and I strongly believe that tax avoiders should be brought to account. Currently in Australia there are organisations that pay little tax, if any, even though they earn millions of dollars in profits every year. Where the inequity in the system really hits home for these organisations is when an employee earning $450 per week pays more tax than his employer. How is this possible, one might ask, when the employer has an operating profit of over $1.4 million? How is this fair-an organisation that returns a profit of over $1.4 million and pays no tax? What would the taxpayer, the battler, the small business operator, the family trying to make ends meet paying their fair share of tax make of this? These Australians, I am sure, would think the organisation was a tax avoider and should be brought to account. And who is this organisation who is legally but unjustly avoiding tax? It is almost every registered club in Australia protected under the unfair mutuality principle. These clubs are using a quirk of the tax system to avoid paying their fair share of tax and, I might add, it is totally legal but totally unjust-totally unfair to those Australians who pay their fair share of tax and totally unfair to those businesses which are in competition and pay their share of tax. It is totally without precedent and comparison. The mutuality principle provides that where a number of persons contribute to a common fund that is created and managed as a common interest, any excess earnings that are generated from the use of the fund are not, for the purpose of taxation, to be considered as income. In essence, licensed clubs are only assessable for taxation on income that is earned from trading with non-members. However, I think it is time the spirit of mutuality is reviewed. Some clubs have become multimillion dollar industries and have an unfair advantage against other sections in the tourism and hospitality industry that do not share the same tax benefits. These clubs avoid their fair share of tax whilst at same time they have a comprehensive competitive advantage over any competitor who pays their rightful share of tax. Some examples of where the tax exemption has benefited registered clubs which paid nil tax in 1995 include the Western Suburbs Leagues Club which had over $9 million profit, yet paid no tax; the Campbelltown Catholic Club which had over $3 million profit, but paid no tax; the Illawarra Catholic Club which had $1.7 million or more in profit, yet paid no tax; the Shell Harbour Workers Club which had $1.2 million in profit, yet paid no tax; the St George Leagues Club in Kogarah which had over $3 million in profit, yet paid no tax; and the Twin Towers Service Club which had $1.4 million of profit, yet paid no tax. These were significant profit figures yet no tax was paid on these amounts. Another fine example of the way clubs can legally avoid tax and skirt around the mutuality principle is provided by the Hellenic Club in the ACT. Recently, approximately $600,000 was spent in a promotion activity for the club to attract patrons-not members, but patrons. Offers of a house worth more than $230,000 to be won was advertised with full pages in local community newspapers. In addition, there were 1,000 free return flights to the Gold Coast up for grabs, costing around $340,000. Surely, promotions like these, which are very elaborate,. must be a disadvantage to tax-paying businesses which simply cannot afford promotions or giveaways like these. Where do they get this excess money to provide such fantastic rewards for their patrons? It is clear that it is by avoiding tax through the mutuality principle. This legal tax avoidance must stop and it must stop on the basis of tax equity. It must stop because it provides a commercially unfair advantage to clubs and it must stop because these operations are not paying their fair share of tax. To change the system does not introduce a new tax-far from it. To change the system just means that the clubs pay taxes on their businesses, like all other commercial operations in Australia. But it is not only me the calling for a change in the system; in March 1995 these inequities were brought to the attention of the House-under the previous Labor government-by the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. The committee recommended: The Treasurer examine the mutuality principle as it applies to the club industry, its effect on government revenue and its contribution to taxation inequity between clubs and other tourism providers; and the Treasurer refer this matter to the Industry Commission. The committee noted: On the evidence presented to it, the Committee concludes that the application of the mutuality principle has benefited some clubs to a degree where they are able to compete unfairly with businesses which do not have similar taxation advantage. In this respect mutuality, as it applies to clubs which engage in substantial commercial activity, is inconsistent with the equity criterion of good taxation, and requires review. Why should the vast majority of Australians pay their fair share of tax and, because of some outdated quirk in the tax system, these multimillion dollar enterprises do not? I want to emphasise that the role of a community club is not to be underestimated. They provide a valuable service for their members and the community. However, the original premise for the mutuality principle is that it is for the benefit of the club or association as under section 23G of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Other businesses in the industry such as hotels, gymnasiums, butchers and video hire stores are being drastically disadvantaged because they do not have the same tax exemption. These multimillion dollar operations which do not pay their fair share of tax operate under the Waratah formula. This relies on the club providing a sample of non-member visitors and then applying this figure to turnover, and thus profit. This very loose income tax procedure requires urgent regulation to ensure that these tax avoiders pay their fair share of tax. My grievance today is not with the massive benefits these multimillion dollar operations receive from avoiding their fair share of tax; my grievance is with the inequities of the taxation system in Australia. The issue I have raised today is but one example where sections in the tourism and hospitality industry are disadvantaged because of the anomalies in the taxation system. The standing committee recommended that the Treasurer refer this matter to the Industry Commission. I believe the commission should look favourably at the standing committee's recommendations. They should thoroughly examine and review the mutuality principle because, in my opinion, the original meaning and objectives of mutuality are not being met. These multimillion dollar organisations are avoiding their share of the tax burden with which nearly every Australian complies. Is it possible that the Commonwealth is missing out on an estimated $500 million-that is, half a billion dollars-per year in tax revenue from this quirk in the tax system? For the sake of all Australian taxpayers I urge those with the governing power to fix this stupid regulation and to do so very quickly. Tax Avoidance Dental Health Program: Public Hospitals",20
17,Mr LEE,MTAA,"We might well ask the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) whether he includes the Penrith Panthers in his list of tax avoiders which he believes should be taxed. Does he include the Penrith Panthers Leagues Club in his list of organisations which, he is alleging, are avoiding tax? There is no response from the honourable member for Cowan. He is very brave about calling for these clubs to pay tax but, given the fact that there is a by-election in the federal seat of LindsayMr Richard Evans-Do you support tax avoidance?",22
18,Mr LEE,MTAA,Do you support the Penrith Panthers paying tax? Mr Richard Evans-I don't support tax avoiders; do you?,22
19,Mr LEE,MTAA,"The honourable member for Cowan, by implication, says that the Penrith Panthers Leagues Club is a group of tax avoiders. Mr Richard Evans-Do you support tax avoiders?",22
20,Mr LEE,MTAA,"The honourable member calls the members of Penrith Panthers Leagues Club tax avoiders. I have to say to the honourable member for Cowan that his party has a rather chequered record on this issue because this is an issue which the Australian Hotels Association has been pushing for for some time. The Australian Hotels Association, - quite legitimately, have always objected to the fact that the owners of hotels pay tax on their profits whereas clubs which compete with hotels have not been subject to the same principles under the taxation act. When this issue was put to the Liberal Party and the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, at the last election he gave some very interesting replies. When the Australian Hotels Association went to Mr Costello they asked him whether he would give them an assurance that clubs would have to pay tax. Mr Costello, the current Treasurer, said that he would be prepared to establish an inquiry into whether or not it would be fairer for clubs to be subject to tax in the same way as hotels and other corporations. That might be well and good; that is the Treasurer agreeing with the principles outlined by the honourable member for Cowan. But the Treasurer was also lobbied by the clubs' representative, the Registered Clubs Association. He gave a very different answer to the Registered Clubs Association when they sought an assurance from him that there would be no inquiry into the taxation regime that applies to clubs. We had the Liberal Party giving completely contradictory assurances to the hotels and the clubs about whether or not there would be an inquiry into the tax regime for the club industry. If the honourable member for Cowan honestly believes that clubs should pay tax and that there should be no benefit for clubs under the mutuality principle, then let him go down to the main street of Penrith and shout, as loud as he can, that he thinks Penrith Panthers Leagues Club should be paying tax and that the members of Penrith Panthers Leagues Club are tax dodgers. That was what he was saying by way of implication today. I would like to make a few remarks about issues that affect not just my electorate but areas in the outer suburbs of Sydney-areas like your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins-in areas such as western Sydney. There were a number of decisions made by this government in the August budget which will severely disadvantage people on modest and low incomes. The decision that I consider the most callous in this the budget was the decision to completely abolish the Commonwealth dental health program. The Howard government's decision to abolish the $100 million Commonwealth dental health program is going to seriously disadvantage about four million Australians who are either pensioners or cardholders throughout this country. In western Sydney last year, 21,000 of these Australians received treatment thanks to that Commonwealth funding; 21,000 people in western Sydney were able to have emergency dental care or were able to have essential dental care provided under the Commonwealth dental health program. In my capacity as the federal shadow minister for health, I have visited dental clinics in several states. It is only when you meet the people in the waiting rooms of the dental clinics that you realise this is not just an argument about numbers, about how many millions of dollars and whether the federal or the state government should be funding this program. This is not an argument about economics or numbers; this is an argument about whether elderly people should live in pain because they need some emergency dental care. This is an argument about people who are living in pain every time they eat, people whose nutrition is suffering because they cannot eat certain types of food because of the state of their teeth. It is about people are embarrassed to smile because of the state of their teeth. It is about people who are afraid to go out and who restrict their social activity because they are embarrassed about the state of their teeth. There are large numbers of our fellow Australians out there who each year in the past have relied on that Commonwealth funding for the dental health care program. I say to Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that if she has not yet had the opportunity to visit some of these dental clinics, please do so and meet the people whoMrs Moylan-I'm busy visiting nursing homes and trying to fix up the mess that you left.",22
21,Mr LEE,MTAA,"I will say a bit about nursing homes in a minute, and then the minister can respond to that. Minister, if you do get a chance then visit some of these dental health clinics. Meet some of the staff who are so dedicated and have given so much to try to relieve people of the pain they are suffering because of the state of their dental health. Today there are people who are getting treated in the dental clinics at Nepean Hospital, Westmead Hospital and Mount Druitt Hospital in western Sydney. Large numbers of people in western Sydney depend on this Commonwealth dental health program to obtain that emergency dental care. They cannot afford $200 an hour to be treated at a private dental clinic. They cannot afford to have the Commonwealth abolish its federal funding for dental care and assistance. It is this issue which we would ask the government to reconsider. The minister interjected a few minutes ago about nursing homes. I can certainly tell the minister that the people of western Sydney do not agree with the government's policy of charging people an up-front fee before our parents or grandparents are allowed to be admitted toMrs Moylan-The government's not charging it.",23
22,Mr LEE,MTAA,"But you are making it essential for every owner of a nursing home to levy who that nursing home fee. I put this example to the minister. Minster, let us say you are the owner of a nursing home and you have one spare bed in your nursing home. Two families come to you with grandparents who need to be admitted to that nursing home. One of the families can afford the up-front fee and the other family cannot. As the owner of that nursing home, who are you going to admit to your nursing home-the person who can afford the $26,000 or the person who cannot? I can tell you, Minister, if that is a company and the owner or the manager of that nursing home does not let the person who has the upfront fee into that bed, then you could take action against them, under the Corporations Law, for not maximising the profits that are due to the shareholders. Mrs Moylan-No, you can't.",23
23,Mr LEE,MTAA,"I simply say to the Minister that she should get some legal advice. The owners of nursing homes will have to admit those people who can afford to pay the up-front fee, otherwise there is a breach of fiduciary duties to the shareholders. The other point I want to touch on very briefly is that there is another threat to the people living in western Sydney-a threat to their local public hospitals, those at Westmead, Mount Druitt and Nepean. It comes from this government's decision to cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million over the next four years. The federal cutback to public hospitals will mean that there will be enormous pressures on the good people who work for those public hospitals, on the number of beds and on the number of staff who are employed in places like Mount Druitt, Nepean and Westmead hospitals. New South Wales still does not know how much its federal funding is going to be cut back. The budget papers say that in addition to lots of other cuts there will be $70 million taken out this year and in the next four years, allegedly for cost shifting. New South Wales, and every other state, is a quarter of the way into this financial year. As far as I am aware, no state health minister has yet been told how much of that $70-odd million in federal funding cuts they will have to bear. How can the people who run the budgets of the hospitals of Nepean, Westmead and Mount Druitt know how much money they have to spend this financial year when Dr Wooldridge will not tell Dr Refshauge how much the federal funding cuts are going to hit our state? Minister, it is cutbacks like the federal funding cutbacks announced in your budget that will simply lengthen the waiting lists at these hospitals; that will make it that much harder for us to improve the quality of services in places like Nepean, Westmead and Mount Druitt hospitals. Minister, you know that it is our public hospitals that are under pressure. We would like you to take some action to ensure that public hospitals are not hit in this way. (Time expired). Railways Child Support Agency Austudy Petrol Pricing Media",24
24,Mr WAKELIN,MTAA," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will touch on a range of subjects this morning concerning Australia generally, but particularly regional Australia. I want to start with a few comments about the railway systems of Australia. Over the last decade or more, probably more like 20 years, we have seen job losses in the railways of between 50,000 and 100,000, so there is a vast change occurring in the railway systems of Australia. We currently have a situation where the Commonwealth owns two loss-making railways-National Rail and Australian National. That is not that unusual because that has been the traditional way of running rail for more than a century-government owned and government supported. But the problem highlighted by the Brew report, which only repeats what the previous government already knew in reports to them in 1992 and 1995, is that there is a huge gap between the necessity to get rail up to performing its task and the reality that is occurring. There were some very brave efforts made but, nevertheless, we have seen this huge loss in employment and, in the case of AN alone, we will be seeing the work force drop from 10,500 in 1983 to approximately 1,500 by the middle of 1997. I do not want to dwell on that; I just say it as a matter of history. The most important thing is that railways be given every opportunity to focus on the national transport task into the next century. Rail performs approximately a quarter of the transport task across Australia. The transport task is worth about $30 billion; rail is worth something like $8 billion. Over the decades of this debate there has been the constant catch cry of private enterprise versus public enterprise-sadly, I think, to the detriment of the rail industry. No-one would be surprised to hear that the coalition government is a supporter of private enterprise and that it is looking to those principles to maximise opportunities for rail. It is pleasing to see those people who have been perhaps traditional enemies of that approach be challenged and in many ways be supportive. I say 'challenged' because traditionally the union movement would have been, perhaps unquestionably, supported by the membership. I will quote from the Port Augusta newspaper, the Transcontinental, of 14 August where it is reported that workers passed a motion of no confidence in public transport union state organiser Mr John Crossing following a meeting convened by him at that period. In fact, the men decided they would not go on strike and passed unanimously a motion that John Crossing would not be welcomed back in Port Augusta. I think that is indicative of the changing mind-set. When we see these fundamental figuresthat is, 50,000 to 100,000 job losses in the last 10 or 20 years in the rail industry, and job losses in AN from 10,500 to 1,500 by mid-1997-then everybody is coming to the realisation that we have to do it differently to give rail the best chance in the future. As I say, there is at least an $8 billion business there which can, managed properly, serve this country well into the 21 st century. The next subject. I will touch on this morning is the Child Support Agency. I want to highlight three simple propositions. The adversarial nature of this business when we are seeing a rise in marriage breakdown highlights the problem in a very dramatic way. I know the parliamentary inquiry and the report highlighted this in many ways, and the response from the community was unprecedented. Firstly, I believe there needs to be far greater incentive in the system, free of government interference-free, if you like, of the Child Support Agency approach-which gives incentives to both parties to negotiate with a much stronger sense of good faith rather than at times with a sense of vindictiveness at a time when a relationship is at its most fragile. I also wish to highlight this morning that I believe there needs to be far greater recognition of the income of the custodial parent along with that of the non-custodial parent. The fact that people can have between 18 per cent and 40 per cent of their gross income taken from them in a summary fashion seems to me inappropriate. The third point I wish to make about the Child Support Agency is that it is ironically the harshest, it seems, on those, particularly women, who are part of a second relationship. As a marriage breaks down and the pain of that is dealt with and people move on to a second relationship, that relationship should not be penalised by, I suppose, historical legislation, and certainly not by historical baggage. No-one who has visited my office has denied their responsibility to care for children, but they do believe it should be much fairer, much more balanced, and able to be dealt with in a spirit of reconciliation, particularly for the children. I will briefly move on to Austudy and the means test. There are some people receiving the Austudy payment that should not, but equally there are those who have been penalised by this approach. Once again, it is the regional people who are the most penalised. The most common complaint I am getting in my electorate office is that there is a degree of comfort for many of those who receive Austudy compared with a significant degree of hardship for those who sometimes receive it and sometimes do not. So there is an iniquitous situation in Austudy and, in some cases, the actual means test is exacerbating that. I simply reinforce, as I have done many times in the past, that in regional Australia often there is no choice; they need to go to cities to get their education qualifications. This is at a time when adjustment in agriculture and other industries is significant. The demand for education is higher and there is a greater need for regional people; yet they are being penalised still. I note that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) touched on petrol pricing. I just remind the member for Werriwa that in 1983 the excise rate was 6c a litre and when the Labor Party left office it was 36c a litre. There are issues about market power, and the government is addressing them as expeditiously as it can. That increase from 6c to 36c a litre highlights the impact the price of fuel had, particularly in regional areas. My final comment this morning will endeavour to deal with the media and journalists. I must admit that I thought there was a design fault in this place when I saw the media sitting up there in judgment on us. I felt that it might be more appropriate if they were at our level. Nevertheless, I make that general comment. I think it was Tom Burton who said in that wonderful piece on SBS in the coverage of the last federal election that they become players in the political process. I think he said that they get it right about 70 per cent of the time, so I suppose we presume they get it wrong 30 per cent of the time. My concern is not with particular individuals or particular parts of the media. Sometimes we will hear the private media versus the public media-{Time expired) Parkes Freight Airport Proposal",24
25,Mr ANDREN,MTAA,"I rise in the House today to raise attention to a shameful breach of promise by this government which has seriously undermined public confidence in the political system throughout Calare and indeed throughout a large part of inland New South Wales. The promise was made by none other than the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in the final hours of the election campaign in March this year. On a flying visit to Dubbo and Bathurst, he came to realise that one of the critical issues facing voters in the seats of Parkes, Calare, Hume and Gwydir, and even further afield, was the future of the proposed inland freight airport at Parkes. Only the week before the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, had visited Parkes and promised a returned Labor government would pay for a feasibility study into the Parkes airport proposal. Mr Fischer had no alternative but to promise to match Mr Keating's undertaking, and he did-not once, but twice-in media interviews on the day. Now, seven months after the election, still no money has been forthcoming. Mr Fischer, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the member for a litre Parkes (Mr Cobb) all seem to have lost interest in the proposal. The Parkes freight airport project and its associated Inland Marketing Corporation concept is no pie in the sky scheme. It is a well thought out and researched proposal to ensure Australia's agricultural exports are delivered in a quick and economical manner to growing Asian markets. Paul Keating could see its potential. So could Tim Fischer-until he found himself in government. Instead, the National Party now supports throwing money at Canberra and Adelaide airports. A highly questionable upgrading of Adelaide airport, many experts say, is a waste of money aimed at propping up the Liberal state government in South Australia. In Canberra's case, the FAC is looking at wasting a million dollars on a study looking at its freight potential, yet anyone with even a basic knowledge of freight airports can tell you at no charge that Canberra is clearly unsuitable as a freight airport. Last week, in an interview with ABC radio, the transport minister had the audacity to suggest the federal government was not putting any money into the Canberra airport study, that it was being funded by the Federal Airports Corporation. It is clearly funding endorsed by this government, whatever its source. To say otherwise is simply to play with words. The Inland Marketing Corporation's Parkes airport concept is supported by 33 local councils from inland New South Wales. Deputy Speaker, if you are at all familiar with country councils, you would know they are a pretty conservative bunch. Yet these 33 conservative mayors and their councillors realise just how much potential the Parkes airport proposal has to offer. Many of them have put money into pushing it to the stage it is at now. It is estimated to cost $55 million, but they are not asking for that much money. All they want the government to do is to pay up the $300,000 it promised to allow them to carry out a full feasibility study. If it is not feasible, they say, they will forget about it. Last week, after the transport minister announced a million dollars would be spent looking at freight options for Canberra, 23 of these conservative councils came together for a crisis meeting at Parkes. The Parkes Mayor, Robert Wilson, told the meeting the National Party member for Parkes had failed to represent the area, had failed to pass on submissions to the minister and had worked against the Parkes airport proposal. The scathing criticism of the National Party did not end there. The Mayor of Cowra, Bruce Miller, who hails from the electorate of Hume, the transport minister's electorate, put forward two motions to that meeting. The first condemned the National Party leader, Tim Fischer, for breaking his election promise to provide that $300,000 towards the Parkes study. The second motion called on the National Party to 'do what it was set up to do and start representing country people'. Both motions were passed unanimously without a single word of dissent. Even the newly elected state National Party member for Orange, who was present at the time the vote was taken, failed to speak out against these motions. Indeed, the member for Orange, Russell Turner, says: The Federal Government has a moral commitment in helping the growth of regional New South Wales, yet the Federal National Party has let us down badly. I want to let them know there are a lot of disillulevel sioned National Party voters out there now. They are not my words; they are not the words of the Labor opposition; they are the words of the state National Party member for Orange. I repeat: The Federal National Party has let us down badly ... There are a lot of disillusioned National voters out there now. They waited 13 years for the return of a coalition government, a government with a record number of members from rural and regional areas, and they hoped it would finally see a turnaround in fortunes in the bush and they would start having their needs represented. I would suggest that the member for Orange is a little more in touch with political reality in inland New South Wales than some of his federal counterparts. I am glad the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) is now in the chamber to listen to the second part of my speech. I would suggest this broken promise demonstrates that the federal National Party has no vision for rural Australia beyond the self interest of its members. This is a project outside my electorate of national importance worthy of national study. Three out of four Riverina councils support the Parkes proposal. Indeed, support comes from as far away as Bourke and Inverell, while a seafood processor I recently spoke with in Hobart was enthusiastic about the need for a freight outlet like Parkes to get his produce to Asian markets. Parkes is clearly the only freight airport proposal with widespread public support. In his interview with ABC radio last week, the transport minister dismissed the Parkes proposal, saying there were a dozen other freight airport proposals in New South Wales. He dismissed the Deputy Prime Minister's broken promise, claiming the government had honoured its election commitment by referring the Parkes proposal-along with the dozen or so others-to the parliamentary inquiry looking at freight airport proposals. Quite simply, there are not a dozen other freight airport proposals in New South Wales. I can name only four. None of them are anywhere near as advanced or have the same of backing as Parkes. As for trying to justify Mr Fischer's broken promise by saying that government had instead set up an inquiry into the freight airport proposals, the inquiry is nothing new. It was set up by the Labor government before the election and is being continued, in essence, by the current ComParty munications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Standing Committee of this House. Evidence to that committee shows the freight import industry is estimated to be growing at l7Yz per cent a year, with exports increasing at seven per cent. A submission says that the current and forecast scheduling of passenger-freight services from this country will not cope with demand. It shows we need a dedicated airfreight structure in this country, not slinging cargo willy-nilly into the bellies of passenger jumbos. We need an infrastructure that can take the freshest, cleanest, greenest produce in the world from the producing valleys of south-east Australia-the orchards of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland-and the fisheries, too, of the south-east, and deliver them via a dedicated freight outlet which is serviced by a national highway system and a national rail system and a container port intermodal transport facility. This is a community that is desperate for the economic boost such a project would deliver. This is a community that has made more than a fair sacrifice to keep this country afloat during the droughts and commodity crises of the past decade and half. That infrastructure, wanting only an enlarged airport, already exists in the central west at Parkes. There are 33 councils around the state eager to support this scheme. They only want a vote of confidence, a recognition of the work they have put in. The vision they have is worthy of serious study. They want to stack this project up against anything else being considered. They want to challenge the doubters who are peddling untruths and belittling this scheme on narrow parochial grounds, or perhaps their airline interests feel threatened by the entrepreneurial activities of other international air carriers in the freight import-export area. If fair, objective, non-political and economically sound research shows it is not economically viable, then clearly the project will not go ahead. Remember, of course, that this government and the one before it are driven by economic fundamentalists who believe that no public money should be committed to any infrastructure program. The people of Calare and of western New South Wales did not come down in the last shower. A handshake, Mr Fischer, is as good as a written contract. When you promise something, you are expected to keep your word. The promise to fund the study into the Inland Marketing Corporation's proposal was a core commitment from the coalition to the people of western New South Wales. I should not have to remind my National Party colleagues that in the bush when you give your word on something you are expected to keep it, or you will never be trusted again. Men's Counselling and Resource Centres",26
26,Mr LINDSAY,MTAA,"Herbert) (10.35 a.m.)Good morning to our visitors in the gallery. This is a grievance debate and I will be speaking on the urgent need for men's counselling and resource centres. Since being elected, I have received constant representations from men presenting a valid case that they have no effective support mechanism to help them in times of distress. I thank Townsville psychologist Mr Bruce Young for his considerable help in preparing this speech. Feminism has been one of the greatest advances in the free Western world. The progress and ongoing emancipation that women are achieving is due in part to women gathering together to share common experiences, thoughts, desires, goals and frustrations. Women have achieved great advances for not only themselves but the whole community and the nation's future. Primarily the advances made by the women's movement can be described in social justice terms. Exposure, recognition and validation of women's issues have demanded structural changes to society. Men have also been called on to address their behaviours, attitudes, beliefs and lifestyles in order to accommodate these ever-changing social justice issues. Men are required to adapt to these issues, which can at times be difficult to grasp and can demand a complete overhaul of outmoded thinking. Society is currently feeling the friction that such evolving gender roles can create. Men, not given any formal education in these areas, are often left bewildered, confused and neglected by these rapidly changing processes. When society finds itself in this precarious gender laden confusion, a range of outcomes is possible. They extend from the traditionalist males who may reject outright such changes and form radical backlash movements through to those who may be open and willing to accommodate such changes. A change in anyone gender's demands for rights inherently affects our society, which in tum makes demands upon the other gender. The feminist movement largely concerns itself with its own issues and rights. Rightly, it does not, nor should it, have to ask permission from men to air these issues or exercise its rights. This lack of consultation is almost a prerequisite to enable a truly free voice to be heard. It is not the women's responsibility to concern themselves with the effects their increasing freedom has upon men. Apart from being patronising to men, this would have a constraining effect on the efficacy of feminism. This responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of men. Men must address their own issues. In a complementary manner, men need the same lateral freedom for discussion so that their concerns and issues can likewise develop and help to enrich our community, for it is only when both genders feel emancipated that a harmonious society can thrive. The validation of women's rights is indicative of a level of gender maturation that enables women to have a voice that is not only freely spoken but also heard. Men, unfortunately, do not have a unified voice to achieve the same level of maturation. This lack of cohesion among men may have come about for many reasons. This could be due to an assumed patriarchal position of privilege, a lack of structural placements, a lack of acceptance by society of such placements or perhaps a lack of communication in men themselves due to the way they have been socialised. It comes as no surprise that, as the Australian male adjusts to the demands of the changing society in the 1990s, he is realising the obvious benefits of communication, with ever increasing interest being shown in discussion groups, community interests and the challenging of outmoded assumptions made about men. Men around Australia are now waking up to discuss how society is changing, and they are discussing the impact this may have on their lives. Men are looking to forums to discuss issues which affect not only them but the community. Men are taking responsibility and voicing the concern that they, too, would like to have a say in the shaping of tomorrow. Men's groups are springing up throughout the country, concerned with issues ranging from family law matters to emotion and stress management, and the exploration of gender issues. In Australia at the moment there are over 1,800 different men's groups-often disjointed, unstructured, ill-funded or led by fanatical extremists who are frustrated with the lack of easily accessible channels to either obtain resources or air their beliefs. In this embryonic stage of men's discovery, it is important to recognise the different needs that are likely to arise and that men's experiences and problems are likely to be unique. Men's services should not be a duplication of women's services, nor a stall to dispense feminist theory. Men should be given the dignity and right to discuss and discover for themselves their own areas of concern and to develop a discourse to explain their needs. A content and happy society is, after all, achievable only when both genders have a voice in determining their own needs and resources. Men require a unified voice with a structure that advocates their concerns. Presently men are left isolated to lobby individually. Until only recently, men had no special funding set aside for men's health issues. As it is, men's funding is limited to physical health issues such as testicular and prostate cancer. This is a good beginning. However, men require services beyond the mere physical. Men in Australia have suicide rates that are three to four times higher than those for women. In Queensland, separated males have suicide rates up to 7.6 times higher than those for married males. Australia and New Zealand have the shame of being the only two Western countries that have a male adolescent suicide rate that exceeds their general suicide rate. Male rural suicides similarly have an unacceptably appalling high rate. Men need a range of proactive services to help reduce these 'deaths by neglect' of our male population. I am heartened that this government has already made concerted steps in addressing this serious problem. An important part of men's services that needs funding is in the area of research to discover what men's needs are and why they are coping so poorly. Men's counselling services are needed deal with issues such as sexual traumas, loss, grief and coping, and family and relationship breakdowns. Men cry too! Counselling sercar vices are also required for perpetrators child and adult sexual abuse. To curb instanthis. ces of child abuse, a telephone service is needed whereby abusers can call to either discuss the situation and seek help or talk to someone because they feel they are about to abuse again. This telephone line should be confidential with anonymity guaranteed. This would provide an avenue for perpetrators discuss their intentions instead of carrying them out and will hopefully lead to ongoing counselling. More importantly, this would provide a service not offered before which could dramatically reduce instances of child abuse. Men's services should supply that other men's discussion groups and educational services can grow. Discussion nights divorce, family law and sexual harassment legislation would all be instructive to men. Discussion nights can educate men on rape, domestic violence, theories of manhood, been ignored. relationships, communication, anger management, suicide, fatherhood, intimacy, depression and stress management. Indeed, proactive education is the key to any good counselling service offered, as prevention is always better than cure. To deal with the serious issue of domestic violence, a two-stage plan is needed which could be provided by such a centre. First, proactive education system is needed schools and for the public to promote awareelectoral ness of domestic violence and the nonLindsay. physical components such as emotional and psychological abuse. Secondly, a counselling service is needed for both the perpetrators the male victims of such abuse. Studies in Australian males' concerns are embarrassingly scarce. This situation speaks volumes for the poor distribution of resources allocated to men's well-being. Society is witnessing an ever increasing incidence spousal murder-suicides by men over custody issues, yet the research into why this occurs in the first place is virtually non-existent. Mr Deputy Speaker, men in today's society that are under an ever increasing suspicion of guilt. This is easily illustrated if you consider whether or not you as a man would stop your to ask a seemingly lost child if they are of all right. I wonder how many men would do Men have, despite an ever changing world, inherited a legacy of a very negative stereotype. Men are portrayed in the media as violent, potential rapists and as being preoccupied with sex, power and control issues. Men are increasingly frustrated with this legacy and are asking for a shift in society'S apprecito ation and perception of them. The current devaluing of men has far-reaching ramifications for society. Unfortunately, men in the 1990s are subjected to a large number of generalisations concerning their nature. It is a pity that society continues to stereotype men based on the offensive a structure so behaviours of a few. To conclude, men appear to have been on inhibited in accessing the blueprints that society is following. The consequences of men being stifled and not having a unified voice is that certain men's issues have largely Former Member for Lindsay",28
27,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MTAA,"Last evening the Speaker responded to a number of questions that I asked yesterday concerning the purchase of a laptop computer from Southmark Computer Systems Pty Ltd, which intimated a purchase on behalf of the a House of Representatives and indicated the in involvement of a customer Kelly and the office of the former member for The House, very clearly from the Speaker's statement, has had no involvement whatsoever and in this purchase. Similarly, inquiries today have elicited the fact that the tax exemption number which is essentially required in these processes-in this transaction DA0156-has nothing whatsoever to do with the House of Representatives. Similarly, contact with the of office of the Minister for Administrative Services this morning indicates that there have been no contacts, no approaches and no purchase by that department. Similarly, the Parliamentary Information Systems Officeanother broad possibility that represents members of parliament-indicate that they do not have a number. In their case, they simply provide a statement that the goods are free of sales tax under item 74 of the first schedule et cetera. The company assures me that this equipment was delivered to the office of the former member for Lindsay within the parliament. So the question widens as to the whole process. I think this must be viewed in the context of a few matters, including the firm commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the Governor General's speech of 30 April upon his election when he spoke of 'the government's intention to improve the standing of the national Parliament' and expressed concern that 'increasing numbers in the community have lost respect for the Parliament and its members'. Similarly, on 2 March the Prime Minister actually took the opportunity to put up-front that one of the aims of the government was supposedly to 'restore decency, standards and honesty to our national government'. As an MP I must express some concern at this whole process. As late as 30 September the General Manager of Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, Mr Semmens, at a Senate estimates committee indicated quite clearly that there were limitations on the rights of members of parliament to the equipment they received through that role. He indicated: We are talking about dollars. I have a rolling replacement program to fund both computers and other equipment, and I do not have, in that budget, funds to accommodate much variation. Of course, it is very difficult to predict just how many might express an interest were there to be some leeway given to these kinds of requests. So it is very clear that there is no intention by the government, no intention by the parliament, to extend further rights in this field to members of parliament. We all know that the senators and members entitlements document lists exactly what we can receive as representatives of the people as people funded by the Australia taxpayer. Certainly, beyond that limit, there is no right. Most members would understand that they cannot just go off to a company saying, 'I am a member of parliament. I have certain rights. Give me some computers. Give me this equipment. It is tax exempt et cetera.' I for one am a person without legal training but at a very early time. I got the impression from the department and other sources that that is just not the way things operate around here. The question of gaining tax exemption improperly is not a trifling matter. It is subject to the Taxation Administration Act of 1953, which provides alternatives of a $2,000 fine or, in certain circumstances, at the behest of the commissioner, a $5,000 fine or a prison sentence up to one year. So, whatever some people might seem to indicate, these are not trifling, irrelevant matters. I thought it was quite topical this morning when I heard the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) quite clearly indicating his concern about tax evasion, his concern about standards in this country with regard to people paying the right tax. I am not the only one who is concerned about the way this type of operation might have occurred. The situation is that there was delivery to the house itself. The reception of this material occurred after the legal representatives of the former member for Lindsay quite emphatically, quite clearly, indicated to the High Court of this country: 'Our client has no right to be here; she has never been a member of parliament but we will want to argue about whether it is a re-count or a by-election.' After that date a person who in reality had no entitlement to be here took delivery of this material which the company's invoice indicated to be tax exempt. We all know we have no right to tax exemption. We have no right even if we are still legitimate members of the parliament, if we are still here quite properly through election. We have a situation where there is a requirement that there is a purchase order with a sales tax exemption number-an indication or quotation of a number--derived from the Taxation Office and signed by an appropriate person. I myself today still do not know who has signed any authorisation document. There must have been one. One assumes that the company has proper practices-and they seemed to indicate over the phone that they do. One does still not know how this number, DAOI56, was provided to them. I do not know whether it is related to the Department of Defence or any other federal government department, but there are clearly quite importelectorate ant questions about this. That documentation shows an invoice to the House of Representatives, the Parliament of Australia, but, interestingly enough, care of the comer of Woodriff and Tindale Streets, Penrith, which we all know is the location of the office of the former member for Lindsay. In the last Lindsay F oeus from the federal senator for New South Wales Bob Woods, we are assured that the former member for Lindsay is 'a person experienced in law, criminal psychology' and-perhaps more aptly for this case-'she can take effective action to translate wishes into reality'. Somehow the wish to obtain this computer with a tax exemption for which there is no entitlement has by some process occurred. It is also worth further noting that I have been advised by South mark that the company supplying this, Digital, went further to provide a deal which 'they would do only for major companies or major clients'. So it was not a five-second phone call to Southmark requesting a computer and maybe some accidental intimation for which someone around the place might have a tax exemption number and errors, mistakes and misunderstandings. Not only was the tax exemption given, not only was a number cited; the deal was over and above the ordinary because Digital considered that it was not dealing with a Tom, a Dick or a Harry off the street but a major customer; someone that was part of the government. As I have said, I do not claim to be legally proficient. I note the comments made about the member for Lindsay regarding her expertise in the legal field. I know that if I understation took this kind of action I would be regarded as dishonest. I know that the electorate would regard me as such. I know that I would be dishonest if I had received this material knowing that I had been given a tax exemption for which no way in the broadest possibility did I have any entitlement. These are questions that the former member for Lindsay must answer. They are questions that go to those matters that the Prime Minister raises. They go to concerns about propriety. They go to concerns about exactly what the Australian will tolerate from its representatives. Small Business: Royalty Fees",30
28,Mr MAREK,MTAA,"It grieves me to see yet another financial and bureaucratic impost on small businesses being conducted in my electorate of Capricornia: namely, circular letters from the Australian Performing Rights Association and the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia requesting exorbitant fees under the Copyright Act 1968. Not only is it another set of forms that small businesses have to fill in annually; it is a blatant money grab from those businesses who use free to air radio and television broadcasts as a background service for their customers and staff. While I appreciate there is a requirement to request licence payments from businesses who use radio, television, compact discs and tapes to entertain or attract customers to their premises, such as nightclubs, record shops, radio stations and the like, I do not believe this licence requirement should be applicable to every doctor, dentist, hairdresser, stationery shop, supermarket, school, gym and restaurant. People do not go to these places to be musically entertained. They go there for a specific purpose which has nothing to do with entertainment or the Australian Performing Rights Association or the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia. Many businesses that use radio or that pipe music through their telephone when clients are on hold will also be required to pay this obnoxious fee. This means my federal office, which essentially listens only to parliament question time and the local news on radio 4RK ABC, will in future have to pay a fee of $36.20 plus 90c for every additional speaker. I have been inundated with complaints from my constituents over this money grab. Some of them will have to pay up to $250 a year for the privilege. Given the level of adverse reaction to the APRA and PPCA's licensing campaign, it is apparent that the lack of awareness of the role of these organisations and their approach to licensing users of music are issues which need to be addressed immediately. The APRA and the PPCA should be hauled over the coals over the attack, intimidation and threats outlined in their letters against people who infringe the act. This style of letter writing is downright disgraceful, and I take issue over this matter, even if you have a right under the act to licence the users. They must realise that most people are not aware of the Copyright Act and have not been made aware. Many in business may look at the correspondence as some sort of junk mail or some kind of money hoax. The APRA and the PPCA have not handled this subject well, and I advise them to instigate an advertising campaign of sorts to educate the people of their responsibilities under the act. When I contacted the office of APRA's general licensing manager, Mr Arthur Cooper, and asked him how this levy was distributed, he told me that the APRA keeps 12 per cent of the fee and the rest is distributed to the artist. When I asked how and what artists do they select and how this is monitored to give the money to the correct artist, they could not answer me. I am sure Beethoven and Bach are not getting a regular cheque from the APRA or the PPCA. Just to add to this unfair burden on businesses, the APRA and the PPCA want the businesses who register and pay their licence fees to supply a list of all the music performed at their premises, including the name of the author, the name of the composer, the name of the arranger and the name of the publisher of each such composition and the number of times performed during the period in question. How ridiculous can you get? I ask you: what business has the time, let alone the resources, to complete such a request? This is bureaucracy gone mad. This government is committed to reducing the burden of paperwork on small business. We currently have a small business task force out there trying to find ways to reduce this paperwork warfare, not add to the problems. While I am on it, I would like to see legislation passed to ensure that the people driving this tripe are fully accountable to the law. So if we find any unfavourable transactions taking place, we can lock the drivers of this impost up and throwaway the key. Wit h this statement in mind, I reinforce my previous statements from other speeches and media releases that anybody who has their hands in the public till must be held fully accountable to the full extent of the law. Moving on, just to add to the woes of small business, APRA and PPCA state in their licence agreement that they, or their accredited representative, shall have unrestricted right of entry to premises during all times of performance. This is absolutely outrageous and resembles something out of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Mr Laurie Ferguson-You've read it?",32
29,Mr MAREK,MTAA,Often. It is a good novel. I shall be calling on the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  amendments to the Copyright Act to not allow further financial burden and bureaucratic imposition on small businesses. People who are not in the entertainment industry must be allowed to have free use of free-to-air radio and television broadcasts as a service to staff and customers.,33

Public Accounts Committee Report",34
33,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: Report No. 346-Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General. Ordered that the report be printed.",34
34,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,34
35,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"The JCPA report No. 346 I am tabling today is of paramount importance to the future of the parliament itself. Prior to the 1996 election, the Hon. John Howard, now Prime Minister, gave a commitment to the Australian people to establish a completely independent Auditor General who would be an officer of the parliament, as part of a broader strategy to restore authority, dignity and meaning to parliamentary institutions. The existence of a of the strong and independent Auditor-General is fundamental to the effectiveness of the parliament itself in its scrutiny of executive government. Indeed, a former Auditor-General told the JCPA in 1994 that he considered the question-who will control the Auditor General?-to be one of the great battles between the parliament and the executive. It is a battle which has had a long history. In 1902, the first Auditor-General in his first report to parliament stated that his office was inadequately resourced for the discharge of its audit functions. The JCPA has reported to parliament twice in the last decade on the desirability of strengthening the relationship between parliament and the Auditor-General. In its report No. 296 tabled in 1989, the JCPA informed parliament that the Australian Audit Office, as it was then, was in a state of crisis, that it was under-resourced and that a lot of problems stemmed from parliamentary complacency. The JCPA also reported that there was confusion about whether the executive or the parliament was responsible for the Auditor General, with the result that the office was neglected by both. In report 331, tabled in 1994, the JCPA made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor-General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor-General from the executive and provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. Today, seven years on from the original JCPA report, the question of where the Auditor General fits in the framework of government still generates heated debate, as the committee discovered during this inquiry. However, the  was in no doubt that he considers parliament to be his employer. In this report the JCPA has recommended that the Auditor-General be declared in the Auditor-General Bill to be an independent officer of the parliament. The title encapsulates the role and status of the office of Auditor-General. The Auditor-General performs a function that is essential to parliament and parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform. While acknowledging that the debate about the status of the Auditor-General is essentially about symbolism, we believe that symbolism is extremely important. To a very large degree, the way in which the position of Auditor-General is described influences public perceptions of the role and the significance of the office. It is important to note, however, that in the legislative model proposed by the JCPA the Auditor-General would not be subject to direction by the parliament. The JCPA has recommended that a guarantee of the Auditor-General's audit independence be enshrined in the Auditor-General Bill, putting beyond doubt that the Auditor-General has complete discretion in determining the audit program of the ANAO, the Australian National Audit Office, and in deciding the manner in which audits will be conducted. The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in referring this matter to the JCPA for inquiry, drew the committee's attention to the concerns that appointment of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament could damage the independence of that office. The committee has reviewed the legal opinions obtained by the Australian National Audit Office on this issue. The committee is concerned that these legal opinions were obtained in a vacuum of policy advice about the intentions or will of the government and the parliament in appointing the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament. This is criticism neither of the legal opinions nor of those who sought them, but it is the reason why some of the legal concerns raised in the inquiry are not relevant to what the JCPA is recommending in this report. The committee has attempted to allay the fears about the appointment of the Auditor General as an independent officer of the parliament in this report, outlining in some detail what the JCP A means by that title and recommending provisions to be included in the Auditor-General Bill to clarify the meaning and intended ramifications of the title. In the JCPA's legislative model regarding the independence of the Auditor-General both the position of Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office would be established as statutory offices for whom the Prime Minister would take portfolio responsibility. An important element of the new framework to underpin the independence of the Auditor-General is the establishment of an audit committee of parliament. The audit committee on behalf of the parliament would enhance the transparency of decisions taken in relation to the Auditor-General. In particular, the audit committee would approve the appointment of the Auditor-General, examine the proposed appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to parliament and to the executive on appropriate levels of resourcing, monitor any executive directions to the Auditor-General and approve the appointment of the independent auditor and advise the independent auditor of parliament's audit priorities. In his letter of referral, the Minister for Finance confirmed his intention to seek cabinet agreement that the JCPA be given the function of an audit committee. The JCPA is enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming an audit committee. The audit committee functions are an integral part of the JCPA's existing broad role of reporting to the parliament on means for improving public accountability. In this report the JCPA has also recommended a range of measures that could be incorporated in the new Auditor-General Bill to support the functional independence of the Auditor-General. The committee was flying blind, not having been given a preview of the Auditor-General Bill 1996 and thus not being in a position to suggest specific amendments or additions. The committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor General to have a mandate to conduct the full range of financial and performance audits across the entire public sector, including performance audit in government business enterprises. The committee has also recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor-General to be appointed for a fixed term of 10 years. It will be apparent in this report that the JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor-General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor-General is not properly resourced or does not have a legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive government to account. I commend this report to parliament. I urge members and senators to take an interest not only in this report but also in the work of the Auditor-General, whose future effectiveness will have a major impact on the effectiveness of the parliament itself. This report contains a series of recommendations which pose a challenge to the government. If adopted, these recommendations will go a long way towards restoring the authority and meaning of the parliament and securing the Auditor-General's independence from the executive. In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues on the JCPA, all those who gave evidence to the inquiry and the JCPA secretariat, whose collective commitment to the task has enabled the committee to table this report within two months of receiving the reference requested by the minister.",34
36,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Joint Committee of Public Accounts Report 346-Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General makes a very substantial contribution to an office which is of the most fundamental importance to the parliament. The report is part of an ongoing process of strengthening the independence of the Auditor-General, a process which is still not complete. It has been seven years since the JCPA's report The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament was tabled and the passage of legislation flowing from that report has been some time coming. But it is almost here and I do believe that the commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) 'to establish a completely independent Auditor-General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the executive' has given an important impetus to bringing the process of reform to fruition. The report outlines the key components of the functional independence of the Auditor General: personal independence in relation to appointment and tenure; a wide legislative mandate empowering the Auditor-General to audit the complete spectrum of Commonwealth functions; freedom to determine the audit program and to decide the nature and scope of audits; unrestricted access to information and the right to report any findings to the parliament; and adequate resourcing. Enhancing the Auditor-General's independence through the mode of appointment and tenure is vital. The committee's recommendations do this by involving the parliament, through the audit committee, in approving by a two-thirds majority the government's nominee for appointment and by conducting a public confirmation hearing to take evidence from the nominee prior to approval. The term of appointment of the Auditor General was given considerable attention by the committee. In my personal view, if there is any single office of the Commonwealth that would justify appointment until retirement, it is that of the Auditor-General. This is particularly so given the fact that reappointment for a further term is not an option because it would substantially erode the Auditor General's independence, as anyone who has witnessed the sad sight of a statutory officer seeking a further tenn would attest. Nonetheless, the committee's recommendation for a IO-year term is, I believe, a very effective alternative. With regard to the Auditor-General's mandate to audit Commonwealth functions, there has been something of a tradition of affinning the need for an unrestricted mandate, yet qualifying this when it comes down to brass tacks. The Auditor-General Bill 1994 significantly qualified the Auditor-General's mandate by exempting government business enterprises from performance audits unless interest. there was a request by the minister or by both houses of the parliament. While some shred of intellectual legitimacy may be given to such an exemption by murmurings about GBEs being subjected to market disciplines, no-one who has witnessed the lack of market discipline operating on some government for business enterprises could take this seriously in real life. Government business enterprises do spend taxpayers' money, they not infrequently waste it, and the parliament's capacity to make judgments on this should not be limited by exempting them from the scrutiny of the be Auditor-General. In addition, I think it is matter of principle that grand statements about unrestricted audit mandates should be accompanied by commensurate legislative mended powers. It is therefore laudable that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has bitten the bullet and matched recommendation to principrejudice ple by including performance audits of government business enterprises. The task of securing the independence the Auditor-General has both symbolic and substantive aspects. While the Audit Act 1901 leaves the Auditor-General's independence implicit, and this has not resulted in any executive interference in the Auditor General's capacity to detennine which audits would be conducted, the committee believes it is important that the Auditor-General's complete discretion in the discharge of audit functions and the Auditor-General's freedom from any direction should be specified in legislation. The independence of the Auditor-General and the capacity of the parliament to fulfil its task of scrutiny depends on the ability of the Auditor-General to report to the parliament. The Auditor-General Bill 1994, however, did contain substantial qualification on the ability of the Auditor-General to report to the parliament. Most importantly, there is a wide ranging provision that the Auditor-General not release sensitive information in a report tabled in the parliament if-and I quote: ... the Attorney-General had issued a certificate to the Auditor-General stating that the release of the information would be contrary to the public The definition of 'sensitive information' was so extensive that the committee could not visualise any fonn of moderately interesting information about government activities that could not be fitted into one or other of its categories. This was particularly concerning the committee since the bill established no checks on the Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate and the parliament was not even to be informed that the Attorney-General had given a direction to the Auditor-General, let alone the reasons for the direction. It might seem far-fetched that this power would exercised, but providing for such a capacia ty is in principle inappropriate. And if it is not to be used, why have it? Accordingly, the committee has recomthat the restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information should be restricted to the disclosure of information likely to national security; that the audit committee should receive an unabridged copy of the report; and that reasons for the exclusion of sensitive information should be reportof ed to the parliament. A key bone of contention over the years has been the issue of resourcing the Auditor General. This has long been regarded as going to the heart of the Auditor-General's true independence. The committee regarded it as being of fundamental importance that the resourcing of audit functions should be made transparent to the parliament, thus allowing the parliament to hold the executive to account for the level of resources appropriated for the Auditor General to fulfil the statutory functions of the office. Accordingly, the committee proposes that the audit committee should examine the estimates of the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to the parliament and to the responsible ministerwho, given that the committee's recommendations are accepted, will be the Prime Minister-on the appropriate level of funding for the ANAO. The ANAO's estimates and the recommendation of the audit committee would then be considered by the executive as part of the normal budget process. I tum finally to the issue of the designation of the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. The Prime Minister had indicated that the new government would make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament. Nonetheless, the designation of the Auditor-General did exercise the mind of the committee and it certainly exercised the minds of some departments and authorities. Having considered the various views, the committee concluded that the Auditor-General for Australia should be appointed and titled as an 'Independent officer of the parliament'. The committee believes that this would be a very important symbol of the independence of the Auditor-General and of the Auditor General's primary role in assisting the parliament in its scrutiny of the exercise of authority and the expenditure of public funds by the executive. I believe that the JCPA report is a very good and very strong report which should significantly enhance the symbolic and substantive independence of the Auditor-General and the ability of the parliament to make the executive accountable to itself and to the Australian people, and indeed improve the functioning of the executive and ministers' capacities to oversight their departments and authorities. I would also like to say that, as someone who has been involved in the partisan side of politics for a significant part of my life, it a great pleasure to see the Joint Committee of Public Accounts operate in a totally non-partisan fashion. And I would like to thank the committee secretariat for completing a major task in an excruciatingly short period of time.",36
37,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would largely echo the comments made by the previous speakers. I was away for most of the consideration of this report, so I am not sure whether the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) was referring to the fact that it was possible to be bipartisan when I was not there or whether it was a question of the general operation of the committee. Mr Vaile-It made it a lot easier.",38
38,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"I am sure it did. Report No. 346, Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General, follows on from a couple of other reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Nos 296 in 1989 and 331 in 1994. In the 3Y2 years that I have now been on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Auditor-General's role, his particular tasks, funding and independence have engendered quite a bit of debate. It would be recognised on all sides that auditors-general, certainly the two that I have worked with as a member of this committee, have diligently performed their duties, as have their staff. They have certainly performed a great service to the parliament and the country. But symbolism, part of which this report is about, has been a major issue of discussion on the role of the Auditor-General. Although the report is not exciting reading, like many reports of the Public Accounts Committee, it is fairly weighty and contains a range of issues worthy of serious consideration by the government. And I will mention several of those today but, to ensure that others have an opportunity to speak, I will then sit down quickly. On the role of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament, there was some debate on whether that was a good, bad or indifferent idea. Through this report we have tried to hold on to the most important aspect of that, while at the same time taking into was account some of the concerns raised by some government departments as to what the role really means. I certainly believe that the Auditor-General not only being independent but being seen to be independent is crucial to his operation as an important review and regulatory body within the Public Service. There are a number of recommendations on the audit committee. The JCPA believes that the committee has a role to play in appointing the Auditor-General; examining the appropriations to the ANAO; reviewing the performance of the Auditor-General in consultation with the independent auditor; and reporting to parliament on the operation of the Auditor General-all crucial issues to the operation of the Auditor-General. Complaints have been made in the past which, to some extent, have been legitimateand I know they go back to the earlier part of this century-that auditors-general have often raised concerns on how effectively they can do their job on the basis of how practically they have been funded and allowed to operate. We are trying to build on what has been a fairly extensive development of the role of the Auditor-General over the years to try to put those questions very much in the open so that there can be no real accusation of any partisan approach. Although that has been the case in the past with the Auditor-General, this report certainly gives us an opportunity to make things not only a matter of what actually is but what is seen to be. On the appointment of the Auditor-General, the committee recommended a lO-year fixed term. I believe that such a term may be a little too long, but I support the rationale the reasoning for that recommendation. By and large, it is not a bad time. The intention is to ensure that the Auditor-General cannot be seen to angle for a further term or put under any pressure on that basis by being made ineligible for reappointment and for any appointment within the Commonwealth Public Service for a further three years after they have sought to become Auditor-General. The committee also looked at a retirement age of 65 for the Auditor-General-which I think is common sense-and tying remuneration to senior levels in the Australian Public Service. All these recommendations are designed to try to say, in layman's terms, the Auditor-General is a very important part of the process of government in this country and plays a crucial role as a watchdog and as an auditor in the operation of the Public Service and of government as a whole. This position not only should be independent and properly resourced, and seen to be significant, but it also has to be seen to be those things. That symbolism is crucial because as we look to the future and to the role of government evolving and altering over time, and we look at the role that the Auditor General will continue to play in years to come, issues like performance audits of GBEs and the wider role taken by the Auditor General will be seen to be a crucial part of that watchdog role and a crudal part of ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in government. It will be a crucial role in ensuring that people have reason to believe that their tax dollars are used effectively and the operation of government in this country is done effectively and in a way that is open for all to see. I commend the report to the House. I congratulate the staff of the committee for the work they have done and the committee members for working so well in a bipartisan way in my absence. I am back now, so I am not sure whether I can say the same about the next one.",38
39,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is the third in a series of and reports with regard to trying to improve and increase the independence of the Auditor General. The first report from the Public Accounts Committee was in 1989, report 296. I was fortunate enough to be part of the then Public Accounts Committee which put together report 331 in 1994. I am pleased to have been a member of the current Public Accounts Committee presenting this report No. 346, Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General. I suppose what we have been trying to achieve in this report is encapsulated in a comment that the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then Leader of the Opposition, made in June 1995 in his speech 'The role of government: A modem Liberal approach' when he said: We will establish a completely independent Auditor-General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the Executive ... That is exactly what the committee has attempted to achieve in the recommendations encapsulated in this report. I will briefly go through the key recommendations which do that. Let us bear in mind that not only do we have to have the framework for independence but we have to have the appearance-and the symbolism, as the previous speaker said-of independence of the Auditor-General. In recommendation 1 the committee recommends that the Auditor-General be known by the title Independent Officer of the Parliament, the parliament being separate from the executive and being the representative of the people of Australia. So he will be an independent officer serving the people of Australia and a watchdog over the activities of the executive government. That is the nominal symbolism of the independence of the Auditor-General. To underpin that we saw the necessity to move the responsibility for the Auditor-General into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. So recommendation 4 states: The Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office should be the portfolio responsibility of the Prime Minister. So when dealing with appropriations and budgetary matters the Prime Minister, rather than the Minister for Finance, is the spokesman in that regard. In recommendation 6 we have recommended that the audit committee-we have also recommended that the JCPA be the audit committee-should examine the budget estimates of the ANAO and the Auditor-General and make recommendations to the parliament and the Prime Minister for the appropriations. So there is a circuit-breaker in the system where the people of Australia, through the representatives of the JCPNaudit committee in this parliament, are scrutinising the budget that is being put forward by the Auditor General and the ANAO for approval by the executive, to be included in the budget. So the people, through the representatives in this chamber on the audit committee, have a say in the budget. That is one of the key concerns that has been raised in the past in the previous two reports. In recommendation 7 we say that the appropriations for the Auditor-General and the ANAO should appear as a separate schedule in the budget papers, not hidden away under the Department of Finance. We are not making any aspersions that in the past the Department of Finance may have tried to intimidate or manipulate, in a financial way, the activities of the Auditor-General, but this gives the appearance that they will not and cannot. So in that process the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office will put together their budget for an upcoming year and present it to the audit committee. The audit committee will then recommend that to the parliament and to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will then deal with that and speak on that, I would imagine, in cabinet. Then that will appear in the budget papers as a separate line item for all to see. All those measures underpin what we are trying to do in elevating not only the reality but the perception of independence of the Auditor-General. Lastly, and most importantly, the other recommendation I wanted to highlight is recommendation No. 14, which states: The Auditor-General Bill should provide that: the Auditor-General has a general mandate to initiate the full range of audit in relation to all Commonwealth entities (including performance audits of Government Business EnterpriseS-As one of the previous speakers said, although they are separate corporate entities, they are still owned by the Commonwealth and thus by the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of Australia are the shareholders in those corporations. They deserve to have the ability, through their Auditor-General, to see how their investment is performing. That is also a very important recommendation. I close by commending this report to the parliament. As I say, it is the third report since 1989 in a series addressing the issue of the independence of the Auditor-General. I am sure the government will take up the recommendations in this report and it will be to the betterment of government and the better governance and scrutiny of governance in this country for many years to come.",39

41,Mr ABBOTT,COMMITTEES,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.38 a.m.)-I am delighted to have this chance to endorse the 1996 Commonwealth budget and I congratulate the Howard-Costello-Fischer government for tackling the very serious economic problems that we faced. Australia could not live on bankcard forever. I am for disappointed that some members opposite have taken the occasion of this budget to try electo reopen the class war-a class war which of ended in Australia some time in the 1960s when all of us decided that we belong to the middle class. Earlier this week in my electorate corporate for rights and environmental concerns came into collision. Optus commenced its cable rollout in the municipality of Manly and its many of my constituents feel that they are now threatened with a form of technological home invasion. The reason for this is the for former government's telecommunications cent; regime, which put telecommunications carriers in effect above the law. You and I cannot put a flagpole in our backyard without getting council permission first, yet these carriers can do virtually what they like. They can put a its 30-metre-high phone tower virtually wherever they want. In November 1994, the coalition tried to disallow the previous government's telecommunications national code in the Senate. We aid wanted a veto over some of these forms of infrastructure within a certain distance of inresidential homes and we wanted councils to have more power over the carriers. That is what we tried to do, but unfortunately the then government struck a compromise deal of with the Democrats, a compromise which to turned out to be just window-dressing. I want to stress that I am not here to blame Optus for what is happening; I am here to spend blame the previous government's system of rules. I commend the new Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, for his draft telecommunications national code, which gives councils significantly more say over infrastructure. It enables local councils to implement locality planning-guidelines to permit or to prohibit this kind of infrastructure within their council areas. It also provides for appeals to Austel in the event of disagreement between councils and carriers. This is a very important step in the right direction and the Local Government Association is quite wrong to say that the draft code tabled by Senator Alston is going backwards. It is a very significant step in the right direcplaints, tion. Unfortunately, it may now be too late to stop the Optus rollout. Perhaps we are in a situation a little bit like the words of Macbeth: 'I am in blood steeped so far that returning were as tedious as to go o'er.' Nevertheless, it is vitally important that we have better regulation of the rollout so we ensure that cables cannot be rolled out in areas of extreme environmental sensitivity. It is very important that we have a national plan to ensure that, sooner or later, all the overhead infrastructure goes underground. If that does not happen, we will find the garden suburbs of the beautiful cities of our country looking like Chicago in the 19th century. The information superhighway will become a dead end of poles and wires, as Optus is followed by Telstra and various other entrants into the telecommunications market in stringing ever greater numbers of cables on poles that are already groaning under the weight. It is my understanding that the minister is looking into the possibility of a national burial fund for overhead infrastructure and that he is considering bringing the various parties to this issue together to see whether a sensible compromise can be hammered out. I strongly support those efforts and they cannot happen a moment too soon for the people in my electorate. Turning now to the North Head ocean outfall, many improvements have been made to this over the years. The Greiner government, with the support of the then member for Manly, David Hay, extended the outfall. It is now a deep ocean outfall. The Fahey government, with the support and indeed the encouragement of the now member for Manly, Peter Macdonald, ended incineration at the North Head site. Now all the treatment takes place in a sealed chamber. These are very significant improvements to the treatment of waste matter at North Head, but it is not enough. The Fairlight survey group has been monitoring atmospheric pollution from the North Head plant for many years. I want to congratulate Maureen Young, Sammy Newman and Patricia Harris for their work on behalf of the local community. They have detected high levels of breathing disorders and skin comparticularly when the prevailing winds take the pollution over land in the near vicinity of the plant. Epidemiological studies do not altogether bear out the work of the Fairlight survey group. Nevertheless, they cannot be dismissed as scaremongering because leading local doctors believe that pollution from the plant is causing serious health problems. I quote Dr Mark Donohoe concerning a patient: . . . my conclusion that his breathing difficulties and related symptoms were most likely the result of an airborne chemical irritant. I quote Dr John Saunders on one of his patients: It must be inferred that these symptoms have a local, environment cause with the North Head Treatment Works at the top of the list of likely offenders. Dr Peter Macdonald, who is also the state MP, talks about a patient's various medical problems: . . . associated with an environmental toxic product, probably emanating from North Head. In the medium term, the solution is to upgrade these treatment works and to reduce their throughput. In the long term, we have to end the policy of ocean outfalls altogether. For that reason, I very much welcomed the statement in January 1995 of the then shadow minister for the environment, Ian MCLachlan, and I very much welcome the clean seas budget initiative, part of the Natural Heritage Trust package of the government. It is very important that we reduce health costs to the general community. I cite that old adage that prevention is better than cure. I refer the House to what is called the Pulser program which is a program of medically supervised exercise for cardiac patients being carried out at Royal North Shore Hospital and many other hospitals in New South Wales. It is supervised by a doctor and it is run by paramedical staff but, unfortunately, participants are now paying up to $360 a year to join in. I would like to congratulate my constitute Ron Wylie for drawing attention to Pulser's plight. Private funds, I understand, sometimes will even reimburse gym fees, yet no-one reimburses people their expenses for medically supervised exercise under the Pulser program, even though millions and millions of dollars are being saved as a result of the better health of people who would otherwise be chronically ill. I call on the health funds to consider including the Pulser program in their list of benefits. Ron Wylie has collected a petition which has been signed by over 700 people in and around my electorate. Some pages of this petition will be presented to the House next Monday; some pages, unfortunately, are irregular. I will read the petition: We, the Citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House, the anomaly existing where we ,ufferers of cardiovascular, respiratory and arthritic diseases who participate under medical supervision, in the cardiac rehabilitation services offered by the Cardiovascular Education Centre at the Royal North Shore Hospital, and all others who receive such services from other institutions, receive NO reimbursement in relation to claims made to Medicare, Veterans Affairs or Private Funds. Your petitioners, therefore, pray that the House considers the undersigned petitioners appeal and that those eligible be compensated under the Health Care Act for the fees paid in connection with such services. I table this petition. Finally, I would like to draw the House's attention to the predicament of perhaps my most distinguished institutional constituent: Ken Arthurson, the Chairman of the Australian Rugby League-a former player, coach and boss of the Manly-Warringah Rugby League Football Club. Ken's delight at the success of Manly-Warringah in winning the Optus Cup just a couple of weeks ago turned to dismay last week when the Federal Court brought down its decision on Super League. I want to say to the House that Ken Arthurson and John Quayle have acted with great dignity throughout the Super League controversy. I very much hope that some arrangement can be made which ensures the great game of rugby league remains united and is administered for the benefit of players, spectators and district clubs rather than simply for media magnates-notwithstanding all the valuable contributions that they have made to the game.",42
42,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"Hinkler) (11.48 a.m.)With the time being shortened, I would like to make a few brief comments on the budget and on some pre-budget initiatives taken by the government. For too long Australian families, especially families in the middle and lower income earning brackets of the Australian population, have been neglected. I have been looking through press clippings of the last three years of the previous government. It is interesting to see just how badly the press accepted the three budgets prior to this current one. I think Laura Tingle's article on the 1995 budget sums it up-'Broken promises pave the way to poll'. That was her headline. I suppose it encapsulated what had been going on over the previous three yearsa lot of smoke and mirror tricks, a lot of giving with one hand and taking away with the other. I for one very readily welcome the family tax initiative because I think for the first time in many years it starts to put cash back into the pockets of the average Australian battler. Someone with, say, three dependent children who is earning less than $76,000 a year will get $23.10 a fortnight more. If that same family is earning less than $71,000 and has a child under five years it would attract another $19.20 or, if you like, $42.30. If you go up to four children in a similar circumstance, it is $50. Although that may not be big money by today's standards, I think it is a vast improvement on what families have had to suffer over recent years. What has happened to families has been insidious. The excise on petrol crept up slowly, even after Labor modified its infamous attempt to impose a 5c and a 7c increase at the beginning of its term. Even so, it increased it later not only by the CPI factor but also by increased excise of small amounts during those years. In addition, sales tax was delivered in two tranches-{)r, if you like to add cars to that, in three tranches-taking sales tax in what was the 10 per cent bracket to 11 per cent and then 12 per cent, in the 20 per cent bracket to 21 per cent and 22 per cent, and in the 30 per cent bracket to 31 per cent and 32 per cent. Then, of course, cars suffered another five per cent penalty on top of that after it had been promised that that would not happen in the foreseeable future. It is against that background that we deliver this valuable family tax initiative to low and middle income earners. As was pointed out by Ross Gittens in one of his articles, although the Keating government did deliver some tax concessions, it tended to be in the upper bracket of middle-class Australia and it neglected the people who really needed that help. The other thing that I commend heartily is the health insurance rebate. To have had Australia's health insurance profile reduced from 61 per cent or 62 per cent when Labor came to office to 32 per cent of the population is not only an insult to those people who want to be privately insured and take responsibility for their own health care but also a tremendous burden on the public hospital system. Having spent 15 years on a hospital board, I know just what those strains are and what state governments have to grapple with. There is no private facility in my own electorate of Gladstone. I think Gladstone would benefit from a private hospital. In a provincial city, unless you have a private hospital alongside a public hospital, you get to a point where there is not sufficient weightage to attract specialists. One of two things happen: they either come to town and work in the public system and generally get worked to death and give it away because they cannot get relief, cannot get conferences and work excessively long hours, including weekends, or, alternatively, they do not get enough operating time and cannot sustain themselves. When there is a private hospital you can generally work an arrangement: a mixture of sessional work at the public hospital, operating work at the private hospital and then the specialists' surgery facilities-all of which create a package that keeps specialists in provincial cities. Health insurance rebates are very important to mention because if there are not enough people in provincial cities to support the private hospital then it is not going to happen. I commend the government for introducing the rebate: $125 for single people earning less than $50,000, $250 for couples and $450 for families. I want to talk about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Labor Party has distorted this immeasurably in the various debates we have had on this issue in the parliament over recent weeks. I have done an analysis of pharmaceutical benefits, going right back to 1960 when the co-payment was 5Oc. It is very interesting to note that the co-payment for the broad mass of the population since Labor came to power increased from $4 to $16.80over 400 per cent. It crept up slowly over all that time. To come out now and become pious and preach to the coalition government because it has increased the co-payment to $20 is utter nonsense. If you look at the cost of pharmaceuticals during the same period, you will see that it is quite staggering. For example, the cost from 1992 to 1996 increased from $1.13 billion to $2.20 billion. It nearly doubled in that time. Is it any wonder there is a need for a co-payment? I do not mind the fact that Labor increased the co-payment if it did so in good faith. For example, on one occasion, between July 1985 and November 1986, it jumped up by $6-from $5 to $11. That was a fairly big jump, but nothing like the one we have put in place. We have left the safety net at $600. All that means is that someone who is on constant medication gets to that figure two prescriptions earlier than they would have otherwise got there. In other words, they might pay only an extra $2.80 on their prescriptions, but if they are unfortunate enough to be on constant medication they will not be disadvantaged. The safety net still cuts in at $600. The only difference is that they reach that two prescriptions earlier. That is a point the Labor Party have missed, and it shows that they have been manipulating this debate. Another interesting thlng about the safety net that they have preached to us so much about is that between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1996-five years-the safety net has increased from $300 to $600. So this caring Labor Party was saying to those people on constant medication, 'Hey, you guys, you've got to be twice as sick as you were five years ago to fall into the safety net.' I think that another point that has been missed in this whole debate. I want to finish on a matter that is perhaps not very popular in some parts of the country but where I think the government took the right policy decision-the closing down of REDOs. I spent 20 years in regional development and I never saw a worse scheme and I have never seen a better policy decision than to close those down. Those REDOs were excessively bureaucratic. They fostered a cargo cult mentality. They were generally not strategic in their planning. They were a sinecure for friends of the government on numerous committees. They had no sense of local ownership. They were derived from maps concocted in Canberra with no regard for local nuances. Worst of all, they were excessively expensive to run. I can remember that when the meeting to set up the REDO was held in my area I attended it. It was an interesting meeting. The promise was made, and it was also recommended by the interim chairman, that they should not become bureaucratic structures but that they should become umbrella organisations that would coordinate the work of the existing state based development boards. Everyone agreed to that; yet, within 12 months, we had these grants of $200,000 going out to run these REDOs. Generally, if you take the $150 million for that program, divide it by 41 regions in Australia, then take off a third for administration-which is absolutely abominable-then divide it by the number of years, there was not much there. It was another smoke and mirrors job. That is with the exception of those regions that got in fairly early and got a $2 million weir, or something like that. That is why I say 'cargo cult mentality'; I think that in the ordinary course of events many of those things would have been built by state governments anyhow. Because of that we have this excessively duplicative body sitting over the top of the existing development boards and destroying their focus. What made it even worse is that after these $200,000 grants went into the regions-that is was about the average-in some instances the department then put officers out in the country to supervise the REDOs and, presumably, the spending of the $200,000. It was like a comedy circus. I have always said that, if the Commonwealth is going to participate in regional development, that sort of money should be aimed at a strategic level and given to enhance the existing development board's ability in the fields of trade, planning and industrial promotion. That could have been achieved at a third of the amount that Labor proposed by enhancing tl e original state based development boards; for example, by providing them with development officers, planning officers or researchers, so that they could do the work. The beauty of those development boards is that they reflect the local community. They have local ownership, with 300, 400 or 500 members. They are representative of local government of the area. They are not political appointments. They have state government representatives on them. They have a sense of ownership. They are not wasteful with their expenditure. Many of them combine tourism and industry promotion together, so the government dollar is driven further. I have had a fair go on this matter. I have been asked to shorten my presentation. I wanted to put those things before the parliament at the time of this budget. I commend the government especialIy for its family initiatives. I am comfortable with its plans for health, child care and nursing homes-matters that I am quite happy to address at a later date. I would commend the government for the courage to put this REDO situation to bed and hopefully, as we move towards the end of this term, we can look at something better for regional Australia which will better reflect the aspirations of those areas that need development and need it desperately.",44
43,Mr MUTCH,COMMITTEES,"In rising to speak to the first coalition budget 14 years, I cannot help but note the vacant lot appearing opposite, both in space and intellectually. That is with the notable exception of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who was kind enough to second my private member's motion on the matter of preserving census forms-a matter which I know the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, supports wholeheartedly. It certainly says something about the comprehensive nature of the election on 2 March this year that the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to the budget barely made a ripple. It barely rated a mention. Indeed, media interest and, more profoundly, public interest have been much more apparent with respect to the maiden speech made to the budget by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). If I have time. I might make some comments later in my address on that. The contents of telephone calls to my office are all recorded. A perusal of this record gives a fair indication of the public response to contemporary issues. Prior to the budget my office records revealed some degree of anxiety. These fears were whipped up by an opposition that finds its main expertise false propaganda or disinformation and fuelling the fears of an anxious public. But a strange thing happened after the delivery of the budget. The phones went relatively quiet. Not only that, but in going around my electorate of Cook, I was gratified by the number of people who congratulated me personally on the budget. I have been quite happy to take some credit for a budgetary process with which, as a backbencher, I had perhaps minimal involvement. Of course, this applies also in the reverse. I have been on the receiving end of some voter dissatisfaction, particularly with flight paths currently being trialled. The long suffering people of Kurnell have beaten a well worn path to my door and have exercised their democratic rights to use their local member as a punching bag. Mind you, after they voted me a historic win in the in Kurnell polling booth, I am happy to receive their fulsome advice and will continue to endeavour to seek options that may improve their situation. I will outline some of the things that have been happening on this issue, particularly in light of some comments made by my friend and colleague, the newly elected Mayor of the Sutherland Shire, Councillor Kevin Schreiber, who is very concerned about the impact of trialling the flight paths on the residents of Kurnell. On 20 March 1996 the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) directed Airservices Australia to undertake a review of Sydney air space and report on the long-term operations by 16 December 1996. As part of this review I am ensuring that the proposals put forward by Kurnell residents are comprehensively evaluated. On 29 March I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development asking for an evaluation of proposals advanced by Kurnell and Cronulla residents. In April I met with the minister's senior adviser and departmental representatives, in the company of Kurnell and Cronulla residents, and representatives of the Sutherland Shire Council to discuss further these proposals. In June I met with representatives of Airservices Australia and Michael Day, author lies in of a plan being promoted by the Kumell flight path action group, which includes consideration of curved flight path approaches through the heads of Botany Bay. Today I had to leave a meeting with Michael Day and representatives of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and also a representative of the ministry of transport to come to the chamber to make this speech. The proposals put forward by Michael Day and the residents of Kurnell that were appropriated and are being promoted by the Sutherland Shire Council will receive and have been receiving detailed attention. The government has also established the Sydney Airport Community Forum, on which I am a delegate, as is the Mayor of the Sutherland shire. I am also allowed a nominee on the committee and my nominee is Kevin Hill, who represents Kurnell and other people affected in my electorate. Kevin has submitted to the community forum a list of proposals for detailed evaluation and consideration. These are being given the attention they deserve. In addition to my nominee on the Sydney Airport Community Forum, I have asked Peter Mattson of the North Cronulla Precinct Committee to serve as my nominated alternative to the committee. At the behest of Peter and the North Cronulla Precinct Committee, I have taken up the proposal that aircraft departing to the south should turn out to sea over Bate Bay-that is, after taking a jink to avoid the village of Kurnell-and thereby avoid hugging the Cronulla Peninsula coastline. This proposal had been talked about but had not been properly addressed prior to our government coming into office. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has, at my instigation, examined this proposal and approved it in principle. The option suggested by CASA involves a 13-degree turn away from the coast-from the 163 degree to the 150 degree radial. CAS A advises that this option would take aircraft approximately three kilometres further off the coast adjacent to Bundeena than is currently the case. This would be very much welcomed by the people living on the Cronulla Peninsula. Implementation of this proposal involves amendment to regulations, and I therefore urge the minister to implement these changes as soon as possible. I have received some complaints from residents of Sylvania who are experiencing an increase in aircraft activity due to the opening of the east-west runway and the propensity of pilots heading towards Melbourne to tum left and head south at the earliest opportunity. The recent announcement by the minister that he has directed Airservices Australia to implement, on a trial basis, take-offs to the north from the third runway will considerably alleviate this traffic as the Melbourne traffic will take off to the north, do a turn east out to sea and then proceed south over water. This would occur, generally, with onshore north-easterly winds-the prevailing wind pattern in the summer months. In addition, this procedure would reduce landings over Kurnell on the third runway by approximately 20 per cent. I have also received a lot of complaints from residents of Grays Point. They are being affected by the Melbourne traffic heading south. They are also being affected by some planes that are curving to approach and are doing a loop through the Sutherland shire, going over the top of Grays Point and then coming into land. I am very confident that the overview that is occurring at this time will do a great deal to assist in removing this type of flight path from residential areas and place them over areas more appropriate to pass over. It is a matter of making sure that all of these concerns, complaints and alternative proposals are put to the inquiry and are properly evaluated, and then we can look forward to a comprehensive plan that will be produced in December. That is something that sets us apart from the previous government, which prevaricated and acted completely politically at all times on the Kingsford Smith airport issue. The minister has taken some decisions. We as a government came in and made decisions, we are consulting and we will come up with a proposal that I think will do a lot to satisfy the concerns that are being expressed-with the caveat that, if you have a major international airport in the city of Sydney, you cannot please everyone and some people will obviously have to bear some effects from that airport. Another proposal that has recently emerged but seems to have sunk very quickly-I hope it has-was the idea of constructing another runway at the end of the two existing runways protruding into Botany Bay. That additional runway proposal would point out towards the Heads. I would like to put squarely on the record my opposition to that proposal. It is unfortunate really that we did build runways into Botany Bay. It seems strange that in a country as vast as ours-we are not like Holland or Hong Kong-we had to fill in bays. That is something we could have done without. The problem is that Botany Bay has already been severely damaged by the runways protruding into the bay and the associated dredging of the Botany Bay port. As a result of that, we have considerable problems affecting Taren Point aquatic reserve, which are wetlands of international significance. We are now looking at remedial measures, and I am hoping we can take advantage of some of the funding we are hoping to receive from the sale of a portion of Telstra. Those funds could be very useful in implementing proposals that have been already looked at and evaluated with respect to looking after this particularly important wetland. The idea of putting another runway in the middle of Botany Bay would, on environmental grounds, be catastrophic. I mentioned earlier that I would like to say a few words about the brouhaha that arose following the maiden speech of the member of Oxley (Ms Hanson). I was very concerned to read about the statements. I think it is an indication of the desperation of the opposition when you get statements from people who are stalwarts of the trade union movement like state Labor secretary, John Della Bosca. I think he pulled something right from the bottom drawer when he was quoted in the papers as saying, 'John Howard acts like a racist and profits by racism.' Frankly, that sort of comment is about as low as you can get. It is a despicable comment to make about a Prime Minister who is an honourable man, and anybody who knows him or has had anything to do with him knows that only too well. Secondly, the government is duty-bound, in my view, to take note of the issues raised by the honourable member for Oxley. This should be the case with matters raised by any honourable member of this House, including members of the opposition. I was particularly impressed by the answer given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this week in response to a question by the Leader of the Opposition. I noted two particular points that he made. He said that there should be 'robust debate in this country about the size of our immigration policy' and that 'people who exercise free speech have an obligation to do so in a sensitive and caring fashion'. I think that sums it up and says it all. I believe that the debate on immigration and settlement or population policy is one that needs to be entered into vigorously. There seems to be a creeping view that this vast land with a relative scarcity of water resources has reached its population peak. This proposition needs to be vigorously examined. I do not really believe it to be correct. I have always taken the view that the greatest resource of any country lies in its population, the fruits of its toil and the talents of an educated citizenship. This issue does need to be debated. It is an important debate that we should not shirk from. I have been asked to keep my contribution short because the opposition has been trying to create havoc with this parliament and inhibit the free speech of members. In deference to members who wish to make their contributions, I will conclude now.",47
44,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"It is a little while since the Treasurer (Mr Costello) brought down the first coalition budget in 14 years, so I took the trouble to refer back to his speech to give me a focus in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1). We have heard much about the deficit that we inherited-and I do not intend to revisit that-but I think most Australians accept that there was a budget repair task. The cabinet, the executive and the coalition parliamentary parties can take some credit for the effort that has gone in over the last seven months-and particularly leading up to the budget. It was an unenviable task that particularly our senior cabinet colleagues inherited. I want to go first to the charter of budget honesty. I think that that is a basis of the structure of our parliamentary process. It is right at the heart of encouraging a more honourable-and over time a much betteroutcome for the Australian people. Regarding the charter of budget honesty, the Treasurer said: Our Government will enact a Charter of Budget Honesty that will require the government of the day--ours or any otherI repeat that: ours or any otherto publish a budget update signed off by the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each Federal Election campaign. The public will be given updated financial information before the election, not after it. The public will know the state of books before they vote. That is very profound and very important, I congratulate the Treasurer and the executive for that stance. I move to an issue dear to my own heart: regional Australia. When you are in ment it is somewhat easy for your opponents to pick holes in your case. Having been opposition for one term, I respect their role and understand why many of them will take that opportunity from time to time. I thought I might just revisit some of those issues 37th Parliament particularly related to regional Australia. The one that really jumps out at you all time when you live in regional Australia is the fuel excise. When the Hawke government first came to power in 1983 it was 6c a litre and now it is 36c a litre for leaded fuel. think that indicates the insidious creeping attack on regional Australia, particularly through the indirect tax system. One other issue on regional Australia is of the regulated economy versus a less reguthat lated economy. We hear much about the industrial relations bill that is before Senate, with much negotiation with the Democrats and probably the Independents and the Greens. But no-one in that debate, particusome larly the opponents of the IR bill, ever cedes the huge reliance in regional Australia on the international commodity price and impact of a regulated economy. No-one talks about it; no-one wants to know about it. The great injustice that is inflicted regional Australia by this approach is quite remarkable. We have an urban dominant is culture which will not recognise the huge impact on regional Australia of the regulation that exists, remembering that up to 80 per cent of our exports and our lowest incomes come out of regional Australia. There is a great issue of straight social justice in this, and I am pleased that the budget begins to address that in no more profound an area than the assistance for isolated children's education. No group in Australia is more disadvantaged in education than in regional Australia. In my own state you will regularly see statistics taken over a the decade or so which show quite clearly that the lowest number of tertiary graduates come out and of regional Australia-and I think the lowest number come from South Australia. It is of some national shame that we are not able to do better in that area, but I am delighted that govern this budget begins to address that. I now tum to families. From 1 January in 1997 a one income family with two children with one under five will receive, through the tax system, a $34 improvement per fortnight in their situation. I am pleased that we are of the able to see our way clear to do that. There has been some focus on the increases in the private health system, but it is quite the remarkable that we are only discussing it because that incentive may be partially eroded by the increases. Over the previous decade or so, those increases were there all the time. I They were a fait accompli, with no-one challenging them. When the coahtion endeavours to address it, we come under some fire because there is some erosion through the that increases which were regularly there. I guess is politics. I am pleased that we have made an attempt to recognise those people the who try to take care of their own health through the private health insurance system. For self-funded retirees, it is pleasing to see equity with the pensioner allowances. conWe have a reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent with $180 million the in 1996-97 going to small business. From 1 July 1997 there will be capital gains rollover relief in relation to like business. That is on pleasing to report. The employee share scheme will also be improved. Something that particularly important to me is the issue of apprenticeships and training. It is pleasing to see that $207 million there over the next four years because apprenticeships have fallen to an all-time low in recent decades. I would like to briefly discuss the environment. As someone who was involved with the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation initiative in the Landcare program back in the late eighties, it is particularly pleasing to see that program maintained. We all know it would be in a much stronger position if we were able to get the Telstra legislation through the Senate. The point I would make about the Telstra legislation is that, despite all the guarantees of protection through the universal service obligation, we must never forget that the Democrats would never want anybody else to have a superior or at least an equal position on the environment. This is about the Democrats' self-righteous approach to the environment. They would not want anyone, apart from them, to decree what is right for the environment of Australia. It is a political reality that the Democrats do not want anyone coming in on their territory. For selfish political reasons, the Democrats have decided to block the Telstra legislation. They talk about ideology and public ownership of this great icon, but the real political reason is that they do not want anyone else to have their alleged high moral ground. It is a disgrace. They should face up to the reality and let us get on with doing what has to be done for the environment of Australia.",49
45,Mr ENTSCH,COMMITTEES,"Leichhardt) (12.26 p.m.)Unfortunately, tactics from the opposition have limited time for government speakers to be able to speak on this very important budget. I will do the best that I can in the limited time that I have. I rise today to address my government's first budget, a budget that follows in the wake of 13 years of Labor's mismanagement of the Australian economy and one which tries to address the irresponsible spending practices of the previous government that, in its arrogance, forgot about the real men and women of Australia. On 2 March this year the people of Australia spoke-r should I say screamed with rage-about being ignored and being made to feel aliens in their own country as Labor played the percentage game, throwing billions of dollars at minority groups in an attempt to shore up their failing electoral chances and, in that arrogance, still forgetting not only traditional support base but every Australian man, woman and child who did not claim membership to one of their pet specialised minorities. With one of the biggest political swings in recorded history the Australian nation spoke and called for responsible government, responsible fiscal management and recognition of the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australia. Labor did not hear that collective voice for 13 years. They did not hear it during the election campaign, and they are obviously not hearing it now. It is because of this mismanagement and this looking after the old Labor mates syndrome that they were resoundingly chucked out on their collective ears by a totally disenchanted Australian public. It is also why the Howard government have had to tighten the national belt and get this nation back on to a sane economic keel. Our first budget is not a forgiving budget, nor is it based on romantic economic principles that dictated the Keating years of borrow now to buy votes and to hell with tomorrow and future generations. It is an honest budget. It is a budget based upon accountability to the Australian public. It is based on the fact that, while we as a government were in no way responsible for the financial mess left to us, we are prepared to roll up our sleeves and work towards fixing the problem. It is a fair budget, a responsible budget and it is a budget for all Australians. Its acceptance not only by Mr and Mrs Average Australia but also by the world economic community demonstrates that both grassroots Australian people and the economic experts alike were sick and tired of the great Labor lie. Despite the difficulties we encountered when the real truth finally came out after the election of the true extent of the mess in which Labor left the Australian economy, we have been able to deliver on the key points of our election strategy. And make no mistake: no-one should underestimate the seriousness of the financial situation left to us. In simple terms, any Australian who holds a bankcard and who has to borrow every month to pay the minimum payment would be in exactly the same position we found ourselves in when their we came into government on 2 March. In spite of this, the $1 billion families package is, for the first time in 13 years, finally a recognition of the real Australia: the people who have suffered through ridiculously high interest rates, young people who had written off the chance of ever owning their own homes, and the elderly who could only pick up the crumbs from under Labor's table as the money that they were justly entitled to, after a lifetime of paying taxes, was handed out to minority groups. Like the rest of Australia, the families of Far North Queensland are the big winners under this family oriented budget. The $1 billion family tax initiative has given back to most average families in Leichhardt nearly $52 a fortnight, a move that not only will put a significant amount of money back into the family purse but also will be of immense benefit to the local economy when spent in local communities. This commitment to one of our major election promises is in sorry comparison with the previous government's l-a-w law tax cuts, which the Australian people are still waiting for following the 1993 election. Despite a massive Labor scare campaign on child care, this budget has ensured that child-care assistance is equitable and is provided to families in greatest need by addressing child-care growth and affordability. We will maintain the $256.6 million family day care operational subsidy in recognition of the role it has in providing quality, affordable child care. Subsidies will also be provided for some community centres in disadvantaged areas and occasional care centres. Vital to Far North Queensland is the additional $31 million which will be available over the next four years to enable children with additional needs, such as those with disabilities or in remote areas, to be accommodated in services. These child-care initiatives, along with the planned National Planning Framework with the states, will help to deliver a more even distribution of child-care places and will help to overcome Labor's ad hoc child-care system which has resulted in an oversupply in some areas and an undersupply in others, particularly in regional Australia. This budget has not forgotten our older Australians, one of the most important sectors in our community, who have worked all their lives to contribute to the well-being of our nation and, by every right, should be able to sit back and reap the benefits of all of that hard work. I have no doubt that unifying the nursing home and hostel systems into a singular residential aged care system will help to address the steep decline in infrastructure spending and maintenance that has occurred in aged homes in recent times. The twiceyearly indexation of pensions remains, and we have undertaken to maintain the pension at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. The guidelines for the age pension income and assets test have also been simplified to make it easier for senior Australians. For the first time ever, another important group of senior Australians, which has never been officially recognised by any government-ur independent retirees-has been the beneficiary of this budget. In his budget speech, Treasurer Peter Costello acknowledged this previously ignored group by offering them the same cash rebate as the pensioner rebate, taking them to a tax threshold of $11,185 by 1997-98. One of the most important challenges facing parents these days is ensuring that their children get a job after completing their education. Expanding on the family nature of the budget, my government has taken real steps to create real jobs. Labor's 'revolving door' training programs-designed more to hide the problem than to address the real issues-will be replaced with incentives to small business to help create real jobs, with a total of $5.4 billion being spent over the next four years on labour market and training program assistance. With $1,700 million over the next four years being provided for apprenticeships under the new modern australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, we will turn around the current sad state of our apprenticeship system which, under Labor, has seen the number of apprenticeships drop to the lowest level in 30 years. This money will be targeted to small and medium sized businesses. The first Howard budget has brought back recognition of all of those in the engine room of the Australian economy-the small business people and the farmers-those who are still holding a glimmering flame aloft for making a go of it on their own, so long ignored by Labor. It is the small business sector from which the real hope of job creation will come. In Leichhardt alone we have over 11,500 small businesses and we have, based on the latest statistics, 7,731 unemployed. If the Howard government's initiatives for small business help to create one extra job in only half of those small businesses, our unemployment problem in Leichhardt would almost cease to exist. Our small business initiatives, in company with the coalition's industrial relations age, will return the drive and the heart to the workplace, especially once we get rid of Laurie Brereton's absolutely ridiculous unfair dismissals legislation-<>ne of the worse of legislation ever introduced into this place and one of the most destructive devices ever conceived to limiting employment opportunity. In the dismantling of the 'jobs for the boys' syndrome and bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake attitude that has permeated the discredited Labor way of life in this nation for so long, innovations such as the Small Business Deregulation Task Force must come as a breath of fresh air to Australia's 850,000 small business people. For far too long our small businesses have been gradually steered away from what they do best-making a quid for themselves and for their countryand turned into unpaid pencil pushers for a mob of bureaucrats whose only role in life is to try to justify their own non-productive existence. A sad reflection of Labor's mismanagement was highlighted by the ALP member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) in his speech on the appropriation bill here on 17 September-I might add that he got his full 20 minuteswhen he stated that the 1995-96 bankruptcies were amongst the highest on record. But what that honourable gentleman omitted to mention was that the more than 25 per cent increase last year occurred while his party was in government. The heartbreakingly high number of bankruptcies into which many of Australia's small businesses have been forced over the past few years will, I expect, soon be a thing of the past with the impetus provided by this budget. All of these budgetary benefits-the family tax initiative, more money circulating in local economies, greater job opportunities, our IR legislation, the removal of the draconian unfair dismissal legislation, the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, along with the $500,000 relief from capital gains tax to fund the expansion, re-establishment or retirement of small business operators as well as the reduction to six per cent of the provisional tax uplift factor-mean that the coalition's promise to the small business people of Australia, packthe engine room of our economy, is quickly being met. This budget is the first major step in providing an environment for all small businesses that will see it quickly take up the pieces slack with real job opportunities. The one storm cloud on the horizon of our government's endeavours to give the Australian economy the economic recovery it needs and wants looms in the shape of the airheads in the Senate, the Democrats, who are supposed to be 'keeping the bastards honest' but who are more and more intent on keeping this country down simply to pander to their chardonnay approach to what life in Australia should be like, not what it actually is. I call on them to accept the Australian people's decision on 2 March and allow us to pass the appropriate legislation and let the people of Australia again be the judges of our performance at the next election. One of the other areas that has prospered under this budget has been local government in Far North Queensland. A $1 million boost in real terms to funding has seen my electorate's funding increased by 6.43 per cent, well above the Queensland state average increase of 4.87 per cent and the national average increase of four per cent. A new Austrade office in Cairns could not have come at a more opportune time for the Far North, with a $3.4 million 'supermarket to Asia' program and the reduction in the threshold of eligible expenditure of the export market development scheme, providing a valid and exciting future for Far North Queensland as it moves towards becoming the future food bowl for Asia. The Howard government has also turned to assist what effectively became one of the most underprivileged groups in the nation under the Keating years, our rural producers, suffering the multiple ravages of a government that didn't give a damn, an arrogant Prime Minister who proudly proclaimed on return from one of his many self-promotional trips overseas that 'Australia is no longer a sheep paddock or a quarry', and interest rates that crippled a once proud group of pioneer Australians, with many of them still suffering under financial burdens that would have bowed lesser men. The new coalition government has redressed this situation with innovative legislation that will bring a laser plane to Labor's ridiculously tilted agricultural playing field. Moves to lift the fringe benefits tax on rural accommodation supplied to workers have received very little kudos under the budget, but if ever there was a piece of innovative legislation to restore the working heart to rural Australia, this is it. After 13 years of neglect, Australia's rural population is now being recognised once again. This government has been very quick to implement schemes that have seen rural people able once again to provide basic education for their children, something that has been allowed to slide under Labor, with bush kids gradually falling into Third World status and being denied one of the greatest tenets of Australian life-the right to an education. Overall this budget is a budget for all Australians. It is a responsible budget. This budget is the start of responsible financial management that in time will see this country once again able to afford to develop infrastructure such as massive water projects to make our inland boom, essential power projects that will give us manufacturing capacity to become a real force in Asia and other road and regional infrastructure projects-a budget that will allow our government to fulfil its social obligations without plunging us into unaffordable debt.",51
46,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I appreciate the consideration of my colleagues in being cut short. I say to the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) that it is better to be cut short than caught short. This budget is a very different budget from the ones we have had for the last 13 years. This budget is a fair budget. It is based on honesty, not on fantasy. The budgets of the last 13 years have been grandiose, offering all sorts of things, along with promises that no Australian child would live in poverty by 1990. That was the substance of the Labor budgets. They never really produced. This budget is fair. It is fair to all Australians. While undoubtedly there are some people who will be unhappy with parts of it, it is essential that in this, the first budget of the Howard-Fischer government, we had to take the hard decisions. The future of Australia depends on our taking the right decisions, on taking the hard decisions. It is fair that the rich and wealthy among our citizens should pay their fair share. There were many instances where this did not happen under the previous Labor government. But it is happening in this budget. It is fair. It is true to the priorities that we established in the election campaign: small business, the family and the protection of the elderly and the disadvantaged. It is a believable budget. It is a budget of economic responsibility. Although we did not cause the problem, we have accepted the responsibility to go ahead and fix it. I say to the Labor opposition, to the Democrats and to the Independent senators that they have a great responsibility resting on their shoulders. Australians believe in a fair go and this government, having been elected with an outstanding majority, an absolute mandate, to get on and do the job, should be allowed to get on and do it. Anything else is not a fair go. If we are wrong and we make mistakes and we do not do it right, the people of Australia have the answer. At the end of the three-year term they can toss us out. But we should be given a fair go in the Australian context and allowed to get on with the job. I am delighted that we were able to produce so many things for small business. We need to get the budget through, but I say to the Democrats that if they are fair dinkum, they will listen to the people and let us get the budget through. The new apprenticeship scheme is more than satisfactory, it is exciting-$207 million over four years, which adds up to $1.7 billion over four years for apprenticeships and traineeships. And that is real apprenticeships, real traineeships, not the merry-go-round of popping people into training courses for a few weeks, then back on the dole, train them again, take them off the unemployment statistics and then back onto the unemployment benefit. We are looking for real training, real apprenticeships, so that they can get a real job. We do not want any more recycling of Australian men and women who have been on the unemployment list and who want to get a job. We are cutting the red tape for small business. We have already got lower interest rates. I hope that we will get even lower interest rates. The provisional tax uplift factor has been reduced from eight per cent to six per cent, and that is a benefit for small business of $180 million this year. Once the Senate lets the budget through, the capital gains tax variations for small business will be more than significant. When somebody sells a business to enlarge, expand or go into another business or, on retirement, they put the proceeds, up to $500,000, into an approved retirement fund, that amount will not attract any capital gains tax at all. That is of great benefit to small business because the small business men and women of Australia work their guts out, to put it very bluntly, very often for seven days a week. They see their business as their superannuation, and that is all they have got. I am delighted that this government has kept its promise to provide that capital gains tax exemption for small business. The real benefit for small business will come once the industrial relations bill is passed by the Senate. The unfair dismissals legislation introduced by the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), w-ich does not work, which victimises small busmess and employers, has to go. There will be great benefits, too, from the workplace agreements that will be available. We have seen the most comprehensive family tax package ever seen in this country. While, naturally, I am concerned that the operational subsidy has been cut for some child-care centres, more than $1 billion will be provided this year for child care. In the portfolio of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), $24 billion will be provided for aged care and child care over the next four years. That is a very substantial sum of money. I am particularly pleased that $36 million has been provided for respite for carers. My electorate has a very large number of people who are elderly and in need of care, or are disabled. The problems for the person who is the carer, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, are absolutely horrific. I am delighted that the Howard-Fischer government has provided $36 million for respite for carers. One of the other very positive aspects is funding for school education, which is up by five per cent next year. In 1995-96, which was a Labor budget year, $1,124 million was provided for school education. In 1996-97, in this budget, we are increasing that to $1,167 million. We have abolished Labor's new school policy, which was a no new school policy. This will be of great benefit for schools around Australia. Illiteracy is a major problem in this country. We tend to shove it under the mat and ignore it, but we should not. Whether you are an Aboriginal Australian, a migrant entering the country who cannot speak English, or even a native born Australian, if you are not literate and if you do not have numeracy skills, you are battling. Literacy is of vital importance. So we have allocated $45 million for a fouryear literacy strategy. I am delighted about that. I have been amazed in the course of this debate to hear some opposition members talk about a cut in road funding. I do not know what statistics they are looking at, but the reality is that last year the Labor government spent $1,569.7 million on roads. In this budget we are providing $1,603.5 million; next year, that jumps to $1,625 million; and the year after that it jumps to $1,656.8 million-a very substantial increase for road funding in this country. Of course, they are the basis of our whole economy and our trade. I am very pleased that we have reinstated the black spots program by allocating $36 million for that. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that one of the things I am really thrilled about, because it is of such great importance to primary industry, agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing, is the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. That is vitally important the fishing, forestry, agriculture and mining sectors. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to people in local government in the electorate of Cowper. I am talking about the councillors, the general managers, the office staff, and the outdoor staff working on the roads and other projects. They do a tremendous job. That is why I am very pleased that the input and the effectiveness of local government have been acknowledged and recognised with a funding increase of four per cent. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the electorate of Cowper, with its climate which the CSIRO says is the best in Australia-the optimum climate for the human animal-has very large numbers of self-funded retirees. Under the previous Labor government, self-funded retirees had a very raw deal indeed. This is why I am very pleased that we first came out in the election campaign with a promise to do something for them. Now this has actually happened and self-funded retirees will benefit from having the tax-free threshold increased from $5,400 to $11, 185-thus providing some fairness, justice and equity for self-funded retirees. It also means that couples who are self-funded retirees will not have to pay any tax whatsoever with a joint income up to $19,850-a measure that is long overdue. I have already mentioned the $1 billion family tax package which, when the budget goes through, will provide substantial cash in the pocket, the purse for the parents, the mums and dads of Australia. I would like to talk briefly in the time is left to me-because, as I said when I started, we are limited on time-about what has happened from this budget for the electorate of Cowper. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, this budget I am delighted with in terms of my own electorate. We know that there have had to be cuts for higher education. But I am very pleased that Southern Cross University, which has campuses in Lismore and Coffs Harbour, will not be cut because of its growth potential and its programs which are meeting the needs of the community. In fact, in 1997 Southern Cross to University will get an increase of three per cent and in 1998 another increase of three per cent. This is evidence of the Howard-Fischer the coalition government meeting the needs of regional universities. Very briefly, before the budget there was all of this scaremongering about a Medicare hitlist-all these offices were going to close. Why do the unions and the opposition set out to try to scare people? Of course, this is what they did, but there was no Medicare office hit-list. There still is no Medicare hit-list. I am delighted that once we get everything under way, we will be establishing Medicare offices in selected pharmacies to provide Medicare services to people throughout Australia who at the moment are remote from them. The electorate of Cowper is short of nursing home beds, hostel places and community aged care packages. I am delighted to see the Minister for Family Services at the table because I know that she knows, because I have told her time and time again, that under Labor's pork-barrelling-their unfair distribution of the assets of this country-Cowper has missed out and there has been a tremendous shortfall. I am hopeful that in the fullness of time we will get some equity and justice and the people of Cowper will get some of the beds and hostel places to which they are entitled. For the past 12 years I have been fighting for two things in particular. One is SBS television. Again, this budget is providing SBS television next August for the people from Yamba down to Port Macquarie, and I that am very pleased about that. My major thrust for the time that I have been here has been the Pacific Highway. When I first stood for election in 1984, I made the point that we had to have a new Pacific Highway, a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway all the way from Hexham to the Queensland border. At that time people said, 'Garry, you're a nut. You're mad. That will never happen. It's pie in the sky.' I knew it was going to happen, I knew it had to happen and it is happening. I congratulate the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on what he has done, and the cabinet as a whole, in providing that funding for the Pacific Highway. It will have a major impact on everybody in Australia because so many people use that Pacific Highway. I repeat: this budget is fair and it is good for most Australians. I have only one other point I would like to talk about and then I will yield the remainder of the time to my friend and colleague the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). But I must, in one and a half minutes, refer to the state Labor government and what they are doing to the forests of New South Wales not just with the RACAC report but in creating 45,000 extra hectares to be added to national parks, an additional 153,000 hectares to wilderness areas and 671,000 hectares deferred from logging. This is a king-hit on the timber industry of New South Wales-towns like Dorrigo will be destroyed. The timber industry is under enormous attack. I encourage the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in his negotiations with the New South Wales government to stand up, as I know he will, for the timber workers, the forest workers and the people involved in sawmilling so that they can get a fair go. They will not get one from the state Labor government unless we can do something for them.",54
47,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEES,"Wannon) (12.58 p.m.}-As the last speaker on this budget debate, I reinforce again what an excellent budget this is, what a great job the Howard-Fischer government has done and, in particular, what a tremendous amount of work and positive results we will see from the efforts of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in putting together the first budget of this coalition government. It is a budget that has been extremely well received right throughout Australia, a budget that has reassured many Australians that not only did they make the right decision back in March in the change of government but they will see some really sound economic management-something that Australia sorely lacked in the last decade or so under Labor. In the short time that I have available, I will concentrate on one aspect of the legacy of Labor, a legacy that no-one could be proud of-that is, what has happened to savings and, more particularly, how Labor in fact set about to run up debt to try to cover up its own shortcomings in its budget mismanagement. Looking at the figures, we see some quite staggering things. In the last four years, under Labor, Commonwealth debt increased by 300 per cent. More staggering is that in the last 13 years, foreign debt of Australia increased by an incredible 800 per cent. That all occurred under the Labor government. One of the worse legacies of the Labor years is the dangerously low levels of national savings that have come with this. It is an ominous sign that, apart from the war years and the Great Depression, under the previous government savings reached their lowest level this century. From 1973 to 1983 Australia's national savings rate was 22 per cent of our gross domestic product. Despite its rising to 22.4 per cent in 1988-89, the recession that we had to have under Labor inflicted enormous damage on the savings rate and the figure had fallen to 16.8 per cent by 1994-95. As a result, our national savings are not only 5.6 per cent of GDP below the prerecession figure of 1988-89 but also they have dropped below the lowest point of the 198283 recession. As the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, said in November last year: We are not saving enough to finance all the investment we want to make, necessitating substantial overseas borrowings and other calls on foreign savings. And: The real issue for Australia in the debt area is not the debt burden of any particular sector but the macro-economic task of raising national saving. Clearly, as the former governor put it so succinctly, this is a very serious problem and it is something that the present government has inherited from the failed Labor government. One of the great concerns is that, when we look at both public and voluntary household savings, we find they are in fact in a precarious state. More concerning is the fact that they have declined when we compare them with those of our Asian neighbours. In fact, if we look at the achievements of many Asian and OECD countries, we find quite clearly that saving both funds investment and, more importantly, generates further investmentsomething that we clearly need to help solve some of our unemployment problems and some of the many other related problems. If we look at the household saving rates as a percentage of disposable household income, we find that in 1995-96 Australia was down to just 2.5 per cent. This compares with Japan at 13.4 per cent, nearly six times; Germany at 11.6 per cent; and even the United States at 4.7 per cent. If we consider it, it is through a lack of adequate savings that we have been forced to look offshore for financial resources. In other words, we have had to rely on the savings of foreigners and this has been one of the instrumental causes of the rise in our national debt. So what we have seen is that from the time that Labor came into power in 1983 until earlier this year Australia's foreign debt went from $23,000 million to a staggering $180,000 million. But it is even more concerning when you look at what has happened to public savings: Labor actually reduced national savings by 3.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. Not only that, when we look at the cumulative figures in recent years, we see that Commonwealth debt has gone from $55 billion to over $97 billion because of the cumulative budget deficit in recent years. One of the other related areas that is of equal concern is the plight of household savings. Once again, when we look at the figures under the Labor government, we see some very telling figures. In the March quarter of 1983, household savings were around 7.6 per cent of household disposable income. By September 1995, this figure had slumped to 3.6 per cent-less than half. If you look at the liabilities of interest bearing assets of the household savings, you find it even more alarming. In fact, the household sector actually went into deficit and is a net payer of interest. Whatever way you look at it, the Labor government holds a number of dubious records. The first is that household savings are at near record low levels, while household debt as a percentage of disposable income is at record high levels. Why did this happen under Labor? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, our level of income tax was high compared with that of many of our competitors. Secondly, we did not experience the growth in incomes necessary to allow most people to save. Thirdly, our savings were taxed at the full marginal income rate on real and also on nominal gains. Labor did nothing to provide the incentives necessary to encourage voluntary savings by Australian families. This level of tax which so many Australians suffered from particularly affected those who wished to save. It affected their interest income. What was bizarre about this was that it affected blue-collar workers more than anyone else. They were the hardest hit by this attack on household savings. What are the consequences of this? With our foreign debt already high, foreign financiers are building premiums into the terms on which they are prepared to lend us money. In other words, like an overgeared corporation, we are gradually becoming more exposed to the risk of external shocks. A major future shock could push Australia into a debt spiral which we could only escape from by making extremely harsh and protracted adjustments. There are other indicators of just how irresponsible this was. For example, our foreign credit rating was downgraded-not once, but twice. Our foreign currency credit rating was downgraded by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's, first in 1986 and again in 1989. That is some record. This is what the new government has inherited. This is the challenge that this budget takes up. This budget will be hailed as a success because it will tum around the problem of national savings and, just as importantly, it will encourage an increase in household savings and, in particular, voluntary savings. I could go on at some length about the risks caused by low savings levels. One of the immediate results is that, for many Australians, interest rates are significantly higher than they are in comparable countries throughout the world. Anyone who looks in the back of the Economist month after month can see just how serious the difference is in the interest rates that affect households. More seriously, if it is not addressed, there is a risk of loss of sovereignty as we become more and more dependent on the mercy of foreign lenders and have less and less of a in the way we conduct our economy. It always seemed ironic to me when the former Prime Minister talked about increasing independence of this country when it was through his actions, both as Treasurer and Prime Minister, that we became increasingly dependent on foreigners-not more independdocument ent. This budget will have some very positive effects for people in the country, those in my electorate of Wannon. One of the real concerns in my electorate has been the journed. effect Labor's economic mismanagement has had on the farming sector, especially those who have had to borrow to remain viable. One of the major concerns is the level of debt in the farming sector that Labor more than doubled. It is now something like $18,000 million. The higher interest rate premium that first time. I was talking about earlier has had a direct negative effect on those who have been put in that unfortunate position. What the government is doing in what I hail as the excellent budget of the Treasurer is to tum around some of these negative This aspects of economic mismanagement. That is why I believe that not only are all Australians very positive about this but also the opposito tion ought to be positive because they know in their hearts, underneath it all, that it has taken this change of government to really start to tum the nation around, to really start to give the next generation some real hope and to stop some of the non senses that were going on with the smoke and mirrors were being employed by some of the Labor treasurers. I come back to this point about savings. is just so important that if we are going build a sound, secure future base then clearly it has to be by encouraging individuals to increase their level of savings and, of course, not to continue to run up deficits in the public sphere because those only draw on the savings of the nation itself. From those two perspectives I believe that we face some very serious decisions. We have taken the first of these, although there will obviously have to be more down the way. The level of savings is something that should say be of great concern nationally. Clearly, this government has started to do something about it. It is something that all Australians should the be deeply concerned about because without this action the country could face some very as serious problems in the years to come. I commend this budget. It is an excellent and I believe it is the hallmark of sound, responsible government. Clearly, it is something that all Australians are going to particularly benefit greatly from. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adNA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read a Second Reading",57
48,Mrs MOYLAN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. bill will give legislative effect to a 1996 government budget decision to discontinue the payment of the untargeted operational subsidy community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. This bill will also give legislative effect to a 1996 budget decision to apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the child care cash rebate for families on higher incomes while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes. This change will that take effect from 1 April 1997. The bill will also introduce amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and It compliance requirements consistent with the to intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. Currently, operational subsidy is paid under section 11 of the Child Care Act 1972 for child care places provided by community based services but not for places provided by the private sector. Seventy per cent of all centres are privately operated centres. The repeal of section 11 from the Child Care Act addresses the inequities in government funding between families using private long day care centres and community centres. The removal of operational subsidy will place community based long day care centres and private long day care centres on an equal footing. It will also encourage greater efficiencies. Operational subsidy will continue to be made available for family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse child-care needs of Australian families. Assistance will be provided to help community based long day care centres losing operational subsidy to restructure their business and to ensure families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care. Over a two-year period, $8.3 million will be provided to enable community centres to purchase financial or management advice to improve operating practices and adjust to the loss of operational subsidy. The withdrawal of operational subsidies for community based services will not affect the quality of care as this will be maintained for all centre based long day care services through the quality improvement and accreditation system. There is presently no link between a family'S income and their level of entitlement to the child-care cash rebate. While access to the child-care cash rebate will be retained for all families regardless of income level, it is equitable to apply a lower level of entitlement for those families who need assistance less. Families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut-offs for part A of the Family Tax Initiative will have their benefit maintained at 30 per cent of their claimable child-care costs, while families with a taxable income in the current year greater than these cut-offs will entitled to a reduced rate of benefit of 20 per cent of their claimable child-care costs. This reform to the child-care cash rebate scheme ensures that government assistance is targeted to those most in need, while still recognising child care as a legitimate work related expense. Further amendments to the child-care cash rebate scheme implemented by this bill will improve the administration and accessibility of the child-care cash rebate scheme. The government wishes to ensure that the child-care cash rebate is available to those who are genuinely in need of assistance. The government is equally concerned that those who do not have a legitimate need are held accountable for any payments to which they are not entitled. To that end, further refinements to the operation of the child-care cash rebate scheme will ensure that foster parents and persons with long-term informal parenting responsibilities are eligible for the child-care cash rebate; that the rebate is payable for two sets of child-care fees for the one period of care in certain circumstances; that the Health Insurance Commission has the power to suspend claims where a problem with a registration or claim has been identified; that rebate cannot be paid for care provided by a registered carer to children of that registered carer's partner; and that carers must notify the Health Insurance Commission if their circumstances have changed, affecting their eligibility to be registered. To further clarify the legislation, the definition of child care will be revised and consequential amendments will bring the Childcare Rebate Act into line with recent amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Lawrence) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Report",59
49,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (1.18 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the first report of the committee for 1996 relating be to the implementation of rock fall risk reduction strategies on Christmas Island. Ordered that the report be printed.",60
50,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Public Works Committee is a unique committee. It is unique in that, whereas other parliamentary committees engineer particular referrals that are of interest to the strategies of that committee, the Public Works Committee only has the referrals that are brought to it by other departments. It does not engineer its workload; its workload is dictated by departments that undertake capital works of in excess of $6 million. It is therefore worth noting that when the work on Christmas Island was referred to the Public Works Committee it came not at the committee's behest but at the behest of the appropriate department. I make that point because there were some among my parliamentary colleagues who presumed that sending the Joint Committee on Public Works to Christmas Island meant sending them to an idyllic spot. It is true. I am sure that, as a Western Australian, the shadow minister at the table is more familiar than most with just how idyllic a spot Christmas Island is. It is true that Christmas Island is a tropical island. It is true that Christmas Island is a slowly growing tourist attraction. However, it is also true to say-and the parliament needs to recognise this-that Christmas Island is a huge phosphate mine. The scars from the mining have now largely been overgrown by tropical growth. The phosphate mine no longer has first-grade phosphate available, and so the Christmas Island community has, in recent times, faced some difficulty adjusting to life without the income from the phosphate mine. I will outline the history of the island for the benefit of my parliamentary colleagues. Christmas Island as such first came into being in 1888 when the British acquired it. They recognised the worth of the phosphate and proceeded to mine it. In 1947, the Australian and New Zealand governments purchased the phosphate mining operation from the British government. That proceeded until 1987, when high-grade ore ceased to be available. That could have been the end of Christmas Island, but two things have subsequently happened. Firstly, a casino was built which has attracted interest from all around the globe, but principally from Indonesian and Malaysian players. Secondly, a new company was formed to process the low-grade ore that remained as a result of the high-grade ore processing that had already occurred. As this is part of Australian territory, the Australian government of the day, I concede quite responsibly, recognised that they had a responsibility to maintain on Christmas Island the standards that exist on the Australian mainland. While the then government undertook a rebuilding program on the hospital and the school, and while airport facilities have been upgraded to meet demand for the casino, it is also fair to say that unemployment has not been a major problem on the island because of the growth of the casino and the reworking of the phosphate mine. In fact, it is below the unemployment levels existing on the mainland. The island population numbers about 2,000 to 2,200 people, depending on how many visitors are there. Many of the community are of Malaysian descent because, when it was first in operation, the British phosphate mine attracted Malay employees. The population of Christmas Island lives principally in five areas. The Settlement is the major retailing area on the island. Adjoining it is the Kampong, which I will deal with in a few moments time. The other three areas are Poon Saan, Silver City and Drumsite. The reason that the activities on the island were brought to the attention of the Joint Committee on Public Works was that in February 1995, a 30-tonne boulder collapsed near the Kampong area, posing a risk to human life in the area. The management of the island suggested that it would be responsible for the Commonwealth to minimise this risk by looking to some form of strategy to deal with it. The Kampong, which was the area particularly threatened by the rock fall, is at sea level. It is a settlement which is overlooked by a steep cliff which rises 180 metres above the Kampong and which poses the rock fall risk. The danger to life and property posed by loose boulders from the cliff face has been known for some time, and numerous incidents have been reported, the most recent of which, as I said, was in 1995. A landslide risk assessment that was carried out by specialist consultants following incident I have referred to highlighted the risk that was posed to the residents of the Kamone pong area. Advice from the AttorneyDEST General's Department demonstrated that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to implereduction ment appropriate risk reduction strategies. While it is difficult to assess the risk is, the whole question of what should happen on Christmas Island in terms of reducing rock falls was a matter of assessing the probability of a particular disaster occuridentify ring. The areas of particular concern to the Commonwealth are two residential blocks known as block 408 and block 412. The tions consultant who, in the Golder report, assessed the risk, indicated that at block 408 he felt that the individual risk per annum of there being any fatality was one in 11,000 to one in 63,000, and one in 53,000 to one in 300,000 at block 412. While they may seem like relatively figures, the facts are that they still represent a higher risk than a number of activities that Australians would normally engage in. For that reason the Commonwealth felt an obligament. tion to look at these rock fall reduction egies. The consultant's report, which I have tabled, attaches the greatest risk of fatality residents of these blocks. Under the Christmas Island redevelopment program the government the island. has allocated nearly $2 million for the construction of rock fall barriers of a modem, sophisticated design, adjacent to these residen- Island tial blocks. These barriers will stop the equiis valent of a 10 tonne truck travelling at 50 kilometres per hour. Because of the need proceed with the work before the forthcoming wet season, the committee agreed to the immediate construction of the barriers. will reduce the level of risk substantially. The committee has also recommended that before this December, the Department Environment, Sport and Territories should have ready a rock fall risk management plan for Flying Fish Cove. The plan should identisupport fy events, document responses, assign responstaff sibilities amongst the various organisations, research, monitor and increase the community awareness of risks and dangers. Simulated the exercises should be undertaken. This reference was somewhat unusual in respect: instead of a definitive proposal, presented the committee with a range of strategies, five in all, which provide risk measures, the construction of fences and barriers, and the provision of alternative precisely what accommodation. All would involve expenditure by the Commonwealth. DEST was unwilling to a preferred strategy. The consultant who made the risk evaluations was therefore asked by the committee to make recommendaappropriate to the circumstances. Reliance on expert advice was seen by the committee as the most prudent course to follow. I should mention here that the consultant has many years experience both in Australia and overseas in landslide investigation, coastal geomorphology and geological studies of civil low and mining projects. It was clear from community reactions that the most pressing need on Christmas Island is the availability of land for private developThe committee has made a number of stratrecommendations designed to reduce risks from rock falls and to hasten the release of land. If implemented, they will substantially to reduce the need for the Commonwealth to continue investing large sums in housing on Finally, I should mention the Christmas Boat Club, which has premises in what seen as a high risk area. The premises were subject to a potentially catastrophic event into 1972 involving several large boulders. The consultant has recommended that the premises be demolished. The committee has agreed to This this but has also recommended that a new safer site be found for the club and that the construction costs for a new building be wholly or partially funded from the communiof the ty benefit fund. I thank fellow committee members for their in preparing this report. I thank the and commend the report to the house.

NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 October, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",61
51,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I started this speech yesterday and unfortunately it was interrupted because of other business. Returning to the topic today, I would like to point out what is happening in the community in terms of this budget and this government's approach to beneficiaries. The government puts forward with enormous energy and at great expense to the taxpayers a thesis that the budget cuts are only occurring in areas where they are deserved. In other words, the cuts affect people who are rorting schemes or rorting business welfare or affect people who are not observing the rules. The government claims the community benefit is being achieved by cutting certain areas. The implication is that those people who are affected by the cuts are themselves responsible. In other words, the ones who are being cut deserve to be cut and therefore they should not complain. That sits very badly with the thesis of the government at election time about protecting those most in need of help and maintaining income for pensioners and the like. Those two objectives sit very badly. The fact is the people who are affected by these budget cuts are expressing the view that they are made to feel somehow it is their fault but they do not know quite why. They are upset and they are hurt and they are concerned. They do not know why they have been targeted or picked on for punishment. They were not aware they were offending. However, all the pundits cannot be wrong so therefore it must be their fault. One day they will realise that it was not their fault, that the whole thing is a furphy and a concoction and a quite deceitful exercise. The fact is the government has lied. It lied during the election, it lied up to the budget and it has lied since the budget. The example I mentioned yesterday which best demonstrates that is the question of the average earning credits scheme. The second reading speech says the scheme is being wiped out because is it is too complicated and people do not understand it. That was the only reason put forward. What the minister did not say was that it is also saving $250 million from pensioner and beneficiaries payments. I quoted yesterday the example of people who take part-time work for a short period, like being a Santa Claus at Christmas. This is one of the things that brought this process into place, the fact that at some times of the year some retired people will work for a couple of weeks at Christmas time as a Santa Claus. In the past, before this process was available, they were likely to lose most if not all of their pension for that period and the net benefit of all that work was that they ended up almost no better off. But they liked doing that, they enjoyed the engagement, they enjoyed that experience. The earnings credit scheme that allows you to earn $1,000 averaged over a year was a great benefit to those people. Sure, it was complicated. Sure, it cost to administer it. But the point was it was to encourage people in our community to feel that they could be judged on earnings like they could on tax. The fact was that they earned, they paid tax over a whole year, but if they were a pensioner or beneficiary they were effectively punished week by week by week. Even if for the whole year they averaged $30 a week, which would be below the cut-off point for pension cut-out, they could still lose their pension for two weeks if in fact they earned that $1,000 in a fortnight. The fact that it is going to save a quarter a billion dollars is indicative that this was about the complexity and it was not about the difficulty of administration, it was always about the saving. Yet, the government has been so dishonest with what it has put forward. The fact is that most people who are affected by it do not know about it yet. When they finally find out they are going to be very angry and they will feel very cheated. It affects something like 120,000, which is no small number. As for it being too hard to access and too complicated, the fact that it is saving so much indicates that a lot of people have understood it. I want to go through just nine measures in this legislation that are affected. The under18-years change to jobsearch means a saving of $29 million. The activity test on beneficiaries means $377 million savings; the earnings credit scheme that I have just mentioned is a saving of $259 million. The employment education entry payment, to help people back into employment, saves $59 million. The backdating of child disability allowance-that is a nice little exercise-amounts to $6 million. The lump sum super payment saves $58 million, deeming for pensioners with the first $2,000 or $4,000, $40 million. The debt recovery-this is wonderful, this is the one where it says that social security can never be wrong-brings in $372 million and the advance system of $79 million. That comes to $1.279 billion. One point three billion dollars will be ripped off pensioners and beneficiaries. These are the people that this government was supposed to protect. If that is protection, I would hate to see if they got punished. That is not taking into account, also, the cuts to Working Nation and all the other things that have been done. But it still leaves $1.3 billion in nine measures. There are other measures involved as well in here, but those nine are enough to talk about: $1.279 billion out of the pockets of pensioners and beneficiaries. The savings will not be achieved because a lot of people will not do those things. A lot of the pensioners will not work as Santa Claus any more and that will be a tragedy. But they will not do it because they would of lose their pension for a week or a fortnight not and create all the hassles involved. If the government thinks the earnings credit scheme is complicated, I can tell you it is nowhere near as complicated as trying to explain to a pensioner that if they work for a fortnight at $500 a week they will lose most of their pension and have to pay back that pension if they do not put in a form. That is much more complicated. It will cost much more to administer and it will mean people, once they know about it, simply will not do it. So they will not get the savings anyhow. All they will do is drive people out of the system. The point is that these savings are illusory because they are only available if these systems are in place. Take them away and the people will not do it. Mind you, with some of them they will have no choice, like the deeming one. That is the one where the first $2,000 for a single pension or $4,000 for a married couple of money in the bank will be charged at full deeming rates. The child disability allowance, being paid backwards for a year, for the families with children with disabilities who receive that allowance, has been a major thing. For many families the costs and the burdens and the problems of having a child with a disability do not really formulate. It often takes six or nine months before they actually get it diagnosed properly. To cut that out at the cost of saving a measly $6 million sends a very nasty message to all people in the community with disabilities. This government is against people with disabilities. That measure of support to those families with special problems had been a fundamentally important one. By ripping it back, ripping it away and putting it backwards for only three months is a really gross measure. It is a mean, nasty exercise aimed at those people who are the most worse off. There is an argument for saying we should go back to birth, not to 12 months ago, because those families have borne the burden by themselves in many cases for one or two or three or four years, in many cases even longer, not knowing what is causing it and feeling responsible themselves. The child disability allowance has been a minor way in which the community has been able to help that family look after their young. So, as I said, this government's measures are very nasty. Two that go hand in glove are the new activities test on what constitutes suitable employment and the debt recovery process, which is amongst the last of the amendments. Between them, they come to about $700 million, more than half the $1.2 billion I spoke of. What is in future deemed to be suitable employment is going to be very interesting. For example, if a fitter and turner turns down a job as a labourer, it will probably be deemed that he is not entitled to social securiamendments. ty. On the other hand, once he has worked as a labourer and he applies for his next job as a fitter and turner, his deskilling will have serious consequences. Not many employers will take on a skilled tradesman who has been working outside his trade in a lower skilled area. Once a person does that, he diminishes his employability. Under this new system, that will be the case. I and many of my colleagues in this House, and perhaps even the Senate, are getting an increasing number of people coming to our offices with worries and concerns about how these things will work and what is happening in our CES and DSS offices. The number of staff has been reduced, so there are fewer people dealing with cases on a face-to-face basis an.d making judgments. The skill levels are lower because a lot of the people who left were the most experienced in the department. The uncertainty amongst the staff is enormous. They do not quite know how to interpret it, so they are going to the maximum in case they are wrong. In other words, people are being treated at the harsh end of the scale because the departmental officers do not want to be seen not to be applying the laws. These amendments are being quoted to people right now. As recently as yesterday afternoon, I was advised of a case where the department quoted the need to take into account now the amendments which are coming into operation in January. If Social Security staff make a mistake and it is their unforced error, not the person's, then what these amendments say is that the person will still pay. So the government's approach is: reduce staff, deskill the work force in the Department of Social Security and the CES and then, if they make a mistake, the beneficiary pays. In other words, Social Security and CES can do no wrong. That is a saving of $370 million-off whom? It is off beneficiaries, off unemployed people. These amendments target the worse off in our community-the beneficiaries and the pensioners. They rip out $1.2 billion from their current incomes. This is a government that is supposed to govern for all. Try and tell that to the people who are affected by these They do not feel included at all. They feel victimised and targeted. They are also told it is their own fault. These amendments should be voted down. They are abysmal and an insult to the parliament.",63
52,Mr LINDSAY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) argued that the country should continue to spend more than it has. Neither he nor I in our private finances can spend more than we have year after year, and neither can the country. He was effectively saying, 'Let the kids and grandchildren of the pensioners in this country have the problem.' I do not believe that is a responsible way for the government to go. This afternoon, I am going to give some good news in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill. Tuesday, 1 October 1996 was the International Day for the Elderly. In Townsville, aged care representatives from nursing homes, hostels and day care respite centres gathered with nursing home residents, home carers and volunteers for an aged care services celebration. It was a day to honour not only elderly Australian citizens, but also a day to recognise the dedication and work of Townsville's and Thuringowa's aged care workers. A significant number of retired people live in my electorate and it was my pleasure to be able to pass on a message of both thanks and congratulations to those gathered for the International Day of the Elderly at the Villa Vincent Home for the Aged. . We have all heard the statement, many tImes before, that Australia has an increasing ag-in- population. It was as true 10 years ago as It IS today, and every year pressure builds on our aged care system to better cater for, care for and accommodate our elderly Australian citizens. One group of people that I had the opportunity to thank publicly on October 1 were the home carers. While aged care workers do get recognition in society from time to time, though nowhere near enough, home carers receive practically no praise or thanks at all. The honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) made a point during the last parliamentary sitting week that bears repeating. The honourable Minister for Family Services said: The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 74 per cent of assistance needed by the frail elderly and people with a disability living in the community is provided by their relatives and friends on an unpaid basis. Without the assistance of these carers, many of the most dependent and vulnerable people in our community would find it very difficult to remain living at home. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for Pearce for spending s?me time - n .Townsville recently. During the tIme the mInIster was in Townsville, she was able to meet with representatives from aged care, child care and emergency care services. Not once during the many meetings the minister attended did she not stop to take time to listen to a particular person's story or concern. As far as I am concerned, home carers are Australia's unsung heroes. Without them, the pressure on our aged care nursing homes, hostels and hospitals would simply be too great. I fully agree with the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, when, just - nder a month ago, she said during question tIme that the care these people provide could hardly be duplicated by institutional care in this country and that, even if it could be matched, the cost to the nation would be enormous. The quality of the care could never match that of the people who are giving care to those they love. The coalition government is committed to recognising the invaluable role home carers play in our society. Our commitments to them are partly reflected in schedules one and two of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. While changing references in certain acts from carer pension to carer payment may be viewed by some as a cosmetic change, it is an important change, nonetheless. The word 'pension' carries certain connotations, and the reality is that many people are too proud to have their names attached to those particular connotations. Home carers often have to sacrifice a lot to provide the loving services that they do. Anything we do as a government should not make the decision to stay at home and care for a loved one any harder than it already is. If part of that means replacing the word 'pension' with the word 'payment', then that is a change that should have occurred a long, long time ago. The government will also extend, from 10 to 20 hours a week, the hours a carer may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training, without affecting their qualification for the carer payment. Home care more often than not means close to full time care and people do, unavoidably, lose some touch with other aspects of their lives. The changes contained in schedule 2 of this bill will also help to ensure carers lose as little touch with their employment, study or other activities as possible. Further, schedule 2 will increase by 10 days the number of days a carer may temporarily cease to act in caring in a year, without affecting their qualification for the carer payment. These are basic changes which the previous government could have implemented any time in the last 13 years, with minimal cost. The fact that they did not is disgraceful. These points are very significant and welcome extensions of the bill. They are very welcome changes, not only in my electorate, but in every electorate throughout Australia. No doubt the constituents of Lindsay also recognise their significance. These changes give carers greater flexibility in their arrangements and will make the decision to care for a loved one at home easier to make. These changes will prove particularly welcome in the rural and regional areas of Australia, where access to medical, nursing and respite facilities is restricted. Carers need to be able to take a break every once in a while from the pressures and the strains, particularly the emotional strains of the work they do. This government is directly addressing this need. The coalition is providing $36.7 million over four years for a national respite for carers program. This program will see carer resource centres established throughout the country. About $31 million has also been allocated to support children with high levels of needs in care, such as children with disabilities. On 19 September Senator Newman incorporated into Hansard a media statement from the executive director of the Carers Association of Australia. I think that part of that statement bears repeating in this House as well. The executive director, Ms Anne Marie Mioche, said: The Government will establish a National Respite for Carers Program which will operate over the next four years and will also see the establishment of Carer Resource Centres across Australia. In the context of this budget, $36.7 million above the 1995-96 expenditure is quite a lot of money. She added: The fact that the Government will be establishing Carer Resource Centres sends a direct message to all carers that this Government cares about them. It should not have taken a change of government in order for the needs of this special group of Australians to be recognised, but it has. This bill also recognises the valuable role of voluntary work in society. Schedule 4 removes restrictions on the amount of full time voluntary work for unemployed people aged 50 and over and increases the allowable amounts of voluntary work for customers of all ages. Voluntary work often paves the way to real employment. While that is especially true for our younger Australians--Qne of my staff is a good example of that it is also true for older people trying to get back into the work force. Schedule 4 provides a new means for the older unemployed to satisfy the activity test by undertaking approved full-time unpaid voluntary work for an approved organisation for an unlimited number of days per year, or by a combination of unpaid voluntary work with an approved organisation and suitable paid work for at least 40 hours in a fortnightly period. For people undertaking full-time voluntary. work, only 32 hours per fortnight are required to satisfy the activity test. While there are areas this government is freeing up, we have also made an election commitment to improve and tighten DSS activity test and administrative breaches. In the short time. I have been the federal member for Herbert, I have had a surprising number of cases of abuses of social security payments brought to my attention. It is very sad that this should happen in this country. One problem brought to the attention of the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce, when she visited Townsville was raised in the first meeting she had with representatives of Townsville's emergency care providers, the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Community Emergency Support Centre and the Salvation Army. Townsville would have to be one of the most idyllic climates in all Australia. I can almost guarantee anyone blue skies and warm weather even during the middle of winter. Perhaps some of our visitors this afternoon might take that as a commercial for Townsville. However, Townsville's emergency care providers say our weather also brings a steady flow of unemployed or disadvantaged people who, according to the Society of St Vincent de Paul's administrator, Bernadine Breen, can often show up at the emergency centres or the DSS with only $10 in their pocket. It is a fact that people wishing for one reason or another to drop out of the employment market are attracted to centres offering a comfortable lifestyle. Byron Bay, for example, is a well known location. However, having people gravitate to certain centres does increase pressure on services provided by organisations such as Townsville's Community Emergency Support Centre. Maureen Hurst, the coordinator of Community Emergency Support Centre in Townsville, has told both myself and the minister that she could have to satisfy up to 120 people on any given day seeking assistance. In that respect, I was pleased that the minister was able to tell Townsville's emergency care providers that an additional $5 million has been provided by this government over the next four years to assist in this area. That additional $5 million is very welcome indeed. Social security should be there to provide those in our society who need assistance with a safety net. Unemployment benefits should be there to assist people during periods of unemployment. It should not be used as a substitute for employment itself. Schedule 5 of this biII will help ensure only those who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to return to the work force will receive payment. No doubt some on the opposition bench will claim that these measures are coldly designed to remove the social security safety net and toss people off unemployment benefits. But, let us face it, Mr Deputy Speaker, people who actively look for work, whether they are successful or not, will have no problem in meeting the DSS guidelines for assistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, before I finish up I would like to speak briefly on another section of this bill. Just last week I took a call from a constituent wanting to know what the government was doing to assist widows. Schedule 12 of this bill provides measures to provide common payment arrangements for older women without recent work force experience who either are a dependent partner or who lost the support of a partner later in life. I was able to tell my constituent that as from 20 March 1997 the widow allowance will be extended to women aged at least 50 years who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. This is a significant step forward in the legislation. The widow allowance was introduced in January 1995 by the previous government to assist women who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 50 and who had no recent work force experience. While women will still have to be at least 50 before accessing the allowance, the lowering of the age of when a person becomes widowed, divorced or separated to 40, more realistically takes into consideration some of the employment and financial difficulties people face after losing a partner at such a stage in their life. Schedule 12 will be of real benefit to widowed, separated or divorced women in my electorate of Herbert as it will be to older women throughout Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend this bill to the House.",65
53,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (1.57 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. John Howard, Prime Minister, said he was pursuing a fair Australia, that he would protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our that community. Most of all what the Prime Minister said was that he was going to be 'for all of us'. But the reality of this bill shows that this was a very shallow pledge, that 'all of us' excludes the aged, the young, the unemployed, migrants, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander people, students and, of course, women. There are a number of significant issues in this bill, but I only want to touch on some of them here today. The issues I want to talk about really do summarise the mean-spirited nature of this government and the way in which they are taking away the earnings credit scheme which is being abolished in this bill, the employment entry payment and the non-pensioners' education entry payment. All of these payments were introduced to in fact assist people into employment. The taking away of these payments is going to mean that people are going to be on unemployment benefits and are not going to be able to access employment in the same way that they were before. Another very serious change in this bill is the way in which they are changing the child disability allowance. These are the different items that I want to go through in this bill. What this government has tried to do is woo families with their family tax initiative, but as we start to add up the numbers and as families start to add up the numbers, they are going to see that the small benefits that the family tax initiative gives to families will be taken away with the other hand. There is no doubt that the family tax initiative will hardly-will not in very, very many cases, not in the majority of cases-offset the costs and the pain that families will face as a result of the rest of this government's measures.(Time expired)",68

56,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. It concerns today's ABS jobs data showing that 31,000 full-time jobs were lost in September and that youth unemployment has risen sharply. Will the Prime Minister now admit that the budget strategy has flattened job opportunities for the unemployed and young Australians and that unemployment is a matter within his responsibilities and, therefore, will he reassess the government's budget strategy?",69
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is: no, I will not. The reason I will not is your absurd claim that our budget strategy has failed when the budget has not even been passed through the parliament. Your incapacity to calculate or even phrase a decent question on this subject is breathtaking. I will just say it again: you had 13 years and under your current leader you took unemployment to a post-depression level of 11.2 per cent. I would have thought that any self-respecting opposition would have hung its head in shame for at least 12 months before it had the nerve to ask us any questions about unemployment. I say to the honourable gentleman: not only do you show and do all of your colleagues display an absolutely breathtaking indifference to what you failed to do when you had the reins of government for a period of 13 years, but what you are doing at the present time is deliberately fomenting uncertainty in the community about the level of unemployment. You are doing it quite cynically; you are doing it quite deliberately. We have proposed a number of measures which are designed, over the longer term, to improve the employment situation.",69

Mr Costello-Who said that? Who was it?,69
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not say that. The Treasurer did not say that. The Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said that. What have you done about the unfair dismissal law?

Sir Michael Jopling and a distinguished party visiting us from the parliament of Great Britain. A very warm welcome to you, Sir, and to your party. May you enjoy your very brief stay in Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Skase, Mr Christopher",70
67,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that there has been no satisfactory solution in the Christopher Skase saga, despite years of effort and millions of dollars spentMr Fitzgibbon-He is one of your mates.",70
68,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,has the government ceased all attempts to pursue Skase or will the government continue to act if there is any reasonable chance at all of success?,70
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I heard somebody from the Labor Party side interject, 'Your mate,' when there was a reference made to Christopher Skase. I will tell you whose media policy Christopher Skase supported in the 1980s: it was not ours; I can tell you that. Along with many other Australians, I and many other members of the government view with a great deal of anger the fact that Christopher Skase, a person who has clearly defrauded many decent Australians of a large amount of money, should continue to enjoy the luxury of a self-imposed exile somewhere else in the world by courtesy of the judicial processes of the Spanish state. The first I personally knew about the decision of the bankruptcy authorities was when I turned on the television this morning for the early morning news. I have asked the Attorney-General to advise the government as to whether it is feasible to overturn the decision that was taken by the bankruptcy authorities. According to my advice, that decision was taken by the bankruptcy authorities in accordance with guidelines established by Michael Lavarch, the former Attorney General. Those guidelines were adopted by the incoming government. The decision was taken, so I am advised, without prior reference to the government which, I guess, in the normal course of events, would be a natural thing to do in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act. Mr Lee-What did they tell you? What do you mean by 'prior reference'?",70
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Dobell!,70
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I simply say to the House and, through the House, to the Australian public that we will act if there is any earthly likelihood of recovering Christopher Skase's ill-gotten gains-and those ill-gotten gains must anger battling Australians who have to pay their taxes and have otherwise got to comply with the laws of Australia. I have to say that on an issue like this I can understand how ordinary battling Australians think the system is unfair. What Skase has done was aided and abetted by the Spanish judicial process not by the Australian judicial process. Having made that point-and with the approval of a number of people on the front bench of the Labor Party-I think it places some obligation on them also not to score some cheap political point out of it. Mr Bevis-Oh!",70
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you're not, but Bolkus and Beazley were. Ah, you're not; you're a good bloke, Arch. But your leader was out there again today, happy as Larry, having a go. Can I just say to the House that what Christopher Skase has been able to do represents an obscenity in the eyes of average Australians. It is a great disappointment to me, and I am sure to all Australians, irrespective of their politics, that the Spanish judicial process has let him go free. I have asked the Attorney-General to examine whether it is appropriate to overturn the decision of the bankruptcy authorities. That decision was not, so I am told, taken as a result of any budget expenditure decisions. It was taken, according to the bankruptcy authorities, on their assessment of whether or not the committing of further resources would be a worthwhile investment of public funds. I want to know, as a result of a separate examination by the Attorney-General, whether that was a correct decision and whether or not it would be appropriate to overturn it. If it is, I can assure the House, and through the House the Australian public, that that decision will be overturned. Assistant Treasurer",70
73,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Treasurer confirm that under the allocation of ministerial functions for the Treasury portfolio he announced on 26 March, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, was given responsibility for administration of the banking laws and detailed design of laws relating to superannuation? Will he confirm that since then Senator Short has been regularly engaged in consultations on both policy and administrative matters with the major banks, including the ANZ? Will he also confirm that on 20 August he gave specific responsibility to Senator Short for finalising the details of requirements that will apply to RSAs, or retirement savings accounts, for which accounts the ANZ Bank has been a leading advocate?",71
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Holt has read out what I believe was put in a press release as to the allocation of the duties of Senator Short. I do not have that press release in front of me, but that accords with my own recollection. If he was reading accurately from the press release, I will confirm all of those matters that were put as to the allocation of duties. Psychiatric Consultations",71
75,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of recent claims that people with psychiatric illness are discriminated against by this government's measure to limit full Medicare rebates to 50 private visits per patient per year? What is the minister's response to this claim?,71
76,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am certainly aware of some of these claims and I would like to put them into some perspective. The government is proposing in the budget to limit the number of psychiatric consultations to 50 per person per year, after which the Medicare rebate will drop to that of a general practitioner long consultation. To put this in some perspective, this is still extraordinarily generous by international standards. In the United States, someone could expect to get six or seven psychiatric consultations in one year and then pay for the lot afterwards. In the recent Dutch budget, psychiatric consultations were limited to 15 per year, with the patient paying the total amount after that. What we are trying to do is take an approach whereby, if Medicare is going to survive, it has to be cost-effective into the 21 st century. In the area of psychiatric services, some areas clearly are not cost-effective. I am particularly disappointed by the campaign that a few practising psychiatrists have decided to run, doing the usual shroud waving and suggesting this would be the end of the world as we know it. They are suggesting also that this will increase the incidence of suicide. It is interesting to have a look at the suicide figures in Australia and see where the have any bearing on the provision of psychiatrists. Of course, it has not. There is very little difference across Australia in the suicide rates. There are very big differences in the provision of psychiatrists. In fact, the area with the lowest suicide rate in Australia-the ACT-also has one of the lowest rates of people seeing psychiatrists. Let me put this into some perspective. First of all, if someone is so iII that they do need particularly intensive treatment, they are to be an in-patient and none of those consultations counts. Mr Bevis-Not true! Not true!",71
77,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second thing is that the average number of psychiatric consultations any patient has a year is 6.4. The Medicare schedule fee for a one-hour psychiatric consultation is $128.50 and only about one per cent of people seeing a psychiatristor 2,500 people a year-will have more than 50 consultations a year. These people constitute 16 per cent of all services. For people who do have more than 50 consultations a year, they cost an average of $10,750 each. This is not primarily a cost-cutting exercise-the money saved is small-but if I get one frequent complaint from general practitioners it is that they cannot get their patients into see psychiatrists. There are some psychiatrists who see a very smaIl number of people very frequently. Access to psychiatric services is a major concern and it is also a major concern that it is very difficult to get psychiatrists to work in Australia's public hospitals. If you look at the distribution of psychiatrists, the overwhelming majority of rural electorates have absolutely nobody in them who sees a psychiatrist more than 50 times a year. Mr Bevis-And this is going to fix it, by reducing the number of visits and the benfits.",72
78,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the rest of them have one or two only. Just to respond to the honourable member for Brisbane, it will depend entirely on how psychiatrists choose to bill their patients. The top 25 per cent of psychiatrists bill substantially more per year than the Prime Minister's income. They work an average of 48 hours a week, which is about half that of the Prime Minister. The general practitioner long consultation is still quite generous. If psychiatrists chose to absorb this, it would mean an average reduction in their billing from $286,000 a year to $284,500 a year, which I think is quite modest, given the savings we had to make elsewhere. Assistant Treasurer",72
79,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed likely to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his ministerial guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility which require ministers 'to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities'? In accordance with the requirements he laid down in April last, did the Assistant Treasurer provide to the Prime Minister by 27 May this year details of his share holdings, including his 6,679 shares in the ANZ Bank? Bearing in mind his specific responsibilities for banking measures, including RSAs, what steps did the Prime Minister take to ensure that the Assistant Treasurer divested himself immediately of those share holdings?",72
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is, yes, he did provide it to me. The nature of the ministerial guide, which I stand by, puts an onus on ministers to comply with it. Mr Lee-What about you? What is the obligation on you?",72
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for DobeIl!,72
82,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat that the ministerial guide places an obligation on ministers to comply. The Assistant Treasurer did not comply, which he has acknowledged to the Senate. I have discussed the matter with the Assistant Treasurer. I am satisfied that he has not been guilty of any deliberate wrongdoing. Opposition members-Oh!",72
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-I am satisfied that he has not been guilty ofMr O'Connor-You should sack him.,72

85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. What has this got to do with the matter at hand? He tolerates, and reasonably so, the ownership of farms along the entirety of this front-bench.

86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat; there is no point of order.,73
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to standards of ministerial behaviour, a mob that allowed a Prime Minister to own a piggery is hardly in a position to deliver any sermon.

96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was his explanation to me. The members opposite can guffaw, but I really hope the Leader of the Opposition asks another question on this. I almost hope he moves a censure motion on this, because then we might talk about the member for Fremantle. We might talk about ministerial standards.

103,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question and acknowledge the very positive comments made by the Vice-President, Joseph Estrada, that the Australian economy was a model economy of the Asia-Pacific. I point out that trade has doubled this decade and is now approaching the level of $1.5 billion. It was the first country I visited and, during the course of that visit, I paved the way for the fixing up of a trade difficulty, a market access difficulty, between Australia and the Philippines with respect to fruit and vegetables. That has now been signed away and cleared and has unblocked that particular trade, which has been blocked since 1989. For the benefit of the member for Cowper and members on both sides of the House I add that this is the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Australia and the Philippines. It reflects a very solid bilateral relationship--a relationship which is facilitating expanded trade, investment and tourism between Australia and the Philippines. It is of course the host nation for the APEC summit meeting, which the Prime Minister will be attending, to take place in November in Manilla and Subic Bay. Finally, I point out the very favourable comments by the Vice-President of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, about the economic make-up of Australia with regard to income distribution. In that regard, I would remind the House of the findings of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra that some 71 per cent of families in Australia, and not the wealthiest families, will benefit from the family tax initiatives initiated by the Prime Minister and the government in the budget due to cut in on 1 January 1997-another very positive dimension of the economy of Australia. I welcome the Vice-President's private visit to Australia. It is a manifestation of the good working relations that Australia has with this very important ASEAN nation. Assistant Treasurer",73
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question goes to the Prime Minister and follows his confirmation that he was correctly advised. Is it not the case that as a result of, among other things, the Treasurer's announcement of the Wallace inquiry, the intention to proceed with the establishment of RSAs and the fact that ANZ shares have risen substantially since April",74
105,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was a decision that was taken before the election.,74

108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand the drift of what the Leader of the Opposition is getting at. I have not had an opportunity to examine the calculations on which his allegation is based. I will do so. If there is anything further I should say on the matter, I will say it. Outsourcing of Information Technology",74
109,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I ask the minister to inform the House of what action he has taken to implement the government's information technology outsourcing initiative which was announced in the budget. Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for his question. Honourable members may recall that in the budget the government announced an approval in principle of the outsourcing of its data centres subject to a scoping study and a business case analysis which will also look at the mid-range and desktop operations in departments and agencies. This study will begin in departments and agencies at the end of October. We are committed to getting the best value for information technology expenditure in every department and agency and believe this initiative will yield significant savings. This whole of government approach to information technology has wide application in the Commonwealth. The government can no longer afford the luxury of, for example, more than 50 personnel and financial systems, nor can it afford more than a dozen data centres, many with excess capacity. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for his foresight in establishing the Office of Government Information Technology to make the necessary improvements, and outsourcing is another step in this process. The government is strongly committed to this initiative proceeding in the context of the next budget. It will enable us to deliver more effective and efficient services to the community. It is my understanding that this is one of the more significant outsourcing initiatives ever undertaken on a national government basis. Outsourcing of IT is common in both the government at state level and the private sector, and the Commonwealth is lagging behind. This initiative will provide opportunities to Australian industry in the provision of direct outsourcing services to government agencies as well as in strategic alliances with global service providers to take advantage of the significant opportunities on the world stage that this scale of operations will bring. To ensure that the initiative is pursued with vigour, I am creating a new policy advisory committee, which will be chaired by the chief government information officer, to provide me with timely and relevant advice on this outsourcing initiative and other major policy undertakings. The committee replaces the existing government information services policy board to better reflect the priorities of this government. As I have indicated, outsourcing is commonplace in the private sector. Therefore, I felt that the government would benefit from private sector participation at a senior level. The committee will consist of eight members-four senior public servants and four private sector executives, all of whom have had extensive experience in the innovative application of information technology to deliver goods and services to their customers. Their independent advice will cover areas such as outsourcing strategies for the government's computing infrastructure, government telecommunication network rationalisation strategies, electronic sion of information in government, one-stop shop delivery of government services and Commonwealth-state cooperation in IT infrastructure provision. I am confident that with the advice of this committee a cost-effective and efficient service can be delivered to the community through a practical whole of government approach to the use of information technology. Assistant Treasurer",74
110,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the ANZ share register this morning identified the trustee of the Short Family Trust as the holders of 6,679 shares. Is the Prime Minister aware that the increase in value of that number of shares since Senator Short became Assistant Treasurer is $9,083? Prime Minister, what is your response to the fact that Senator Short, by not divesting his shares when he should have but has now only because he has been sprung, will make a profit of $9,083? Did you, Prime Minister, take these factors into account in making your decision not to enforce your ministerial code of conduct by requiring Senator Short's resignation?",75
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot instantaneously confirm the precise figures that the honourable gentleman uses, but I will accept, for the purposes of the exchange, that the figures he has used are accurate. If they are not, he will explain that. It will not be my responsibility to have to explain it. The decision that I took was based upon my belief that nothing that the Assistant Treasurer had done in exercising his responsibilities as Assistant Treasurer had led to his enrichment or his profiting.

119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"impose a blanket prohibition on ministers holding shares. They do not do that. They contain injunctions against ministers trading in shares and they also require ministers who hold shares in companies that are involved in their portfolio responsibilities to divest themselves of those shares. If I had believed that Senator Short had taken a decision which deliberately enriched him through his ownership of the ANZ Bank shares, then I would have taken a different view of the matter. I do not believe that the bare establishment of the Wallace inquiry of itself constitutes an act whichMr Crean-What about the RSAs.",76
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I simply say that - enator Short played no role in the establishment of the Wallace inquiry; I can assure you of that. You interject about the retirement savings account. The coalition parties were committed to retirement savings accounts long before Senator Short was considered for appointment as Assistant Treasurer. They were committed to the establishment of those something like three or four years ago. It was taken to the election as coalition policy. I can just say again to the House and to member for Hotham that the decision that I took was based upon a number of beliefs on my part. The first was that, yes, the Senator was in breach of the guideline. In determining whether there should be any response to that, on my part, I did take into account that I accepted that the Senator had not been guilty of any deliberate dishonesty. I do not believe that any of the decisions that were influenced by a desire on his part to enrich himself by virtue of his ownership of ANZ Bank shares. I would contestMr Martin Ferguson-But he has.",76
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It can equally be argued that, if any government takes a decision that involves a tax reduction that benefits a member of the front-bench, that person should resign from the ministry. I would say to the member for Hotham that I believe that the honourable minister has behaved correctly. He has behaved honestly. I do not believe that he set out to enrich himself and to behave in a dishonest fashion. Nuclear Disarmament",76
122,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to Australia's recent initiative in taking the comprehensive test ban treaty to the UN General Assembly, an initiative which was applauded throughout the international community. In light of that initiative, I ask the minister what progress he has made on pushing forward with Australia's arms control agenda and the government's security council campaign during his just completed and successful visit to the United Nations General Assembly.",76
123,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond very much for his question. I did visit New York from 23 September to 3 October to attend the 51 st session of the United Nations General Assembly. Without wishing to gild the lily, the visit was quite successful. While I was there I delivered Australia's general debate statement and lobbied in support of our candidature to be elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. I signed on behalf of Australia the comprethe hensive test ban treaty and attended meetings on landmines, in particular conveyed by the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and on improving the United Nations rapid reaction peacekeeping capability. I also spoke to the Asia Society, focusing on the development of processes for regional interaction into the 21st century, and participated in the United Nations Security Council debate on the Senator took the Middle East. As I understand it, I was the first Australian foreign minister to address the United Nations Security Council in 10 years. This was an open session of the security council. During that speech I called on Israel and the Palestinians to recommence direct dialogue and recommit themselves to the search for a peaceful resolution to their differences. In particular I urged all parties to the Middle East peace process to fulfil the commitments that they had already made. In my statement to the General Assembly on 30 September, I highlighted the achievement of the adoption and signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty and in my speech focused on the report of the Canberra Commission and the value it will bring to the peace and disarmament agenda. The report was circulated to members of the United Nations and I presented a copy of the report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I also spoke about Australia's approach to reform of the United Nations and the approach we would take if elected to the United Nations Security Council. While in New York I met a large number of foreign ministers. If you take into account the meetings I had at receptions and other social functions with foreign ministers, it was somewhere in the vicinity of 100 foreign ministers. In those meetings I clearly focused on consolidating support for Australia's security council candidature. I have to say that, whilst I was encouraged by the support that was expressed for our candidature, I remain what I would describe as cautiously optimistic that we will win a seat. We are competing against Sweden and Portugal for two seats, so statistically a good opportunity of being elected to the security council, but of course you can never be sure of these things. We all know in this House how uncertain electoral processes can be. We have done everything we can to contribute towards Australia's election. The last point I would like to make is that while I was in New York I also met with the Chinese foreign minister, Mr Qian Qichen. I signed with him an agreement on the maintenance of Australia's Consulate-General in Hong Kong, beyond the transfer of sovereignty in July of next year. I regret that honourable members opposite who are trying to interject are not interested in a serious issue, such as Australia's Consulate-General in Hong Kong. All I can say is that we were the first country with significant interests in Kong to have signed an agreement of that kind. Assistant Treasurer",76
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that this affair occurred in the context of Senator Parer very publicly divesting himself of his mining shares at the very outset. Given that the Prime Minister has had Senator Short's declaration since May, and with the obvious breach of his guidelines contained within it, does he not accept that it is not just Senator Short but himself and his office which are at fault in ensuring that those guidelines were upheld?",77
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept that there has been a breach of the guidelines. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, any plain reading of the guidelines indicates that they put a personal obligation on ministers to comply with the guidelines. He plainly did not. I have explained the circumstances in which I believe he did not comply. I have also explained my reaction to it and I have expressed a view. I think it would be apparent from the words that I have expressed that I do not think Senator Short is likely to repeat it.",77
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. If you are only to apply your guidelines when you have clear proof of a deliberate intent to profit, why we have have them? Why say they have to divest when you do not mean it?",77
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order. The Prime Minister.,77
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This government adopted clear public guidelines which are far more specific than those of former governments. In applying the guideOpposition members-A guide!,77
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are a guide. It is quite clear from the circumstances of this matter that Senator Short has not complied with the guidelines. I have taken into account the matters I have said I have taken into account in my handling of the matter. I came to the conclusion last night that it would be, Hong in all of the circumstances, exacting an unreasonable penalty on Senator Short if I were to require his resignation. Those opposite will criticise that. The Australian public will make a judgment about whether my actions were reasonable in a circumstance where a person has clearly, in my view, not been guilty of any deliberate dishonesty. I think anybody who knows Senator Short would be aware that he has not been guilty of any deliberate dishonesty. In all of the circumstances, I do not believe that he has profited from any deliberate decisions. I do not think the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares influenced decisions that he took. In those circumstances, I have taken the decision that I have and I remain confident of the minister's capacities. Papua Fruit Fly Infestation",77
130,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. In view of the significant risk to fruit and vegetable exports from Far North Queensland from the papaya fruit fly infestation, what action has been taken to address this threat to export incomes? Is the minister confident that efforts to fully eradicate the papaya fruit fly will be successful?",78
131,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. He has had a long association with the fruit and vegetable industries in North Queensland. He has been a great champion of them as the people in his electorate and in this place would be well aware. He has been a very strong voice on behalf of those industries and in particular has fought hard for the problem of the papaya fruit fly infestation, which was detected on the Australian mainland near Cairns about 12 months ago, to be properly addressed. This very unfortunate fly is endemic to South-East Asia and Papua New Guinea. It will attack up to 30 species of fruit and vegetables. It has the potential to do immense economic damage not just regionally but to Australia's emerging horticultural exports to - si- which have the capacity to help very sIgmficantly as Australia seeks to tum around the current account deficit mess that the people opposite left us. As a result of the efforts of the four Far North Queensland members, including Mr Entsch, members of the government and industry scientists are now creating a very opti-istic scenario through a baiting and trappmg program. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that there is every reason to believe that we can look forward to the complete eradication of this pest inside two years. It is a very welcome development. That will be aided by the securing of $6 million from the Commonwealth and a further $6 million from the states. They will work together in a partnership agreement to develop a model of how to deal with these sorts of problems in the future and progress the eradication program over the next couple of years. I am delighted to tell the House that very valuable exports of Far North Queensland mangoes to Japan have now resumed and exports of other fruit fly host fruits and vegetables from outside the quarantine zone have also resumed to most markets. Honourable members can be confident that papaya fruit fly now appears to be safely contained within the quarantine zone and will be eradicated over the next couple of years. The House will be pleased to know that we found the money to act on the recommendations of Professor Malcolm Nairn in relation to the northern quarantine area. Unlike the previous regime, we found money-$14.7 million-to upgrade barrier controls and monitoring in North Queensland. The previous government had a recommendation in 1991 that further surveillance around Cairns was needed and they ignored that recommendation. They did nothing about it. Had they acted on it, you never know how much heartache and economic cost we might have avoided. We have acted on this. They did not. That is typical of their response to the needs of rural and regional Australia. National Gun Control Advertising Contract",78
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, on 1 October you told radio 6PR that in regard to DDB Needham Adelaide winning the national gun control campaign advertising contract 'there had been a completely proper tendering process and there was nothing unethical about what had occurred'. Do you stand by that statement?",78
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unless there is something that I am not aware of, yes. Essendon Airport",79
134,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I draw the minister's attention to the extremely important role that Essendon airport plays for regional Victoria and for the people in my electorate of Wannon in particular. With Moorabbin airport near saturation point, Essendon airport provides an extremely important charter link and air ambulance base for many people throughout country Victoria. Can the minister inform the House of the government's intentions regarding Essendon airport?",79
135,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. In order to answer the question it would be appropriate to account for some of the history of this. The former government announced the closure of Essendon airport. The context in which they made that decision was a number of aircraft incidents at the airport, the most notable of which was a crash of an aircraft into a house near the Essendon airport. That incident raised a number of questions about the suitability of Essendon airport as a future aviation centre in the Melbourne metropolitan area. This government came into office and has taken an open mind on this subject, recognising the importance of Essendon airport in its regional role, its air ambulance role and in terms of the economic activity it generates within the local area. Therefore, we have been consulting with a number of interested parties. I have met with the airport chamber of commerce just recently, for example, and we have also been talking to the air ambulance people and a host of other people. We will continue to consult with interested persons with a role to play in Essendon airport and we will be making our decision very shortly about the future of Essendon. I will be putting a submission to cabinet for their consideration, but you can rest assured that that submission will recognise the importance that Essendon airport has in its regional role and in terms of local employment opportunities as well as taking into account the very important role of aviation safety. Child Support",79
136,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the government address the social and financial problems incurred with child support? If the government supports sole parents with an income of approximately $47 per week per child, how can it justify non-custodial parents having to pay in excess of $100 per week per child, leaving these people in destitute situations, even throwing in their jobs to obtain better financial security on the dole?",79
137,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason why the government policy is to seek a contribution from non-custodial parents under child support is that the government believes that both parents are responsible for the children that they bring into the world, whether they have custody of them or not. The reality is that if the parents are not going to be made to make a contribution it is only going to be other taxpayers who will be picking up the difference. As a matter of policy, our government believes that the parents are the first area of responsibility and that there should be mechanisms for the parents to make a contribution. Where the parents are unable to do so, of course there is a social security net which steps in for the sake of the children. I believe that no humane society could have it otherwise. Non-custodial parents cannot believe that they lose responsibility for the maintenance and rearing of children once they lose custody. I think we all recognise that family breakdown is a terrible thing and to be avoided as far as possible. But where it does occur, both parents, whether custodial or non-custodial, have a responsibility which is firstly owed to the children",79
138,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would not interject here if I were you. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting,79
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Chifley and the member for Hunter.,80
140,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hunter thinks this is a bad situation, does he? You do not think that non-custodial parents should make a contribution? We are very interested to see the interjections that are coming from the Labor backbench because the Labor front-bench agrees with this position. That is why there is absolute silence down there, old son. We believe that the non-custodial parents should be making a contribution because it is in the interests of the children concerned and in the interests of preserving their prospects in a humane and decent society. Defence Force: Membership",80
141,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, are you concerned at the extremely low level of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander personnel in the Australian defence forces? With this level now standing at 0.7 per cent, are you implementing any programs to increase that level, and by how much?",80
142,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, indeed, I am concerned about that low level of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander personnel. And we know that figure because the ADF conducted that survey. To meet the requirement that we wish to see, an increase to two per cent of the ADF, the Department of Defence has entered into an MOU with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to ensure that over five years to the year 2005 we will see that two per cent achieved. To do that, we have a three-point strategy: firstly, increasing the awareness of ADF employment and career options, with the aim of increasing the number of indigenous people recruited; secondly, an examination of current selection tests for any cultural bias; and, thirdly, the encouragement of increased participation by indigenous people in the reserves and cadets. To achieve that, we have already undertaken six initiatives: firstly, the production of a video segment for indigenous people's TV programs featuring indigenous people in the ADF today; secondly, the identification of indigenous personnel in the ADF who can be used as role models and used actively in marketing; thirdly, a review of brochures and posters to ensure that ethnic g!'-ups are included in images of ADF members; fourthly, identification of suitable indigenous ADF personnel to feature in recruiting duties; fifthly, the inclusion of cultural awareness in recruitment courses; and, sixthly, the establishment of a support group to improve the likelihood of training completion and retention of indigenous members in the ADF. There is one other thing I would like to mention, and it is this: we have two extremely effective reserve units. One is the 51 st Far North Queensland Regiment with a strength of 502 personnel. It has a content of 42 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and will be well known to the member for Leichhardt. Secondly, in Norforce, which has a strength of 400 personnel, 20 to 25 per cent are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, and of course will be well known to the member for the Northern Territory. I have to say that these two reservist units are two of the most effective reserve units we have, and are proof perfect of the contribution that indigenous Australians can and do make to our ADF. National Gun Control Advertising Contract",80
143,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Attorney-General. In light of claims by witnesses that the Attorney General's adviser, Melanie Granger, told the ministerial committee on government communications that 'Daryl prefers DDB' to conduct the national gun control campaign, can the Attorney confirm the truth of reports in the West Australian of 1 October that he said she did not, and that he 'did not have a preference'? Further, was the Prime Minister correct when he told Howard Sattler on 6PR on the same day that 'two of the three people' Senator Robert Ray named for failing to declare a conflict of interest as Liberal Party officials who had worked closely with DDB Needham staff on Liberal Party campaigns 'voted in favour of another agency'? And are there any official records to support the Prime Minister's claim?",80
144,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I find it somewhat disappointing that when we are running a national campaign with bipartisan support we get issues like this raised. Mr Martin Ferguson-Answer the question.",81
145,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have collected 71,000 firearms; we have paid out $35 million to firearms owners; we have achieved something monumental. Mr Martin Ferguson-Come on. Answer the question.",81
146,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Okay, let's get to the questions. I was not present at the meeting of the committee; I was represented by my adviser whom the member for Banks has named. She came to me in the course of the meeting indicating that there had been an interim vote and there was a division of opinion as to who was to be selected. She showed me the material that had been presented. I had a brief look at it and told her that was not in a position to offer a comment, I would leave the decision to her. She went back to the room and the decision was taken. The decision was taken by a committee that included some people who were expert in the running of campaignsMr Martin Ferguson-Mates!",81
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,81
148,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It also included representatives of the ACT and New South Wales governments, the police ministers from those states. Mr Tim Fischer-What? The New South Wales government?",81
149,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The New South Wales government. On the relevant day I had no idea of any political connection between any of those firms and any party, either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party-none whatever. It has only been raised subsequently, and I suggest that there is absolutely nothing in it. Veterans",81
150,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, does the government recognise the psychological trauma which many veterans continue to endure long after their active service? What is the government doing to ensure that Australian veterans have access to the world's best trauma support and treatment services?",81
151,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I want to thank the member for Dunkley for the question because I know he has a very personal interest in the welfare of our veterans in this country. I can assure the honourable member that this government does recognise the profound psychological trauma that many of our veterans suffer as a result of active service. That psychological trauma does not stop when the war stops; nor does that psychological trauma stop when they leave active service. The government already has in place a range of programs to help veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or, as it was often known in earlier days, battle fatigue or shell shock. The National Centre for WarI Related PTSD, a joint initiative between the government and the University of Melbourne, has accredited nine intensive PTSD treatment programs which are now running throughout Australia. So far about 450 veterans have benefited from these programs. Many more veterans benefit from programs through general practitioners and counsellors right around Australia. Recognising that 30 per cent of our veterans live outside the metropolitan area, we specifically cater for those veterans who live in country Australia via a satellite-style program. A special program for Rwandan veterans is currently being organised in conjunction with the Department of Defence. We are committed to making sure that the services we offer veterans are not just the best in Australia but the best in the world. In association with the National Centre for War-Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, we have brought to Australia Professor Arieh Shalev, a military medicine expert and world authority on PTSD, from the Hadassah Medical School at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. He is helping our health professionals, our counsellors, our psychiatrists and our general practitioners to provide the very best care to our veterans. He has run workshops, advised clinical staff and met with health professionals throughout the country. He will also be holding public lectures so that veterans, families and their friends can learn more about PTSD and the range of treatment services which are available. On 23 October, Professor Arieh Shalev will address a seminar here in Canberra to discuss PTSD issues and prevention strategies. As a further example of our commitment to the veterans of our community, this government will bring the best in the world to Australia so that our veterans receive the best of what the world has to offer when it comes to the treatment of PTSD. It is essential that in such a rapidly changing, controversial area of medicine we ensure our policy responses are at the cutting edge of the world's best practice. Our veterans deserve nothing less.",81
152,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House(1) censures the Prime Minister for his failure to ensure properly adherence to his Ministerial Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility because of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short's blatant conflict of interest in holding shares in a company directly involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities; (2) further censures the Prime Minister for his failure to ensure no interference from his private office in the duly constituted tender processes in the awarding of a contract for the National Gun Control Public Education Campaign. Mr Reith-We will take the motion immediately.",82
153,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",82
154,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House(I) censures the Prime Minister for his failure to ensure properly adherence to his Ministerial Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility because of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short's blatant conflict of interest in holding shares in a company directly involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities; and (2) further censures the Prime Minister for his failure to ensure no interference from his private office in the duly constituted tender processes in the awarding of a contract for the National Gun Control Public Education Campaign. This government is only six months old, yet it has seen ministers clearly breach guidelines established by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for proper conduct of their affairs-both their personal ones and their parliamentary ones. The Prime Minister has had to defend his Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) after he came into this place and blatantly misled the House. The Prime Minister has had to endure the humiliation of seeing his Treasurer (Mr Costello) parade around the globe, and then effectively had to come into this place and defend his Treasurer, who engaged in a completely unprecedented revelation of private conversations between himself and one of the most important people in financial markets in the world. The Prime Minister now comes into this place, clearly not having gone through any of the questions he ought to have asked Senator Short last night when he was determining whether or not Senator Short's commission ought to have been terminated. When he walks here this place, he decides that the and basis of his defence will be not to say that he has actively and properly upheld those guidelines but to make reference to the fact that we have on the front bench somebody who was a victim of a rorted political royal commission in Western Australia. And that is his defence. He says, 'I am looking forward to the opportunity to stand up here",82
155,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Order! There is too much background noise in the chamber. Would members cease standing around. If you intend to leave, leave quickly and quietly.",82
156,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"He says, 'I am going to stand up here in this place and defend my government on the basis of a suggestion that really the other side were as bad as me.' That is what he thinks of his guidelines; that is what he thinks is his priority and his primary duty in this place as Prime Minister; that is what he thinks is substantial in defending his ministers. Then he stood up here to answer the first question I asked him-what an extraordinary defence it was !-and said, 'How dare you ask me this question, because the previous Prime Minister had a piggery.' He did not seem to comprehend that, if that were a sufficient reason for someone to go, his minister for primary industries, who owns a farm, would have to go straight out the door at this very instant and that, on that basis, all other bers of his front bench who own farms would no doubt find themselves in some form of conflict of interest on top of that. Then the Prime Minister went to that other defence-about our being so unreasonable as to demand people's resignations when they actually hold shareholdings in a company that might materially benefit from some decision or other taken by their portfolios. He raised that hoary old defence. He said, 'If we took that silly view, then all of us wouldn't be able to sit here because we've all got an interest the taxation system. We pass legislation on that. The Treasurer has to handle legislation on that. So if we're going to be that strict about it, then we ought to be forgiven for regarding your questions as irrelevant or impertinent' --or any other way that he wishes to regard them. He chopped me off from asking another question. The question I would have asked him, and will ask him again, concerns the gun control area, because this government has sullied one of the purest initiatives-I might say their own initiative in this areaMr O'Connor-Grubby.",83
157,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"The government has sullied it by the grubby way they have handled this contract. The way in which the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Prime Minister responded to the questions they had put to them would suggest that they have not been reading Senate Hansard for the last week. The question I would have asked the Prime Minister was this: is your senior political adviser Grahame Morris responsible for DDB Needham Adelaide and Mr Ted Horton being awarded the national gun control advertising contract; did Mr Morris contact the Office of Government Information and Advertising and tell them to list DDB Needham Adelaide as one of five agencies to pitch for the contract; what involvement did Mr Morris have in expanding the proposed final short list of firms competing for this contract from two to three; was he in any way responsible for DDB Needham being included on that list, despite the fact that they were ranked fifth of five mem- agencies who pitched and after research testing they were described as 'barely meeting the requirements of the brief; and why did Mr Morris fail to declare a possible conflict of interest at any stage during the selection process as a former Liberal Party official who was hired and worked with the DDB Needham staff working on that campaign? I would have asked him those questions. Those points would have been capable of being demonstrated to him. We have two matters here that go to the in total inadequacy of this government in upholding standards in this place, this government which has had so many strikes against its ministers. God knows why it is defending Senator Short. Senator Short routinely stands before the Senate and misleads it and is routinely censured by the Senate. He shares that characteristic with about two or three other Senate ministers as the government's handling of its affairs in the Senate goes from catastrophe to catastrophe, reaching new heights of incompetence step by step. It is not as though the Prime Minister is defending some sort of genius. He is defending a fellow who cannot handle his portfolio duties. He ought to have taken this as a welcome opportunity to uphold his personal integrity and to uphold, on top of that, the standards which he says are so important to the proper functioning of this government. We find something interesting about these guidelines. I think everybody in the gallery, everybody in the media, everybody in the public and everybody in this parliament would think they are guidelines in the context of things which must be done. They are guidelines in the context of bare minimum requirements for integrity in this place. They are guidelines that were touted by the Prime Minister as part of his involvement in improving the standards of this place. What Labor minister in 13 years of office held shares directly benefiting from decisions that were taken in his portfolio? What Labor minister in 13 years of office was in that position? Not one Labor minister was in that position. Within six months the Prime Minister is on his scrapers in this place blackguarding us to defend himself in the outrageous position that he has arrived at. While we are going through the ministerial conduct rules that they have laid down let me quote a few elements of this guide which we now find is no longer a core guide. This is a 'non-core guide', we now find. But we are going to continue to assume that it is a core guide and that, as a core guide, it includes these provisions: Ministers should ensure that their conduct is defensible and should consult the Prime Minister when in doubt about the propriety of any course action. Did the Prime Minister require at any point of time that Senator Short consult him in regard to the propriety of his actions in the last few months in regard to this matter? When he discussed with Senator Short last night whether or not the fellow should have been punted, did he ask the senator whether he had read that part of the guidelines? What did he assume, having seen Senator Parer resign, highly publicly, singing and dancing? It is not as though he did not make the point obvious in the Senate. Senator Parer has been enormously proud of that fact. If Senator Short had been unable to hear Senator Parer sing and dance on that particular subject, Senator Short must be the dumbest senator that has ever entered those portals. If nothing else put an alarm before Senator Short at least that performance by Senator Parer should have put an alarm thoroughly before Senator Short. The core guidelines go on: Although their public lives encroach upon their private lives, it is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes. 'Any appearance'. This is not just a question of some form of Jesuitical logic, finetuning, cut it point by point along the line-oWe are going to do a bit of a hairsplitting exercise here and say that Senator Short could have been reasonably expected, although he has banking responsibilities, somehow or other to have sensibly overlooked this when he wrote to him.' It is appearance here. It is a very broad definition of what the Prime Minister expects of his ministers. How extraordinary that the Prime Minister had not considered, so concerned with propriety is he, Senator Short's position when he was on the mat last night as to what his fate might be. I would have thought that the first question the Prime Minister would have asked Senator Short was: 'Senator, I don't have any ANZ Bank shares myself, but what has happened with those shares in the last few months is that there has been a response to some of the very favourable decisions we have been taking on banking.' Had he done so or had he got his office staff to do so-if of they were not so preoccupied with wandering around the place working out how to defend themselves before their next appearance before Senate estimates committees-he might have arrived at some sort of conclusion that the near $10,000 profit that he made was something that should not have happened. Good heavens! Does that $10,000 profit give any appearance of using public office for private purposes? You ought to rock on there out to the battlers in Lindsay and elsewhere. You are always talking about the battlers and the appearance before the battlers. What battlers out there in Lindsay have made 10 grand in the last few months and are saying, 'Oh, yes, there is a little bit of oversight there, a little bit of a problem, but I will pocket the 10 grand, thank you very much, and I will divest myself of the ANZ shares'? Battlers in Lindsay would love that one. They can make 10 grand like that at their own behest, just at the drop of a hat, just at the snap of their fingers! That is a rocking little prospect for them out there in Lindsay.  yourself have had the benefit of putting in place before your various ministers what their ministerial responsibilities are. You need to comprehend this, because this is what was put before your Assistant Treasurer. Your Assistant Treasurer was given this mandate from his boss: The Assistant Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary will assist the Treasurer in the development, implementation and administration of policies in the areas set out below'Detailed laws in regard to insurance and superannuation' is one of them. Then: Representational duties and administrative including in relation to administration of the banking laws. He has been given some specific responsibilities in relation to the RSAs. Now the Prime Minister says: 'It doesn't matter that he has those specific responsibilities because we had the RSAs in place before the election.' So, on the basis of that, the minister with responsibility for mines could have a set of shares in uranium mines, knowing that before the election you had a proposal to abandon the three mines policy. He could have had shares in Western Mining or any of the others and it would not have mattered if he had kept them. It would not have mattered if Senator Parer had kept them, because it was announced before the election. On the basis of that morality, having been announced before the election, he can afford not to observe your ministerial guidelines. I rather think that Senator Parer got the point. I rather think that Senator Parer, even though the three mines policy and the other aspects of your mining policy had been announced before then, irrespective of that, as the minister directly associated with that, would have done something about it. I will say one or two other things about these RSAs. I have here a note from the Treasurer in which he says: The Assistant Treasurer will be responsible for finalising the details of requirements that will apply to the RSAs. Understand this about these RSAs: these RSAs are at the heart of a major campaign by the banks to secure resources off the superannuation funds. This is not a minor banking issue. This is not a matter of side concern. The government is doing things like contemplating wrecking the position that ordinary Australians currently have in relation to their superannuation entitlements and foreshadowed superannuation entitlements in favour of providing funds for getting the RSAs going. But, somehow or other, that one line position that the Liberal Party put out before the election is a position which excuses this particular minister, by that fact alone, from being obliged to consider whether or not his banking shares would improve in value as a matters, result of it. But these are not small matters that he must consider. I have here more than a dozen pages-in fact, about 17 or 18 pages-f highly detailed points to be considered in establishing the RSAs. Determinations or decisions on anyone of these points will be decisions which make a massive difference to the profitability of banks in the future, will make a massive difference to the value of their shares, will make a massive difference to the posture of the banks in the financial community of this country. This is their fightback; this is their defence against the superannuation funds. And pointman in that fightback at the administrative level is Senator Short. The point-man as far as the government's administrative arrangements are concerned is Senator Short. I would not mind betting that a fair bit of that 10 grand that he proposed to mosey off with when he sells these shares has been made on the basis of a bit of a shrewd judgment; in fact, all banking shares have done pretty well since the advent of propositions like this put forward by the government. I would not mind betting that any reasonable analysis of it would see a very substantial proportion of that 10 grand being absolutely a product of what Senator Short was administratively responsible for. The Prime Minister just slip-slides away on this one. You never get the qualification, you never get the reservations, you never get the slip-sliding that he did in question time today when he abused us for our supposed absence of standards. You never get that. You never get it when he compares what he thinks about that with the great, pure system that he regards himself as having established in relation to parliamentary standards. You never hear a word on that from the Prime Minister when he is out there blackguarding us in this chamber, as he has been doing for the last six months. When he is on the defensive himself, there are no standards. There are no core standards; there is no accountability. There is only a wrap of the arm around the shoulder: 'No, Jim, I'm not going to ask you any questions on what you might make about this. No, Jim, I'm not going to ask you if you saw Senator Parer's position on this. No, Jim, I'm not going to ask you what the detail of the RSAs were that you were considering or the administrative arrangements that you had in place with the Treasurer. No, Jim, I'm not going to ask you any of that. The fact is that every other person in the Senate has discovered that you are a blithering idiot and that general impression abroad is one I'm about to share myself, and if you happen to be in that position I'll let you go.' Can you imagine for one minute what they would have done to Paul Keating if he, as Treasurer, had had shares in the ANZ Bank and the value of the ANZ Bank shares went through the roof? Would it have been of saying, 'Look, Mr Hawke, we took the view that Mr Keating explains himself by the suggestion that he stood in ignorance of all this, that banking shares, when banking responsibilities, don't really mean what they say. So Paul Keating, you're off hook as far as we're concerned on that'? You were into Paul Keating on the piggery when you had a bench full of farmers. now have a front bench full of farmers and you still make that part of your defence. were into Carmen Lawrence in order to defend yourself after an appallingly political royal commission in Western Australia. And Needham company. that is your defence: 'My frontbenchers can do anything because Judge Marks rocked on over to make a bit of dough in Western Australia.' So don't have any accountability in this chamber: 'That is my defence-I'll do nothing more about that.' Unfortunately, there has been only 20 minutes to go through the issues that are before us. Mr Crean-There will be more next week. Just you wait.",83
158,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"And there are many more. But that does not matter. I have put down a few questions for him to consider about his prime ministerial office in another area. We are going to be asking you about that next week. As far as this is concerned, when we come to the gun question, I have a bit of time for the Attorney-General because there is decency in the gun policies that you pursue and on which we support you. Because there is decency in that, we are not entitled to ask you questions about how the fifth placed tenderer as far as the bureaucrats were concerned became the first placed tenderer; how DDB in Adelaide, who writes about $5.8 million worth of business, belts out everybody else who writes about $40 million or $50 million worth of business; how they got jumped onto the short list after the short list put only two there. Then Mr Morris walks in and says, 'Let's have a chalk and cheese comparison,' and all of a sudden the chalk gets up over the cheese. But don't you worry about that, Prime Minister, because we are going to be asking you about that one next week. We are going to censure you for this a case now, though.(Time expired)",86
159,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and you've got reserve my right to speak.,86
160,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Could I commence my response to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by making a couple of observations You about the context in which this censure motion is moved by the Leader of the OpposiYou tion. He raises two issues: the position of Senator Short and the awarding of the gun control campaign contract to the DDB On the second of those issues, whether or not DDB Needham should have been awarded the gun control contract, I can do no better in starting my response than to quote some words that were uttered by the spokesman in 1989 who had this to say: It is not the case now, nor has it ever been, that an agency which has the account of a political party which is in government should be banned from receiving government advertising. Those words were uttered by former Senator Graham Richardson, who of course had a very long association with one John Singleton. I just happened to have thrust into my hands-and I am grateful to the person who handed it to me-a list of some government contracts. It is a very interesting list. There are two subheadings: the first is John Singleton and the second is Rod Cameron and ANOP. And isn't it interesting? The first subheading reads as follows under John Singleton: 'Job description: privatisation of Qantas advertising campaign. Amount $15 million.' Then we have 'Artwork for Be Tru Blue stickers'. And, thirdly, the 'Buy Australian campaign'. Again in November 1989 another Buy Australian campaign worth $2.4 million. In October 1988 we had the 'Austrade national export drive campaign' and the 'Part share of the Australian Bicentennial Authority advertising budget'. Mr Downer-He did rather well!",86
161,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"He did do rather well. It was purely coincidental and it was all merit, just as I hope the more generous spirited people on the Labor Party's side might acknowledge. Just as Needham's displayed a little bit of professional capacity in the last election campaign, I am prepared to concede that Mr Singleton displayed some great professional capacity particularly in the 1987 campaign. We are all invited to believe that that was just purely accidental. If we are being encouraged to believe that those contracts were awarded on merit, then what is the basis of the allegation being made by the Leader of the Opposition? Would you like me to tell you about that committee? Mr Bevis-There was a member of your staff on the committee.",87
162,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, there was a member of my staff on that committee, Mr Grahame Morris, one of the most experienced political campaigners on our side of politics. I have a lot of regard for Mr Grahame Morris and I continue to have regard for Mr Grahame  Georgiou, who is the member for Kooyong. And I tell you what, the Labor Party in Victoria has a lot of regard for him too! Mr Beazley interjecting",87
163,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Pipe down. You've had your go and you were heard in silence. If you want an extension of time, you should have asked for it. It is very interesting that there was one bloke on the committee that they did not name and that was Paul Whelan. Do you know what Paul Whelan's parting comment to the committee was? He left before the final vote was taken. As he walked out of the room he said, 'I'll leave it to you blokes.' This is the representative of the New South Wales Labor Party on that committee! The fact of the matter is, so I am told by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), $1 million was allocated for this campaign. There were fi ve tenderers.",87
164,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Oh, $1 million.",87
165,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"That is one-fifteenth of what John Singleton got out of the Qantas contract. If you can establish any impropriety, you have not done so yet. All you have done is engage in the old Labor Party tactic of naming a couple of names. Why wouldn't you have your experienced political campaigners on the selection committee? Why wouldn't you allow the political representatives on the committee to make the final choice? Why wouldn't you rely upon the assessment of somebody who had won two Victorian election campaigns against the Labor Party-somebody who'd helped us win a great victory in South Australia and a great federal victory? Why wouldn't you take the advice of those people equally? When you made decisions on these things, didn't you take the advice of your hard-headed professional? Of course you did. Any sensible political party would take those decisions. I do not think there is any doubt about the campaign that has been mounted by the refusal, Leader of the Opposition in relation to this. As he sat down he said, 'Oh, there's more come.' Every member of the government is Australian literally quaking in his or her boots about 'more to come' in this particular issue! Let me then tum to the first part of the claim that was made against me and the about government-that is, the question of of ministerial standards, failure to exercise leadership, 'failure to impose your own standards' and all of those various allegations that were made against me by the Leader of the Opposition. He chose to use the benchmark of the first six or seven months of this government influenced having been in office. If he back to within the first six or seven months of his government having been in office, you had Mick Young thrown out of the ministry because he tipped off his mate Eric Walsh, a Canberra car park, about throwing out spy; you had Lionel Bowen calling for Japathat nese troops in Cambodia; you had Biggles over there threatening to send FIlls over TasmaniaMr MCGauran-He did! He did!",87
166,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"And he did. And so the Short list goes on. Instead of improving with the passage of time, they got progressively worse. He talks about standards. Nobody who has question, been in this parliament for the last 22 will ever forget the night that the former Treasurer, the former Prime Minister-talk about double standards being applied to battlers-walked into this parliament and admitted that he had failed to file two tax returns. What did his Prime Minister do at time? Of course he overlooked it. But what did Treasury do at the time? They prosecuted about 10,000 Australians for having been guilty of the same offence. Was there a word of attrition? Did the rock solid for pristine parliamentary standards, the then member Swan, the then Minister for Defence, get up and say, 'I'm sorry, Prime Minister, but this standard is just not good enough for me'? The truth of the matter is that, throughout the whole time they were in office, the failure of the Labor government at that time to apply proper ministerial standards, their continued even after they had been ministers for long periods, to apply proper parliamentary to and ministerial standards became legend in political circles. The arch exponent the of that was the former member for Blaxland,  Let me make a couple of very direct points Senator Short. Let me say at the outset making those observations that at no stage has Senator Short sought to hide from the Australian public, or hide from anybody, the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short behaved dishonestly. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short taken a decision which has been or conditioned by his ownership of will cast his mind those shares. That is the critical thing. If you could point to any decision that Senator Short has taken which he would otherwise not have taken if in he had not owned those shares, then you a would have a case. But you have not made point; you have not made that case at all. Until you can make that case, you have absolutely no capacity and absolutely no credibility in bringing this motion forward. If you were to ask me whether Senator should have got rid of those shares, the answer is yes. Was he in breach of the guidelines? The answer is clearly that he was. The therefore, is: what was the appropriyears ate response of me as Prime Minister on becoming aware of those circumstances? Would it have been a reasonable, appropriate and fair penalty, given the circumstances of the matter and given the fact that Senator Short had at no stage made a decision that the was influenced by the ownership of those shares-and that is the critical test of morality in this, that is the hard core test of morality here; you may not like it but you have to face that fact-to have asked for his resignation? If Senator Short had taken such a decision, I for believe Senator Short's resignation would have automatically followed. But the fact is that he had not done so. Having been satisfied that his personal honesty in the matter was not in question, I took the decision, given the fact that it was in his early months as a member of the ministry, that it would have been an unreasonably harsh penalty to have required his resignation. As he indicated to the Senate, he will be immediately disposing of those shares. Let me put it this way: I will be very surprised if Senator Short ends up personally profiting in any way from the sale of those shares. Mr Crean-What-$9,OOO?",88
167,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I underline the words 'personally profiting' from them. I think people will understand my meaning when I make that observation. I think Senator Short and others will also understand my meaning when I make that observation. I think the Australian public will understand my meaning when I make that observation. So here we have a situation where, yes, the minister was careless; yes, the minister overlooked the requirement to comply with the guidelines. I acknowledge that; the minister has acknowledged that. It would be foolish to pretend otherwise. The question therefore arises: what is the appropriate penalty? What is the appropriate response? Would it have been appropriate to have sacked him or would it have been appropriate for me to have taken the action that I have? I have taken the action that I have because I believe that he was not setting out to be dishonest. He did not take a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those ANZ shares. If he had not owned those shares, I do not believe the decisions that he would have taken, the attitudes he would have expressed and the views he would have held would have been any different at all from the views he actually held, the actions he took and the decisions he made. That is the background of the decision that I have taken in relation to this matter. It does not mean in any way that I do not put the highest possible store on the requirements of ministers to behave in a proper fashion. Of course, the opposition will have its penn'orth of fun on this issue. I will be criticised for having sacked him. I accept that. But, in the long run, you have to make a balanced, mature judgment on something like this. I think, in all of the circumstances, given the palpable demonstration on behalf of Senator Short that there was no intention on his part to behave dishonestly, given obviously the fact that Senator Short at no stage took a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those shares, to have required his resignation would have been unreasonable. I think the whole experience would have been a very salutary lesson for Senator Short. I do not think it is an experience that he is likely to forget in a long time.",89
168,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"I second this motion, and I do so because we had the example yesterday of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) running away from any responsibility in terms of employment, and today he is running away from any responsibility in terms of standards; standards which he wanted to raise when he came into this parliament. What you are accused of today, Prime Minister, is setting standards and failing to apply them. You are found guilty, in our view, on two counts: one in relation to the DDB contract and the other in relation to one of your ministerial colleagues. Let me go to the question of the DDB contract, the awarding and the means by which the award was made to DDB Needham for the contract to run the advertising campaign on gun control. The best the Prime Minister could do was to try to argue that this was all above board because on the committee making the decision was one Paul Whelan, a Labor Party member in New South Wales. I invite the Prime Minister to listen to this, because it shoots his argument completely out of the water. I refer to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 September, something Mr Morris, that great political operator, has no doubt failed to bring to your attention. On page 4 of the Sydney Morning Herald the heading is this: 'Gun ad campaign reported, says Whelan'. This is your great defence. This is your person saying, 'I'll leave it to you.' The report reads: not A Federal Government committee was accused yesterday of ""rorting"" the selection process to appoint private consultants to run a $1 million national gun control advertising campaign. The Minister for Police, Mr Whelan, told State Parliament that the advertising firm which won the accounts for the program had done so because the firm's staff had worked on the Coalition's campaign at the last election. Mr Whelan described the selection campaign as ""nothing short of extraordinary"". Here is the person who is your defence, and your defence is crumbling by the minute because you have been caught out. Let us remind ourselves of what this Prime Minister said when he came to office. Let us not get carried away with his other defenc- of trying to accuse colleagues of - urs for dOIng similar things when we were In office. We reject that version of events. Put. that aside. the moment. The difference wIth the Pnme Minister is this: he said he was better than other politicians. He said, 'I am better than the rest. I am more honest than the rest. I am full of integrity, and I am the only Prime Minister this country has had in a long, long time who is going to enforce new standards.' Let me just remind him of what he said in the Menzies speech just before the election: I intend to introduce many improvements which in the end will clean up government and clean up parliament itself. We remember his commitment on the John Laws program during the election campaign when John Laws said: So what you are saying, the answer to the question is if you had a choice between breaking. election promises and running a budget defiCit, what wouldJohn Howard jumps in: Well, we won't break, we would ... always expect us to keep our promises. What we saw when he got elected to office is that he redefined promises. We got a version of core promises, not all promises. I say to the people in the gallery, 'When you are listening to this guy before th- - ext election, ask him to tell you whether It IS a core promise rather than just any promise.' Then try to explain the difference to y'0ur kids. A promise is a promise, and promIses have been broken. So the Prime Minister's integrity is shot on that point. The Prime Minister introduced a code of conduct into this parliament. In his first major speech in this parliament he introduced a guide on key elements to ministerial responsibility. It said: Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their responsibilities. That does not mean 'when we find out about them'. This is clear cut-'required to divest' . We might be a bit slow in terms of understanding that you meant core promises rather than real promises, but can you explain to me how the requirement to divest does not mean you do not get rid of them at the first opportunity? Surely it does not mean when you are found out but when you know you have been for appointed, when you have taken the commission at Government House. You know you have responsibility because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) gives you responsibility for banking. You know you have to preside over the future direction of the banking industry because you have charge of the policy which is going to influence the basis upon which those banks function and therefore make decisions about their profi tabili ty . Do you not think a person that has ministerial responsibility over banking would say to himself, 'I have SOme ANZ Bank shares which I should get rid of? We are not just talking about a couple of shares. We are talking about 6,679 of them, no small parcel. This is not the sort of thing you keep in a tin box hidden down in the back shed. You have a family trust set up to accommodate them. Is that what the Prime Minister means by the fact that he will not personally profit, that it will go into the family trust and they w.ill be able to split it up in terms of the famIly? I will tell you this: the people of Lindsay will not wear that. What we have here is a minister of the Crown who, when he came to office, had 6679 shares. Seven months later, until today, h- still had them. When he came to office the price for ANZ shares was $5.92. When he sold them yesterday they were $7.28: Pe<.>ple over there might think that is not a bIg wmdfall because they are used to the millions .of dollars, but let us just understand the en-rrruof this. It is a 23 per cent increase In SIX months, and yet you have the audacity to tell the battlers of Lindsay that they cannot have an 8.75 per cent wage increase for the next 12 months. You will oppose 8.75 per cent, but you will let your ministerial colleague profit to the tune of 23 per cent. It is shameful. What does 23 per cent mean? It means a $9,083 profit. The reason it is a $9,083 profit is that the package is worth $50,000. It is more than twice what the battlers of Lindsay earn in a year, and you say that it is not significant. Prime Minister, where are your priorities? This is not petty cash. Go ask the people of Lindsay what they think about your double standards. Is this what you mean by equitably sharing the burden-allowing your ministerial colleague to get charge of the banking reins of the country, allowing him to keep his shares, to make a $9,000 killing and to get away with it, but telling the battlers of Lindsay that they cannot have a wage increase and saying, 'By the way, we're going to slug you more for pharmaceuticals. We're going to take your rights away to get your kids to universities in the western suburbs. We're going to hit you in terms of all the community amenities'? Is that the equitable sharing of burden? The reality is this: the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) has profited. No amount of sophistry and no amount of redefining can convince people otherwise. This is a massive profit. It is a profit because the minister concerned presided over policy which has seen those shares rise. You say that he did not make any decision based upon the holding of shares. What nonsense! The fact of the matter is that, in the first instance, he has responsithat bility for the Wallace inquiry. Mr Costello-He has not.",89
169,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"You've taken it off him today, have you? Who did you tell that to? Is that on the record? Have you got a tape to prove that you took it off him earlier today? What is the main purpose of the Wallace inquiry? It is to examine bank merger policy amongst the big four. They are the big four banks, one of which just happens to be the ANZ. The ANZ is the main takeover target for the National Australia Bank. If in fact happened as a result of the Wallace inquiry recommendations, the share price would go through the roof. And, unless we had found out about this matter in the Senate, ant Treasurer would still be sitting on the shares. There would have been another profit; not just the $9,000 to date but more. He has already made profit on the fact that the shares went up 23 per cent. Why? Because in the budget you made decisions about RSAs, which clearly the banks had been angling for and which they lobbied you for. We know how well they lobbied, because the ANZ Bank also happened to be the biggest net contributor of political funds to the Liberal Party in the last election. We have payback on all fronts. This is rewarding your mates for their donations in the campaigns and rewarding the person who was given administrative responsibility to implement policy in accordance with your election commitments. It is probably the only promise you kept, if one wants to be honest about your approach to the budget. These were promises you did not want to trumpet about, but you kept them. With regard to other promises, you went around the country saying and insisting that you would keep them, and you broke them. What double standards, what hypocrisy-and from a Prime Minister who says he is going to lift the standards in the place! What cant; what rubbish; what hypocrisy. Today in a dorothy dixer the Prime Minister tried to score points on the Christopher Skase issue. He said this in his response: 'It is an obscenity in the eyes of ordinary Australians Christopher Skase has been able to get away with what he has got.' With that we agree. But don't you think it is also an obscenity that a minister of the Crown can be sworn in, be given responsibility for banking policy, see as a result of that policy bank shares go up by 23 per cent, profit to the tune of $9,000 and divest only when he is forced to? Don't you think that is an obscenity? The two things that you say are important in parliament are, firstly, that you do not mislead it and, secondly, that you do not use that it to feather your own nest. This is what Senator Short has done-the Assistant Treasurer, given responsibility for banks. We can talk about the others because I think this issue the Assistwill continue to unravel. I believe, and so does the whole of the Labor Party, that your guidelines for ministerial responsibility are phoney. What you are really saying is, 'This is what I say. This is what I want to moralise about. This is what I want to go to mainstream Australia and say I want to do. But when it comes to the test I will not do it, I will go out, I redefine the position, I will not do anything.' What we now have is not only the redefining of core promises but also the core guidelines of ministerial responsibility. 'Requiring to divest' does not really mean that; it means 'only when you are caught out'. So what other little deals have your ministers got cooked up amongst themselves? Which others have got share responsibilities where, having taken decisions they know they will benefit from, they will end up with a nice little nest egg? It will be very interesting go through the share register and see which ones they got rid of. Those shares will all be microphone. in the manufacturing sector, because the decisions you took in the budget have decimember mated that sector. That is why you had this dinner last night where the heavy engineering industry was critical of your government for having vision for the manufacturing industry. Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, was not too impressed by this attack on the government and made clear to the industry that she was not going stay there to be abused-and she did not stay; she left. We will go through the share register and look at the ones that have The ones that will have been divested will have been in the manufacturing industry. I can understand why the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, got rid of his Pacific Dunlop shares. The manufacturing industry under Pacific Dunlop will not be looking too flash. But Senator Short did not get rid of his shares in the banking industry, not until he was found out. The reality is that the only thing that can be concluded from this episode is that you, credible Prime Minister, do not have the integrity or the courage to enforce your standards. You are a weak leader. You moralise but you do not act. You say to the people of Australia that you want to be different, but you are not-you are worse. The worse thing in political life is to say something and not follow it through, and that is why you deserve to be censured. (Time expired)",91
170,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Let me make it entirely clear will that this contrived censure motion is without any factual basis. The lack of logic that has been put forward by the opposition in relation to this censure has not been overcome by the ranting and raving of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). It is an infallible guide in this parliament that, the weaker the argument, the higher the decibel level. An infallible argument brings up the decibel level every time. We heard from the member for Hotham high decibels but very little fact. Let us make it entirely clear also that the way in which he to slagged together slurs on character does not get any basis by reason of shouting into the The argument being conducted by the for Hotham was at two levels. At the first level the member for Hotham says that here is a ministerial guideline that says you should not hold shares in certain circumno stances-a point which the Prime Minister The (Mr Howard) readily conceded in question time. That is not the subject of this debate. But at the second level-this is where the it smear and the slur begin-he argues that to Senator Short somehow has moved the ANZ share price by reason of his office and taken a profit. That is the smear that you have been been divested. putting through. Mr Crean interjecting",92
171,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Listen to him intervening now in support of that proposition. That is your proposition: that Senator Short has, by reason of his office, moved the ANZ share price. We heard it said over and over again that Senator Short has somehow, by reason of his office or by holding the shares, collected a $9,000 profit. That is your allegation. Let us invert this proposition to test how it is. If that were a credible proposition, the corollary would be this: if Senator Short had not been the Assistant Treasurer, the ANZ share price would still be at $5.92. That has to be the logical conclusion. If Senator Short had used his position to garnishee some kind of profit, the logical conclusion must be that, if he had not been the Assistant Treasurer, then the share price would still be at $5.92-obviously a frivolous proposition, obviously a proposition with no basis, obviously a proposition that upon analysis reveals, first, a deep ignorance of commercial operation in this area and, secondly, a contrived and pathetic case from an opposition that could not make any factual basis stick whatsoever. Let us come to how it is alleged that Senator Short, by reason of being the Assistant Treasurer, may have profited by the increase in the ANZ share price. How is it said? It is said in two respects. It is said that, first, the government has had an inquiry into financial institutions, and that, secondly, the government supports retirement savings accounts. Let me make it clear: both of those decisions were taken well before Senator Short was appointed Assistant Treasurer and both of them were taken before he was anywhere near economic policy. Mr Crean-So he hung in for a profit, knowing it was going to happen.",92
172,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Knowing it was going to happen; is that right? Oh, you are pathetic. Let me tell you when both of these decisions were announced. They were announced on 2 November 1995-a time when you were still confidently looking forward to another term of office, a time when Senator Short was, as I recall, the shadow minister for immigration. In a speech to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia on 2 November 1995, I said this: As part of our policy to infuse greater competition within the context of neutrality between financial intermediaries, a Coalition Government will introduce an entirely new form of superannuation saving, Retirement Savings Accounts. All approved financial institutions will be able to offer this product. When was it? On 2 November 1995. When did Senator Short become the Assistant Treasurer? In April 1996. What happened in between? There was a federal election. What possible influence could he have had on the decision about retirement savings accounts? What possible influence could he have had when it had been a policy of the coalition for six or seven years? Why hadn't retirement savings accounts been introduced? Let us make it entirely clear why they had not been: because they were opposed by the ACTU. Government members-Ah!",93
173,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Ah! Why did the Labor Party never allow retirement savings accounts? Because the ACTU opposed them. Why did the ACTU oppose them? Because the ACTU, under industrial superannuation, got a say in the management of superannuation. Hear that it got a say in the management of superannuation. Let us have a look at a conflict of interest. Does that then mean that every union member or union official who was opposed to retirement savings accounts because their organisations got control over the management of the funds had a conflict of interest? On your argument, it must! The corollary of that would be that every Labor frontbencher who now holds or who did hold at the time a position as a union official must be gUilty of a conflict of interest. Did we ever hear the argument in parliament that all the front-bench who were members of trade unions or had held office in trade unions wanted to keep any financial institution out of superannuation because they wanted to control funds? What a massive conflict of interest! Here were people who had such big logs in their own eyes they could not see a speck on the other side of the House. Retirement savings accounts, which Senator Short is somehow alleged to have unilaterally thought up and introduced by reason of his appointment as Assistant Treasurer, were announced by me on 2 November 1995. I will let you in on a little secret: that was not even new the first time this policy was announced. This had been coalition policy for six years. So here are a group of people without the intellectual rigour, without the ability, to cast a light of logic on a proposition, saying that six years ago the coalition adopted a policy of retirement savings accounts and that Senator Short, who became the Assistant Treasurer in April, has somehow unilaterally moved the share price of the ANZ. What an absurd proposition! It only has to be stated to realise how absolutely absurd it is. The second proposition is that Senator Short was an Assistant Treasurer in a government that announced a financial inquiry. When, pray tell, might Senator Short have thought up the idea of a financial inquiry? A week after his appointment? Two weeks after his appointment? A month after his appointment? Let me tell you this: on 2 November 1995, in exactly the same speech to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, I actually went out and announced that we were going to have a financial inquiry. Senator Short was in opposition; Senator Short held no ministerial office; Senator Short was not an Assistant Treasurer. On 2 November 1995, I said: In 1979, Treasurer John Howard established the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System which became known as the Campbell Committee. It was the recommendations from inquiry which ushered in the era of financial deregulation. Given the unprecedented change that has taken place since the Campbell Committee handed down its final report in 1981 it is time undertake another review of the financial system ... It is for this reason that the Howard Governby ment will establish a new limited inquiry, the daughter of Campbell. There it is-2 November 1995-nothing to do with Senator Short. Senator Short did not a commission. Senator Short was not even opposition spokesman. You have pulled out two long standing policies of the coalition-two policies that have been implemented by it in government. You say that Senator Short somehow might have been responsible for them-when he wasn't, when it is clear from the written record that they were announced by me. You say that, as a consequence of Senator Short's involvement in those announcements, he has somehow moved the ANZ share price, which otherwise still would have been at $5.92. You soever. therefore say that he has made some kind of profit as a consequence. There has been no decision taken by Senaallegations tor Short in relation to those two propositions, and neither of them has had an effect on share price. Yet what we see here, don't we, is the little slur-move around, try to run together disconnected events, try to make out some kind of paltry case against Senator Short. But Senator Short is not the real target in this-it is the Prime Minister. Let us try to add in a few more slurs and a few more unconnected events, and we might be able to rescue a desperate opposition! What was the other logical proposition? That announcing an inquiry would have somehow affected the ANZ share price? You do not know what recommendations are going to come out of the inquiry. We do not know what recommendations are going to come out. We do not even know whether they are going to be accepted. How could announcing an inquiry have any material effect on the share price? If any decision of Senator Short's has had any effect on the share price, it could only be that he decided to be part of a government which is making it better for Australian that business. And we are all guilty. We are all guilty that we are making it better for Australian business. That could be the only way into which he would have any involvement in this. The disgusting allegations that were made the member for Hotham that Senator Short had used his office to feather his own nest are repudiated, and repudiated entirely. They were disgusting smears and slurs. The fact that you hold stood up here and made those disgusting an smears and slurs has diminished you. They have not diminished Senator Short. Also, the way in which you sought to make the same kind of smear and slur on others by saying that others have cooked up deals or others have sold shares in companies-you referred specifically to Pacific Dunlop, because of their involvement-are disgusting smears and slurs for which you are absolutely diminished. There is not one whit of evidence, not one whit of argument, not one whit of an attempt to make any logical case what I say to the people of Australia and to this House: 'Remember this. Remember the for which there was no substantiation. Remember the smear and the slur from the the member for Hotham, because he has devalued his currency today. Remember it in relation to future allegations that he will be making.' You will not tear down the Prime Minister by engaging in smears and slurs that diminish you. You will not tear down the Prime Minister that way. In fact, the more you do that, the more you distinguish between his character and yours. The more you try to make those unsubstantiated allegations, the more you engage in the smear and the slur, and the more you illustrate the difference between the Prime Minister and you. That is exactly the way we like to see it. Let me make it entirely clear that in dealing with this matter, the Prime Minister has, as he made it clear, ensured that he had a view to the interests of the ministerial standards and a view to the interests that were involved in this. After being alerted to it, the Prime Minister did all of the steps that he indicated. He has come in here and indicated the conversation that he had in relation to Senator Short. He has made it entirely clear as to the way in which he applied those standards. No amount of disjointed guilt by association and unsubstantiated allegations that come from other side of the House can change that in any material respect. As for the DDB Needham matter, the proposition only has to be stated to be exposed. Here is a committee of people-which happens to include a Labor minister-which you think has somehow cooked up something improper. You may have your doubts about Mr Whelan, old son, but I will tell you one thing: Mr Whelan is not working in concert with our side of the House. He is not some deep undercover agent in relation to this. The other proposition is that because DDB Needham had once done work for the Liberal Party they could never do work for the government. DDB Needham have probably done work for thousands of clients. There are probably many of them that we disagree with, there are probably many of their products that we would never buy. But the fact that they are an advertising agency means one thing: basically, they take the money of their client to try to sell their client's product. The only question you ask in relation to this is, 'Will they will sell it well?' You do not say, 'We didn't like the product they sold for A, B, C, D or E', or, 'They once sold products for the Liberal Party; therefore, they are banned for life.' They are a commercial operation, and this was a commercial decision. It was commercial decision that had bipartisan involvement. No amount of smear or slur will detract from the Prime Minister. This censure should be utterly rejected. (Time expired) Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.12 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. R. G.

176,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I move: That(1) so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1996-97, the Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1996-97 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1996-97; and. (2) standing order 48A (adjournment and next meeting) be suspended for this sitting. I move this motion following events in the management of the House in the last 24 hours, and in particular against a background where we had an agreement with the opposition that the appropriation bills, the budget bills, would be sent to the Main Committee so all members would have ample opportunity to make a contribution. Mr Deputy Speaker, the former government established the Main Committee. In 1995, they themselves took the budget to the Main Committee with our agreement. That provided Latham, M. W. members with an opportunity to speak on the budget and, in particular, to contribute to consideration in detail in the committee stage. With the 1996 budget, the first budget of the coalition government, we agreed with the opposition parties to adopt the same practice and procedure. I thought that was quite sensible. They had been at pains to justify and extol the virtues of the committee process as a means of giving members an opportunity to speak. In a sensible, bipartisan way we agreed with the now opposition, the former government, that that was a fair way to deal with matters. This week the appropriation bills were sent to the Main Committee with the opposition's agreement. It was a sensible process. Unfortunately, in breach of that agreement, the opposition tactics committee decided to send the budget bills back to the lower house, knowing full well that they had failed to agree to the transmission of some other budget related bills to the Main Committee, thereby leading to even greater pressures on time in the lower house. So we have the rather absurd position where the Labor Party were instrumental in establishing the Main Committee-they used the Main Committee for debate on the budget, and we agreed with them that we would so follow the precedent this year-but then, in an absolutely clear, black and white case, have breached the agreement we entered into. Under those circumstances the government is left with absolutely no choice whatsoever but to move this motion this afternoon so that the House can proceed with the business which we otherwise intended to proceed with, and so that we can also ensure the transmission of this legislation to the Senate for further debate. It is very important that the budget be passed; it is important that members have the opportunity to speak on it. I think members will be interested to know that in fact already we have had very substantial debate on the budget in the second reading stage. Already we have had something in the order of 31 or 32 hours of debate on the budget. All members who put their names on the list to speak on the budget bills in the second reading debate stage have in fact spoken. Therefore, no-one could say in any sense whatsoever that anyone has been denied an opportunity to speak. When we look at the numbers, as I said, it is interesting to see that this year on the to budget we have had something in the order of 32 hours of debate in this chamber and in the Main Committee. Of course, this motion will prevent further debate on the budget, in particular that part of the debate which is consideration in detail of the respective portfolios in the committee stage. That is regrettable, but it is a consequence of the opposition's breach of the agreement. When we look at the total time allocated to members to speak on the budget this year, 32 hours, and take into account consideration in detail as well as debate in the second reading stage in previous years, this year we have had substantially more debate already on the budget bills than in the I :st two or three years. For example, in 1995-so I am advised by the Chamber Research Office-we had something like 24 hours total of debate in the second reading and committee stages. In 1994, we had something like 18 hours and 16 minutes, plus six hours and 45 minutes in committee, a total of 25 hours. When we go back to 1993, which was an election year so a comparable year in some regards, we had they 18 hours and 55 minutes of debate in the second reading stage and nine hours in the debate on consideration in detail in the committee stage, a total of 28 hours. So it can be seen that the time we provided for the budget debate on this occasion has in fact exceeded the total time provided for members to speak on the budget in previous years. We think that that is very important. In fact, we would have liked to have provided further time. As I said, we had an agreement with the opposition parties that members would have further opportunity to speak but, unfortunately, as a direct result of their guerilla tactics in the Main Committee, that obviously is not possible. In my dealings with the opposition parties it is a common thing for them to defend their actions by saying that when we were in opposition we were just as bad as they are now. Particularly for those who are new members, the truth of the matter is that as an opposition we were by and large very reasonable. Opposition members-Ha, hal",97
177,Mr REITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"It is a fact. You could expect the guffaws but I cannot remember, for example, the opposition, as we then were, getting up and moving an adjournment of the House as they did a few months ago. We even had, a few months ago, the ridiculous situation of the opposition parties moving and voting in favour of the adjournment of the House, and then, an hour or so later, when we moved the adjournment of the House, voting against it. In the whole time. I have been here I have never seen behaviour as feral as the behaviour we have had from these people in the last few days. We will get a tirade from the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), but when he stands at the dispatch box and addresses us I would like him to explain one simple thing: on what basis did he breach an agreement entered into with the government for the proper management of the proceedings of this chamber so that members could have an opportunity to speak? I know what he will say. His answer will be that they do not agree with the processes entered into for the handling of the euthanasia debate. In other words, what they are basically running here is a secondary boycott on the Main Committee. There is some aspect of government policy they do not like so therefore they are going to deny their own people the opportunity to speak. We deny our own people the opportunity to speak but we are not doing it because we want to; we are doing it because we are forced to. But the people on that side are denying their own people the opportunity to speak and then the Manager of Opposition Business is going to stand up and say that we have a fall-off in parliamentary standards. How absurd can you get! Yet again I say to you: you justify a breach of an agreement. I was the Manager of Opposition Business for a couple of years before the last election. In terms of cooperation with the government I would have to say that the number of phone calls I ever had from Kim Beazley when he was the Leader of the House honestly would have been no more than the number you could count on one hand. In terms of cooperation I spend nearly as much time ringing you as I spend talking to the Democrats about the workplace relations bill. You have had more cooperation from us in the management of the House than we ever got from you over 13 years in total. You have had more from us in six months than you ever provided to us in the 13 years we were in opposition. I say to the honourable member: we are going to put matters back into the Main Committee again next week. We would hope that you do not employ the same guerilla tactics as you did this week. If you do, then you will simply deny people again the opportunity to speak and it will show how hollow your claims are about the importance of giving people an opportunity to speak and the success of the Main Committee. I think it can work but it can work only if you put aside your silly guerilla tactics and apply a bit more common sense to the procedures of this House. (Time expired)",99
178,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"We oppose this motion for very good reasons. The only priorities that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has is getting his IR legislation through and positioning himself for leadership of the Liberal Party. He has got another responsibility, of course, and that is to manage this place, but he does not know how to do it. He has lost interest in it, couldn't care, would not have a clue how to get cooperation in this place. Where was he on Tuesday, defending the censure against his Treasurer (Mr Costello)? He was not up on his feet because he wanted the censure to be run. The best he could do was to delay the time of the day in which it was held. Where was the Leader of the House when it came to defending the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his censure today? He makes comparisons with us when we were in office. There was never an occasion in those days on which the Leader of the House did not defend a censure motion. The invisible Mr Reith sits up there smirking and spending his time counting the numbers: 'Yes, this is another little notch against Peter Costello.' Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of relevance: the motion before the chair is for the suspension of standing orders. It arises from a breach of an agreement by the Manager of Opposition Business. He would, of course, be relevant if he gave us an explanation as to why he has breached the agreement, but it is certainly relevant to discuss prior debates during the week.",99
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,I thank the Leader of the House. The honourable member for Hotham will be relevant to the motion.,100
180,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"But the relevance, Mr Deputy Speaker, is his irrelevance-his irrelevance as Leader of the House. That is what we are dealing with today. Let me explore what it is he is moving today. He is moving the gag on the appropriation bills. He is undertaking a procedure which will effectively deny his side of the parliament the opportunity to speak on the budget. All those back benchers who have to go off and defend seats want the right to speak, but he is gagging them. Can you believe this? The Leader of the House is stopping his own side from speaking, and he blames us for that! What sort of a fool is he? The list of speakers for the appropriation bills essentially involves their people because we have spoken on the second reading. What we want is the right to go to the detail, and that is what they will also deny us. Here they are talking about the importance of scrutiny in this House, of opening the parliament to more opportunity to dissect the budget, to deal with the issues, and the Leader of the House is denying it. He is knocking off the ability of this parliament to consider properly the budget. And why is he doing it? Because he has lost control of the management of this House. Mr Leo MCLeay-It's because Tuckey is his adviser.",100
181,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Maybe it is because he has got the member for O'Connor as his adviser that he is doing so badly. The fundamental problem for the Leader of the House is that he thinks he can get his procedures through simply on the numbers. As we all know, the numbers are one thing, but in terms of managing business, cooperation is the most important thing. Let us go to the question of why we have moved the appropriation bills out of the Main Committee. The Main Committee was estabnot lished by us and can only work if there is a consensus. Why? Because when we agreed to set up the Main Committee when we were in office it was the then opposition that insisted, headed by Peter Reith, that it was the right of one person at anyone time to refer matters back into this chamber. That is the basis upon which the Main Committee works. It must have a consensus to function. But you breached the consensus. You breached the consensus because there was a very strong body of opinion from both sides of the parliament that the euthanasia debate should be held here. So important was it that you have had the first crossing of the floor from a member on your side. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) felt so strongly about the approach that you took in breaching the convention that he crossed the floor. I wonder what sort of little disciplinary actions you have got in mind for him. The fact is it was you, as Leader of the House, who breached the consensus. The Leader of the House tries to pretend that we had an agreement to do that. That is not correct, and his deputy is nodding his head. Mr MCGauran-No, there was an agreement.",100
182,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,Is he the one who has given you the advice? The reason you would not know is because you did not tum up.,100
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Hotham is, of course, conscious that if the member for Batman were here he would raise a point of order, but I would remind you on his behalf.",100
184,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I understand the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, but can I just say this: the Leader of the House talks about the so-called agreement we had privately on this matter, but he did not participate in the meeting. This is evidence of the problem and the way in which he runs business. He did not turn up. He could not care less about participating in consultations. He would not be prepared to do it. What he did was send along the battery doll over there, the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), the person who yesterday had to be reminded to get to his feet to move the gag on me. He forgot, so we got a few words out. The battery had run out, so the Leader of the House had to run down from the back and get him up. There he was, the talking doll, moving the gag. He also came along to the meeting. He came along with one instruction. The instruction was, 'We're not giving any time in the House for the euthanasia debate.' That was their opening gambit. You reckon that is cooperation? This is an issue that is important to those on both sides of the House on non-party lines. It is a conscience vote. Yet you want to ram the thing through on the basis that you have not got any extra time. Since that little discussion, we ail know you have got some extra time because we have got an extra sitting week when President Clinton visits. Why couldn't you tell the backbench that you are making us sit for four days for a one-day visit from the US President? Why not use two of those days to deal with the euthanasia debate? That is the proposition I put to you and you never came back to us. You simply said, 'We'll use the numbers and ram it through.' The trouble is you can use the numbers as much as you like, but you will not get cooperation from us. We have indicated a preparedness to cooperate with the way in which the Main Committee is used, but cooperation cuts both ways. You have to be prepared to list the euthanasia debate here and then we will have cooperation in the way in which the Main Committee works. That is the basis of the proposition we put, and Peter MCGauran knows it. He knows it and you know it, because it has been put to you. Your chief whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), knows it because it has been put to him by our chief whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). So let us not have any of this nonsense about no talks and no consultation. 0 u r 0 ff e r is simple: we will cooperate, but you have got to cooperate. What is important to those on this side of the House, as it is to members on your side of the House, and you know it full well, is that the debate on euthanasia should be held here. Our amendment, which the Leader of the House would not let us move the other day, was simply this: that the euthanasia debate be held in here, but that the opportunity be given to the Leader of the House to determine how it was scheduled. We even indicated a preparedness to sit on Friday and Saturday to deal with it. Do you say that is not cooperation? You are a phoney. You come in here, you know you have mucked up the procedures, you know you are so pig-headed and stubborn that cooperation means nothing to you. You think it is all about numbers. It is a thuggery approach rather than a cooperative approach. That is your approach. You have got yourself into such a hole that the only way out is to tough it out. The fact is if this is the way you are that going to seek cooperation, you are going to continue to have problems in scheduling business in the House. This is not the first occasion on which this lack of cooperation has occurred. You have gagged motions against us consistently in this chamber and you are doing it again. Mr Reith-Get used to it.",100
185,Mr CREAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"He now says, 'Get used to it.' That is the great cooperative model in action again: 'Get used to it-more gags, more guillotines.' But his Prime Minister, whom he would not defend today, says he wants to lift standards, he wants to make parliament more accountable and that we should have more opportunity for the ordinary folk to hear what we are doing. How can they hear what we are doing if we are constantly in procedures dealing with your stupidity? And we will continue to run the procedural motions because it is the only defence we have got in that circumstance. I have always operated on the basis of trying to get consensus. In all of my public life, I have operated on that basis. But it cuts both ways. You are not giving it so you are not going to get it. (Time expired)",101
186,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I wish to raise a couple of points. I say as a matter of courtesy to the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that he was considered to be a particularly good Manager of Opposition Business when he had that role. Some of the criticism being levelled against him is perhaps a little unfair. Nonetheless, he can always defend himself much more ably than anybody else. The Leader of the House only recently observed that the guillotine had been used only in an extremely limited way in the first part of the government's term of office. Here we see the guillotine being applied to appropriation bills Nos I and 2 and the parliamentary departments bill, which in effect will limit the opportunity for members to contribute to debate on some of the most important bills of the parliamentary term. Consistent with the undertakings made during and after the election that the standards of the House would be raised, I should have thought that such an approach is inconsistent. We are now seeing the winter of the coalition's new approach to parliamentary procedures corning to pass. In fact, we have seen a clear falling out amongst the major parties. I noted that the arrangements and agreements only involve the two major parties. There is no question of any arrangements or agreements with anybody else in this place, notwithstanding that we now have a number of non-government members whose interests, apparently, are completely superfluous to the so-called agreements and arrangements. As an individual, I do not recollect having received-and I do not suppose that any of my colleagues recollect ever being approached either-an approach on this particular matter. If I may be even-handed in my criticism, it is ironic that the very same Labor Party that in the first instance accused us of being disruptive in the Main Committee, by having the temerity to move two bills back into this House, have now done exactly the same thing and are accusing the government of being hypocrites. That is a supreme example of hypocrisy if ever there was one. Mr Leo MCLeay-We were coming round to your point of view.",102
187,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The member for Watson ought to take note that, in the final analysis, you are judged not on what you say but on your behaviour. In this process of behaviour, you have been entirely inconsistent. I should have thought that you would be the last person to talk in this instance on this particular case. The member for Watson was responsible for what I considered a supreme act of hypocrisy when the Labor Party connived with the government to attack the Independents for having the temerity to move two bills. What a disgraceful act-moving two bills back to the main chamber! For very good reason, I might add, because in both cases there were controversial matters that should have been referred back here for proper debate. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would know that, in the case of the primary industries amendment bill, $20 million was being appropriated from the assets of wool growers to some new corporation to market wool futures on the international market. That appropriation of money had two lines of explanatory memorandum associated with it and one line in the press release of the minister responsible. I should have thought that any bill applying itself in that particular way ought to be debated as a matter of grave importance in this chamber. Of course, that does not even take into account the Andrews bill, on which I have already addressed this chamber, and the fact that it ought to be debated in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. The very idea of moving it holus-bolus, even with five speakers here, into the Main Committee is an abrogation of government responsibility and the government ought to be ashamed of itself.",102

In participating in that debate I, for one, certainly applaud that as a rational unnecessary cluttering of the parliamentary process time. Clearly, we expect all Australians to comply with parliament can do is to ensure that the legislation of interpretation. In my former life as a lawyer, I know how frankly admit that there was perhaps more colleagues, profited from ambiguities and uncertainties should not occur; and bills such as this are clarify ambiguities. Indeed, if I may suggest consider establishing some formal line of communication judiciary with the government, so that those attention of relevant ministers any drafting errors with a piece of legislation. The other issue that is very relevant to bills the name 'omnibus bills', because there are of so many other acts referred to-is that lawyers and the court system.

(2) If he was consulted, did the consultations include consideration as to whether the proposed directions: (a) were of an appropriate nature to be made as general directions; (b) amounted to the Minister exercising a delegated legislative power not authorised by the Act; and (c) conflicted with several sections of the Act specifying the powers of the Commission and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. (3) If he was consulted and the consultations included the considerations specified in part (2), what conclusions were reached in respect of each consideration. (4) If he was not consulted, will he seek urgent consultation on the considerations specified in (2) with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not appropriate for me to advise whether such consultations took place. Whether any legal advice was sought by or provided to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is a question that should appropriately be addressed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I suggest that any further questions on the matter be addressed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. NA Venice Architecture Biennale: Australian Pavilion (Question No. 257) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 May 1996: (1) Has the Minister declined representations for Commonwealth financial support for an Australian pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale; if so, why. (2) What Commonwealth funding was provided to stage the pavilion at the previous Venice Architecture Biennale. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australia Council maintains and manages the Australian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In July 1993, the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) sought assistance from the Australia Council's former Visual Arts/Craft Board for an Australian exhibition at the Architecture Biennale. In October 1993, the Board agreed that the RAJA could make use of the Pavilion provided it met other costs, but rejected the application for direct funding assistance of $44,600. That decision was based on the assessment that support for international architecture exhibitions was not a high priority for the Board and beyond its current funding capacity. I am advised that in December part 1994, the RAIA acknowledged the decision and indicated that it would seek corporate sector support. Following representations made to me in March 1996 I informed the RAIA that accordance with the principles of arm's length funding, and the proviany sions of the Australia Council Act 1975, I am unable to intervene in decisions taken by the Council on particular grants. I have also informed the RAJA that there are no other avenues within the Communications and the Arts portfolio that could provide assistance for an Australian exhibition at the Biennale at such a late date. (2) In 1991 the Visual Arts/Craft Board of the Australia Council provided $15,000 towards the costs of preparing and maintaining the Australian Pavilion for the duration of the 1991 Venice Architecture Biennale. The Australia Council's Community, Environment, Art and Design program contributed $5000 towards the project. These moneys were forwarded to the Australian Exhibitions Touring Agency, the organisation then responsible for the coordination and management of the Australian Pavilion in Venice. Financial Assistance: Employer Organisations and Industrial Companies (Question No. 293) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Did the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approve or make available grants or other forms of financial assistance in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 and (c) 1995-96 to (i) employer organisations or (ii) individual companies; if so, in each case, (A) what was the name and address of the recipient, (B) what sum was involved, (C) what was the purpose of the grant or payment, (D) under what program was it made, (E) who approved the payment, (F) what acquittal requirements applied to the grant or payment and (0) is acquittal outstanding. (2) Has the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approved or made available, grants or other forms of financial assistance in 1996-97 to (a) employer organisations or (b) individual companies; if so, in each case, (i) what is the name and address of the recipient or prospective recipient, (ii) what sum is involved, (iii) what is the purpose of the grant or payment, (iv) under what program is it being made, (v) who approved it and (vi) what acquittal requirements apply.

(B) The total sums involved (C) The Asia Business Links program provides assistance supporting Australian organisations to bring key familiarisation visits of between two weeks to six months. (D) The funding was provided under Austrade (E) Payments are approved by the Manager Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Trade Commission made a number of grants and other forms of financial assistance available to both employer organisations and individual companies over the period 19931996. As these payments were made under a number of different programs, information concerning each relevant program is provided separately. The confidentiality provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 preclude the release of personal information concerning the affairs of persons who have received these payments, such as the address of the person or specific purpose for which the funds were used. Therefore, these details have been provided on an aggregate rather than individual basis. Full lists of all grant recipients and grants paid for the financial years 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 have also been provided directly to the honourable member, as the Act specifically permits this. In the tables that follow, ""companies"" includes sole traders, partnerships and other entities that are not ""employer organisations"".

Computer Systems Modifications (Question No. 532) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What steps are being taken to ensure that all computer systems in the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility are modified so that they continue to operate properly after 1 January 2000. (2) What is the estimated cost of the modifications. (3) Will all systems be modified by 1 January 2000. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department and portfolio agencies for which I have responsibility have made year 2000 compliance part of their systems redevelopment processes for some years. Each is now examining potential Year 2000 exposures in hardware and proprietary software. The Department is working with the Office of Government Information Technology Year 2000 Subcommittee (of which it is a member) and year 2000 project plans are being developed in each agency to ensure that all exposures will be resolved prior to the year 2000. (2) Most of the costs associated with the year 2000 issue are being subsumed within normal system redevelopment and replacement costs. Any additional costs are difficult to quantify at this time, however, it is expected these costs will be relatively small in comparison to recent media information on the subject. (3) Each project plan provides for those systems continuing beyond 1 January 2000 to be year 2000 compliant. Kinetic Technology International (Question No. 544) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: Did he or a person on his behalf hold discussions with Kinetic Technology International before he decided to allow the use of hand-held emergency location transmitters under Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 252A; if so, what are the details. Did he alter the proposed compliance date with respect to the new CAR 252A; if so, why. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. Staff of my office had discussions with Kinetic Technology International, an Australian company which was developing a new technology hand-held emergency locator transmitter (ELT) that would conform with the regulations under CAR 252A. Kinetic Technology advised that a significantly smaller hand-held ELT would be available commercially in the first half of 1997. On 5 June 1996, the Government amended the proposed compliance date of CAR 252A from 1 July 1996 to 31 July 1997 to allow a reasonable lead time for industry to implement the requirements for the carriage of ELTs. The revised startup date will also enable Australian aviators to have access to new and improved technology incorporated in the Kinetic Technology's hand-held ELT. However, there is nothing to prevent any aircraft owner from installing an ELT, either fixed or handheld, before that date. Australian Defence Force Units: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 625) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Which units of the Australian Defence Force operate within the electoral division of Barton. (2) How many (a) officers and (b) enlisted personnel are in each of these units. (3) What effect will the 1996 Budget have on their ranks, operations and funds. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Army units that are currently located within the electorate division of Barton are: E Company, 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, located at Burrows Street, Arneliffe, NSW and 23rd Field Regiment (Headquarters and Headquarters Battery), located at Chandler Street, Kogarah, NSW. (2) The break-up of officers and other ranks in those units is as follows: E Company, 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. (a) and (b) Regular Army-l other rank; General Reserve-96 (5 officers and 91 other ranks). 23rd Field Regiment (Headquarters and Headquarters Battery). (a) and (b) Regular Army-9 (3 officers and 6 other ranks); General Reserve-73 (8 officers and 65 other ranks). (3) The establishment and Regular Army staffing strength will remain unchanged. As a result of a reordering of Defence spending priorities, these units will receive additional funding for equipment and also receive an increased allocation of Army Reserve Training Days. Department of Social Security Offices (Question No. 660) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 11 September 1996: What is the Government's intentions with regard to the Cessnock, Kurri Kurri, Singleton and Muswellbrook offices of the Minister's department. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Department of Social Security intends to continue to operate its offices at Cessnock and Muswellbrook for the foreseeable future. The Department's offices at Kurri Kurri and Singleton are part time visiting services reflecting the lesser demand for Departmental services in these towns. Visiting Services are reviewed regularly in accordance with customer demand. Public Libraries Electronic Access (Question No. 672) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 September 1996: (1) Was the sum of $2.2m allocated in the 199697 Budget for Public Libraries Electronic Access; if so, how will it be distributed among public libraries. (2) What sum will be allocated to the (a) Leederville Library, Vincent, WA, (b) Ingelwood, Dianella and Maylands libraries, Stirling, WA, (c) Morley and Bayswater libraries, Bayswater, WA, (d) Altone Park, Midland and Guildford libraries, Shire of Swan, WA and (e) Bassendean Library, Bassendean, WA. (3) What is the estimated average cost of setting up electronic access in a public library in the Perth metropolitan area. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) An amount of $2.0 million has been allocated to the Online Public Access Initiative (formerly the Public Libraries Electronic Access) to increase public access to online services, including the Internet, through avenues such as public libraries and other similar community centres. A further $0.2 million will be provided from the operational budget of the Department of Communications and the Arts for the administration of the program. I am currently considering options as to how the program might be structured to best achieve the Government's policy objectives to promote widespread community access to online services. (2) Until the structure of the program is decided it is not possible to identify what level of support will be provided to specific community access sites. (3) The cost of establishing electronic access in any library depends upon a number of variables, including: the number of access points; the capacity and functionality of computing, reception equipment, and the online services provided; the bandwidth capacity of the online connection or connections; for example dial-up modem, fixed link dial-up modem, dial-up ISDN, fixed link ISDN etc; the Internet service provider chosen; and whether the library is able to obtain cost efficiencies through a whole-of-region or wholeof-State approach. Therefore it is not possible to provide an average cost of setting up electronic access, which would adequately reflect the wide variety of options already being implemented in public libraries. ABC Promotions (Question No. 673) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 September 1996: In relation to the ABC ""it's your ABC"" promotion featuring finger games using the ABC logo, (a) who authorised the series, (b) how many commercials were in the series, (c) were they produced within the ABC, (d) what was the cost of the promotion, (e) when were they first shown, (f) how many times have they been shown to 9 September, (g) when will they cease to be shown, (h) what is the target audience and (i) has the series had any measurable impact on ABC ratings. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The ABC Corporate identity campaign resulted from a tender process. The campaign proposal from Batey Kazoo, ""It's Your ABC"", was chosen as the most creative and innovative in that it met the requirement of demonstrating public involvement in the ABC. It was authorised by senior management, as is usually the case with such matters. (b) Twenty one promotions were produced. One of these was a specific Australia Day promotion and one was a 60 second montage of random footage. (c) The promotions were produced externally by Batey Kazoo. Batey Kazoo in tum commissioned a young Victorian film-maker to direct the promos. (d) The total cost to the ABC was $263,806. (e) The promotions were first shown on Australia Day, 26 January 1996. (f) The promotions have been seen on 6,026 occasions. (g) There are no plans to cease screening the promotions. An internally produced second series is currently in production. This will be filmed in each State and post produced by ABC staff. (h) The target audience is all people. The ABC has quite deliberately chosen people to appear in the idents who represent a diversity of Australian backgrounds and lifestyles. (i) It is not possible to measure the impact on ABC ratings. However, the viewer awareness of the campaign is great, as has been seen in press coverage, viewer mail, phone calls etc. The series recently won five trophies at the Australasian Television Awards including 1996 Best of Show, 1996 Best TV Promotion or Ident, and 1996 Best Commercial of the Year.

The Australian Government Delegates were assisted by two Geneva based officials: Mr Howard Bamsey (Government Adviser) Ambassador, Australian Permanent Mission to the Office of the United Nations, Geneva Mr Chris Knott (Government Adviser) First Secretary, Australian Permanent Mission to the Office of the United Nations, Geneva (2) A Convention and Recommendation concerning Home Work were adopted by the Conference. (3)(a) The AustraIian Government abstained from voting on both the Convention and the Recommendation concerning home work. (b) The Employers' Delegate also abstained from voting on the instruments. (c) The Workers' Delegate voted in favour of the instruments. (4) Since 1994 Australia has ratified the following ILO Conventions. All three were ratified on 29 . August 1995. Convention No. 69, Certification of Ships' Cooks, 1946 Convention No. 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1-46 Convention No. 166, Repatriation of Seafarers (Revised), 1987. Public Libraries Electronic Access (Question No. 682) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 September 1996: (1) What sum provided in the 1996-97 Budget for Public Libraries Electronic Access will be allocated to the (a) Casula library, Liverpool, NSW and (b) Glenquarie, Ingleburn, Minto and Campbelltown libraries, Campbelltown, NSW. (2) What is the estimated average cost of setting up electronic access in a public library in the electoral division of Werriwa. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) An amount of $2.0 million has been allocated to the Online Public Access Initiative (formerly the Public Libraries Electronic Access) to increase public access to online services, including the Internet, through avenues such as public libraries and other similar community centres. A further $0.2 million will be provided from the operational budget of the Department of Communications and the Arts for the administration of the program. I am currently considering options as to how the program might be structured to best achieve the Government's policy objectives to promote widespread community access to online services. Until the structure of the program is decided it is not possible to identify what level of support will be provided to specific community access sites. (2) The cost of establishing electronic access in any library depends upon a number of variables, including: the number of access points; the capacity and functionality of computing, reception equipment, and the online services provided; the bandwidth capacity of the online connection or connections; for example dial-up modem, Victoria New South Wales Queensland South Australia Western Australia fixed link dial-up modem, dial-up ISDN, fixed link ISDN etc; the Internet service provider chosen; and whether the library is able to obtain cost efficiencies through a whole-of-region or wholeof-State approach. Therefore it is not possible to provide an average cost of setting up electronic access, which would adequately reflect the wide variety of options already being implemented in public libraries. Australian Electoral Commission: Trade Union Elections (Question No. 690) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 September 1996: (1) Does the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) conduct elections for trade unions. (2) How many union elections have been held each year in each State since 1991. (3) Are any of the elections paid for by the unions involved; if so, (a) how many and (b) is it on a full cost recovery basis. (4) What is the total cost each year for the AEC to conduct the elections. (5) How much of this cost has been recovered each year. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Yes. Section 210 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 requires that each election for office for an industrial organisation or branch of an organisation be conducted by the AEC. Industrial organisations refers to both trade unions and employer organisations. There are 126 registered industrial organisations, of which 79 are employer organisations and 47 are trade unions. (2) The AEC does not keep separate figures for trade unions and employer organisations. The table shows the figures for industrial elections, for each state and territory, as well as nationally, for each year since 1991-92. Industrial Elections Conducted by the AEC from 1991192 to 1995/96 1991192 1992193 1993/94 1994/95 1995/96 Total 289 250 200 235 198 1172 154 155 117 149 139 714 82 66 53 59 84 344 95 72 67 78 62 374 77 58 49 53 62 299 Tasmania Australian Capital Territory Northern Territory Total Source: 1991192-1995/96 AEC Annual Reports (3) Industrial organisations do not pay any costs for the conduct of elections. Section 215(4) of the Act states that 'the expenses incurred by the Australian Electoral Commission in conducting an election under this Act shall be borne by the Commonwealth'. (4) See table: Industrial Elections-Sub Program Costs 1991192 to 1995/96 1991192-$4,879,000 1992193-$5,153,000 1993/94-$4,815,000 1994/95-$4,2 }2,OOO 1995196-$4,124,000 Sources: 1991192-1994195-Annual Financial Statements from AEC Annual Reports. 1995/96-The 1995/96 FY figure is directly comparable to previous years. The AEC Financial Statements for 1995/96 show a figure of $5.2m, which includes a range of indirect costs not previously included. (5) None, see the answer to question (3). Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (Question No. 696)  trative Services, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Are Australian Government Analytical Laboratories in Adelaide and Hobart to be closed; if so, (a) what effect will this have on the Government's capacity to react to public health or trade issues and (b) how many staff will be affected by the decision. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Adelaide laboratory is to be downsized to a shop front, while the Hobart laboratory is to be either downgraded to a shop front or closed. 1991192 1992193 1993/94 1994195 1995/96 Total 85 72 54 71 72 354 48 52 41 32 34 207 15 13 9 13 17 67 845 738 590 690 668 3531 (a) Claims that the restructuring of AGAL laboratories threatens public safety are simply not true. Initial investigations of incidents such as food poisoning are the responsibility of state public health laboratories. For example, AGAL was not involved in the initial investigation of the Garibaldi incident; this was handled by the South Australian Government's Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). AGAL nationally has since been involved in investigative work to assist the development of standards and protocols to prevent a repeat of such an incident The SA Government's IMVS is in fact the Australian reference laboratory for Salmonella and E-coli bacteria-the causes of recent major food poisoning outbreaks. Suspected food poisoning cases anywhere in Australia are referred to the IMVS laboratory in Adelaide for confirmation. Therefore, the restructuring of AGAL's laboratory network in no way lessens the protection available to the public from food poisoning. AGAL provides a number of very important services to government, industry and the community, including significant public interest roles in protecting public health, export food markets and the environment, and in the analysis of drugs-insport and illicit drugs. The Government believes there is a clear role for AGAL as a Government laboratory, but that it is important to get the current operations working effectively within the principles of competitive neutrality. The downsizing or closure of the Adelaide and Hobart laboratories is a part of the overall restructuring and re-engineering of AGAL designed to achieve this goal. AGAL will continue to provide its full range of services, including important functions related to protection of public health and trade. In particular, AGAL will maintain a strong national capability to respond to food contamination crises, as a backup and extension to the state systems, through major laboratories in Sydney and Melbourne. All of the services provided in Adelaide and Hobart will be continued, but transferred to AGAL's other laboratories. AGAL will maintain a shopfront in Adelaide, with a small presence of professional staff who will maintain personal contact with customers and forward locally sourced work to the appropriate AGAL laboratory. The case for a shopfront in Hobart is still being investigated. (b) There are 34 permanent staff and 11 contract staff in Adelaide, and 13 permanent staff and 1 contract staff in Hobart. All permanent staff in Adelaide and Hobart are being offered the opportunity of transferring with their position to AGAL's other laboratories. It is not known at this stage how many staff will take up this offer. British Citizens: Voting Rights (Question No. 697)  trative Services, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: (1) How many British citizens who are not Australian citizens are able to vote in Australian elections, referenda or plebiscites. (2) Will the Government change the voting rights of these persons in future. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has advised that, at the end of August 1996, there was an approximate minimum of 155,000 people nationally (excluding South Australia) who were British subjects, but not Australian citizens, at the time of their enrolment. Some of these people may have since taken out Australian citizenship, however, it is not possible to determine the numbers. The AEC further advises that these are the number whose enrolment details have changed in some way (for example they have moved address) and have re-enrolled since 1984, and accordingly have had their enrolment entry coded as being British subjects. Those who were enrolled before 1984 and whose entitlement has not changed in any way will still be enrolled, but will not have been coded on the Roll as being in that category. To do so would be a very expensive exercise. The South Australian Roll is currently on a separate database and British subjects are not separately identified on that database. The legal position under section 93(1)(b)(ii) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is that the only non-Australian citizens who are eligible to vote are those British subjects who were on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll immediately before 26 January 1984. The Commonwealth enrolment qualifications were changed in 1981 because it was the view of all political parties and governments, State and Commonwealth, that Australian citizenship is the appropriate qualification. However, when these qualifications were changed it was considered unfair to disenfranchise British subjects who were already entitled to enrol and vote. Consequently, British subjects who were already enrolled at the date of transition were able to retain their franchise. (2) The Government will not be moving to change the franchise qualifications in the foreseeable future.
