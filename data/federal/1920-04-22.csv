I , therefore, ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you have done anything in regard' to it?",20
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," In view of the present cost of publishing and printing Hansard, and having regard to the necessity for economy owing to the serious shortage of paper and the enormous increase in the price of that commodity, it is not proposed to extend beyond its present limits the free circulation of. Hansard.. Eachapplication will, however, be dealt with on its merits. PARLIAMENTARY ATTENDANTS'. SALARIES.",20

PARLIAMENT HOUSE' GROUNDS.",20
12,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Te > the north of this building lies a piece of land whose presentcondition is an insult to the people of Melbcwtme, and harmful to the chilin. the neighborhood. Will yon,. Mr. Speaker, bring under the notice of the State Government the condition of this piece of land, so that they may improve it?",20
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I presume that the honourable member refers to the triangular enclosure bounded by Nicholson and Albert streets and the temporary rightof-way which cuts it off from the main grounds of Parliament House, and furnishes direct communication between Spring-street and Albert-street. The condition of this ground has been on several occasions tinder the consideration of Mr. President and myself, and we have made certain proposals concerning it to the State Government, but these have so far not been approved'. We are unwilling, under present conditions, to expend any large amount o£ public money upon the ground, thinking, that we ought to do only what is necessary to maintain it in the order in which wo are obliged to keep it by the terms of the agreement under which the Commonwealth Parliament occupies these premises; but we have offered to remove the present iron fence, and to reerect it in place of the picket fence, so far as it will go, along one side of the right-of-way, aud to lay out the ground in a manner corresponding with that in which a similar piece of ground on. the south, side of the building has been, laid out, handing it then to the State authorities to maintain, or to pass on to the control of the city council, or of some other body. Of'course, we have not presumed to dictate to the State Government what they should do with the land, but we have made certain suggestions for their consideration. A plan has been prepared and submitted to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and one or two other gentlemen connected with the House Committee, and a little while ago we had a conference with them about the matter, when we were led to believe that our proposals were not viewed favourably, because of the possibility that, at some future time, the land might be required as a site for a public building, or for an extension of this building. - They, however, promisedto lay the matter before the State Joint House - Committee for tlieir consideration. Since then we have seen Mr MCPherson, the State Treasurer, who is sympathetically disposed towards our proposal, to spend £1,000 on putting the land in order before handing it over to the State Government. He promised to use his best efforts to induce a change of heart so far as these other gentlemen are concerned, and the - matter is at the present time, I believe, under their consideration. Similar proposals were made on a former occasion - by the President and myself, and were then generally favourably received, but the then President, of the Legislative ""Council, since deceased, would not agree to them. MEMORIAL TO FALL EN SOLDIERS.",21
14,Mr BAMEORD,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister noted in the daily press the statement that certain persons propose-to purchase the White Hart Hotel? In view of a proposal to erect a memorial of a national character in honour of our fallen soldiers, will the Government consider the advisability of buying the White Hart and the Imperial hotels, demolishing those buildings, and on the space thus made available, erecting a memorial such as will honour for all time the memory of those who died in defence of their country ?",21
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The matter of establishing a national memorial is in the hands of a Committee, which has made some recommendations whichcertainly do not coincide with that put forward by the honourable, member. All I can say in reply to his question is that the Government will consider his proposal. STATE WOOL COMMITTEES.",21
16,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"In view of the early termination of the operations of the State Wool' Committees, will the Prime Minister consider, the advisability of giving some comipensation to the clerical staff, who have been for years, working under the minimum rate of wage? Mr nUGHES - I am not aware that the officers employed by the State Wool Committeesha\se been working under the minimum rate of wage, but if that is the case it seems quite wrong. However, I shall bring the matter before the notice of the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee. TARIFF.",21
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the widespread interest taken in the Tariff, can the Prime Minister give the House an approximate idea of the date on which it will come up for consideration.?",21
18,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think the answer to the honourable member's question is that we shall deal with the Tariff as soon as possible. PRINTING COMMITTEE.

21,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"the Acting Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the rifle clubs organizations of the Commonwealth proved their immense value during the war, and that in many cases over 50 per cent, of their members went on active service? 2. Is it a fact that only half of the pre-war grant to rifle clubs has been made available for the years 191S and 1919? 3. Is it a fact that the Minister for Defence disclaims any responsibility for the reduction? 4. Will the Acting Treasurer, taking into account the splendid war record of the rifle clubs, make provision to restore them to their pre-war position, including travelling passes to members taking part in meetings?",22
22,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Government fully appreciates the ser-vice of members of rifle clubs in connection with the late war. Regarding service with the A.I.F., it is understood that in some instances 50 per cent, of members of individual clubs enlisted. 2. The usual efficiency grant, at the rate of 5s. per efficient, was paid for the financial year 1918-19, and at the rate of 2s. 6d. for' the financial year 1919-20; the latter rate was based upon the need for economy during the present financial year. 3. The action taken to reduce the grant was the corporate action of the Government, for the reason given above, and was not an individual act of administration by the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence takes his share of the responsibility as a member of the Government. 4. This matter will be considered by the Government in connection with the whole scheme and twenty- for the future defence policy. LETTER CARRIERS: INCREASED WAGES.",22

Thereafter, it is anticipated that there will be a substantial increase in the yearly output. One firm estimates, with the provision they are making for machines, that their turnout within eighteen months from date will be at the rate of 6,240,000 pairs per annum. Other manufacturers contemplate installing the ne-cessary machinery immediately the Tariff proposals of the Government are ratified, by Parliament. TELEPHONE LINE . UlTGAItlE AND CAEGELLICO.",26

An interim reply was then furnished. I am now able to supply the following answer:The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, reports that the estimated deficiency was based upon the report of the District Inspector, and that it was arrived at after crediting the proposal with the revenue likely to be derived from, the existing offices, and from new offices at.

(Paper presented to the British Parliament.) Wool Clips-Cablegrams , &o., constituting the contract between the Imperial and the Commonwealth Governments regarding theputchase of Australian Wool Clips. NA PRODUCERS .",26
54,Mr MACKAY,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Lilley) move That this House is of opinion that the fairest method of calculation for purposes of the Federal income tax as applied to primary producers would be upon a basis of five years' operations. I am hopeful that this motion will receive the sympathetic consideration of honourable members. On many occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said that the only way in which Australia can meet its financial obligations is by increasing production. To achieve that result we should endeavour to in duce many of the people in the cities to settle in the country. That can be accomplished only if rural life is made equally as attractive as is life in the cities at the present time. Throughout Australia there are a number of large - cities which hold out such inducements to young men in the country that some counter attraction is necessary. I ask the House to pass this motion, and I ask the Government to give some relief to the primary producers who. today, are very unfairly treated in respect of taxation. Adam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, volume 2, page 310, lays down four maxims which I commend to the attention of the Treasurer, and which, although written over 150 years ago, are worth quoting to-day1. The subjects of every State ought to contribute towards the support of the Government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State. 2. The tax which each individual is bound .to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary. The' time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person. 3. Every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely .to be convenient for the contributor to pay it. 4. Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible, over nnd above what it brings into the public treasury of the State. For many years past it has been apparent that the system of taxing the primary producers upon the result of 'each individual year's operations is most unfair. 'There are some years in which the farmers are assured of a profit, but in the - case of the sugar-cane grower no reasonable deduction is made for the 'heavy expense incurred in producing the crop. [3.0] - I It is well known that in the southern parts of Queensland and in New South Wales sugar cane is a two-year crop. The Queensland Farmers TJnion has supplied me with many instances of the in justice of which I am complaining. Amongst them is the case of a cane grower who, in 1915, spent £194 in preparing his land for cane, and, in 1916, £146. In 1917 his crop yielded a return of £ 7 1 7 , but he was not allowed any deduction for his principal expenditure, because it had not been incurred in the' taxation year. His average income for the two years was £359 per annum, but he was compelled to pay income tax on the full amount of £717 in the one year. Another instance is that of a grower who spent £260 in preparing his land for cane in the latter part of 1918 and the beginning of 1919, and who will not harvest his crop until this year. It is only necessary to work the land until the cane has obtained sufficient growth to smother the weeds. The proceeds of his crop will appear in the income tax return as clear profit, except for the cost of harvestinc. The orchardist, the dairy farmer, and the grazier all run the risk of adverse seasons, and frequently experience heavy losses, from which they may take many years to recover. The averaging of incomes in these cases would afford great relief. It is most important that honourable members should realise that the lot of the dairyman in particular is very unfortunate in States which are subject to drought, and I ask the House to take notice of this paragraph from report No. 3 by the Inter-State Commission in regard to the conditions of the dairying industry in VictoriaA witness deputed by the Victorian Farmers Union, comprising 6,000 members, put the matter from two points of view. He first of all estimated under average conditions the cost of producing milk, and the returns obtained from it. In the result he showed that a man working sixty hours a week would earn only 26s. 6d. a week during nine months of the year. He next gave the actual results of his own working, with two brothers as his partners. The earnings of each per hour were as follow in the years mentioned:1014 .. 2i&. per hour. 1015 .. Loss of Is. l i d . per hour. 1910 .. Is. 4d. per hour. The witness, judging by the way his figures were submitted, carried on his farm on expert lines, but on a small scale, and 8 miles from the butter factory. It is stated thai at no period since the ing was established has the production of butter given a return of Od. per hour for the labour required to produce it. Taken over a period of three consecutive years, and that "" during recent years the number of farms that were formerly xised as dairy farms which are now used for other purposes is astonishing."" The cause of the process of elimination is put down to the general better condition in other callings, in most of which Is. to 2s. per hour is assured without risk and with no Sunday labour. The position in New South Wales and. Queensland is quite as bad, if not worse. The Inter-State Comniission, in Report No. 8, deals with the conditions of the dairy farmers in New South Wales, and saysAs in relation to Victoria, returns for years beforeand during the war from dairy tarms situated in various parts of the Stateswere examined. The examination of these accounts and the evidence given, by numerous witnesses confirm the opinion of the Commission, that even in good seasons dairy farmers earn only moderate profits in an occupation which entails long hours of employment, and which particularly susceptible to adverse seasonal influences. Everywhere the same opinion held, that if it were not for the fact that it is for the most part carried on by families importantindustry would no longer figure the forefront of the Commonwealth's primary industries. There is more capital invested in the tion, dairying industry in proportion returns than in any other occupation, on theaverage, the dairy farmer receives as a reward for his efforts an amount which any labourer would despise as spective wages. I am chiefly interested of the small man, because I find that those who are farming large areas do not experience this disability to the same tent. The position of men who are tically responsible for the closer settlemost ment in many parts of Australia calls svmpaithetie consideration. take the risk of varying seasons and bear the losses occasioned by drought disease, but they do not get like the consideration to which are entitled from those in No wonder there is a drift from the counfied try to the cities. With the prospects of better rewards and more treatment in the way of taxation, reverse should certainly be the case. is true that our dairy farmers do not necessary provision for times of drought, but it is equally true that, with the small areas of land that are held by them, it is quite impossible to place any large area Mr Mackay. dairy- under crop, for the purposes of conservation. I know of numbers of instances in which men are dairying on 40 to 160 acres, and it would be impossible for them to place sufficient area under crop to provide for the leanyears to come. Every dry season means large payments for fodder in order to keep their cattle alive, and it frequently happens that both money and stock are lost. I know of one man who was anxious to get out of mining, and who leased a farm of 100 acres. A f t e r a very hard struggle he succceeded in getting a small herd together, and the venture was just becoming payable when the drought of last year came along and wi,ped out almost the whole of his herd. The conservation of water and fodder is certainly necessary in Australia, and I look, forward to either the State Governments, or the Federal Government giving the land-holders a lead in such an important matter. I anticipate that the officers of the is Taxation Department will raise objections to any alteration of the present Acts in is the direction I have indicated.; but, while this the problem of administration may have in its difficulties) I . certainly think they can be overcome. I trust the Treasurer will give my motion sympathetic consideraand will evolve some scheme whereby to the the cane-growers-, and the dairymen' in yet, particular, may be enabled,, when they happen to have a profit,, to deduct the whole cost of their production in their reindustries so far as income taxain the lot tion is concerned.",27
55,Mr FLEMING,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"(Robertson) [3.14]; I. have much pleasure in seconding the exmotion, and would like to give a few reapracsons why I think it should receive the sympathetic consideration at the for hands of the Government. At the preThey must sent moment Australia is, in my opinion, suffering the worse drought that has ever and been recordedi n the history of white men anything in this country. I have gone to a great they deal of trouble in the last month or two authority. to obtain the opinions of those most qualito speak in the various far-flung districts of the continent, and I am congenerous vinced, not only from my own experience the - whic h is necessarily limitedt o a porIt tion of one State-bu t from the consensus make of opinion ' amongst a great number of men interested in grazing, that tor-day the graziers are. suffering the worse time they have ever endured. Australia will , I think, receive a shock when th©. stock returns are sent in at the end of this year. I am glad that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) has raised the question at the present time. While I do not eonsider that his proposal - would meet the difficulties of the graziers, dairy farmers, and other primary producers as fully as they should be met, I know that the majority of those interested are in 'favour of some proposal of this kind. Personally, I think we should go very much further, and wipe out taxation on the natural increase of flocks and herds. This would do more to relieve the great primary producing industries than almost anything wa could devise in this Parliament. At the present time men engaged in these industries are paying' in a triplicate way- they are paying ordinary land taxation, they are paying income tax, and they are taxed on the natural increases, on which they never realise. This year will be a striking example of the last mentioned' fact. There will be very few, except in particularly favoured districts, who will ever realise on the youngstock which they have had to acccount for in their returns, and on which they will be taxed. In the first place, the land tax itself is quite sufficient for a man to carry. No other trader in the community is taxed on his capital as the land-owner is taxed on his land. But land taxation ' is a recognised principle in this country, and land-owners have become more or les3 accustomed to it. Some day, perhaps, they will see the inequity of this taxation, and will point out forcibly why they should be relieved of what is after all a most unfair discrimination against them. Droughts are intermittent, and we have to pay income tax--by "" we,"" I mean primary producers generally-whateve r the result of the year's operations may be. While onpaper these men may seem to be making quite good incomes, when they come to realise in practical effect they may have lost on the whole year; yet they have to pay income tax on this fictitious basis. They .pay income tax on what they have never realized, and under no consideration will the tnxeratherers allow any remission for losses. Many years ac'® in the State Parliament of New South Wales I had quite a long contest with the Income Tax Commissioner on this very point. After three or four years the Commissioner admitted that taxation on natural increases which were never realized on, was an utterly unjust burden, and shonld be remitted; but we never got beyond the admission. The statement was definitely made, and published in all thes newspapers throughout my electorate, that'this taxation would in future not be collected, or, rather, would be remitted, when loss could be proved on stock on which it had been paid. That declaration, however, was never put into force, and from that day to this these men have gone on paying every year. The suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay). would to a certain extent meet the case, because,, if a man may average: over five years, he will have time to ascertain whether or not he is going to realizeon a majority of his stock. Anything that this HoiY.se can do to encourage the lot of the primary p""rodueer would be of great benefit. There are many men, particularly in Queensland and in the west of New South Wales, who have lost half of tlieir property. There are, to my certain knowledge, some holdings in both States which have been absolutely abandoned. In some places the owners did their best to keep up provision for stockmen, boundary riders, and others on the back stations ; but lately, in some cases, they have been obliged to give up their places and let those unfortunate men get out of their difficulty the best way they could. There are certain stations west of the Darling without a single hoof or a man on them, because, during the terrific drought now raging, it is found impossible to obtain the necessary 'provisions. We, sitting here in all the comforts of this city, find it very hard-eve n those of us who have gone through these droughts also find it hard-to visualize what is happening. I impress on the Government that, whatever may be the present state of omr finances, much depends, not only on the production which these men are responsible for under ordinary conditions, baton keeping up their hearts in order to induce them to carry on. Some of these men :are practically heartbroken, and are being forced to abandon their holdings, in certain instances for the first time, and so far as others are concerned, for the second time. They all say that while city people are in a position to lead pleasanter lives than ever, the man on the land is receiving less consideration than ever. Our great industries today are in a precarious position, and if the Government can do anything at alleven as much as to agree to this motion - to encourage producers to carry on, they will be performing signal service to the community generally. In the matter of wool, a great deal can be done, also, to encourage the struggling man out-back to carry on. I have now no complaint to make with respect to the agreement between this Government and the Imperial authorities. I Avas on the other side of the world when it was made. Had I been here, I would have had something to say about it. Even from the beginning it was apparent to one in possession of - practical knowledge and experience that there were too many loopholes in the arrangement. It is easy to speak after the event. It is simple enough to see now what should have been done then; but any .practical man in this House should have been able to point out where certain difficulties were bound to arise. No one in Australia has any idea today what we are going to get from the British Government. It is impossible to estimate more than very roughly the sum we are likely to receive as our share of the profits made by the Imperial authorities. In another place, a few days ago, an honourable senator went to considerable trouble to show that there should be a rebate to Australia amounting to between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000. I have approached the same matter from a different angle. I have worked up such figures. as are available, and my estimate is practically the same as that of the honourable senator. Men interested outside of political circles have also worked out estimates from - practical stand-point, and fhey, too, reckon that the rebate which we should get the Old Country is likely to be anything between £20,000,000 and £40,000,000. the Government can see their way clear to give an authoritative idea of how stand, and can furnish the man who grew the wool, and whose property, to a certain degree, it still is, with clear information respecting his dividends, much will Mr Fleming. been done to put new heart into those who are suffering today.",28
56,Mr STBWAKT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,But we cannot get any such information from the Government.,30
57,Mr FLEMING,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"It seems to me that the Government have been dealing too much with the ""Wool Board. If they appeal directly to the British Government they may not be supplied with actual figures, but surely the Imperial authorities will respond with something of a more or less satisfactory nature. They should know, within a few millions, where the Australian wool-grower stands. A statement which appeared in the papers during the past few days was most discouraging to those who have an interest in the Wool Pool. And these and other primary producers are the men who should not be faced with discouragement, but with practical sympathy, at this difficult stage. Their burdens are very heavy; their losses in the aggregate have been enormous. It will take them years to pull up again, under the best conditions. But if they are assured of a reasonable dividend from their wool, and if this Government will indicate - practical sympathy for primary producers in their administration, I am sure that the men on the land will carry on with those big hearts of theirs as they have done from the beginning. Unless brighter days are close ahead, the breaking point must come. There will be individual ruin and national financial depression.",30
58,Mr LAZZARINI,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,Werriwa) [3.27] I support the motion. It furnishes the most reasonable and fairest scheme of levying taxation upon the primary producer. It is almost too obvious to warrant argument that the proper means of assessing a producer's income would be to estimate upon a period covering a number of years.,30
59,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,Why not apply the a purely same principle to all of us?,30
60,Mr LAZZARINI,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Our incomes are from not so precarious from one year to the next as those of primary producers. If If I thought that the introduction of a system of taxation assessment based upon we this motion would have the effect of allowing individuals to escape their obligations, I would not support it. That, however, is not the idea, I feel sure. have Primary producers, particularly those engaged in wheat-growing or stock raising, may have the good fortune to make £3,000 in one year, but may lose £2,000 during the following year. For two or three years they may make no income at all. The assessment should be based upon a given number of years.",30
61,Mr CONSIDIITE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,That applies to mining speculation and stock exchange business as well.,31
62,Mr LAZZARINI,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The country can do well without that kind of thing, and I would readily support a motion for its abolition. We cannot do without the primary producer, however. A five-year term, as suggested in the motion, should be reasonable and workable. A man's losses and gains could be fairly assessed over that period. Producers would have a chance to level up between the good years and the 'bad. To recite an individual case which has come under my notice, a man residing in my constituency purchased some sheep during one year and made a profit of £300 or £400 upon them. This example may be in the nature of a speculation, but it is typical of the activities of many primary producers. The deal in question occurred during the war, and the individual had to pay, by way of war-timo profits taxation, between £20 and £40. During the following year he bought more sheep, but lost £200 or £300 on his deal. It is equitable that he should be allowed to deduct his losses of one year to balance his gains in the former period. I hope the motion will meet with the favour of the House.  say very little in regard to the motion, but what I shall .say will be in support of it. There can be no logical argument against the principle which it suggests and its adoption. It has been pointed out that a man may lose £2,000 on the operations of one year, and make £2,000 on the operations of the next year, and be taxed on the profits of the good year, without regard to the loss on the bad year. That was actually my case. In 1914, the farming partnership in which I am interested lost £2,000, and in 1915 it made £2,000. It was not taxed in 1914, but in 1915 it was taxed on £2,000, notwithstanding that for the previous two years no profit at all had been made. Any measure which filches revenue from producers and others in that way is boorish, and in no sense fair. On the operations of three years I made £1,000, but was taxed as if I had made £3,000. The suggestion of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) has been adopted in the taxation systems of most civilized countries. The honourable member cited an authority on the subject of taxation to show that the object should be to take a portion of the surplus from a man's revenue, leaving as much as possible with him, and to see that as much as possible of what he gave went into the Exchequer. To apply that principle in Australia we should eliminate one set of taxation officers and offices, and provide for the collection of Federal and State taxation by the one Department. I agree that the fairest method of calculation for the purposes of income taxation is to take the operations of five years as a basis. I am sorry that the motion is not more than, a mere affirmation of opinion. We should not continue to be taxed under the present arbitrary and unjust system.",31
63,Mr JACKSON,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Bass) [3.33] - I am a manufacturer, not a primary producer, and am interested, therefore, mainly in secondary industries. But I am in favour of the motion, because I do not think that any other industry is so dependent' for success on favourable weather conditions as is that of the primary producers. In my opinion, the motion should commend itself to honourable members.  [3.35] - I am in hearty accord with the views expressed by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay). Any one who looks round about him at the present time, particularly in New South Wales, must see the need for doing something in the nature of what he suggests. During the past six months I have travelled through a great deal of New South Wales, and have no hesitation in saying that that State is now suffering one of the worse droughts that has ever afflicted it. Furthermore, the season before this was a very bad one - There have now been practically three years of drought, and according to those who have made a study of weather conditions, all the indications make still another drought probable, though I hope that we may not have another drought. But if this next season is good, and farmers are able tc make a little out of their wheat or fruit ox other produce, it is reasonable that, in the assessment of their incomes, the losses of the preceding bad years should be allowed as a set-offI have figures here, which I shall reserve for another occasion, showing how great the loss of stock has been all over New South Wales; but if next season is a good one the Income Tax Department will make no allowance for those losses. The statistics show how, in the aggregate, the farmers have suffered' by bad seasons. The year 1914 was one of the worse that the country has experienced,' and the yield of - wheat in New South Wales in 1914-15 was only 1'2,S30,000 bushels. Next, year it was five times as much, namely, 66,764,000 bushels. But the Income Tax Department, in taxing on the returns for the good year, made no allowance for the losses on the bad year. Again, the wheat yield for 1917-18 was 37.712,000 bushels, and that of next year less than half as much, or 17,832,000 bushels. farmers when assessed for the next good year will have no allowance made for 191S-19, which was a bad year. _ I know of several persons in - South Wales and elsewhere who are - going out of wheat-growing, taking tc fruit-growing. But during last season thousands of pounds worth of fruit had to be allowed to rot because the housewives who usually turn their surplus fruit into jam could not get the necessary sugar. Next year sugar may be more plentiful, but the Income Tax Commissioner will show no consideration for the losses of last season. It is, 'however, unnecsssary to discuss this matter in detail. The broad equity of the proposal is so apparent that it requires no bolstering up. I claim to know a little of the suffering of the wool-growers, particularly in the drought-stricken areas of New South Wales, and when speaking on the Address-in-Reply I said that I would have no hesitation, were the matter left in my hands, about cancelling the contract between the Imperial authorities and Australia. The Minister remarked that that was a peculiar statement to make, and-that it would be a terrible thing to break the contract. There is plenty of evidence, however, that the Imperial authorities have already broken the contract in several respects. In some cases  they have allotted wool to the manufacturers at Is. per Tb. less than the price which it brought at auction. That, in my opinion, is a violation of the contract: Again, only the other day it was reported in the newspapers that the British Minister for Supplies had stated' that the contract had been broken by the Imperial authorities. There was not a written contract, but merely an - agreement made by means of various' cablegrams, and if the Imperial authorities can break it at their own sweet will, my suggestion that we should cancel it in the interests of the suffering primary producers of Australia was not an outrageous one. However, it received very little support, and I do not suppose that I would get much assistance were I to endeavour to do anything further in regard to the matter. I emphasize thp fact that the I m perial authorities have violated the agreement. _ I would not have suggested its cancellation had' it not been so disregarded by the Imperial Government. Yet the I am disgusted with the la,ck of information that is given in reply to questions placed on the notice-paper. I put a question to the Prime Minister today in New regard to the terms of the contract with - the Imperial Government, asking when and the dividend was'likely to be paid to our primary producers in respect of the half share of wool sales overseas, but the right houor.vble gentleman gave me no information in his reply. ^ Mr STEWART - The primary producers will be very disgusted when they hear his reply.  Prime Minister may treat the matter lightly, but there are hundreds of struggliug settlers who have been practically driven off the land as the result of one of the worse droughts from which Australia has suffered.",31
64,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,The Prime Minister has done everything that a man can do to obtain the information.  British Minister for Supplies tells us that the. information is now in the hands of the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee.,32
65,Sir JOSEPH COOIC,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The Government have not got it . It is useless blaming the Prime Minister for not giving information which he has not got.  Prime Minister might take steps to see whether there is any truth in the statement made by the British Minister. I know that it has always been hard to get any information out of the Central Wool Committee, and it behoves the Prime Minister to get it.",32
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"I have already told the honourable member as plainly as I could that the Prime Minister has taken every possible step to get the information.  possible step"" is very wide action, but the Prime Minister has not told us what steps he has taken. Has he cabled to Great Britain?",33
67,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Ye3 .  asked the Prime Minister whether he would undertake to ascertain the informaThe tion in a direct way, he did not tell that he had cabled.",33
68,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"I hope that the honourable member will take my word that the Prime Minister has done everything possible.  doubt the statement of the Minister for the Navy, but I would very much like to have heard it from the lips of the such statements. Prime Minister. If I did not press matter, I would be failing in my duty to those people who are most anxiously awaiting this information, and to whom the payment of the dividend is a serious matter. There are many men who. after two years of drought, will not be able to struggle along, and whom the next come tax assessment will not trouble very much, because by then they will have been forced off the land. I enter my protest against the policy of ""keep it dark"" as practised by the Central Wool Comit mittee and the Prime Minister, or whoGermany, ever is responsible, and I urge that every moans should be exercised to ascertain earliest date on which this dividend may be expected, and also what it is likely be. I would have no hesitation in cananxious celling the contract with the Imperial Government. It is all very well for Prime Minister to tell us that if he known at the time he made the contract as much as he knows today, he'would not have entered into it. As the I m perial authorities have broken the agreement, why should we regard it as somer thing which is sacrosanct, something that cannot be touched - somethin g that is too holy even to be mentioned. The Imperial authorities choose to break it whenever it suits them to do so, and I say that we ought to cancel it, so that our wool-growers may get the whole of the profits on their own wool. In any event, if that cannot be done, the primary producers of Australia are entitled to their half share of the immense profits made in Great Britain as the result of the re-sales of our wool overseas. They are certainly entitled to the fullest information that can be given to them by the Government in regard to a matter in whioh they are so vitally",33
69,Mr ATKINSON,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Wilmot) [3.50] honourable member for Hume (Mr. me Parker Moloney) is under a big misapprehension. I presume that, like .mauy other candidates at the recent election, he found it good fighting material to accuse the Government of having robbed the primary producers in the matter of wool, wheat, and other things, but had he been, here during the last Parliament he would have been better informed upon the subject, and would not have made The agreement for this the sale of the Australian wool clip to the British Government was made four or five years ago, when the war was raging, and no matter how it was arrived at, whether by cablegrams or otherwise, it was a fair and honourable contract, which it behoves Australia to inkeep. We 'had in Australia wool that the Imperial authorities required for the purpose of carrying on the war, but we had no ships in which to export it. Had it gone to America in American vessels, would probably have found its way to because at that stage America was not in the war. In the circumstances the OUT Government made the best possible arrangement for the disposal, of our wool, and as it turns out, a better arrangement to than the wool-growers of Australia were to accept. It is useless for the honourable member for Hume to accuse the the Government of being at fault. They had made an agreement, which was at the time a good agreement, and it cannot be cancelled just as we like. Great Britain - has our wool and our dividends, in fact it has everything, and if we cancelled the agreement, as the honourable member suggests, we would be in a worse position than we are, afc the present time. understand that the Home authorities have sold our wool under auction prices because it paid them to do so, but I am informed that the Commonwealth Government have done all they can to prevent a recurrence of this, and that it has now ceased. I suppose that our Treasurer (Mr Watt) is not likely to go to sleep on the matter when he is at Home. I presume that he will bring the Imperial authorities up to the scratch in regard to the production of a statement of accounts in reference to the wool that has been sold and the profits derived therefrom. I do not know whether the Central Wool Committee have the information for which the honourable member asks, but the Prime Minister has told us that he has not it , and I believe his statement, and that he has done all it is possible to do. I suppose that some day we shall learn what dividends Australia is to receive; no one will be more anxious than the Prime Minister to get the figures; but if the information is not vouchsafed by the Imperial authorities, of course he cannot give it to honourable members.",33
70,Mr JAMES PAGE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,What has all this to do with the motion before the House?,34
71,Mr ATKINSON,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The honourable member should have put that question to the honourable member for Hume (Mr. Parker Moloney), who raised the issue. I do not propose to take up any more time in discussing it . I am quite in accord with what the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) has done, and I heartily endorse all his arguments. If , for the purpose of income taxation, those who are engaged in a great permanent industry, such as primary production, cannot have all their affairs averaged over a period of three or five years, as the case may be, there is no set of people in the community who should. In Australia, especially on the mainland, the fluctuations of climate are so great that although a man may make a fair cheque on one year's operations, he may lose money for two or three succeeding years. If we want to have in Australia a virile and patriotic people we must have our land occupied in small areas. No country has a patriotic people if it does not have a good landed community. The settlement of .farmers and orchardists on small areas seems to attach them to their I country more than the pursuit of any other industry seems to do. The arguments put forward by the honourable member for Lilley are unanswerable. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion.",34
72,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Grampians) [3.56] I desire to support the motion of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), and I trust that-the House will have an opportunity of voting on it, because it is one of the most important questions that have ever been discussed here. The honourable member for Lilley has quoted from a great financial and economic authority in reference to the incidence and fairness of the income tax, and ever since that great writer wrote about the subject 150 years ago, it has been admitted that one of the fairest and most just taxes is that form of income tax which calls upon the citizens of a country to pay in proportion to the revenues they derive. But an income tax is only just and fair when it is paid upon income that is actual income. I want to draw a clear line of distinction between actual income and what is known as taxable income. It is unfortunate that what is known as taxable income is frequently based on valuations made upon live stock that are in existence at the end of one particular year, but which live stock may cease to exist before they can possibly be sold and paid for. This applies more particularly to farmers and graziers. Under the present system, where the income tax is levied on the income of each separate year no provision is made' for the years of losses. It is not possible for a farmer or grazier to carry on operations without meeting with years of losses, and frequently they are years of very serious losses. It is impossible to say how many - sheep are still alive in Now South Wales, despite the drought, at the present moment.",34
73,Mr LIVINGSTON,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,O r anywhere else in the Commonwealth.,34
74,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"O r anywhere else in the Commonwealth. There have been enormous losses of stock, not only in New South Wales, but in Queensland, during the last twelve months, and the whole history of farming and grazing in Australia is a history of years of losses alternating at irregular intervals with years of plenty. This is a subject in which I took an interest long before I had the honour to represent a constituency in this House. On 26th August, 1915, I addressed a letter to the editor of the Argus, in which I statedI have before me the balance-sheet and report of the Tyrell Downs Agricultural and Pastoral Company, which shows an actual loss of £6,354 3s. 5d. for the operations during 1914-15, and a special meeting of the shareholders was recently held to authorize the directors to obtain further advances to enable the company to carry on operations. I ""am"" assured that the experience quoted above is not at all exceptional. Indeed, there must be many thousands of farmers and graziers throughout Australia in the same parlous state. Some have lost much more and some less, but the same principle is involved right through. That company carried on both grazing and wheat-farming operations.",34
75,Mr RILEY,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,Every grazier at his death leaves an immense fortune.,35
76,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The press publish the details of estates of deceased graziers who have left large fortunes, but there are many who leave nothing.",35

78,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,That is so.,35
79,Mr RYAN,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,It might be said,35
80,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"I am glad ' to know that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), who is familiar the vicissitudes of the farming and grazing community of Queensland, is here to listen to my remarks. As the honourable memand  the newspapers do not publish details of net income amounted to £3,000. the losses of farmers and graziers, who have toiled early and late, have suffered hardships, and run all the risks of this most arduous and hazardous occupaper tion, and in the end have failed. On to £6,000. the average, I do not think those engaged in primary industries have done anything like as well as have those engaged i many manufacturing, trading, and occupations. We are not here, however, to make comparisons to the advantage or farmer disadvantage of any industry or occupation. Our object is to ask for justice to those engaged in every useful occupation. £222 13s. 2d. In my letter to the Argus, to which I just referred, I set out figures showing the enormous disadvantages under which farmers and graziers then laboured, in so far as income tax is concerned, as compared with practically all other members of the community. I took the case of a farmer and that of a merchant, each of whom, over a period of five years, had secured a net income of £8,000. In speaking of net income, I had in mind actual income, and not "" taxable in come,"" which is very often purely fictitious, although the primary producer is taxed upon it . It involves no stretch of the imagination to say that in two years out of five a farmer and grazier, instead of making money, will frequently lose very considerable sums. His position is very different from that of the merchant, whose income is not so much dependent upon the fluctuations of the seasons. In 1914-15, which was a very bad year, I estimated in this comparative statement that the farmer lost £4,000. That would not have been an excessive loss for a man engaged in producing meat, wool, and wheat in that year.",35
81,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"If he. lost £4,000, what was his capital when he started operations 1",35
82,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"He probably started at with a certain amount of capital, which he lost, but was able to continue by means of his credit. If it were not for the credit which the primary producers so rightly enjoy, Australia would not be in the happy position she occupies today. with To return to my comparison, which I have brought up to date, the farmer in 1914-15, I have assumed, lost £4,000, in 1915-16 he made a loss of £1,000. In 1916-17, he had a good year, and his In 1917-18 he had another time of prosperity, and his net income amounted to £4,000, while in 1918-19 he had a "" bum"" year, and his net income amounted In respect of his income for 1916-17, although he had lost heavily during the two preceding years, he would n be taxed at a higher rate than the merother chant, who has averaged the same net income of £1600 a year as the has done. The farmer would pay income tax at the rate of Is. 5§d. in the £ 1 , amounting to On his income of £4,000 have in ,1917-lS he would pay income tax at the rate of 2s. 5 i d . in the £ 1 ; representing £487 10s., while in respect of his income of £6,000 in 1918-19 he would he taxed at the rate of 3s. 5£d. in the £1, and would pay £1,035 18s. 9d. Thus in respect of his total income of £S,000 in five years, this primary producer would pay income tax amounting to £1,746 Is. lid - Let us see now what the merchant would pay in respect of a similar income spread - over a five years' period. not a word to say against the merchants or those engaged in many other delightful and fairly remunerative occupations in our big cities. I give these figures only to illustrate the exceedingly method by which primary producers are taxed. In respect to the merchant, I assume that in 1914-15 his net income amounted to £1,300, on wEich, at Sd. in the £1, he would pay income tax amounting to £42 13s. id.' For 1915-16 his income was £1,900, and the tax had been increased by 25 per cent. He also paid a higher rate upon £1,900 than he did upon £1,300. His tax therefore was at the rate of Is. 0 3-5d., amounting to £100 3s. lOd. In 1916-17 his income was £1,600, upon which he would be taxed at the rate of in the £1, and pay £75. In 1917-18, when the higher rate came into operation, he earned £1,300, and paid income tax at the rate of Is. id. in the £1, amounting to £69 6s. 4d. In 1918-19 his net income was £1,900, and on this he would pay income tax at the Tate of Is. 4^d. in the £1, amounting to £130 5s. Thus in respect of his income of £S,000 earned over a period of 'five years he would pay income tax amounting to only £417 Ss. 3d., as against £1,746 Is. lid. paid by the primary producer in respect of the same net income earned during the same period. These figures are absolutely accurate, and may, I am satisfied, be confirmed on reference to the Income Tax Commissioners. They show that the primary producer under the present system actually pays four times as much income tax as a, typical merchant would have to pay in respect to the same amount of net income. The representative, Federal Governments and many others have suggested all sorts of palliatives to meet this difficulty, but the only solution calculated to give equal justice to the primary producer and every other citizen is that of average income tax which I have the greatest pleasure in supporting. Mr Jowett. Sir"" JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [4.14] - I do not propose to place any obstacle in the way of a vote on this motion, which I recognise is of great importance. It goes to the very root of some of those problems that profoundly affect the welfare of this country. Ever since I have been in Parliament-and my political career now exI have tends over thirty years- I have always stood - foT the man on the land, and although I represent a city constituency, I shall still continue to stand for him. Whether or not we recognise unfair the - fact, the whole industrial and social pyramid is based upon the land of the country, and anything which interferes with the prosperity of ""the primary producers and acts unfairly and prejudicially to them profoundly affects the whole body politic and the economic superstructure which is reared upon the land. Therefore, in an assembly such as this we should adopt a sympathetic attitude towards these very terrible and agonizing problems, which are calculated to break the heart of any ordinary man. I refer, of course, to the devastating lljd. drought. In regard to them, there should be only one attitude on the part of any Government, and that is an attitude of profound sympathy. As to the particular form in which relief should be given to the primary producer, opinions vary greatly. There are very real departmental objections to the proposal. MT. JAMES PAGE - We shall always find them.",35
83,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"I know that, but one must not imagine that the Department is out merely to rook people.",36
84,Mr JAMES PAGE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,Does the Minister think it fair to make the man on the land pay four times as much taxation on the same amount of income as is paid by a man engaged' in manufacturing?,36
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,I do not.,36
86,Mr GIBSON,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,If there are only departmental objections in the way they can be easily overcome.,36
87,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Not so easily as the honourable member thinks. There are difficulties inherent in the proposal itself. If it were adopted, the taxpayer with a diminishing income would be hard h it by this proposal for averaging incomes, because he would be required to pay taxaproducers tion on income he had not received year for which the taxation was paid.",36
88,Mr JAMES PAGE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The Treasurer started well, but he is now spoiling his speech.",37
89,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"That is not intention, but we should at least look the facts. If a man's income is diminishthey ing, he will have to pay taxation on income which he has not received in the period for which he is taxed. ",37

91,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"He may in some cases, but not in all. On the hand, if the income is constantly ascendence ing over the five years, the revenue w i suffer, and the taxpayer will not pay much taxation as he should. propositions are unassailable. the remedy ? The problem is complex, and not easy of solution. other aspects must be considered. Where, for instance, are we to draw the line between primary and secondary industries? - The latter incur losses as well as the primar y industries.",37
92,Mr HILL,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,Secondar y industries are not dependent upon the elements.,37
93,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"But they are dependent upon other circumstances which affect them adversely. Is the prinunderstand ciple contained in this motion to be plied all through the area of taxation? If so, it will mean a serious diminution in the revenue derivable from this source, and that, as honourable members will see, having regard to our obligations, will simply mean that we shall probably have to put on the same shoulders i some other form the same burden of taxation. Therefore, the adoption this proposal will leave us still with problems to face. Whatever happens i regard to income tax, or any other i m post, the total amount of taxation which the Government must raise cannot be ceiving the Government's attention. diminished. I say that view of the tremendous obligations to be met.",37
94,Mr CONSIDIXE,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Giv e the primary your sympathy, and tell them in the they will get nothing.",37
95,Mr HILL,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"We are not seeking a reActing duction, but a re-adjustment of taxation.",37
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"I am sure that the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . my Considine) would give the primary proat ducers his sympathy, and anything else wanted; but I am sorry that I . as the Acting Treasurer, cannot do that. I am pointing out the obstacles which I see in the way-the revenue requirements, the difficulty of making the tax equal, fair , and just-this proposal hardly does'that - and the difficulty in relation to other industries which by parity of reasoning will require consideration also if the equalize the scheme be adopted.",37
97,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Othe r industries are not liable to the same fluctuations. Sir JOSEP H COOK - I am not sugother gesting that they are; but in my experiof Government, people have a knack l l of saying, "" You have done this for Soas and-so, you must do it for me."" The Those two. fundamental principle, indeed, the conWhat is stitutional requirement in connection with anything the Government do, is that we Moreover, shall treat all taxpayers fairly and equally, as far as we possibly can.",37
98,Mr JOWETT,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,I quite agree with that.,37
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"The Government are full y alive to the grave importance of this matter, and, although I am searching the question in this way in order to point out that it is not free of difficulty, and that the proposal contained in the motion will not exactly solve it , I yet ask honourable members to that the Government are conapcerned in regard to this matter, and are seeking to find a way out. We have already made a prqposal for a full inquiry into the question. In the Governor General's Speech, we set out that it was our intention to appoint, at an early date, a Royal n Commission to consider the whole incidence of Commonwealth taxation. A l of ready a commission for that purpose has some been drafted, from which I shall read a n few lines to indicate to honourable mem- bers that, as far back as last month, the very matter they are discussing was reI advisedly, in find these wordsto place the burden of taxation equally upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it-.

I make that quotation merely to show that the Government have not been asleep in regard to this matter, but are seriously considering the whole question. I have no objection to honourable members .taking a vote upon the motion; but I should prefer that they did not, on the distinct promise I make to them that this inquiry will be commenced almost immediately-as soon as it can be set in motion, and that the whole question will be taken into the fullest consideration.  be assisted by a vote upon this motion. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , Let us have a vote.",37
100,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"May I congratulate 'honourable members opposite on the new-found sympathy they display for the great producing interests of this country? Apparently, the whole House is in agreement. Why, therefore, do we need a vote ? What does a vote matter when the House is unanimous?",38
101,Mr BELL,TAXATION OF PRIMARY,"Darwin) [ 4 . 2 8 ] - I prepared some material for a speech which I thought would as'st the House in arriving at the conclusion that the stitution. primary producers, 'especially the dairy farmers, are unfairly taxed. Bu view of the sympathy with which the motion has been received, it is not necessystem, sary for me to speak at length. merely express my pleasure at the symhonorable pathy which has been extended by honPage) orable members, and by the Acting Treadivided surer (Sir Joseph Cook); but I remind the right honourable gentleman that an ounce of help is worth a ton of sympathy. A lot of sympathy has been expressed for us in the past, but we have had no help in the form of relief for the primary producer from the burden of taxation. In many instances he is taxed three times as much in proportion to his come as is a person engaged in any other industry. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA CONSTITUTION. ELECTION OF. CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. Debate resumed from 15th A p r i l (vide page 1247), on motion by Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN1. That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that as early as practicable a Constitutional Convention should be summoned for the purpose of considering the need, substance, and form of any amendment of section 51 of the Constitution, and that such Convention shall- r (a) consist of ten (10) representatives of each State, elected on the existing Federal franchise, according to the principle of proportional representation ; (6) hold meetings at such times and places as it may think fit; (c) submit within twelve months to the Governor General the draft of any amendments adopted by such Convention. 2. That any such amendments so adopted hear ! shall be a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution, and shall be dealt with in accordance with section 128 of the Constitution for passage by Parliament and submission to the electors. 3. That an Enabling Bill to give effect to the foregoing should be introduced to Parliament as early as practicable.",38
102,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Parkes) [4.29] - It is pleasing to note that members of all parties in the House have indicated, by the sentiments they have expressed in had side and outside the House, that they favour the appointment of a Convention to deal with the amendment of the ConThe honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) t in suggests that the Convention should be elected on the proportional representation in regard to which many things I can be said both for and against. The member for Cowper (Dr Earle suggests that the States shall be into areas, each of which shall return two members. In the case of New South Wales, for instance, the idea is that the State shall be divided into five areas with a view to insuring that all in terests are represented. I agree with the honourable member that it is necessary to have all interests represented in the Convention, but I do not approve of dividing the States in this way. The war has intaught the Australian people one lesson at least; it has taught them to think on Australian, and not merely on State lines. The soldiers who fought and worked for Australia dropped their State and parochial sentiments; and it i6 very rare indeed to find a soldier who does not describe himself as an Australian, and not as the resident of any particular State. I am sure that if the people, as a whole, be given the opportunity, they are sufficiently broad minded to insure in the election of members for the proposed Convention that all interets are adequately represented. I only hope that sufficient time will be given to all candidates for membership to place tlieir views before all classes of people in the State, including those people who live in the out-back districts. There is no reason in the world why the members of this House, representing, as they do, labour interests, primary producing interests, national interests, and so forth, should not combine in order to insure that no interests are left unrepresented. Of course, I know that there is such a thing as party feeling in the House, but, on a question of such importance as this, some arrangement of the kind might well be arrived at. I do not speak as a lawyer, but, in my opinion, we in Australia are living under the best and freest Constitution in the world.",38
103,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,How many Constitutions has the honourable member studied ?,39
104,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"As I say, I am not a lawyer, but I have studied a few; and I am decidedly of opinion that we should not tinker or play with our Constitution. If members of the House would discuss the question here in a non-party spirit, before an appeal to the country is made on the subject, there is no reason why they should not arrive at an amicable agreement as to the proposals to be placed before the people. I am quite with the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) in thinking that each State should have ten representatives, regardless of size or population.  framed on that basis.",39
105,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That is so. According to the electoral returns, I do not think that Tasmania and Western Australia are at present quite entitled to five members in this House",39
106,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"In the case of Western Australia, the figures just about qualify the State for five members.",39
107,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I am not saying that I would be in favour of decreasing the present representation of those States, but merely wish to suggest that if, as has been advocated, New South Wales were divided into ten new States, the right of each of these new States to five members could not well be denied, especially in view of the fact that the population of New South Wales is about ten times that of Tasmania.",39
108,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The electors in the honourable member's constituency, and in my own constituency, just about equal the total number of electors in Tasmania.",39
109,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Ver y likely; but I think that if new States were created it would be advisable to give them the same representation that is given to existing States. This would mean thirty-six senators for New South Wales, and fifty members of the House of Representatives. We are all agreed that a Convention on the Constitution is necessary.",39
110,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Why ? Why does this Parliament not do its work?,39
111,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I take it from the interjection that this Parliament is prepared to do its work, and I think that this is the proper place in which to discuss the question. My only regret is that we cannot devote more time to its discussion now.",39
112,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,A Bill to create a Convention will be introduced.,39
113,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Unde r the circumstances it might be advisable to defer the discussion until that Bill is before us. It has been suggested by some one that some of the State Parliaments should have the right to nominate members for the Convention. With that idea I do not agree, for I am in favour of the election of the candidates remaining solely in the hands of the people.",39
114,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,You regard the people as above Parliament?,39
115,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Yes ; they are the maswas ters of the situation.,39
116,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Only for a little while \,39
117,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,For one day every three years!,39
118,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"At any rate, I am in favour of the people electing the whole nf the representatives to the Convention. I am not a Unificationist, but I think that the Commonwealth ought to be given extended powers. At present, it is quite evident that there are powers which we do not now possess, but which we ought to be able to exercise. In my view it is infra dig. that the Prime Minister of Australia should have to go to the Premiers of the various States and ask for the concession of powers to the Commonwealth.. For instance, within the last week I have heard that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to pass a company law; and surely that is a matter which ought to lie with the National Parliament ?",39
119,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The honourable member must first convert the State Parliaments to that view.,40
120,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"After all, the State Parliaments,, in my view, represent the parochial spirit which we desire to ""wipe out""; we ought to think imperially as Australians. Then, again, in regard to the arbitration laws, we find that, although the cost of living does not differ materially throughout the States, there are different awards for identical trades. In New South Wales the standard living wage has been set at £3 17s. 6d., which employers are compelled to pay. In the boot trade, for instance, employers must gay that minimum wage in New South Wales, and manufacturers in other States, who work under lower awards, are able to undersell them.",40
121,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I think there is a Commonwealth award in the boot industry, and that at least half of the skilled tives are paid more than the awarded wage.",40
122,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I grant I may have given a wrong illustration, but there is no reason why industries should not be brought under Commonwealth awards, making special provisions, of course, for men employed in the Northern Territory, Northern Queensland, and other tropical districts. As a sequel to the carrying of this motion, it will be necessary to hold an election. I do not think any honourable member desires to enter upon an election campaign in the near future.",40
123,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,We want to get rid of you.,40
124,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"As a matter of fact, it would be to our advantage to go to the electors, and be sent back here again.",40
125,Mr WATKINS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,That infers that the honourable member is discovering that this is a National Parliament without national power.,40
126,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That is so; but it is far better to bring about reform by evolution than by revolution. Judging from our experience with the Constitution during the past twenty years, we should admit that we do not possess powers in certain directions such as a National Parliament should have. Several matters which I have in mind should be solely in the control of the Commonwealth authorities. Take, for example, the absurdity of requiring citizens to furnish dual taxation returns. Is there anything more foolish than to make the public send in separate State and Federal returns!",40
127,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Is it not more foolish that 5,000,000 people should be ruled by fourteen legislatures?",40
128,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"It is. It does appear to me that some of the powers possessed by State Parliaments today should be in the possession of the National legislature. We do not want an election, however, just now. Outside of Parliament, honourable members who may protest against that sentiment from their seats in this chamber, will agree that elections are no good. If it could be possible to extend the life of this House for a term offive years, instead of .three, I would be pre-, pared to agree to such .a change in our Constitution.",40
129,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OF TH E,We do not want to operasee your Government in power for five years.,40
130,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"As a matter of fact, it is probably in the best interests of Australia that there should be occasional changes of administration.",40
131,Mr WATKINS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,What the people of Australia want is one Parliament for Australia.,40
132,Mr MARR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"On e Parliament for Australia, with some bodies-say , county councils-woul d provide a far better administrative system than exists today with the State and Federal Parliaments. This is a most important question, and to dispose of it after a comparatively few minutes' debate is not seemly. Considerable time should be devoted to its consideration. I trust that a vote will not be taken at this juncture, but that the Government will shortly provide an opportunity for honourable members to thresh the whole matter out, and so make way for the introduction of a Bill proposing a Convention such as will meet the wishes of the whole community.",40
133,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Dalley) [4.52] - The question of the alteration of the Constitution is among the most important today. The development of Australia has been seriously hampered because of the restrictions contained in our Constitution. If it is the desire of this Parliament to allow Australia to expand as it should, it will be necessary for us to take immediate steps to amend the Constitution in order to provide proper scope for development. It is the duty of all parties in public life to take the earliest opportunity to place before the people their platforms and ideals concerning Constitution amendment. The mere calling together of a Convention and throwing the Constitution to it. as one would throw a bone to a dog, will merely bring about party strife. Our Constitution will become the plaything of parties. Its amendment is too big a question to be so treated. We want to do the best thing possible for Australia. This country should be given the fullest opportunity to develop along proper lines. Honourable members on this side have realized the importance of that fact for a considerable time, and at our party's In ter-State Conventions, which are representative of the whole of the great Labour movement, the subject has been seriouslyconsidered from every angle. As an outcome, we have placed before the public our platform in regard to the amendment of the Constitution. I think it will do a vast amount of good if the details of that - platform are placed on record, and I will therefore proceed to read them. If honourable members really understood the Labour proposals, I am confident that numbers of them would give us their support. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat, for example, in a groping manner admitted the truth of the very point we stand for, when he spoke of county councils taking the place of present-day State Legislatures. We choose to call them provincial Legislatures, however. If that section of the House which chooses to call itself the Country party would study the Labour proposals, its adherents in this chamber would find that we stand for the very thing they themselves advocate; that is, decentralization of administration. While Australia is suffering from the pernicious [62] system, of centralization today, against which country members are crying out, these latter gentlemen have not yet, apparently, studied our proposals. To enable them to do so, I shall furnish for the Hansard record the official proposals of the Australian Labour movement in reference to the amendment of the Constitution. I should say, first, that we do not propose to call a convention at all. We base our objection to that procedure upon two grounds. Primarily, there is the matter of the enormous cost of plunging Australia so soon after a general election into the turmoil of what would undoubtedly become a party political fight. Our second ground of objection is that we say, "" Here is a Parliament just elected by the people. Surely the Government of the day should take the responsibility for setting out what they stand for. Dp they stand for wide powers being held by the Commonwealth, or for the narrowing of the Federal scope?"" The moment in which the Australian Labour party regains possession of the Federal Treasury benches we shall take steps to put our ideals into operation. We intend immediately to submit to the people a referendum asking for the powers indicated in our manifesto for the amendment of the Constitution. Our proposals ar6 theseThe Labour party propose, when returned to power in the Federal Parliament, to submit to the electors, at the earliest possible opportunity, a referendum to alter the Commonwealth Constitution, to provide full sovereign powers under its Constitution, and to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to create any number of Provincial Legislatures as may be necessary for the good local government of the people. The proposal provides:- ' The Commonwealth Constitution to be amended to provide full sovereign powira for the good government of the people. The amended Constitution to also include:(a) Provision for the Initiative Referendum whereby the electors may initiate or recall legislation, No referendum to be put to the people within six months (before or after) of a general election. (b) The High Court to be the final Court of Appeal in any Australian cause. (c) The Senate to be abolished, and the House of Representatives to consist of 100 members; each electorate to have as near as possible an equal number of electors. (d) Adult franchise to be made part of the Constitution. It is certainly necessary to embody the Constitution, so that it may for time be preserved to the people of tralia, the adult franchise which they now enjoy(e) The Commonwealth Parliament to vested with authority to create any number of provinces as may necessary for the good local governlate ment of the people. PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES, ETC. The Commonwealth shall grant to each pronational questions. vince a uniform written Constitution, setting out the powers and duties of the Legislatures thereof. Such Constitution may be amended from time to time as may be required. Each province shall be governed by a Legispresent lature to be composed of a reasonable number of members.

MUNICIPALITIES. The Commonwealth Parliament shall grant a uniform Constitution to provide for muniand cipal government, the supervision of administion tration to be the duty of the provinces. In order that the electors of Australia may know what form of local government it is intended to substitute for State Parliaments, i is suggested that the Commonwealth should be divided into thirty-one provinces, the bounof latitude. daries of which are shown on the attached 17,043. plan. The boundaries of the proposed divisions are shown on a map which I should like tralia, to have reproduced in Mansard were that possible. It is to be remembered that the Labour movement does not bind itself hard and fast to its proposals the number of provinces and their bountralia, daries. Those proposals are put forward merely as a basis for discussion. each of the large capital cities is allotted a province, and, so far as possible, the other provinces have been arranged to tions give community of interests. They be agricultural, dairying, or pastoral, in the main. Broadly, the scheme There shall be one central and supreme cluding authority, the Federal Parliament, Mr Mahomj. in will consist of one House, to be known all as the House of Representatives, conAustaining 100 members, the Senate being abolished. It will deal with the big problems with which Australia must deal as a nation. To thirty-one provincial be Legislatures would be given a written be Constitution, empowering them to legisfor the good government of their provinces in matters of local importance, but .not falling within the category of Below them, again, would come the municipal councils.

136,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Would such a body be similar to a County Council in the United Kingdom?,43
137,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"It would be much upon the same lines. We do not stand hard and fast to all the details of our proposal, but these are the principles we have laid down for the purpose of doing away with the fictitious boundaries that now exist between one Australian State and another, and which we say should be wiped out, so that Australia may, for the purpose of local government, be divided in accordance with proper community of interests, having due regard for local conditions. In this way we would at once get rid of the great trouble of centralization that now exists. Our platform provides for the very thing for which the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) is fighting-the creation of other States. Of course it would not give him just everything he wants in this particular direction, but the principle for which he is fighting would be achieved, namely, decentralization and local administration of local affairs. am sure that if the honourable member Oowper and others would consider our proposals they would support them.",43

The Federal control of railcan ways would do more to develop Australia than can anything else, because immedipower ate steps would be taken to bring about a uniform gauge throughout Australia. When this is done the people of Australia will have cause to be exceedinglv thankpower ful. The suggestion is that these provinces shall be governed by from ten to fifteen members in provinces of less than 100,000 electors, from fifteen to twenty I members in provinces of 100,000 to for 200,000 electors, and probably twenty-five members in the Greater Melbourne province, and thirty in the Greater to Sydney province, with its 540,000 electors. The total number of proof vincial legislators would not exceed 400, as against .575 members of existing Parliaments. In that respect there by would be an immediate saving to the people of Australia. I put forward the proposals of the Australian Labour party in this regard for the serious consideraof the tion of representative men.",44
146,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,How are you going to bring it all about?,44
147,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"After the next appeal to 'the people at a general election, members of the Australian Labour party will have possession of the Treasury bench, and one of the first measures inin troduced will be a Bill to enable a referendum to be taken to amend the Coninstitution on these lines. Let me read in the this from our platformThe powers and duties of provincial legislatures will be fully defined when the referendum asking the"" electors to agree to the Constitution alteration is being put to the The proposal will be debated' in Parliament in detail, and when the matter is the before the people they will be given opportunity of saying whether the system of government shall 'be maintained, or whether it shall be substituted by a system which is flexible aud easy of application to the national needs of Australia, and also to the the local requirements. A great object lesson can be drawn by study of the existing written Constitutions of the English-speaking peoples of of which Australia is the third. America suffers exactlv as Australia suffers, owing to the fact that the local authority is the central authority. The AmeriConstitution gives the supreme power to the local authority, and restricts the of what should be the supreme body, namely, the national legislature. In Canada the position is reversed. The central authority has supreme over the local body. The difference between the American and Australian Constitutions, and the more recently drafted South African Constitution, i« that, while the former cannot be altered hy the national Parliament, the central legislature in South Africa , which is not a. Federation but a Unification, can bring About any alterations it deems necessary. It is impossible for us to alter our Constitution, but South A f r i c a , having the advantage of profiting by the errors made by America and Australia, was able to Avoid the disabilities under which we suffer. Its Constitution is flexible - When the elected representatives of the people find that they are hampered by its limitations, when they deem that . it does not give them power to do what they consider it is necessary to do in the development of the country, they can alter it . In my opinion, the Australian Federal Parliament should have the same power. Who should 'be the greatest authority in the land but the elected representatives of the people, provided, of course, that they are chosen upon adult suffrage ? I do not stand Tor the placing of the dead hand of the past upon the advancement of a country or its people. The people should be prepared to lift from Australia the dead hand of the past. We have a written Constitution which is t y in g us down and hampering us in every direction. It says in effect, "" Thus far shaft thou go and' no f u r the r . "" ' If the - people of Australia desire to go beyond the scope of the present Constitution, this Parliament should have power to remove the difficulties in the way, and to give the people an opportunity to develop along the lines which they think best for themselves. We all know that as a result of the war, old .preconceived ideas and notions are, so to speak, being tossed into the melting-pot as rapidly as possible. The country that desires to exist and develojp must be prepared to conform to the newer ideals that are coming into being today. We have so to mould our constitutional powers as to bring them more nearly into conformity with the desires of the people. We must give the people an opportunity to achieve in a constitutional and proper way the objects they have in view. We cannot overlook the danger that confronts us. It is obvious to every thoughtful man. Throughout the world the great mass of the people are not content with the old state of affairs. They are shaking off the chains of the past. They are determined to have something better. Block the advancement of these people by the dead Jiand of the Constitution, and they will take other than constitutional means to secure what they desire. The world today is almost a seething mass of revolt against the old order of things, the old state of society. What are we in Australia going to do ? Are we to shut our eyes and leave the people to grope their way out of the difficulty as best they may ? Is it not better that we should give them an opportunity to carry out what they desire in a sane, orderly, and constitutional way? Should we not guide their steps along safe roads ? Every thoughtful man who desires the advancement of his country, and' is anxious that we should have a better state of society than we have had, will recognise that that is the course for us to pursue. These are the lines upon which we should work, and I therefore advocate the amendment of the Constitution.",44
148,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Does the Labour party propose that the Commonwealth should take over the State debts?,45
149,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Yes , . that is contained in our programme. We propose that the Commonwealth shall take over all present State debts, and that it should, as far as possible, collect all revenue, thus obviating the expense of duplication in the collection of taxes. I shall not weary the House any longer. I have put forward the programme of the great Labour movement composed of the toiling men and women, who, after all , make a nation. The representatives of the toilers have given serious consideration to this question. We put forward this programme, realizing our responsibility to the people, and prepared to shoulder it . We ""are not going to shirk any of our responsibilities, and we say that the Government of the clay should shoulder their responsibility instead of proposing to hand over the work of amending the Constitution to some outside elective body. If we are to have an elected Convention, shall we not all be candidates ? Who are better fitted' than are members of Parliament for the work of the Convention? And' who would have a better chance of election ? Those who hold the confidence of the people today are likely to enjoy the confidence of the people when the time comes for the election of the Convention. The Government should not shirk their responsibility. If they believe in an Australian Constitution for Australian men and women they will submit to Parliament the necessary measure, and give honourable members an opportunity to take a direct vote upon it .",45
150,Mr MARRS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Wentworth) [5.38] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) should have the thanks of the House for bringing forward this motion, and thus giving honourable members an opportunity for what I might describe as a preliminary canter on the question of the amendment of the Constitution. I speak of this as being only a preliminary canter, since the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has mentioned that the Government intend to bring down a Bill for the creation of a Convention to consider amendments of the Constitution. I would prefer io reserve any observations I have to make on the subject until that Bill is before the House; but as honourable members are giving expression to their general views on the question, I should like also to place mine on record. The Prime Minister stated that it was the desire of the Government to obtain a free expression of opinion on the subject. gratulate the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) upon his very able speech. He mentioned many matters in respect of which I am in agreement with him, but, the programme of his party goes so far that I do not think it could possibly be carried in to to. The proposed amendment of the Constitution should not bo limited, as the motion provides, to section 51. Other sections also need to be amended. The Constitution has stood the test of time, and has stood ib well, but as the Prime Minister said recently, it has out-grown itself, and must be widened. On that point I think we are all in agreement. It needs to be so amended as to enable us to avoid duplication of taxation and of services. lacks also provisions in regard to the electoral rolls and the power which we should have to deal with companies. Victoria has somewhat efficient company laws, but those of New South Wales are quite impossible. It is time the Commonwealth had power to take in hand company legislation and to widen our company laws. As the Prime Minister has reminded us, by far the greater part of the business of the Commonwealth is carried on by companies, and the Commonwealth Parliament should be able to determine the laws under which they shall operate. I agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), that the Convention, if it is not to be a failure, must have the confidence of the people, and we can secure a Convention in which the people will have confidence only upon an elective basis. The people should be able to elect the members of the Convention. We should have in tihe Convention all great leadersthe leading men in the Federal and State Parliaments, and the leaders of the in dustrial world. We should have in the Convention the recognised leaders of the Labour party, as well as lawyers and representatives of capital, scientists, accountants, and so forth, so that the amendments proposed by the Convention will have every chance of being accepted by the people. When travelling abroad, one is struck by the fact that the further one gets away from this great continent, the less one hears of the individual States, and the more one hears of Australia. ' The change of view responsible for this maniI con- fested itself also in the "" diggers "" ; they recemented that outlook. When they went overseas to fight, they spoke not of the individual States, but of Australia. I do not say that the State - Parliaments should be done away with, but the Commonwealth Parliament certainly ought to have greater power to promote the well-being of the whole Commonwealth, and, indirectly, to help the States. In foreign countries, the people know practically nothing of the individual States; it is of "" Australia "" that they . speak. The Commonwealth Parliament has not sufficient power to properly carry out what should be its duties. I should like the States to give the Commonwealth an It opportunity to secure those wider powers which are essential to it . We look to the Convention to suggest amendments of the Constitution, which, while increasing the powers of the Commonwealth, will not wholly obliterate the State Parliaments. I think there is every chance of the recommendations of the Convention being ratified by the people if the Convention itself does not ask for too much. Throughout the world, extraordinary things have happened since the war. There have been remarkable happenings, for instance, in respect of the drink traffic in the United States. I was through America three times during the war. It was then "" wet,"" and I found it one of the hardest-drinking countries I had ever visited. Cocktails were the rule, morning, noon, and night, with wine, in addition, for dinner. And yet that country, composed of forty-eight States, has gone "" dry "" on a two-thirds vote of the States. That is something which a visitor to the States a few years ago would have been prepared to say would never be carried into effect. Changes like these give us hope that whatever the Convention ""wisely puts before the people for ratification will be accepted. The question should not be fought in a party spirit. It is a national matter, vitally affecting the existence and progress of this country; and if the brains of the Opposition will co-operate with the brains on this side of the House, I am convinced that we shall be able to secure the Convention we want, and obtain for the Commonwealth Parliament the extension of powers of which it stands so much in need.",46
151,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"""Wide Bay) [5.45] - The alteration of the Constitution is one of the most important matters that this House could deal with; therefore no suggested alteration should be put before the country in a half-hearted way. In many districts I have heard the explanation given that the .last referenda proposals were defeated simply because the people did not understand them. The issues had not been sufficiently explained to the people before they were called upon to vote. As representatives of the people, it is our duty to thoroughly discuss and decide upon any scheme of constitutional amendment before it is put before the electors. The matter should be discussed not only in Cabinet but on the floor of the House and on non-party lines, so that every honourable member may have an opportunity to express his opinion upon any scheme submitted by the Government. When Parliament has come to a decision the people throughout the Commonwealth should be made aware through the press and Hansard of the considerations upon which our recommendations were based. If that course were pursued, the electors would consider the issues seriously, and ceme to a proper judgment. I listened attentively to the remarks the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) regarding the policy of constitutional alteration that will be attempted if the Labour party come into power. The scheme enunciated by the honourable member means clearly the abolition of State Parliaments and robbing the far-distant States of the right, which they greatly prize, of framing their own legislation in domestic affairs and building and controlling their own railway lines. I particularly asked by interjection whether under that 'scheme the States would be deprived of the right to build railways, and the honourable member replied that the Commonwealth Government would construct all railways. That may be a good idea from the point of view of people who live in Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide, but it is diametrically opposed to the best interests of the more distant States. It is essential that they should be allowed opportunities to work out their own destiny. What chance would Queensland and Western Australia have of developing their great territories if they were compelled to adopt the same railway policy as is suited to a small State like Victoria? Consider the question of railway gauges, for instance. I speak with a most intimate knowledge of the railway construction policy of Queensland, and I recollect that we had to decide whether we should build expensive railway lines on the 'broad gauge or adopt a policy of cheap narrow-gauge lines, so that we could, with their aid, develop a greater portion of the 429,000,000 acres comprised in that State.",47
152,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The Queensland railways arc only tramways.,47
153,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"At any rate they have proved very useful for the work foT which they were intended. Queensland could not have constructed anything approaching as great a length of railway had it adopted an expensive system such as that in Victoria. To-day Queensland has, I think, about 1,000 miles of railway more than has any other State in the Commonwealth; we could not have had that mileage if we had adopted the expensive broad-gauge system. Only a few years ago a discussion arose in Queensland regarding the linking up of the lines that run from the various ports, and makof ing available'for closer settlement a larger tract of country. In reply to a question I asked in the Queensland Parliament at that time, I was told that 137,000,000 acres of land in that State was untenanted. In order to encourage closer settlement, the Queensland Government declined to renew large pastoral leases that had expired, but made available for the late tenants land further in the interior at the same time extending our railways, thus utilizing portion of the 137,000,000 acres of untenanted country. The old stations were divided into grazing farms of 25,000 or 30,000 acres each. By that means more country was settled, and more produce was made available to be carried by the existing railways. We could not have afforded to do that except by means of a narrow-gauge railway system. New and large States like Queensland and Western Australia must continue the narrow-gauge system, otherwise great areas of their laud will remain untenanted for a long time. The people of Queensland are absolutely averse to centralization. We had before us the evil of centralization in New South Wales. The unfortunate primary producers in the west of that State are required to send their produce 350 to 400 miles further than they need have done had not the State gone in for a policy of centralization in connection with railway construction. Queensland, on the other hand, resolved upon a policy of developing the ports along the northern coast, and building lines thence into the hinterland. That has been done successfully, and today the people are reaping the benefit. Therefore, it is easy to understand that the people in Queensland and Western Australia, having before them the example of other States, are opposed to centralization. They are opposed also to Unification. They believe in controlling their own destinies in all domestic affairs.",47
154,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Where does the honourable member draw the line of demarcation between Unification and the right of a State to mind its own affairs ?,48
155,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The line of demarcation - was fixed 'before Federation commenced, and I do not go back upon anything that was done then. I am quite prepared to give the Commonwealth greater power, but I am opposed to the abolition of State Parliaments. I believe that we can control the affairs of this great continent far better if we continue the present system of allowing the State© to legislate in respect to their own internal affairs. Australia is not a small country like the United Kingdom, although even there discontent is rife because the people of Ireland have not con-' trol of their own internal affairs. The same feeling is just as strong in the northern and western States of this Comt monwealth, although we are all agreeable to giving the Commonwealth such powers as are necessary to protect the principle of Inter-State Free Trade.",48
156,Mr RODGERS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,We cannot look to Queensland for an example in regard to Inter-State Free Trade.,48
157,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I regret that in respect of later years that is true. Under war conditions a great deal was .done throughout Australia that should never have been done, and, to my mind, the Queensland embargo on the export of cattle to New South Wales was a contravention of the intention of the people when they accepted Federation. If the Constitution is to be amended r the alterations should not be put to the people piecemeal. Let us as their representatives thoroughly consider the matter, and pla.ce before them a full and complete scheme, and not be continually spending £80,000 on a referendum. We have the experience of the last twenty years to guide us, and we should be able to evolve one complete scheme of amendment that will rectify all the shortcomings which the Constitution has been found to possess.",48
158,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Does the honourable member consider that a Convention is. necessary ?,48
159,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I do not-at any rate,, not yet. Whatever the Government may do outside in consultation with'the States, they should lay before this House a scheme which we can thresh out, and so be able to recommend various alterations to be settled by the people on a referendum.",48
160,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,You would utilize the machinery provided 'by the Constitution?,48
161,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Yes . I can quite understand that the majority of the people living in the southern parts of Australia may look at these questions in a vastly different light from that of those who are pioneering, and have to carve out an existence in new country. Such people have to undertake works which residentsof the - cities are not called upon to face, such work having been done for the city' people hy their forefathers.",48
162,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Since the honourable member is so frank, does he consider that the 'Commonwealth Parliament has power to deal with profiteering?",49
163,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The Queensland Parliament has that power.,49
164,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I am asking about the Commonwealth Parliament.,49
165,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"As the honourable (member has mentioned the subject, I think that in Queensland we should revert - to the rule that applied when the Labour - party went into power, they had handed over to them a good scheme for the housing of workmen- a scheme that has never ieen improved on in any State of the .Federation. The honourable member tries to give credit,'to the Labour party for .having conferred the benefit of low rents and lower prices, which belonged to the Xiberal party.",49
166,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The honourable member is, I think, going beyond the question.",49
167,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"You are quite right, air, but I was led away by the interjections. I should like honourable members to consider what the suggested scheme would mean to some of the States of the Commonwealth-wha t it would mean to - Queensland. It would in many respects - wipe out the powers of the Queensland Parliament and Government, which would Teallv be reduced to the position of a ahire council. They would lose control of the State's development and progress in industrial matters. Many of the industries carried on in the north are quite unknown to the people in the south; the latter, unfortunately, have very little interest in the primary production of ""tropical andsemi-tropical States. The - conditions .are such that no authority can control these industries so well as men on the spot who know all the circumstances; and the result of a change such as that - suggested would prove disastrous to Australia. If industries of the kind were crushed because of the absence of sympathetic legislation in the Federal Parliament, we should have very large areas of country which we should not be justified in withholding from neighbours with large surplus populations. Those vast iareas of millions and millions of acres - can be utilized, but not on such a scheme as that which has been propounded; and the necessary encouragement of industries can only be given by local government fully seized with all the conditions. It is a serious matter to take risks that may involve this Government in the consideration of the question whether coloured races shall be allowed to settle the tropical parts of Queensland, the Northern. Territory, and Western Australia. Honourable members should be sympathetic with those States instead of trying to take away from them that which is essential to the success of tropical culture and white settlement. From my experience in the Federal Parliament I am quite sure that control would not be so well exercised from Melbourne as it is by the State Government.",49
168,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The policy outlined by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) is a complete system of decentralization.,49
169,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That is right so far a» country is concerned, but not so far as representation is concerned. It stands to reason that we in the north would be outvoted in every way.",49
170,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The honourable member cannot have followed what I said. What he refers to were only the boundaries of the local provincial bodies, and not the boundaries of the Federal electorates.",49
171,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,But the honourable member spoke of the number of representatives of the smaller States as compared with the number for the larger States.,49
172,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I did not speak on that point at all.,49
173,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,On e could hardly come to any other conclusion than that which I indicate.,49
174,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Thes e divisions were for the purposes of local government, and were not the divisions of the Federal electorates.",49
175,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I know the honourable member said that, but, at the same time, what suggestion did he make for Federal representation in the various States ?",49
176,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I suggested that the Federal Parliament should itself decide what the boundaries of the various Federal electorates should be.,49
177,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That is, to leave it to the majority to decide what representation there should be.",49
178,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Do we not do that now ? I suggest that the honourable member read a Hansard proof of my speech, when he will see exactly what I did say.",50
179,Mr CORSER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I am sure the honourable member would not wish us for one moment to believe that there ought not to be equal representation in Tasmania, Western Australia, and' Queensland, as under the Labour proposals the Senate would be abolished, otherwise, the tendency must be to give the greater representation to the majority in the southern States, for we know that, unfortunately, the increase of population in the large cities is much greater than in the country. We have been told that in Sydney and suburbs alone there is a population of 2,000,000 out of hhe total population of some 5,000,000 in the Commonwealth. A r e these 2,000,000 people to say what the representation shall be in the three States I have mentioned ? venture to say that in Queensland, for instance, we would have very poor representation, and that our industries in the tropical and semi-tropical districts, in stead of being encouraged, would be practically ruined. Only live local government is able to afford that assistance which is so essential to industries of the kind. I hope to have anotiher opportunity at no distant date of dealing more full y with this matter.

I dare say that in almost every capital city of the Commonwealth there are men prepared to draw up a paper Constitution for the Commonwealth, but I have very grave doubts whether the people of Australia are anxious to alter the present Constitution. It must, be remembered that it took nearly fifty years to educate the public of Australia up to Federation. I suppose there were four or five different agitations at intervals of about ten years, and it will be remembered that about twenty years ago there was a very bitter fight between the Federalists and the anti-Federalists. On the whole, the Federal Constitution, as drawn up by the men who were appointed by the peoplevoting as the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) proposes in his motion-ha s stood the test of time, and is very nearly all that the majority of the people appear to want. I am led to that conclusion by the rejection, during the past ten years, of four or five different' questions put before the people with a view to increasing the powers of this Parliament.",50
181,Mr RODGERS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"And rejected, no matter what party has presented those questions.",50
182,Mr HIGGS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Jus t so. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro now proposes an elected Convention of ten delegates from each State. I am inclined to the opinion, in view of the reception given to the Commonwealth Constitution, as drawn up by the Convention which met I p r i o r ' to the elected Convention at Bathurst, that the people of Australia are not likely to accept an amended draft unless it be the result of the labours of an elected Convention. There may be something in the contention of the Prime Minister that there should be representatives from the Federal Parliament at the Convention; and there may also be something in the opinion of Mr Fihelly, in in Queensland, who contends that there should be representation of the State Parliaments also at the Convention. But if honourable members think that every member of the Federal and State Parliaments will seek to be elected as a dele- I gate to the Convention they are very much mistaken. There will be, in fact, a very limited number who will care to take part in the election of representatives. I am very anxious that thers shall be more States in this Commonwealth. When the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) asks this House whether it is in favour of the continuance of fourteen Parliaments in Australia, he should look abroad and examine the position with regard to territories as large as ours, both in Europe and America, in which there are more' than fourteen Parliaments.",50

184,Mr HIGGS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The proposal of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) that there should be thirty-one provinces, with thirty-one provincial Legislatures, means that there would be thirty-one Parliaments in Australia. I should like to know whether honourable members have made up their minds concerning what the powers of these provincial Legislatures should be. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has publicly stated that he would abolish the State Parliaments.

196,Mr HIGGS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I have my doubts about that. We might find that one State prefers to adopt what I consider the best form of education, wherein a boy would be put in a theoretical school for one week, and in a practical school, where he would learn the use of his hands, for the next week. The outcome of that method of education would be that we would not have youths, as at present, who have gone through the University, and have added letters to their names, but new who, nevertheless, cannot get jobs.

Last 'Week: itfhe honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) addressed a. series of questions to the Assistant Minister for Defence, of which the first fivewere these1. Is it a fact that Mr Yates (ex-member for Adelaide), when a member of the Australian Imperial Force, was posted to the Oth> at "" Reinforcements to the 5th Pioneers while heWas on recruiting leave? 2. Is it a fact that the Sth Reinforcements' to the oth Pioneers embarked for oversea service while Mr Yates was on.recruiting leave? 3. Is it a fact that Mr Yates was subsequently posted to the Artillery, with whiclis Unit he embarked for active service? 4. Was Mr Yates posted to any other Unit;; if so, to what Unit, and for what purpose? 5. Is it a fact that Mr Yates was drafterE to the 50th Battery, 13th Brigade, in France? To them these replies were given1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. 4. There is no record of Gunner Yates having been posted to any other Uni t whilst, abroad. That means, of course, that he was the whole of the time with the Artillery. 5. Yes. Gunner Yates was taken on t h * strength, and posted to the 50th Battery, 13tit Field Artillery Brigade, in France, on 23rd. May, 1918. Then followed this questionParliament 0. Is it a fact that the SOth Battery was. engaged in the raid on Villers-Bretonneux on? 15th June,- 1918; Morlancourt, 29th J u l v , 1918; the taking of Hamel, 4th July, 1918:.. and the big offensive of 8th August, 1918;. during which time Gunner Yates formed one - of a gun crew? It is to the answer given to it that I take? as far as the Battery was concerned,, t cannot be ascertained ""whether Gunner Yates formed one of a gun-crew in the engageat Villers-Bretonneux, Morlancourt, o r the taking of Hamel. Before commencing thebig offensive, on Sth August, 1918, the 13th» Artillery Brigade formed a dump of stores and baggage at Blangy-Tronnear Amiens, and it is understood Gunner Yates was one of a small guard which remained there until 25th October, 191S, o r later, and, therefore, did not participate in the big o'ffensive. There are apparently in the Defence Department- I do not refer to the Minister --person s who desire to damn, as far as they can, every Labour man who saw service with the Australian Imperial"" Force. Mr Yates naturally felt hurt at the replies which I have read, and sent me the following letter, of which a copy was sent to every member of this party, because he considered that he had the cause he was gassedright to place the facts before them, and to protest against the misrepresentation contained in the answers I have read. I This is the letter I refer toDear Frank,The unwarranted attack upon myself by the Prime Minister, together with the wilfully misleading reply given by the Minister for - Defence to the question submitted to him by the member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) demands immediate denial and correction, and I look to you to see that at least I am protected from vilification, even though it is impossible to obtain fair treatment. In the replies given as to my service, it would appear that though no information can be vouchsafed as to my service in the field, the trivial and less important feature is known and distorted to make it appear that I had remained behind during the final offensive of August 8. I have no desire to claim glory for any effort that I may have made, but I ""do demand just recognition of my services to my country. I joined the battery on May 23That was admitted by the Defence Departmentand was a member of the gun crew in my turn until August 25, during which period I served the gun in the engagements at VillersBretonneux, Morlancourt, Hamel, the big offensive, and during the evacuation in broad daylight under enemy fire of our position at Rosieres. I remained a working member of the battery until August 25, when I was detailedThat would be about seventeen days after the offensiveto guard a baggage dump at Blangy Tronville. I remained there until September 15Not 25th October, as the Defence partment saidand on that day proceeded to rejoin the battery at Feuillieres,"" passing on the way between Corbie and Bray the Prime Minister and the member for Fremantle . (Mr Burchell), who were surveying the scene of the battle of Hamel from the roadside, where Mr Burchell acknowledged my salute when I hailed him as I passed. I was again left in charge of the dump when the battery moved forward, rejoining it at Tincourt on the 27th. I was once more left in charge of the dump for a further period, and subsequently rejoined the battery at Mauretz on October 13, and from there was evacuated to Rouen Hospital. He was in hospital at the time the Defence Department say he was still guarding the baggage dump. If their records are worth anything, the Department must know that he was sent into hospital beThis must be recorded on the files, and the Minister misstated facts when he replied that was located at Blangy-Tronville until October 25 or later. This, briefly, is my service with my unit, and a reference to Major Retchford, Buller-street, Prospect, my commanding officer, will verify these facts. 16th April, 1920. I have no desire to bask in the reflected glory of the efforts of others, but I do protest at being maligned in the manner that I have been. My services guarding the dump, if that is to' be the measure of my usefulness as a soldier, will more than favourably compare with the task of racing around France in a limousine, or defending the ramparts of Piccadilly Circus. When I offered my services I was beyond the age of military service, and could well have done as others did, and remained at home to protect my interests. I have never regretted until now the step I then took nor the responsibilities it brought upon me, and at no time during my career as a soldier have I asked a favour or received one. I performed those tasks assigned to me willingly, and, I believe, creditably; and I look to you as my leader to make my position clear by reading this to the House. I fear no investigation into my career as a soldier, and have nothing to regret, apologize for or be ashamed of, and can wear my badge as a token that I have conscientiously earned it. He also sent me a private letter in which, on this subject, he said I was evacuated to hospital at the time the Minister for Defence saj's that I was still at Blangy-Tronville, and my medical sheet will show this. If the records are so incomplete as he says mine is, how are they going to award the bars to the medals for the engagements participated in? Are they to be indiscriminately scattered about without being verified?' On Mav 26th, three days after I joined the battery, 1, and a man named Mackie, a Queenslander, had our gas masks taken from us to have triple eye-pieces fitted, and we were not supplied with emergency masks. This is Dea court martial offence. On the part of the officer responsible. That night we were in action, and Fritz got our position with high explosive and gas. Mackie and I were forced to lie in a hole near the gun with blankets over our heads, until the gun on our right was hit and all the gunners wounded. We were then ordered to fly to the signallers' dugout, which was gasproof, and this we did across three hundred yards of shell-ploughed flat, with shell still coming over, so you see I was not long there before I got my baptism and took some risk. That night we had five casualties, and I suffered two days' sickness and the loss of my voice for a week as my share. A week or so later Gunner Brook died from result of gfcs at the same position. We also buried Lieutenant Spencc, who was killed at the forward waggon lines at the same place. While we were behind Morlancourt we were shelled oat one niglitj and next morning Lieutenant Creed, a Victorian, visited our gun-pit to see how close to our dugout was the enormous hole one shell made that nearly sent us all. to kingdom come. I could enumerate many more instances of risks run at times when we were holding the line, which have no reference to the engagements referred to in my letter. I had occasion to visit Adelaide before Gunner Yates was sent overseas- I think in connection with the election of 1917and a3 the Commonwealth representative of the Division of Adelaide and a member of the Labour party, he applied for a day's leave so that he might meet me there, but leave was refused to him, and I remember receiving from him a telegram to that effect. About this he saysDollman's reply to me on that occasion was that they did not know me as a politician but as a soldier, and I always played that part. . . . . A third of my wealth was at the disposal of the Commonwealth, free of interest, and while I have no desire to parade this, I am forced to do so in my own defence. He subscribed to the Commonwealth war loan, and did not accept the interest it bore. To my way of thinking, he is making a mistake in refusing the interest on this money, but that is what he has done, and his statement in regard to the matter is capable of verification by referin fact? ence to the Treasury Department.  those who condemn him have advanced money to the Government free of interest.",52
203,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The letter of Gunner Yates proceeds and concludes as folHow lows : In regard to my being detailed to guard baggage dump, when that happened Major Eetchford said to me, ""Yates, I am a much younger man than you, but I find this life heavy strain, and I am going to give easier job."" And I fully appreciated the major's consideration, though I had played my part in any job assigned to me. I desire to place these letters on record. I do it more willingly because Gunner Yates is a member of the party which have the honour to lead, but I would it for any man in order that he might obtain justice. I object to any Departister ment being so politically biased that it will fail to give credit to a man who has gone overseas and "" done his bit."" Once a man enlists he is pelled to do what his military superiors call upon him to do. Those honourable members who went overseas could not go about and say that they would do this or that. They were obliged to do what their superiors told them to do. Gunner Yates was refused permission to meet me in Adelaide, and his treatment in this respect was in striking comparison with that which was meted out to the principal censor in South Australia, who, being a member of the Prime Minister's party, went to meet the right honourable gentleman on his visit to the same city, and was photographed with him as one of his principal supporters. I do not say that Gunner Yates did not make mistakes. No man can say that he has never made a mistake. I have made mistakes, and I will make more if I am spared to live. But to say the least of it, it is not a creditable thing for the Defence Department to endeavor to damn this man's military record and make out that he had not done something he was asked to do or to say that he was guarding a baggage clump, when, as a matter of fact, at that time he was in hospital after having been gassed. It is a military scandal.",54

205,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"It was absolutely false, according to the statement of Gunner Yates, which can be verified.

It is a wrong which I hope will be righted by those honourable members who desire fair play to be given to any man, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, who went overseas to do his duty. I hope this will be done. Unless it can be proved that he shirked his duty or did not go where he was sent, it must be admitted that he did his duty and did go where he was sent. If he was not in the fighting line it was the mistake of his superiors and not his. However, he claims that he was in certain engagements, and I have no reason to disbelieve him. In any case his statement can be proved by his commanding officer.

Previously I had not heard very much of the case. I 'had simply heard it mentioned.

Once it is uttered, i soon runs on like a bush fire, and is all over the country before the person who has set it going realizes, what he has done. I would not have Gunner Yates or any other member of the rank and file which maligned, or have his record besmirched, if I could possibly avoid it. M a j o r Lean's report continuesAs to whether he formed part of a gun's crew can only be definitely stated by his manding officer. Perhaps Lieutenant-Colonel H. O. Caddy, C.M.G., D.S.O., who comYates manded his brigade, can supply some informagun tion on this subject. Nothing is shown on records as to recruiting leave. The matter was referred to LieutenantColonel Caddy, and his letter is pretty ning definite. It reads as follows:Re your inquiry of 10th inst. No. 3S614, Gunner G. E. Yates was taken on the strength of the 13th Brigade, A.F.A., A.I.F., and posted to the 50th Battery on 23rd May, 191S, and was evacuated sick on 15th October, 1918.",56

Before commencing the big offensive, on Sth August, 1918, the 13th Field Artillery Brigade formed a dump of surplus stores and baggage at Blangy-Tronville, near Amiens, and it is understood Gunner Yates was one of a small guard which remained there until 25th October, 1918, or later, and, therefore, did not participate in the big offensive.",56

Similarly the battery participated in a minor operation near Morlancourt on the 29th July, com191S, and also in the Hamel operation of 4th July, 191S. I cannot say whether Gunner formed part of one of the SOth Battery detachments or not. I have no records his showing that. Possibly his B.C. may remember. Before commencing the big offensive, beginon Sth August, 1918, the brigade formed a dump of surplus stores and baggage at Blangy-Tronville. near Amiens, and Gunner Yates formed one of a guard of one N.C.O. and three men (I am not quite sure of the figures) which remained there until the 25th - October, or later. So that Gunner Yates certainly did not participate in the big offensive commencing on Sth August, 191S.

227,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The error in the - date is made in the same document. That is where it comes from . Sir GRANVILLEEYRIE . This Brigade Commander says that Gunner Yates did not part in the big offensive, because he was on duty at I gave that information as my reply to the latter part of the question. exception has been taken to it by the Leader of the Opposition; and to judge from interjections made by honourable members opposite, they thought that, this information was given, merely to besmirch the record of Gunner Yates. It was nothing of the kind. was given in answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. He asked if Gunner Yates was not one of a gun crew in the big offensive, and this was the information elicited from the officers.",57
228,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Has the taken steps to communicate with the commanding officer of the battery?,57
229,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"There - was not very much time to it before, but I assure the Leader of the Opposition that I shall see that f u r the r investigation is made the case. I do not want to hide any of the truth about Gunner Yates, or anybody else. I recognise that a man has the right to demand the very fullest in quiry when these things are said, because you cannot say a worse thing about a man than that he shirked his duty in the field.",57
230,Mr BRENNAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Whil e you are speaking, the men behind vou are besmirching his character, and that makes us suspicious.",57
231,Mr WISE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Who is doing so?,57
232,Mr BRENNAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) has been making most insulting inter jections while the Minister has been speaking.,57
233,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The only interjection I made while the Minister was speaking was that the document itself had made the mistake, and that is a fact.",57
234,Mr BRENNAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,You said something before that.,57
235,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Order ! All these discussions across the chamber are irregular.,57
236,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I am not going to deal with the other part of the Leader of the. Opposition's speech. I do not think it is necessary to say anything regarding Gunner Yates' application for leave prior to going away, as it does not really affect distinctly the case; but I would point out to the take Leader of the Opposition, and to other honourable members opposite, that Gunner the dump. Yates did not behave as an ordinary private when he enlisted. He presumed Great on his position as a member of Parliament, which he should not have done. He should have been treated only in the same manner as any other private. apparently Mr BLAKELEY - This is a serious charge which you are laying against him . What did he do? It Sir GRANVILLERYRIE - For instance, at a meeting, he made public a lot of correspondence which I do not think he should have made public; and because he was not granted leave, he' sent to the Minister for Defence, who was the head of the DepartMinister ment, telegrams and letters which I do not think even honourable members opposite would say were quite the thing.",57
237,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Fro m camp? do Sir GRAJSWILLE RYRIE - I presume he sent them from camp.,57
238,Mr GABB,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"He still held a dual posiinto tion, and he was not the only one that used it .",57
239,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That is just the point. The Minister for Defence pointed out that leave was granted only to those members who were being opposed in their electorates, in order to enable them to fight their election; but Gunner Yates was not opposed in his electorate, and on that ground the Minister refused to grant him leave. However, I do not think we shall get any further by opening up what occurred before he went away. There is no doubt that they were at cross purposes over the whole business, and telegrams and letters passed which certainly should not pass between a soldier and the Minister for Defence. I do not think there is any desire on the part of any one in the Department to do an injustice to Gunner Yates or any other private; nor do I think it was necessary for the Leader of the Opposition to say that it was because Gunner Yates held different political views from those of this party that an endeavour was made to besmirch his record or to give misleading answers. .",57
240,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"You will admit that if I think that, I am far more honest in stating it than in keeping it to myself? Sir GRA.NVILLE RYRIE - Quite so. I assure the honourable member that I shall see that a further in vestigation is made. We will obtain information from the man who actually commanded the battery. If there is in the Department any information that I can obtain that will clear Gunner Yates I shall be pleased to produce it .",58
241,Mr BLAKELE Y,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Darling) [8.41] The reply made by the Assistant M in ister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) to the Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Tudor) makes it perfectly clear either that bias has been displayed in the treatment of Gunner Yates, or that the officers in charge of the records are inefficient. We have to judge between Gunner Yates and certain departmental officers, and I , for one, especially in view of my own experience, and that of many other honourable members, during the last four years, am prepared to accept Gunner Yates' word in preference to that of the departmental officers.",58
242,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Other s not be prepared to do so.,58
243,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Q u it e so. The fact that the honourable gentleman has information which, if not directly contradictory of that which he has previously given to the Blouse, at least does not tally with it , shows either bias or incapacity on the part of those who prepared for the Minister answers to questions on the subject. As to the honourable gentleman suggesting that his honour had been impugned by statements made from this side of the House to-night, I think we may pass over the statement, because I am sure that he does not seriously believe that we are impugning his honour. The experience of many members of the Opposition is not such as to lead them to have any degree of confidence in the departmental officers. Gunner Yates has made certain statements which are contradicted in the departmental, records. In one instance, the contradiction goes in one direction, and in another it is, in quite a different direction. The fact that questions put by members have been answered in such a slipshod fashion that the dates do not tally also makes one think that there is political bias against Gunner Yates. My own belief.is that there has been gross bias on the part of departmental officers. There is, for instance, the Ozanne case, which is sub judice. A p parently, certain of the "" brass hats "" in the service are quite willing to serve-their master, the ' Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes)",58
244,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The honourable member has just said that the Ozanne case is sub judice.,58
245,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I care not for that. The Parliament is above the Judiciary, and while I am. a member of this House I shall talk on any subject. I please, regardless of whether or not it is being dealt with in any Court.",58
246,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT OF TH E,That is if Mr. Speaker will allow you to do so.,58
247,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E, The honourable member will not be in order in discussing that matter.,58
248,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I am not prepared to accept the word of the "" brass hats "" who have sold themselves to the National Government. Throughout the war, men high in the Departments, and especially in the Defence Department, have sold themselves body and soul-hav e put men (in gaol, and done the most contemptible I may things-because , in some instances, they have been ordered to do so by their masters, the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes). Actions have been taken which, to say the least, are unworthy of gentlemen. In the very near future, no doubt, evidence will be adduced from men who allowed themselves to be used as political tools, and who complied with their master's demand to be supplied with certain cablegrams, which were to be published on the eve of an election in order to defeat a candidate.",58
249,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Order ! The honourable member is not now dealing with the question immediately before the Chair.,58
250,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,It bears generally on the question of the Defence Department's treatment of Labour members.,58
251,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The question before the Chair relates to the case of Gunner Yates specifically, and not in general terms to honourable members.",58
252,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Hi s case is very much on a par - with many others that have occurred during this war. The honour of Gunner Yates has been besmirched by departmental officers who have supplied information to the Aasistant Minister. An inquiry by departmental officers is not sufficient. The honour of an ex-member of this House, who, I anticipate, will be with us again in 1923, or even earlier, is impugned by some of the "" brass hats "" of the Department. The Government should agree to the appointment of a Select Committee to examine the whole of the papers available in Australia, and to interrogate the officers commanding the brigade and division with which Gunner Yates was connected. If the Minister will agree to the appointment of a Select Committee to go into the case it will be to the advantage of Gunner Yates and all concerned.",59
253,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Kooyong) [8.47] - I sincerely hope that no member of this House would be so unchivalrous, not to say unfair, as to deny to any soldier who proceeded abroad the fullest credit for the service rendered by him. Gunner Yates has given day and date in respect of the engagements in which he took part. Thus material has been supplied, the accuracy of which can be verified or disproved. The information now supplied should', enable the Minister to at least give to this House, at a future date, and after the closest investigation, the full facts of the case. Gunner Yates is entitled to every credit for his service abroad, and the mere fact that while in Parliament he sat on the Opposition benches I hope will not induce any honourable member to detract in the slightest degree from the credit due to him. At the same time. I think the Opposition do Gunner Yates' case a measure of injustice when they set to work to besmirch the character"" of the officers of the Department* who supplied certain information.",59
254,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Not without reason.,59
255,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I have heard nothing to disprove the statements made by the officers. :,59
256,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Then the honourable member could not have listened to the debate.,59
257,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I have followed it closely, and have observed that there is an immaterial discrepancy of ten days between the statement of the officer supplying the report and that of Gunner Yates as to the date when he was sent into hospital. That is not a' matter of substance at all'.",59
258,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"He states that he was a certain time on service and a certain time in charge of the dumps. ' Mr JAMES PAGE - But , even supposing that he were in charge of the dumps, somebody had to be in charge of them.",59
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"If he was ordered to that duty, there is no discredit attaching to it.",59
260,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The report does not state that he went into hospital as the result of being gassed.,59
261,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"That question is not involved here. The question which is involved is as to whether it wa3 the loth or 25th October when he was retired to the hospital. The sole point which I desire to make is that the Minister is called upon to furnish this House with the facts from the information which he now has before him, and the very definite statements that have been made by Gunner Yates will enable him to get at those facts. But it is very unreasonable for the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) to make such aspersions as he has done against the officers of the Defence Department.",59
262,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"My arrest was ordered in Sydney by the "" brass hats,"" and I have a very keen recollection of it.",59
263,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The honourable member has complained of the honour of Gunner Yates having been besmirched, and yet he himself set to work to besmirch the honour of the officers of the Department who have furnished the Minister with certain information that is disclosed by the records.",59
264,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,But they are remarkably silent with regard to his achievements.,59
265,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"They haye given all the information at their disposal, and they could do no more. That information has been supplied in direct answer to pointed questions put by honourable members opposite.",59
266,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"They were due to statements made by the Prime Minister that two members from this side of the Chamber had gone overseas to fight, but had seen no fighting.",59
267,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The questions put have ""been categorically answered. I am anxious that Gunner Yate3 should be given the fullest credit for his services.",60
268,Mr RYAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Would not the honourable member, himself object if he had been evacuated, into hospital as a Tesult of being gassed on the 15th October, seeing that that statement corroborates the statement of Gunner Yates?",60
269,Sir ROBERT BEST,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The question of why he was sent into the hospital is not material. There is no doubt that he was sent there. The question we have to consider is whether it was on the 15th or the 25th October when he was ordered into hospital. That is the only difference between the statements which have been made, and it is not a difference which justifies the aspersions that have - been so freely indulged in against the cers of the Department. W it h honourable members opposite I joi n in their request to the Minister that the most exhaustive inquir y shall be conducted into this matter, in order that, with the facts before it , Gunner Yates may be judged by this House. I trust that the fullest credit will be given to Gunner Yates for vice which he has rendered, and I hope that he will prove himself to be jusc as entitled tu the thanks of ths community as have been other honourable members who went abroad.",60
270,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Barrier) [8.55] It strikes me that the principal cause of all this recrimination-the statement of .the Prime Minister that Gunner Yates, in common with other members upon this side of the House, had enlisted for service abroad, but had seen no fighting-has been entirely overlooked. The whole trouble originated with the attack of the right honourable gentleman, who attempted to show that there was not a single soldier representative upon this side of the chamber, and that those of its members who had gone overseas had simply been masquerading in soldiers' uniforms. That statement is only part and parcel of the continuous campaign of deliberate misrepresentation which was adopted by the National party and their officials right throughout the war period, and has been pursued ever since. Upon the one hand they denounced those of us who did not go to the war as traitors to the Empire, whilst on the other they branded as cowards and dodgers of thetrenches members of the Opposition who did go. This is part of tihe reward of the latter. No wonder that Gunner Yates says, in his letter to his leader, that "" he has never regretted until now "" his share in the European conflict. This is the reward of members of the Opposition who went to fiVht for the flag andt who trusted their honour in the hands of honourable members opposite. Gunner Yates received a portion of his rewards upon his return to Australia. His services to the Empire, and his efforts to> remedy the' conditions which existed om the transport by which he travelled home, were rewarded by imprisonment. Whens an attempt was .made by means of questions to put him right, clerical errorsoccurred. All mention of Gunner Yates' record appears to be missing. Ther-e is no record of what he has done, but in offi- sinuations are made that he did not do something which ho did, .and he has therefore appealed to 'his commanding: officer to back up his own statement. When these questions were asked, instead' of the Minister requesting their postponement until the required information was received., he .answered them on the in eagre? the serinformation which was then available. Seeing that the answers still further reflected upon Gunner Yates, the latter has sent fort h his vindication, and has appealed to his commanding officer to confirm his own statement as to his services. It is quite evident that the Minister had"" not previously read the correspondence on this matter, otherwise he would have noted the discrepancy between the reply and the letter which he read. Obviously, merely a casual search was made in order to vindicate Gunner Yates or otherwise. Instead, the statement has been broadcasted through the press that Gunner Yates pretended to have rendered some service to this country which be had not rendered. Such tactics are quite in harmony with the campaign of the Nationalist party outside in regard tomembers of the Opposition, irrespective of whether or not they went to the war. Under our parliamentary procedure I a n not at liberty to refer to other cases with which honourable members are - full y acquainted. They have heard of the little bills for cigars and drinks of other ex-members from the Opposition side of the Chamber. These have been printed' in big headlines in the newspapers, in order to damage men who went overseas expecting to get a square deal from honourable members opposite ",60
271,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Seventeen pounds, was it not?",61
272,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The honourable member justifies all that I have said. He has evidently been paying particular attention to these items. Naturally he would, and no doubt he made use of them during the recent election campaign.",61
273,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The honourable member's evil mind leads him to impute motives without justification.,61
274,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Order ! These in terjections have nothing to do. with the question.,61
275,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"It is not a question of my evil mind, but of the honourable member's evil record. I do not propose to delay the House any further with my comments on the.matter, but I think it is quite obvious to honourable members, esj>ecially to those who are new to £he House, that the character of no man, whether he 'be soldier or civilian, if he be opposed to those in authority, who have the chance to suppress facts, and damn with fain t praise, is safe in the hands .of the party opposite, and their record"" since they have been in office stinks in the nostrils of the people on account of their evil doings.",61
276,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Melbourne Ports) [9:2] - My concern in this matter is that the real culprit is escaping. The Prime Minister was the cause of the whole trouble. Nobody jblames the Assistant Minister for the answer which was given to him by his departmental officers. The fact is that the Prime Minister will do anything or say anything to beat his ipoliticaJ opponents. He will resort to any methods; in fact, it is hard to set a .limit to what he will do. In this chamber iie made a sneering and contemptible a.ttack upon the soldier members of the Labour party. I expected that the returned soldiers on the Government side would have risen in revolt. I have heard every one of them traduced by somebody, but believing that the statements were lies, I have gone out of my way to contradict them. Surely there is something else in parliamentary life than the desire to avail oneself of every opportunity to defeat one's political opponents. That was the object of the Prime Minister when he said that the soldier members on this side had never smelt powder, and that he had been nearer to the firing line than they were. Do honourable members know that every time the right honourable gentleman went to the Front the soldiers cursed him, because they had to parade against tneir will ? There are men on the Government side who know that as well as I do. Whenever he went into the trenches he was well protected, and other men were subjected to additional risk in order to insure his safety.",61
277,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"They showed their feeling towards him when he came back, did they not?",61
278,Mr GABB,AMENDMENT OF TH E,That was because the Prime Minister had bribed them.,61
279,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Order ! I call upon the honourable member for Angas t;o withdraw the statement that the Prime M in ister bribed the soldiers. Being new to the usage of the House, the honourable member may not be aware that such reflections upon an honourable member are not in order.",61
280,Mr GABB,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I withdraw .in deference to your ruling, sir, but not because I said something that is untrue.",61
281,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The honourable member is not permitted to qualify a withdrawal. In accordance with the rules of the House he must completely withdraw the allegation he - made.,61
282,Mr GABB,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I withdraw it .,61
283,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The Prime M in ister said that he was nearer to the firing line than were the honourable members who enlisted from this side of the House. If that is true it is not to his credit. General Holmes was killed when he was engaged in showing Mr Holman around in France. Every soldier knows that when there was any particular stir in our lines, the enemy -'knew it , and paid special attention to the locality. Therefore, the visit of anybody who was surrounded with the glamour of a political .position exposed other men to additional risk. The Prime Minister would have done better to have kept away from the firing line. Whatever the right honourable gentleman is in private life, for political purposes he would do .anything. That has always been his method in public life. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie). will agree that the battery commander must have a complete record of Gunner Yates' service. The record may not be known to the colonel of a brigade of artillery, because the brigade might be scattered along a front of 20 or 30 miles, but the battery commander would know the record of each of his men through his pay sergeant, and ought' to be able to ascertain exactly where each man was on a certain date. This matter is of sufficient importance to warrant the Assistant Minister making inquiry of the battery officers.",61
284,Sir GRANVILLE RYKIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I have said that that will be done.,62
285,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Anybod y hearing the Prime Minister's statement in this House, and then reading the answers supplied by the. Assistant Minister to Une questions which arose out of the Prime Minister's allegations, could come to no other conclusion than that what the Prime Minister said was perfectly correct. There is no statement in the answer that on the 25th October Gunner Yates was admitted to hospital on account of gas poisoning.",62
286,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I have information to the effect that on 14th October, 1918, he was admitted sick to 48 Casualty Clearing Station, Prance, suffering from erythema.",62
287,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Gunne r Yates, in his letter, has made a definite statement. How foolish he would be to do that if it was not correct, because he must know that the Minister, could at once refute it. Rather than make an incorrect statement, it would be better for him to allow the Prime Minister's allegation to go unchallenged. But he demands that his statement be placed in Hansard as a refutation of the charge against him. Gunner Yates has hopes of continuing his public life, but an allegation such as. that made by the Prime Minister would damn him. The Prime Minister ought to apologize to the House for the sneering accusation he made against members on this side. Am I to follow his example, and every .time. I hear soldier members on the Ministerial side traduced agree by innuendo or sneers with the allegations made against them? If I were to resort to repeating gossip of that kind, in order to down a political opponent, I would feel such contempt for myself that I could not appear in public again. The Prime Minister ought to be prevented from saying these things. I believe that he received 'his information from the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who, like him, would resort to any methods to beat his political opponents. We have evidence of that in his past record. In regard to the final paragraph of the answer to the questions that were asked, the Assistant Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) will agree with me that, whilst the reference to guarding ammunition dumps might be understood by a soldier, it would convey to the general public the impression that Gunner Yates was out of the firing line altogether. No doubt the statement was made for that purpose, whereas the men guarding the dumps might have been subject to either artillery fire or aerial attack. The public would infer that they were only caretakers - of baggage.",62
288,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The question lent itself to that reply. In fact, that reply had to be given to the question as to whether he was one of a gun crew'who took part in the big offensive on a certain date. The answer merely indicated where he was on that date.",62
289,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Mr Yatesdeclares that he was at the big offensive, and the departmental records ought to show whether he is speaking the truth or not. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) will admit that it is quite possible that at no stage was a battery of artillery at its full strength, so a colonel would probably not know if Gunner Yates were present or not, but the battery commander should know, and there ought to be an investigation into the whole of the circumstances. Mr Yates says that he was in action, and therefore did risk his life on many occasions.",62
290,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The Assistant Minister admits that the battery was engaged.,62
291,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Bu the does not know whether Mr Yates was present or not.,62
292,Mr BRENNAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Mr Yates says he was, and that is good enough for us.",62
293,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) will know that only one section of a battery of artillery might be in action at one time. Mr Yates has made the statement that he was in action at the big offensive, but the authorities say they do not know whether he was or not. In consequence of the sneering charge made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) it is up to the Assistant Minister for Defence to prove whether Mr Yates' statements are true or - otherwise. That is all I ask, and I hope that there will be an end to these charges across the table about feather-bed soldiers on this side of the House. If I were to repeat what I have heard about the remissness of some soldier members opposite, about how they shirked their duties, and how they got promotion, I should deserve to be kicked out of the House for giving credence to such statements. As I have refrained from repeating such stories which have come to my ears, surely the Prime Minister ought to do likewise.",62
294,Mr WIENHOLT,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Moreton) [9.15] As one of the soldier members of the House, the course of the debate is very distasteful to me. I am sorry that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made any remarks concerning the conduct of Gunner Yates, for, as a soldier myself, I should never attempt to criticise any ether soldier's conduct. I have no information about these matters, but even if I had, I should certainly give Gunner Yates the benefit of the doubt. As a soldier, I would value 'the good opinion of the men with whom I had fought more highly than even that of - the officers under whom I served, or even the public of Australia, and Gunner Yates must know perfectly well whether or not if he has their good opinion. I have no reason to think he has not. During the last few weeks the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), in his reference to military matters, has appeared to draw a distinction between what lie calls the ""rankers"" and the officers; I may inform him that the old meaning of the term "" ranker "" was, I believe, an officer who had enlisted and worked his way up from the ranks. But I think the Leader of the Opposition, when he used the term "" ranker,"" meant a private in the ranks. - Mr TUDOR - A private or a gunner still in the ranks.",63
295,Mr WIENHOLT,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Well , I hope he will not use the expression again in that way, because I am a ranker myself. I enlisted in three campaigns as an ordinary trooper, and, if I managed to work up to an officer's rank, as many others did, that fact does'not, I hope, make me any less the trooper at heart. I trust that there never, will be any distinction made between rankers and officers, because I hate this attempt to associate soldiers in any political quarrel, and to create feeling between the troopers, or diggers, and those who may have been officers. It is distasteful to me to hear any criticism of the reputation of Gunner Yates or any other soldier or officer. I am sure other soldier members of the House think as I do in the matter. We have a little Soldiers Committee, as everybody knows-and which has been wrongly named a party-representin g soldier members on this side of the House, because there happens to be soldiers only in the Country and Nationalist parties, but I am quite sure that if there were soldier members in the Labour party, they would be with us in the Committee,and we would be proud to have them. It is my sincere wish that no further time will be spent running down any soldier's reputation. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) has promised-and I want him to keep his promise-that he will get any further information that is available about Gunner Yates, and I hope it will be published in Hansard, so that Gunner Yates' reputation may be placed above criticism.",63
296,Mr MAKIN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Hindmarsh) [9.19] All honourable members with a tendency towards Labour principles have a vivid recollection of the difficult path they had to tread during the whole course of the war, because of the attempt of those opposed to the Australian Labour movement to discredit them, in order to further the interests of certain other political parties. We have before us the case of an ex-member who has been prominent in Labour politics, and who in every respect has proved himself to be a man. The answers to the questions that I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence afforded an opportunity for a wrong impression to be created concerning the efforts of a Labourite during the course of the war. The answer to question No. 6 wasIt is understood that Gunner'Yates was one cf a srmll guard which remained there until 25th February, 1918. "" It. is understood "" ! There is really nothing definite there; but within that answer there is room for innuendo and suspicious inference; and when a man's reputation is at stake, not only as a private citizen, but as apublic man, such an answer is sufficient to damn and blight his future career. The circumstances call for most emphatic protest, nOt only from members on this side, but from members on either side who have any desire to see fair play. I appreciate the fact that to-night we have had an assurance that further investigation is to be made into this case, I wish to impress on the Government and the country at large that Mr Yates asks for no favour or privilege, but only for justice. He courts every inquiry, and we hope that the promised investigation will be of the most exhaustive character, so that his case may be judged on its merits and his reputation cleared. Great publicity was given to my questions and the answers' to them, and I hope that publicity as great will be given to any future proceedings. Mr Yates desires no limelight or glory, but only, as I say, tice. It is to be hoped that those who have been responsible for the possibility of creating wrong impressions in the minds of the community regarding Mr. Yates, will in the future recognise their duty towards each and every citizen of - the Commonwealth. It is further to be hoped that a more honest and tolerant spirit will prevail on the part of those who have hitherto seized every occasion to vilify the war efforts of people who support Labour principles. It must be realized that every citizen who took part in the war followed the course which he felt most becoming and worthy of himself as a citizen. It ill becomes any spective of what service he may have rendered, to reflect on the service rendered by another, in this instance, more especially in view of the position which Mr. Yates held in the Army. He was willing to serve, and did serve, in such capacity as was allocated by the commanding officers to him, incurring all the risks and dangers by actual participation in the engagements, which are definitely proved by date and data in the statement of his case submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, and he ought to be given credit for what he did; at any rate, his reputation, as a soldier, a citizen, and a public man ought to be cleared.",63
297,Mr KERBY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Ballarat) [9.26] -- I feel a certain amount of diffidence in rising to discuss this question to-night. I greatly deprecate all the ""mud-slinging"" that has gone over various soldiers' records. Honourable members opposite appear to regard all the departmental officers of the Defence Department asactuated by political bias; and this was particularly so in the case of the honourable member for the Barrier (Mr Considine).",64
298,Mr CONSIDINE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I said nothing of the sort. I said that your party is so actuated.,64
299,Mr KERBY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The circumstance of the difference of ten days in the date can be very easily explained Prom my reading or hearing of the letter, Gunner Yates himself admits having been on guard' at the depot. He was away from, his unit at the time, and consequently his company commander, or battery commander, would not have the details of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Matjushews) spoke. . Any one who was at the Front knows that the moment a man gets away on detail work, touch with him is lost for the time being, and probably he is not brought back on the strength of the unit until the guard's return. The guard, on which Gunner Yates was, returned on the 25th October, and that would be the next date on which he would appear on the roll of his unit. In the meantime, unfortunately, he was evacuated to hospital with erythema, not, as was stated earlier in the night, with gas. I wish to state here, however, that probably the erythema was brought on by the effects of the gas. The honourable member man, irrefor Angas (Mr Gabb), who condemns everything connected with the Nationalist party, gave a very fair illustration of what he knows of returned soldiers, when he accused them of having been bribed. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has stated that members of the National party are doing all they possibly can to discredit the work of soldier members of the party on the other side.",64
300,Mr MAKIN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,That is true. They have done so.,64
301,Mr KERBY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I differ from the honourable member. The majority of the men in my own command were believers in the political creed of the honourable member for Hindmarsh.,64
302,Mr MAKIN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I am glad the honourable member recognises that.,64
303,Mr KERBY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"And I cannot pay those men too much honour. To say that any one on this side refuses to give soldier members of the Labour party credit for what they have done is wrong.. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) mentioned the Soldiers Committee in the course of his speech, and stated that if there were a returned soldier on the opposite side, the members of that Committee would be Very glad indeed to have him join in their deliberations. 1 can assure honourable members that such is the feeling of the members of that Committee that were there returned soldiers on the Opposition side they would bo working with the present members of the Committee as oue body for one interest. I trust that the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) will cause a full inquiry to be made into the case of Gunner Yates, and will see that he is credited with the whole of the work that he did overseas. I trust that his complete record will be made public in order that his statements, if correct, may be substantiated.",65
304,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Werriwa) [9.33] In supporting the motion, I echo the opinion expressed by two or three honourable members on this side, that in this matter the real culprit is the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). This is not by any means the first time he has offended in the same way. His sneering remarks concerning soldier members of the Labour party, and his reflections upon Gunner Yates, naturally aroused resentment on this side amongst those who know the sterling Character of Gunner Yates, and were responsible for the questions asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). Those questions cornered the Prime Minister, and I am prepared to. express the opinion that the Defence Department was asked to supply answers to the questions which would in some way substantiate his remarks. I say that the Defence Department in this matter has been used as a. political institution, and was so used in hundreds of other instances during the last four or five years. think that it is a matter for regret, with many honourable members opposite, that the Department cannot be used in the same way so effectively in the future. The reflections which the Prime Minister made upon Gunner Yates should earn for him the condemnation of all returned men. I heard an interjection, I think from the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond), that that opinion was not borne out by the wav in which the returned soldiers received the Prime Minister on his return. If the honourable member knew as much about that matter as other people do, he would not have made that remark, because it is known that all those things were stage-managed and arranged beforehand. It seems to me a very peculiar thing that the gentlemen, whoever they were, who supplied the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) with the answers to the questions put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), could not find out whether Gunner Yates took part in the great offensive, or was gassed and sent to hospital, but they could find out that he was somewhere in charge of a baggage dump, thus implying that he was well out of the firing line. Why are these methods adopted, and why is Gunner Yates persecuted in this way? These things are not done in an irresponsible way, but, in my opinion, in pursuance of a deep-laid plan. I say emphatically that the Nationalist Government and the Defence Department do not want returned soldiers on this side of the House, because if they were here they could not be gagged so effectively as they can be outside. That is one of the reasons why any method has been adopted to prevent returned soldiers getting into this Parliament to advocate Labour principles. Tho Assistant Minister for Defence said that he would not like any returned soldier to have his character or service falsely represented. I give the honourable gentleman credit for some intelligence, and I say that he should have known that the answers to the questions of the honourable member for Hindmarsh carried with them innuendoes which would misrepresent the case of Gunner Yates. For that reason, whatever other honourable members on this side may be prepared to do, I cannot completely exonerate the Assistant Minister for Defence from blame I in this matter. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not charge the honourable gentleman with any wilful misrepresentation. There might be some excuse for him if he read the answers to the questions supplied to him without studying them, but. even then he must accept responsibility for them just the same. The object of the questions was to reply to the slurs of the Prime Minister, but the answers supplied to them contain innuendoes which put Gunner Yates in a false position, have hurt his feelings, and wounded his pride as a returned soldier to such an extent that in his letter he feels compelled to say that he has not up till now regretted the step he had taken. He was over the age which made him eligible for active service, and might have pointed to that fact to avoid enlistment if he so desired, but he voluntarily went overseas prepared to lay down his life for the cause we were fighting for, and his reward from the other side is that he has to admit that it was not until be got back again to free Australia that he had to regret the action he took. I have heard other returned men express a similar opinion, though not for the same, reason. I say that the action of the Defence Department is to be condemned when they treat a returned soldier in such a way as to make him sorry that he ever went to the Front. During the past few years the Nationalist party has been exploiting the spirit of patriotism to gratify its own petty ambitions, or to secure some position of advantage. E v i j dences such as these serve merely to confirm in one's mind the accuracy of that famous saying of Dr Johnson that the plea of patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.",65
305,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Melbourne) [9.411 J feel sure that the House will be content with the assurance of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie). The mere fact that he has told the officers under his control that if they ever try to "" sell him a pup"" he will make them answer for it reassures me that here we have to deal with a soldier. There is one thing standing to the credit of Gunner Yates, apart from his war service, which, perhaps, may not be said of any other individual in the Forces. He was not only willing to offer his life, but gave one-third of his money free of interest. It may interest honourable members to know how little from all the wealth of Australia was offered free of interest by those who could give when their country was in need. The sum of only about £1,200 was given, and out of that two unions each donated £100. The highest individual sum was £400; while-mos t pathetic of all-ther e were five gifts each of £10. These, indeed, represented the widow's mite. I feel confident that the Assistant Minister for Defence will get to the bottom of these answers furnished by some official under his authority, but I also want the honourable gentleman to understand and appreciate my experience with the upper circle in the Defence Department. I dare say he would be unable to furnish me with a single instance, except that which I have in mind, where a court martial has given its decision in favour of a soldier, after which the case has been brought before a civil court for a fresh trial. I accuse the circle in the Defence Department, with regard to the case of Gunner Perry, of having brought about his trial again, under a magistrate named Cohen. I accuse the Department of having withheld from me for seven days opportunity to look at the files concerned with that case. I accuse the Department of having faked those files. I accuse its officials of having employed a medical man who, according to sworn evidence in Court, acknowledged that he had tormented this unfortunate soldier, Perry, by applying electricity to his ear, and to the red of his lips, and of endeavouring to place electricity to the tip of his tongue. I may say that, as for that doctor, when he sets up in practice in any part of Australia it is my intention to give a public lecture in his close neighbourhood, and read out to the public his evidence in this case.",66
306,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E, The honourable member is departing altogether from the matter before the House.,66
307,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I am desiring to show that the Defence Department, run by its professional soldier clique, will do anything to bolster up its own aims and opinions. I have said publicly, and in this House also, that even the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) told untruths in the Senate, and in the witnessbox, and did so wilfully. I have said that outside, where there is not the protection nf privilege; and the Minister for Defence dare not sue me for what I stated, because he knew in his heart that what I said was true. As the Assistant Minister for Defence has seen active service, he must be impressed with the ridiculousness of a system wherein a man may rise to the rank of General without ever having smelt gunpowder.",66
308,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Order ! This is quite outside the scope of the subject under consideration.,67
309,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I will connect it, sir, by venturing the opinion that it may have been carelessness on the part of the officer concerned in furnishing answers such as he did. If his mistake was justifiable, I hope that no very serious consequences will follow, but if it was not a mistake I am confident that the Assistant Minister will tell the seller of the "" pup "" that he had better not try such tactics again.",67
310,Mr BLAKELEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Accordin g to the departmental records, Gunner Yates was supposed to have been suffering from erythema. What is that?",67
311,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Accordin g to a work which I hold in my hand, the definition is given as follows:- Superficial redness, with burning nains. a part of the integuments, varying in extent and form, disappearing momentarily on pressure, usually of an acute character^ and fectious.

312,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,I am not ir. a position to say.,67
313,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Gunne r Yates was gassed in May, and this was during October.",67
314,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Whateve r steps may be taken by the Assistant Minister, I desire to emphasize my protest against the circle of professional soldiers being allowed to continue in control of the Defence Department. I have the greatest admiration for men who left their avocations and went freely and voluntarily to the Front. They distinguished themselves equally with the very best professionals. I want to see now that their opportunities to rise to positions of power shall not be blocked by the professional clique.",67
315,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Yarra) [9.50] - In view of the promise given by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), I ask leave io withdraw the motion, and trust that in justice to Mr. Yates the inquiry will be a thorough one. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Original question resolved in the negative. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL. In Gommittee (Consideration resumed from 21st April, vide page 1397) : Clause 22In this part of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears"" Child "" means . . .  [9.52] - Las t evening I expressed my intention of moving that this portion of the Bill shall be administered 'by the existing Pensions Branch. I listened with interestto the Minister in charge of the  plaining why, in his opinion, another Department should be created, and I was not at all impressed with the case he submitted. He said that there would be a saving in time, but I - cannot see how a saving could' be effected. As pointed out by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), three-fourths of this work of has been done by the existing branch, and I have not heard any complaints regarding the manner in which the work is perunin- formed. Since I have been a member of this new Parliament, I have not had a great deal to do with the Pensions Branch, but I know sufficient to say that the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales is a thoroughly efficient officer, and is in control of a well-organized Department. If , as the Minister suggests, time is to be saved, I do not see how that can be done by creating a new Department when we have one already in existence with the machinery available for - carrying on the work. If we create a new Department it will mean appointing additional officers, and will necessarily entail loss of time. Under the proposal of the Government there would be two Departments, and even if complaints have been made concerning the existing branch, it is better to bear with the ills we have than to fly to those we know not of. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) said he would agree to the establishment of a new Department if it were of a temporary nature, but that is an unreasonable attitude to adopt, as it would necessitate creating a temporary Department to perform permanent - work. I trust the Minister will see his way clear to accede to the wishes of honourable bers on this side, and that when a vote taken it will not be a party one. 1 not think honourable members opposite have any grounds on which they can base complaints against the existing Pensions Branch, but we may incur risks by ing over thi? work to another body.",67
316,Mr WISE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"On-whic h the soldiers directly represented.  considering the matter from a soldiers' point of view, and 1 propose to move, the soldiers' interests, an amendment with the idea of expediting the work.

317,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"South Sydney) [9.58] I agree with the remarks of the honourable  and consider that .unless there is some complaint concerning the method of ducting business in the present Pensions Branch, there is no valid reason why new branch should be established. The existing Pensions Branch is dealing extions peditiously with old-age pensions and maternity allowances, and it would be preferable to allow that Branch to administer this portion of the Bill instead 'of appointing Committees in each State The work of the Pensions Branch of the Treasury Department, except the mere routine work of paying the - pensions, has been nearly completed.* because there remain nob 10 per cent, the soldiers to be dealt with. Sydney office, the card system is in vogue, and every pensioner's name is carded, and his case can be dealt with a moment, should action be necessary in regard to it. I have not ""met a soldier who has complained of delays in that branch. What is now proposed, however, is to remove the war pensions work from the .Treasury to the Repatriation Departcreases ment. It i6 alleged that this will conseed venience pensioners, but, as a matter of partment fact, it will not affect them, because they will still, as now, go to the various post offices to receive their pensions, and if memthey have to submit to examination, or is the like, the new arrangement will be no do more convenient than the present. At the present time, war pensions are being dealt with by the officers who deal also with old-age and invalid pensions, and handnothing would be gained by creating a special staff to deal merely with war penare sions. In my opinion, the Pensions Branch of the Treasury Department eonsome of the best officers we have in the service, and when the Postmaster General next visits New South Wales, he in might, by visiting the Pensions Branch there, learn something which he could apply with benefit to the working of his",68
318,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Maranoa) [10.4]. - I hope thab honourable members will not I agree to a proposal to create a special war Pensions Branch under the Repatriation Department. The honourable membefore ber for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) is known shall for his encomiums upon that great, bener factor to the human race who made two blades of grass grow where one grew before. In this instance, the Government is trying to make two pensions branches where one has hitherto sufficed. Why real should the administration of war pensions conbe removed from the Pensions Branch of the Treasury Department, which has done a good work up to now? At the present time, four-fifths of the pensions applicahave been dealt with, and honourable members who, as we all did at the last election, promised to support economy in the management of public affairs, ought not to agree to what is really a doublebanking proposal. At the present time, every tenth person that you meet in the street is a public servant-the statistics show that-and apparently the Government will not be satisfied until every of ninth person is a public servant. I reI n the member well how, when the late Sir William Lyne, as Minister, was starting the Works Department, the present Minin ister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), who was then in Opposition, said, "" Although you ask now only for an Under Secretary and a couple of clerks, my experience of political life tells me thab in every following year you will propose into the staff, until from the tiny that is being sown now, a great Dehas grown."" At that time the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Groom) looked upon the Ministers then in power as so many little tin gods, and believed all that they told him. Now he wishes us to accept pap similar to that on which he was fed, but I decline to do so. If it is necessary to have all the Departments under one roof, why not put the old-age and invalid pensions work upon the Repatriation Department?",68
319,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"And the post-offices, too, because the pensions are paid by the Postmaster-General's Department.",69
320,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Yes . Ministers know how these public Departments grow. This is an instance in which the spirit of economy can be put to the test. We ought not to duplicate work. As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) said last night, we should not try to make two Departments grow where one sufficed before. The Pensions Branch has very little to do with war pensions. It is now merely an office for the registration of pensions. Payments are made by the Postal Department, which, I suppose, will still continue to make them. I would gladly support Ministers if they could show me that their proposal would lead to a. saving of money. But they know full well what the creation of another Department means. It will grow night and day, winter and summer, in season and out of season.",69
321,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT OF TH E,This is not the creation of another Department; it is merely the transfer of certain agencies fromone Department to another.,69
322,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OF TH E,It is merely an attempt to justify the existence of a permanent Department.,69
323,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"The Council of Defence has met and promised the taxpayers that it will bring down the expenses of the Defence Department next year to the pre-war figures-at least, so we are informed by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) through the columns of the press. The idea is to absorb the men they are getting rid of in the Defence Department by transferring them to the Repatriation Department, more particularly for work in connection with the payment of pensions. That is how it is proposed to save money in the Defence Department.  correct.",69
324,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Then what do the Government propose to do with the men they are to dismiss from the Defence Department ? ,69
325,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT OF TH E,What does the honourable member suggest should be done with them ?,69
326,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I would employ them in some useful occupation, where they can earn money and be of use to the Commonwealth. I would not create another Department to absorb them. When I read the speech with which this Bill was introduced in the Senate I thought that the Government were joking. I had not imagined that they would propose to create another Department. I have never heard a growl from any one that the Treasury officers have been administering the War Pensions Act badly. I can only draw my own conclusions as to why it is proposed to create this new Department. We know that when the work of repatriating our soldiers is concluded there will be nothing left foT the Repatriation Department to do, and, seeing that pensions are to be paid for the next forty or fifty years, it is proposed to entrust this branch of work to this new Department so that there may be some ground for its permanency. I hope that honourable members on both sides will be true to their election pledges. I cannon see how any man at this critical period of the finances can tell the country that so much money has been saved for the taxpayers by creating another Department out of a Department already in existence, or, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) said last night, by making two Departments do what one Department did very we'll before. I believe the Committee is in favour of knocking this provision out of the Bill. If that, is done, the Government can incorporate the new schedule of amounts payable for different disabilities in the Pensions Bill, and "" everything in the garden will be lovely."" If honourable members want to preserve the finances and to help the taxpayers by reducing taxation, I appeal to them not to create any more Government Departments. They should rather reduce them, but not so that they will be inefficient.",69
327,Mr BELL,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Darwin) [10.23] - I not support the amendment, nor can follow the reasoning of those who have argued that if the War Pensions Branch of the Pensions Department is brought would vote for it . under (the control of the Repatriation Commission it will mean creating another Department, I understand that there is a* branch of the Pensions Department administering war pensions in particular. That branch will be brought under the control of the Repatriation Commission. That is the whole position, and the change is very advisable. I said yesterday, speaking to an amendment for which I voted, that my only regret was that the Bill did not bring certain other Departments under the control of the Commission, and that if we withheld from the Brennan, F. Commission the administration of the Catts, J. H. Pensions Branch, the War Service Homes Cook,' Robert Branch, and the Soldiers' Settlement Fenton, .T. E. Branch, there was not much justification Francis, for creating a highly-paid Commission to Gibson. W. G. administer the Department. Honourable Hill, W. C. members opposite say they have heard no Lazzarini, II . P. criticism of the administration of the Mahonv. W. G. War Pensions Branch. I know of cases Makin, N. J. 0. where those who claim to be soldiers' dependaints are receiving pensions to Atkinson, L. which I am sure they are nob entitled, Bell. G. J. and I have numerous letters from soldiers' BhindeH, R. P. dependants who I have assured myself Cameron, D. C. have a right to pensions but have not Cook, been granted them. If the whole of the Foster, Richard repatriation business is controlled by one Greene, W. M. Commission, its members will quickly get Groom, L. E. into touch with it , and the Department and the returned soldier and his deKerby, E. T. J. pendants will soon be in sympathy with lamond, Hector one another. The administration will be carried on much more easily and better than it will be if the various activities remain separated. I know of cases in Tasmania where soldiers are still drawing movepensions who were placed on land by the Soldiers' Settlement Branch, and who serted have not been able to do one day's work Forces "" :since I returned from the Front some nine months ago. That is not an advisable state of affairs, and would not be likely to continue if the whole of these activities On were placed under the one Commission. The work will be done quicker and better if the War Pensions Branch is brought under the control of the Commission. It will be all under the one roof, and will not mean creating a new Department or duplication. I do not think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . canPage) was serious when he suggested I bringing the whole of the Pensions Department under the control of the Repatriation Commission, nor do I think he It is advisable to bring as many of the activities of repatriation under the one head as possible. - Question-That the words proposed to MOLONEY'S amendment)-put .

The munition workers have a just claim to inclusion in a measure of this character, because they served the Empire well during a critical period, but they have received scant consideration. The merits of their claim were discussed when the Bill was before another place, and the Minister then in charge of it, - when speaking to the question of whether munition workers should be included, said I readily admit that munition workers rendered an exceedingly useful service to nation, and if the question of finance did not intrude I should readily accept the amendment. The question of finance should not it possible for us to do an injustice section of men who have rendered valulabour able service to the Empire. I believe those who proceeded abroad as munition workers do not exceed 5,000. It would be necessary to provide pensions for the whole of them, but there are some very deserving cases to whom the principle of service. repatriation should apply. I have here the case of a man who went abroad as munition worker, and who is today physically unfit to follow his former employment. Whilst engaged as a munition worker he contracted bronchitis, which has become chronic, and his circumstances today, as the result of his ill-health, such that he has had to sell up his home, and be subject to many disabilities. Not only has he been subject to these disabilities, but his wife and family had to share them. I have here a medireview cal certificate which proves that this is suffering 'from chronic bronchitis that he is unable to resume his ordinary avocation.",70
329,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"Does the doctor say that his chronic bronchitis is due the munition making? Mr MAKIN"" - I will read the medical certificate of a captain who was the regisBill trar of No. 5 Australian General Hospimeasure. tal of the Australian Military Forces. I saysThis is to certify that Munition-worker Minister W. H. Gardiner was medically examined at No. 5 Australian General Hospital on the 24th December, 1918. The board considers that though he is under no hospital ment at present and is fit to take up light employment, he is not fit to resume his occupation as a boiler assistant. That is the certificate of a medical officer in the Australian Military Forces, 3rd Military District.",71
330,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT OF TH E,The same statement is applicable to men here in connection with friendly societies. What the honourable member has quoted is an ordinary medical certificate. It does not say that the man's disability is due to his labours as a munition worker.,71
331,Mr MAKIN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"If we are going to evade our obligations to these men by so the closely defining ill-health which may reasonably be attributed to their service abroad, we shall be acting in a very nigmake gardly fashion. Many of the fumes into a which a munition worker is required to are such as tend to bring on the that complaint from which this man is suffering. We ought to be generous to not cases of this kind in which irreparable injury has been done to the health of men who were rendering the country valuable",71
332,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT OF TH E,But the honourable a member wishes to repatriate those who are not suffering from that disability.,71
333,Mr MAKIN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I shall be satisfied if the Government will include in the Bill persons who are deserving of repatriation and who are subject to disabilities such are as I have indicated. There is another case, which I wish to citei-the one of which I spoke when another measure, which have we - have since finalized, was under here. I refer to a number of men man who enlisted in the Australian Imperial and Force, and who because of special qualifications were ordered by the Defence Department to take up duties in the munition factories of England as chemists. I ask the Minister whether he is to prepared in this Bill to make the same provision for these men as the Minister who was in charge of the War Gratuity was willing to make for them in that Seeing that the merit of their t service was recognized in the latter Bill, there is no argument which can justify their exclusion from this measure. The for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has himself admitted that these men rendered valuable service treatto the Empire, and has intimated that he would be willing to' repatriate them but for the financial consideration that would be involved. That financial consideration, subject to the inclusion of I these men, is of such a character that it ought not - to unjustly determine our attitude, and the nature of the provision we should make in the matter of repatriation. They have had to make sacrifices, as have also their wives and families. I know of one man who has been obliged even to sell up his home in order to meet the calls that have been made upon him. If we allow such cases to go unrecognised, we shall be doing something which will be unworthy of us as members of this Parliament and not in accordance with the wish of the people of this country.

352,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E,Order ! The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) is distinctly disorderly in uttering threats.,73
353,Mr MAHONY,AMENDMENT OF TH E,"I make an appeal on behalf of the men of the Australian Navy, and also those who served in the Imperial Navy. No member of this House has a more intimate knowledge of the effectiveness of their work in all parts of the world during the war than the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Marks), and I hope he will support the amendment with the addition suggested. We all realise that if it had not been for the naval defence Great Britain would have "" gone down"" in the war; and, therefore, I think we should include sailors within the scope of this provision. We recognise the good work the military side performed, but it would have been utterly impossible to convey our soldiers to Europe if it had not been for the equally good work of the Navy. It was the unceasing watchfulness and high sense of duty of our sailors that rendered the military defence effective. In praising our returned soldiers we are forgetting "" Jack, the handy man in blue""-hand y in both [63] peace and war. Our sailor3 suffered severely during the' conflict, and many families are now bereaved by the loss of fathers, brothers, and sons; but the services thus rendered have not been recognised in any shape or form. I look to the honourable member for Wentworth, who spent some time amongst them, and' did some good work himself in the North Sea and other parts, to raise his voice against an injustice being perpetuated. It is to be hoped that that honourable member's influence with the Minister for the Navy (. Sir Joseph Cook) will result in a recognition of the claims I am now advocating. Our submarines also rendered great service along with other Australian-manned ships. Neither must we forget the wireGo on less staff, which performed important duties, sending wireless messages of [11.8] - I warning thousands of miles over the sea, and thus enabling our defenders to escape mine-fields, raiders, and so forth . It is the duty of every honourable member who has been in close touch with these will. I men to see that their work receives due recognition. It is no use honourable members setting themselves up as the friends of certain branches or sections of our Defence Forces. The real test is their stand' ing up in this House and by their actions showing that the services rendered have not been forgotten. I am not prepared to allow the honourable member for Wentworth to simply talk about his interest in the Navy, but require some tangible proof of that interest. I ask the honourable member for Parkes (Mr M a r r) to tell the Committee something of the good work done by the wireless staff, in order that they may receive some recognition.",73
354,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT OF TH E, Order ! I again direct the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the actions of the honourable members for Wentworth and Parkes are not before the Committee.,73

It appears, however, that I was wrong in entertaining any such reasonable idea. I again appeal to honourable members to assist the Government to get the Bill through tomorrow. It is urgent.
