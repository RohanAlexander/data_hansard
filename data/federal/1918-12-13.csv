Are the provisions of section 44 of the Post and Telegraph Act 1900-11 strictly adhered to as regards appointments to higher grades in the State Engineer's Branch, New South Wales? 1.1.

PROSECUTIO N OF MILK COMPANIES.",23
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"On the 27th November the honourable member for Oook (Mr . J. H . Catts) asked a series of questions about the prosecution of mil k companies in New South Wales. The following papers are supplied for the information of the honourable member : CHIEF COMMONWEALTH PRICES COMMISSIONER. Melbourne, 12th December, 1918. SENIORITY. (Memorandum.) The Hon. the Minister. With reference to the request made by, Mr. J. H. Catts in the House of Representatives on the 27th November, 1918, that he be informed as to how many prosecutions have been recommended from the State of New South Wales since your occupancy of the office of Minister in Charge of Price Fixing, &c, I now forward copy of a statement which I have had prepared, setting out the information desired by Mr Catts. I may add that I am not aware of any instance where a case has been withdrawn by you except on my recommendation, other than certain cases In which you directed, on 28th May, 1918, that no action be taken pending the display of lists of fixed prices. PERCY WHITTON, Chief Prices Commissioner. Commonwealth of Australia. COMMONWEALTH PRICES COMMISSIONER, VICTORIA. (Minute Paper.) Subject - Replie s to questions asked by Mr. Catts re New South Wales prosecutions. Question - Why were prosecutions undertaken against the big milk companies in Sydney and withdrawn ? Answer - Prosecution s against three milk companies in New South Wales were withdrawn on the recommendation of the Chief Prices Commissioner, of whose minute, dated 3rd September, 1918, the following is a copy:"" In the matter of the prosecution of the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company, Dairy Farmers M i l k Company, Farmers and Dairymen's Milk Company, representatives of the above have made the following statement of their case:The prosecution is in respect of a charge of i d . per lb. made to certain vendors. They state this charge was made prior to 1914, and has been made continuously as a trade usage ever since; that it is really a charge for extra work done on behalf of the vendors. They further say that it was sanctioned by Order No. 72, Gazette No. 153, of 25th October, 1916. They admit there is a technical breach of the Order as now made. It has been the practice of the Department to retain trade usages of that nature, and it is certain that, had it been known here that such was in existence, it would have been sanctioned. The parties concerned say, also, that they understood Mr Ackerman admitted the charge was a fair and legitimate one. The statement so far is ex parte, but on the facts as stated the Minister has, upon my recommendation, consented to the withdrawal of the prosecution on the understanding that if , upon subsequent, investigation, the statement of the case is found to be incorrect, further proceedings will be instituted. As a technical breach is admitted, in agreeing to the withdrawal, it must be on the undertaking that the expenses of the prosecution to date will be paid by the defendants."" Question - How many prosecutions have been recommended from the State of New South Wales since the Minister's occupancy of the office? Answer - On e hundred and thirty-nine. Question - How many have been instituted? Answer - Ninety-tw o prosecutions were approved of by the Minister and forwarded to the Crown Law Department, with instructions that proceedings be instituted. Of these46 cases were heard. Fines were inflicted in 44 cases, and 2 were dismissed. 37 cases were withdrawn after consultation with the Chief Prices Commissioner, pending the exhibition of lists of fixed prices. The Minister's minutes, dated 20th May, 1918, and 29th May, 1918, are attached. 2 cases were withdrawn on the recommendation of the Chief Prices Commissioner owing to the technical nature of the offences and the discovery that the prices order required amendment. . 3 cases against milk companies were withdrawn for the reasons set out in the answer to the first question. 2 cases were not proceeded with by the Crown Law Department, owing to lack «. or insufficiency of evidence. 2 cases have not yet been heard. Thirty-nine cases were not recommended by the Chief Prices Commissioner, in view of the decision to withhold prosecutions pending the exhibition of lists of fixed prices. Eight cases were not proceeded with by direction of the Chief Prices Commissioner, in view of satisfactory explanations having been given and no action deemed necessary. Question - In how many cases has the advice of his (the Minister's) responsible officers been turned down? Answer - On no occasion has the Minister "" turned d o w n "" the advice of his responsible officers. The minute which Mr Catts desires produced is attached. JAS. T. LENNON . 13th December, 1918. BOARD OF TRADE. (Memorandum.) Melbourne, 18th May, 1918. The Display of Publio Notices in Retail Establishments of Fixed Prices. Since taking control of price-fixing operations, I have been surprised at the very large number of prosecutions which it has been found necessary to institute against storekeepers for breaches of the price-fixing regulations. In most cases the amount actually involved on the individual purchase is of a most triflin g character, and frequently amounts to no more than i d. on the article, but, of course, representing in the aggregate a very considerable additional profit to the particular storekeeper involved. Steps have been taken in the past to notify the public as to the prices fixed from time to time for various commodities-firstly , by publication in the Gazette; secondly, by advertising in the press; and thirdly, by the issue of pamphlets containing a list of all the prices fixed. It has been found that none of these methods are really satisfactory, and they do not appear to have in any way prevented individual storekeepers overcharging in many items. The advertising in the press we found to be altogether too expensive, and, unless a practically continuous advertisement was arranged for, giving detailed price-lists, very little could be hoped for from this method. I have given a good deal of thought and consideration to this subject, and it appears to me that there should be no objection to the compulsory display in each establishment selling goods, the prices which have been fixed, of a proclamation setting for t h the fixed prices in bold characters. There are, however, difficulties in the way of this being done, the principle of which is that, whilst prices in the city areas are fixed at a certain definite figure for the most part, in the country districts the prices are conditioned by the cost of transportation, and it would be a very heavy task to ask the staff of the Price-Fixing Commission to work out a separate landed cost of goods throughout Australia. The otlier principal difficulty consists in many of the prices being fixed as a percentage over landed cost, the landed cost being a continually varying quantity. These difficulties, it seems to mc, can be surmounted by issuing the notices with three columns. In the first column would be printed the fixed price in the capital city from which the supplies are ordinarily drawn. The other two columns would be printed in blank, and it could be laid down in the regulations making the display of these notices compulsory, that the storekeeper should fill in No. 2 column the cost of transportation, and in No. 3 column the cost of which, based upon the proclaimed price plus the cost of transportation, he would be permitted to sell the article. In regard to the articles which are fixed on a percentage basis, the percentages could bo enumerated immediately after the name of the article in question, and in the same column. In column No. 1 the storekeeper would be compelled to insert his invoice price plus percentage allowed. This would apply equally to the count r y and the city. In the second column he would in the country insert his cost of transportation, and in the third column the price at which he would be permitted to sell. I strongly recommend to the Board the adoption of this procedure, for the following reasons:- I am practically certain that, at the present time, there is a very widespread evasion of the price-fixing regulations, and without an army of inspectors constantly moving throughout the country, it is practically impossible to enforce them. In the event of a compulsory exhibition of the prices in the shops being adopted, the people themselves would police the operations of the price-fixing regulations, and a ll that it would be necessary to do would be from time to time to check the placards in each store. think that this could easily be arranged through the police force, who could take down, on forms supplied, the actual prices displayed, and forward same to the head office in each State to be checked. It seems to me that it would avoid a good deal of expenditure which otherwise it would be necessary to incur if there is to be anything like adequate supervision of the price fixing operations. I recommend that the Government bear the cost of tliese placards, and that the distribution be made to the post-offices, it being made compulsory for. each storekeeper to provide himself with a copy. I attach hereto specimen notice which it would he necessary for the storekeeper to exhibit. 20th May, 1918. Mr Greene. Commonwealth of Australia. PROCLAIMED PRIOES.

WAR - TI ME PROFITSTAX ASSESSMENT BILL In Committee (Consideration resumed from l l t h December, vide page 9108) : ' Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section 4 of the principal Act is amended by inserting after the definition of ""Co-operative company"" the following definitions:""'Established business' means a business other than a new business. ' "" ' New business' means a business which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was not commenced until on or after the 4th day of August, 1913, and was not reasonably established until - on or after the 4th day of August, 1914.""",23
34,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.15] - I have circulated three amendments dealing with co-operative societies, and this is a convenient occasion for explaining their intention. As I stated in my speech on the second reading, the Government wishes to exempt from taxation the profits made hy co-operative companies in trading with their own members. Certain exemptions were given to co-operative companies by the original Act, but they are not deemed wide enough because it has been found by experience that certain supplying organizations, which are not in any sense profiteering concerns, might be levied on. The object of these three amendmentsand two of them are very technical-is to exempt the profits of co-operative societies arising out of business done with their own members. We do catch, as the amendments are framed, a certain portion of the profits of these organizations, which are not full y co-operative. HonA. A. ACKERMAN, Commissioner. orable members are aware of quite a number of such organizations in the different States. To the extent that they do ordinary trading business with non-memPERCY WHITTON, bers, they will still be liable, under the Chief Prices Commissioner. arrangement suggested, to pay taxation on the excess profit, if an excess profit is visible, in their returns. As the first W.M.G. technical step towards carrying out this object, I move That the word "" Co-operative "" be left out.",26
35,Mr CHARLTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Hunter) [11.17] - I wish to be clear in regard to this matter. Are we to understand that the proposed omission of the word "" co-operative"" is preliminary to a further amendment of the principal Act other than is provided for in the Bill itself, or is it merely to make it clearer that the intention of the Government is that all sales by a co-operative society to its members shall be free of this tax?",26
36,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,That is so.,26
37,Mr CHARLTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,W h i l e purchases made by non-members will he subject to the tax?,26
38,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"The amendment makes clearer, on a revision of the draft, our intention, as announced by me, not to tax the profits of these societies arising out of the purchases of members.",26
39,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Maribyrnong) [11.20]. - Co-operativ e dairying companies have' been started in all the States, and originally shares were taken up, not only by suppliers of cream and milk, but in many cases by storekeepers and others who wished these eoncerns to he successfully established in their midst. Dairymen who subsequently came into these districts were unable to. obtain shares, since they had already been taken up ; but as suppliers of milk or' cream to a co-operative butter factory in which they do not hold shares, they receive encouragement in the shape of a bonus. Are we to understand that those who receive bonuses from a co-operative society in which they are not shareholders will be taxed in respect of those bonuses?",26
40,Mr NICHOLLS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Macquarie) [11.22]. - There are a number of co-operative societies paying bonuses to customers who are not shareholders. Eor instance, the Lithgow Co-operative Society has quite a number of customers who are not shareholders, and during the last four years a bonus of Is. 3d. in the £1 has been paid to these people. If that society, amongst others, is called upon to pay this tax in respect of the bonuses it will he hit for a considerable amount. Further than that, both shareholders and non-shareholders would thus be doubly taxed since they would have to pay this tax as well as the Federal income tax. I should like to know what is the actual position in regard to such a society.",27
41,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Capricornia)* [11.24] Those who appreciate the great work being done by co-operative societies of farmers and dairymen will applaud the Treasurer's proposal to exempt co-operative companies in which not less than two-thirds of the shares are held by members who are bond fide primary producers or suppliers to the company. That, however, will not meet the case of co-operative societies such as those mentioned by the honourable member for' Macquarie (Mr. Nicholls) - societie s consisting of a num: ber of people who have banded together for the distribution of groceries and other goods at the lowest possible cost. Such societies, founded upon the example of the Rochdale Stores, in the Old Country, in many cases have been a great success. The co-operative societies in Sydney, Brisbane, and Rockhampton, however, have not been so successful, owing to the high cost of distributing goods amongst shareholders living in the outside suburbs. Where a number of persons band together in this way to distribute goods as cheaply as possible amongst themselves, I suggest that they should be exempt from the operation of the Act.",27
42,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"The Bill as originally introduced does that, and the amendments we are now proposing will make our intention more specific and definite.",27
43,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,That is the point that I desired to have cleared up.,27
44,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer [11.26] - I sliould, perhaps, have given a fuller explanation of these amendments, but I imagined that those honourable memlbers who had special knowledge of the various classes of co-operative societies would he able from the amendments circulated to follow our intention. The position is that at present certain co-operative societies are absolutely exempt. In paragraph b of section 8 of the original Act we exemptThe business of co-operative companies engaged, for the main part, in the manufacture, preparation or wholesale distribution of foodstuffs, the produce of Australia so far as regards the manufacture, preparation, or wholesale distribution of food-stuffs, the produce of Australia. On representations being made to me by several honourable members that there were otherforms of co-operation that were likely to he hit by the Act, in producing this Bill, at the end of clause 7, I made a further exemption of certain classes of co-operative societies, and if the amendment he agreed to, the exemption will be so widened as to embrace those societies to which reference has been made hy the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls), and, I believe, tihe honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). The exemption at the end of clause 7, to which I have just referred, readsIn calculating the profits of a co-operative company or society there shall be deducted so much of the profits as is distributed or set aside for distribution as bonuses to its members. That means that societies of the character referred to by the honourable member for Macquarie-supplyin g societies, and not butter and bacon factories, which are already dealt with in the original Actwill be exempt from the tax so far as the business of legitimate co-operation is concerned.",27
45,Mr SAMPSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,The amendment does not affect the position of primary producing co-operative societies under the original Act?,27
46,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,-No ; it preserves to them the exemption they enjoy under the original Act.,28
47,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,In some cases the exemption is widened so far as they are concerned.,28
48,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"The amendment may help certain classes of these societies to secure a wider benefit than before. Cooperative businesses for the manufacture and distribution of primary products will - stand precisely as before, but the exemption will now be so widened as to apply to other forms of co-operative societies. - I think, therefore, that the amendment will be regarded as conferring a benefit and protection which these organizations are justly entitled to claim. As to the honourable member for Maribyrnong's - inquiry, I presume the honourable member has in his mind cheese, butter, and bacon factories, and organizations of the kind.",28

I suggest that he ought to omit the words "" was not commenced until on of after the 4th August, 1913, and,"" so as to leave the date of the "" reasonable establishment"" of a business the 4th August, 1914. This would meet the case of a company that had not had time in the twelve months to become established. Twelve months is a very short time to allow.",28
53,Sir ROBEET BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Kooyong) [11.32]. - This definition of "" new business "" is very embarrassing, drawing an arbitrary line as it does. Possibly some date must be fixed, and more or less arbitrarily; but it is somewhat unfair when speaking of a new business to take twelve months before the commencement of the war. Very frequently a new business requires up to six years before it is put on a payable basis. It would be much fairer to go back three years, seeing that "" pre-war standard,"" ""pre-war capital,"" and so forth, all have reference to a period of three years before the war, and that, in my opinion, is not an unreasonable period to adopt in this connection with new businesses. I admit the difficulty of the Treasurer, and that some interpretation must be given in order to give new businesses the benefit of the terms of the Act. But while a certain amount of relief is obtained, twelve months before the war is not sufficiently long, and I suggest three years.",28
54,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.34] - I should like to explain some of the difficulties which are not easily settled in connection with this matter. A date must be. inserted as the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) suggests, because we are dealing with points of time, with ""new"" or ""established businesses,"" the terms used in the Act. The question, clause therefore, to be determined by the Taxing Office and the Government, in giving relief to new businesses, was how to describe a ""new business."" The original desire of myself was to date a new business from the outbreak of the war, seeing that it had no pre-war test at all. At the same time, I was acquainted with businesses, and representations were made to me in respect to a large number of others, which had just heen set going before the war; and it, therefore, became necessary to find a date. It is, of course, a matter of opinion whether this arbitrary date is a wise or fair one.",28
55,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"You r protection is the words "" was not reasonably established until,"" and so on. Mr ""WATT-But the honourable member suggested that it takes four years or more to "" reasonably establish a business,"" and that is the difficulty. I . must think of the administration of the measure, and place no difficulty in the way of the collecting and assessing authority. It is,- as I say, a matter of opinion whether the provision is unduly liberal or unduly restrictive. I think it would be unwise to make the period three years, but I am prepared to meet honourable members by making the year 1912. To that end I desire, first, to withdraw the amendment I have just moved Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

I do 'not think I need dwell on the reasons for this proposed amendment. Any honourable member with a knowledge of country pursuits must know that the path of a stud breeder of cattle, sheep, and pigs is rather an unequal one. Sometimes, by the exercise of much skill, he gets a. good stud ram, and for a time he has a rush and may in one year make a fair sum.

57,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"What would you do with the man ""who sold a £4,000 ram the other day?",30
58,Mr LECKIE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I would give him a gold medal for raising a ram' of that value. I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment as a reasonable one from every point of view.,30
59,Mr ATKINSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wilmot) [11.41] I should like to add a word in support of the amendment, which, if accepted, will do much good to producing interests. As already pointed out, the majority of people who cultivate stud stock begin in a very small way. I know one gentleman in Victoria who was occupied for years in getting his cattle of good strain together, and yet he has no pre-war standard of profits, because, up to that time, he had really heen working at a loss. There are many others in the same position, and if now, when their ventures have become remunerative, they are called upon to give 75 per cent, of their profits in taxation, they will, of course, stop operations. It is necessary in a country like Australia that the very best stock should be used. Australia is a great country for sheep and cattle, and it is absolutely necessary that the best strains possible should be cultivated, otherwise we shall lose our premier position in this regard. It must be observed that the amendment refers only to cases where the stud stock is sold by the breeder; any dealers who take part in the business will, of course, be liable to the tax. Although there are a great many people affected by the amendment the revenue involved would not benefit the Treasury to any extent; whereas if this class of breeder is not empt considerable 'harm may be done to stock. Mr Watt. (Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.44] - It must not be supposed that I am in any way unsympathetic with the men who are raising stud stock. I fully recognise that the breed of stock in this country must be kept up, and that the industry of the stock breeder is of the greatest possible importance as the basic one of the primary industries. But I am assured by the taxation authorities that there will be trouble if an amendment of this kind is accepted by the Committee. First of all, I may say that the small man working up a little stud-stock business will not be touched by the Bill as it stands, because he will not come within the scope of the Act unless he earns over £1,000 per year. The difficulty is that if we were to exempt this branch of the pastoral industry-it is just as much a branch of the pastoral industry as is fattening and selling-som e large breeders of stock or holders of studs would benefit whom I do not feel inclined to exempt.",30
60,Mr ATKINSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,They would only be exempt to the extent of their stud stock. Most pastoralists make their money out of wool and other things.,30
61,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"The honourable member for Hume. (Mr Falkiner), if he were here, could tell, perhaps, better than any one else, what profits are made through breeding stud stock. I think, without doing the honourable member an injustice, I am safe in saying that where one holding is used by his widespread firm purely for pastoral purposes, another of exactly the same class is used exclusively for stud purposes.",30
62,Mr LECKIE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I do not think that he would apply for exemption.,30
63,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"I do not think that he would, but, still, there are in Australia many big stud-stock breeders carrying on no other branch of the pastoralist's business who are making big profits, and I do not think that they should ask for exemption. Another class mixes the business of raising stud stock with that of fattening and selling. The man who is carrying on a mixed business and has a fairly good ex- stud may occasionally put his rams or his ewes into his own flocks. How are we to draw the line between the stud section and the grazing section of such a business ? If a man comes down to the sheep sales with a fewfirst-classrams and sells them for a few hundred pounds each, or for any amount up to £1,000 each, those profits can be traced and possibly exempted, though, it would he difficult to do it with accuracy; but .if, instead of doing this, he sent some of his stud stock into his own flocks it would be an almost impossible task to identify and tax the different classes of receipts. In the circumstances, I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment at this stage, because I want to see whether, on a very careful review of the position, the taxation officers can suggest a remedy which will relieve the men whom we do not desire to tax without opening too widely the door for the exemption of the other class who do not deserve to escape the taxation, because in recent years the profits of graziers generally have been very substantial, and even in some cases ascendingly substantial.  not quite agree with the Acting Prime Minister that the acceptance of the Bill will not injure small men. Any one who understands the pastoral business knows that the big men were making large profits before the war, so that their position will not be affected. The very fact that they were making big profits before the war will enable them to escape this taxation. Mr ""WATT - The price of wool and meat has helped them.  the backs of stud sheep that represents the breeders' profit. One breeder recently sold a ram for £3,000. The wool on its hack weighed 30 lbs., and, as ram's wool is inclined to be a little bit coarse, it was probably not worth more than Is. to Is. 6d. per lb., so that the value ' of the fleece of this £3,000 ram would not he more than 30s. to 43s. Thus, a 50 per eent. increase in the price of wool would have very little effect upon the profits of a stud stock-raiseT. The real value of the efforts of a stud stockraiser come when other pastoralists take advantage of them and purchase stock from him. The stud-breeders have done more to bring about Australia's prosperity than have any other set of men in the Commonwealth. They are a class who should be encouraged, particularly the small men among them. The big man who has heen making profits before the war will not be affected hy this tax, but it will hit the small man who happens to make a profit of £1,500 in one of the war years, £500 of which may he excess profit. He has to maintain his position by purchases from other breeders, and if the Taxation Commissioner takes away practically the whole of his money h'e will be considerably hindered in his operations. I was talking to one gentleman the other day, who informed me that whereas the average return from his father's flock some years ago was about 5 lbs. of wool per sheep, this had now increased to 10^ lbs. of wool per sheep. If the stud stock-breeders of. Australia can bring about that result, it means all-round prosperity to the community. Therefore, I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the amendment.",30
64,Mr CHARLTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Hunter) [11.54] The Acting Prime Minister has given a very satisfactory assurance to the mover of the amendment. There are hard cases in connection with all taxation, and I am afraid that we cannot amend the clause in the direction desired without including the big grazier spoken of by the Acting Prime Minister, who, in addition to having a pastoral holding for trading purposes, also has one for breeding purposes. Such a man should pay the tax if he is making a lot of money. However, the case cited by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) is quite a different matter. He speaks of a cattlebreeder who, prior to the war, had made no profits worth speaking of, but had simply been getting his stud in order, and has now arrived at a stage when he can look for some return. As the Acting Prime Minister has said, this man is entitled to an exemption of £1,000, and an income of £1,000 is .a very fair one, hut he may have been in financial difficulties in the pre-war years, and he may have had to make arrangements for liquidating his liabilities out of his present profits'. In such a case, some concession might reasonably be made. If we insist on collecting war profits from the poorer class of cattle or sheep breeder, the result may be that he may not sell his stock until after the Act expires, seeing that it has only a few months to run after the war. It is to - tie advantage of the country if stock can be successfully raised, and we should assist a man who is a small breeder to put his stock into use. The greater the production of a country the better it must be for the nation. I would not support any proposition to exempt the big man who is making large sums of money hy breeding stock, but there*are exceptions; there are .many men in a small way of business who have not done too well prior to the enactment of this, taxation, and it would be better to d r a ft an amendment to meet .their case. In the meantime, I urge the mover of the amendment to accept the suggestion made by the Acting Prime Minister.",31
65,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Would the Acting Prime Minister make a statement with reference to the position of t in producers?,32
66,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Yes , at a later stage.",32

68,Mr CHARLTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"It could be done the case of a man who is this year, for the first time, in a position to make profits.",32
69,Mr LECKIE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is so. A gentleman who took the prize for English Leicester sheep in Victoria last yeaT lost two of his best animals when he was bringing them to Melbourne on the occasion of the last show. He suffered a great loss on the year's operations through that mishap. However, I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will consult with his officers and endeavour to meet the cases I have mentioned, and ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",32
70,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Kooyong) [12.0]. - Paragrap h (i) introduces a dangerous and vicious principle, inasmuch as it gives the Governor General in Council or the Minister for the time being power to exempt any company from taxation. That is a power of discrimination beyond the control of Parliament. It may, and undoubtedly would, in the hands of the present Government be honestly and fairly exercised. But there is a danger t h at undue political influence might be brought to bear. This paragraph opens the door for the introduction of political influence to secure the exemption of some mining concerns from taxation. I urge the Treasurer to either strike out t h at paragraph or to propose some modifications or safeguards. If it were prescribed that tjjis exemption should only be given by regulation which would have to be laid upon the table of the House, and be more or less subject to parliamentary negotiation, that would, be some, although not sufficient, protection. I think this power ought to be surrounded by direct safeguards and that the Parliament should have the right to say whether any proposed exemption was proper.",32
71,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.4] - The remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong carried my memory back to the days of my legislative childhood, when he was a leading and influential member of the old State Parliament, and I recollect using, from the Ministerial corner, arguments very similar to those which the honourable gentleman has just addressed to me. I was opposed, at that time, to in legislation by the Governor in Council, and I think that I have explained on more than one measure this session that I thoroughly believe in the views expressed' by the honourable member for Kooyong. If we have a democratic form of government we ought, as far as possible, to give it a democratic spirit. Regarding the application of that spirit to the Bill for the extension of the War Precautions Act, I have had to cross swords with honourable members opposite more often than I liked, because I am of opinion that, abnormal times frequently compel the Government to adopt abnormal measures. But I wish to see the abnormality disappear as fast as possible. <The idea of inserting paragraph (i) in this clause was not to give power of political patronage to the Minister administering"" the Act , although that may be its effect. The paragraph was primarily designed to help the tin-mining industry. Representations have come from Tasmania and other States, that the t in industry should be given total exemption.",32
72,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Coul d not that ex* emption be inserted in the Bill?,32
73,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"If the Committee to give total exemption to the tin-mining industry, that can be done explicitly, the same way as it has been done already ih the case of the gold-mining but I do not think that such a provision would be quite fair or elastic enough to meet some of the cases that may arise. When the principal Act was before the House, mining for tungsten metals, at the suggestion of the honourable for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) was wholly exempted if the business had been commenced after a certain time, and if the total produce had been sold for munition purposes to the British or Allied orities. I think we should condition any exemption of metals that are and may be munitions of war, by some such condition. If the Committee prefers that the Bill should definitely to what metals and under what conditions' exemption should be given, I shall try to frame a clause to that effect, but I am afraid that it will be a clumsy attempt, and that we may include interests which should be excluded, vice versa. I would remind the Committee that political influence can have no real effect in connection with this taxation. The land tax is administered by the Commissioner, subject to the control of the Minister, but in income tax administration the Minister plays no part. Of course', before a proclamation can issuo a Minister must operate it through the Executive Council, but it cannot be suggested that a Minister would, without having received proper representations from the Taxation Commissioner, submit any Executive minute that would confer exemption. In other words, if the Legislature is prepared to say that it is dangerous to .allow the Governor General in Council to do so much with taxation as the clause proposes, it must be prepared to place trust in the Commissioner with the independent status which Parliament has conferred upon him. The Commissioner has to report in a regular way what has been done. He has responsibiliof paragraph i. ties which are non-political and non-personal, and the Act throughout gives h much discretion, showing that Parliament trusts the Commissioner in the exercise of desires his powers. However, we have to make a choice of two open roads. I think I in can d r a f t an amendment which will hedge and condition this power with some safeindustry, guards, hut I may make the mistake of leaving the door not sufficiently ajar, and not giving that due exemption to mining interests which it may be desirable to give. member Sir ROBERT BEST - We could provide that the regulations should be laid on the table with in seven days ",33
74,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That could be done, or we could provide that the exemptions auth- should apply to only specified metals. T certainly think that such a limitation would be too rigid. However, I am prepared to meet the wishes of the Committee, prbvided we are able to give specify enough elasticity to the clause to permit us to give assistance to the tin-mining in dustry which especially has felt the strain and duress of war. Although the price of t in has been high, and the industry has been stimulated by that fact, the threat and of the tax gatherer lurking round thecorner in readiness to take 15s."" of every £1 of profit made after incurring all the risks attendant upon mining, has deterred the opening up of new shows.",33
75,Mr ATKINSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Would the revenue suffer seriously if mining generally were exempted ?,33
76,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I am not prepared to dothat. A general exemption would extend to the Broken Hill and M t . Lyell Companies.

81,Mr BOYD,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"There is no proposed basis. Absolute discretion is left to the man administering the Act, or to the Governor General in Council. I think this will he placing the Executive in an awkward position in having to determine between various interests. It would be much better, in the interests of the community generally, if the Treasurer would consent to provide that tin-mining, which is the industry he has particularly in mind, shall be wholly exempt. That would make the administration of the law much easier for the Government.",34
82,Mr SPENCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Darwin) [12.14] - The constituency I represent is interested in this matter, and a number of very clear cases have been submitted to me which show the effect which even the proposal to impose taxation has had in preventing the development of t in mines, and investment in new propositions. At this time particularly the country does not desire that taxation should interfere - with development. Only by tremendously in creased production can the Commonwealth be placed on a sound financial footing. Not only does the taxation prevent investors from putting their money into new propositions, but in some cases it has prevented the carrying on of existing mines. Some small companies and syndicates have worked their properties for a number of years, and received practically no return for their money. After doing a great deal of dead work, and in stalling expensive plant, they were eventually ahle to open up payable ore. In spite of the fact that they have put up a plant which would enable them to treat five times as much as they could previously treat, they are not using it full y, because they know that if they did the tax-gatherer would take from them the profits which would be the result of twenty years of outgoings. Naturally they say, "" We shall wait until the war is over, and then we shall be recouped for our losses over the past twenty years."" T know of another case which is similar. You cannot compel mines to be worked under these circumstances, and it is not fair that their profits should be taxed. The case cc-uld be met by exempting t in mining entirely from the operation of the Aot.",34
83,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"If that were done, oldestablished and successful mines like the Mount Bischoff mine would be exempted.",34
84,Mr SPENCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"It would, ""of course, be wrong to exempt rich companies. Perhaps, on the whole, it would be best to agree to the Government's proposal. Some honourable members Iof late have made a good deal of the regulations under the War Precautions Act , t u t usually we hear very little about regulations.

The company has several dredges. During the three years that I have mentioned it was working through dead and practically unpayable ground in the effort to shift its dredges to another paddock, where they knew that payable t in could be obtained. These dredges could not be dismantled. employees of the company number some hundreds. By working practically at a loss for some time, and contributing freely to calls, the company was enabled this year to show a profit of £9,528 16s. 3d. Should the Bill pass as it stands, the company will be taxed on that profit without. being given a set-off in its losses during the lean years.",34
91,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Was the company operating prior to 1915 ? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It operating in the New England for twelve or fifteen years. When it has worked out one paddock, it has shifted its dredges to others, and has removed some dredges to places 40 or 50 miles away from where they were first employed, in order to exploit old alluvial tin workings. Should the Bill be passed as it stands, the company will have to pay to the taxing officer practically the whole of the £9,528, which is this year's profit.

94,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"You said that those provisions applied to new businesses only. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The company about which I am speaking is an old business. Although in 1916 it made a profit of £1,062, it also called up £2,250, or £1,200 over and above its profit for the year. At the present time no industry in Australia requires more careful handling than the tin-mining industry. When a man puts his money into a business or a farm, he sees a good chance of making a profit out of his investment, but those who invest money in mining concerns often pay heavily for developmental work, merely with the hope of securing a quite The problematic reward. The Government says that it wishes to encourage the production of base metals; but when investors put their hands into their pockets to pay for prospecting and developing, they are told that if their speculation is successful, and if , as the result of spending £5,000 or £10,000 during two or three years, they ultimately make a profit, the taxing master will take a great part of the profit with the war-time profits tax. The ultimate result in some cases has been would be that where there are three district shifts being worked, only one will be worked in the future , the company preferring to wait for a more favourable opportunity to win the metal. This measure may thus become the means of closing down a number of mines and the sacking of a number of men who have been"" following mining for many years. New businesses are ta be exempted from the war-time profits tax, but it will be very hard on old-established concerns that have carried a heavy burden for years, and have kept their employees together when their returns were little ox Why none at all, if the Government takes from them practically the whole of any reward that may ultimately come to them as the result of their courage and energy. I ask the Acting Prime Minister not to leave it to the discretionary power of a taxing officer to provide for exemptions by pro»clamations. We know all about the circumstances of these companies, and why should we not provide for their straight out exemption ?",35

I have had eight or nine years' experience as a working miner, and look to new developments of all forms of mining to assist us in getting out of the r u t in which we have been placed by the war. I would mention the case of a mine in the Cobar district, which has had a very long and chequered career. Scores of deserving business, professional, and other men had so much faith in the enterprise that they invested almost the whole of their savings in it ; but it was not until the war began, and a short line of railway was constructed, that the mine became a payable one. It is now a very profitable enterprise, but the shareholders had already expended over £80,000 in the dead work of development before they secured any ret u r n . It seems very hard that these men, who stood by the mine for years, should now be told that Is. 6d. out of every 2s. of profit made by the mine is to be taken over by the Government.",36
97,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is not the position, under the Act , in regard to any proposition. The tax is Is. 6d. out of every 2s. of the excess profit, if any, made.",36

100,Mr LYNCH,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That does not protect this company, which has now become a very big producer, and has undoubtedly made very large profits. The shareholders waited a very long time for any return on their capital, and surely we ought to be able to frame an amendment differentiating between companies that have been securing a profitable return for years, and ventures of this kind which are of a pioneering character. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT (New England) [12.35] - I wish to ascertain what will be the exact position in the event of our not urging that the tin-mining industry be wholly exempt from the Act. A r e we to understand that cases of the kind quoted by me would receive very favourable consideration at the hands of the Commissioner 1 I do not suggest that the - Government are going to specially exempt the particular company to which I referred.

I tackled the matter just as the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has done, and tried to evolve some cleancut provision. I found, however, thatsuch a provision would be just in one case and unjust in the other, and that if the Legislature was prepared to trust the Commissioner in the ordinary sense, it would be far better to adopt this elastic form of provision, for the reason that, as the honourable member for Elinders (Mr . Bruce) said last night, the principal Act , like the War Precautions Act , has just about run its course. Whether we like it or not, we are looking back over at least two and a half years. There is not a feature of the Bill as brought down by me, whether it be the g if t or the levy feature that is not retrospective. In that regard it is totally different from any other Bill we have introduced.",36
102,Mr BOTD,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"We should take, it to the cemetery and bury it .",36

104,Mr BOYD,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I have every sympathy with them.,36
105,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"I can only say that the honourable member has a curious way of showing it . There are in the Act today three kinds of special provisions with regard to mining companies, two of them heing special, while the other is general. Under the general provision they have, together with all other enterprises, the pre-war test, or the 10 per cent, rate, whichever they elect to take. Then we have two special provisions for mining companies. We have the developmental provision under which a mining Board or management, if it makes a profit of £10,000, can set aside £5,000 for developmental work, and that amount is at once deducted in the assessment of the tax for the year. The Commissioner traces that £5,000 into the accounting period for the next year to see that it is used. If it is used, it disappears altogether, and is not taxed. If it is not used, it becomes taxable in that accounting period unless by the same process it is carried into the third year. We give, as far a3 it is possible to do so, ah allowance for a wasting asset. The management is called upon to judge, if it can, the l if e of a given undertaking, and if a thing has a five years' life, the amortization allowance, as in the Act, allows for it in that way. The more honourable members study this question, unless they set out on a road different from that which the Government had to take in their investigation, the more convinced fchey will be that it is wise to allow this elastic provision to remain, even at the risk of having it regarded as too great a trust to place in the Commissioner or the Executive. such a provision the Commissioner is able to take into consideration not a given company proposition, but a given class of cases in any of the mining industries, and where he deems it desirable he can recommend the issue of a proclamation setting out the conditions that he regards as equitable for the assessment of enterprises such as the honourable member for New England has referred to.",36
106,Mr GKEGOKY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Were any of the Chambers of Mines consulted as to the method of giving this assistance?,37
107,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Speakin g from memory I do not think they were consulted in a formal way, hut I have had so many conversations with representative citizens who know the interests affected hy this provision, that I think I can say that a large number of mining men have considered it .",37

109,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"This measure does not tax wages. If it did, I should answer the honourable member's inquiry in the affirmative. This is supposed to be a tax on capital, and occupations are specially exempted from the operation of the Act . The question which honourable members have to ask themselves is, whether they are prepared to take the road which gives us elasticity and the power to provide against hard cases, or the rigid road which the Legislature must adopt when it wishes to bind the Executive. This provision, I think, will meet the circumstances better than any other.",37
110,Mr CORSER,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wide Bay) [12.41] I . think we shall all agree that elasticity in a provision of this kind is to be desired.

111,Mr CORSER,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"I am glad to have that assurance, since some companies are not working to their full extent because of Under the fear that they would be taxed to the extent of 75 per cent, of their excess profits.",37

114,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Dampier) [12.43] In connection with this clause it has been - suggested that all base metals should be exempt. Such an exemption would mean an enormous loss to the Treasury. Big corporations, like the Broken Hill Proprietary and the Sulphide Corporation, - would be exempt from the taxation of excess profits. The further suggestion was made that t in mining should be exempted. There is no difference between t in mining and lead or copper mining. All these metals are being produced in the several States by people ""who are experiencing the same sort of difficulties. If , however, some assistance is not given, many small mines which have not a fair pre-war standard of profits will have to close down, and many men will thus be thrown out of employment. We realise how unfair the present Act is. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company and other big organizations, for instance, had an enormous pre-war standard of profits, and if they keep their profits down to the pre-war standard they have not to pay even 6d. under this tax. On the other hand, mines that might have had a very small pre-war standard will be compelled to hand over to the Government 50 per cent, or 75 per cent, of their excess profits I think the Treasurer has endeavoured to realise the difficulties we are up against at the present time. When I was in Western Australia recently I was shown a wonderfully rich lead deposit about 80 miles north of Geraldton; and I honestly believe that if it were possible to attract capital to its development it would be the means of affording immediate employment to 400 or 500 men. We all know how different from all other businesses mining is, in that it is almost wholly speculative; so much so, that 95 per cent, or 97 per cent, of the companies formed turn out failures. There are very few prizes, hut so speculative is the business that people can always be found to put a few pounds into a mining venture. We desire to help, not only mines which were unprofitable prior to the war, but also new fields that are discovered. Geraldton case, if investors were satisfied they would get a fair deal from the vernment, money would be forthcoming. We all know how copper, lead, t in , and other metals have increased in value; and no doubt money would be available for such a speculation. But it is realized that, there being no pre-war standard available to them, the only profit obtainable would be 10 per cent, on the capital, which, in mining, is insufficient to induce capital, owing to it being a wasting asset. I can only say that I should not like to be the Minister who has to administer this Bill , for, of course, it cannot be left to the Commissioner.",37
115,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"The Commissioner may recommend, hut the Minister alone can proclaim through the agency of the Governor General in Council.",38
116,Mr GEEGOEY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I do not suppose that the Treasurer would consider it advisable to issue a proclamation in reference to any particular mining venture?,38
117,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,No .,38
118,Mr GEEGOEY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"For some years I controlled what is known as the State battery system in Western Australia, and the difficulty was to give assistance to ventures that were not ordinarily profitable. The suggestion was often made that we should give special treatment to low-grade propositions; but a. big low-grade proposition, with fair values, may be much more valuable than a small one of rich ore. The latter requires much more labour to extract the ore, while the larger one, as I say, may prove to be the more valuable mining venture. I can foresee a great number of difficulties in connection with a clause like this, and the heart burnings and adverse comment that may result. The Treasurer may remember that last year the t in miners of Tasmania put a proposition to him. They asked that, under the Act, the Government should declare the pre-war standard of value for tin, say, £200 peT ton, and give a special allowance on account of the increased cost of production caused by the war, and then fix the present standard of value, and they were prepared to pay war-time profits tax In the on the ^ difference between the pre-war value, plus the increased cost of producGo- tion, and the present value. That struck me as a very fair proposition, only I think if the Government could accept the suggestion to fix the pre-war and present-war values, and then have power by proclamation or otherwise to permit the people who speculate in mining, if they have not paid back a certain proportion",38
119,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is to say, a certain proportion of the capital?",39
120,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Yes ; I do not say that they should pay the whole.,39

Is there any reason? There is a S irinciple, or want of principle, undeTying this Bill ; in my opinion, it is crude in the extreme, and it is very satisfactory to hear from the honourable gentleman that it is not intended to keep it in force for any length of time: A company-it may he one of the wealthiest in Australia - whic h has been paying enormous dividends for a great number of years; may just now embark in some other branch of an ultimately lucrative character. In such a case, the excess profits will be practically nil, and under the Bill such a company will escape taxation. If , however, we take the case of a company which has been delving along for many years, and simply keeping itself alive with heavy calls, we find that if , from any cause Whatever, it is now able to make profits, practically all the profits are taken by the Government. By no stretch of the imagination can this be called fair or scientific taxation.",39
126,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"I have been looking for a scientific tax for years. Mr MCWILLIAMS.:-Then _ I think that the honourable gentleman, in despair of finding a scientific tax, took the first one that came along. If the honourable gentleman will allow me to say so, he Bas my sympathy in having to ""father"" a great many proposals. The object of this Bill, when it was introduced, by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), in his capacity as Treasurer, was to secure the public from undue profiteering during the war. That, I venture to say, was a legitimate and laudable object; but the Bill, during its progress, or want of progress, through the House, was conthe verted into a War-time Profits Bill, at the instance of the late lamented Lord' Forrest, when he was Treasurer. Immediately, however, that gentleman, and, I believe, every honourable member, found that Uhe grafting of one principle on to the other had resulted most unsatisfactorily and disastrously. The Act does not protect the public of Australia from the making of undue profits by traders as the actual result of the war; and it inflicts a serious injustice when it results in such instances as I have just presented.",39
127,Mr SPENCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,The Treasurer is meeting that difficulty with this amendment.,39
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is true, but only to an extent. Can the Treasurer give any reason why coal mining should be exempt?

136,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is so-to keep it within the taxable area. Mr MoWILLIAMS - The Treasurer must realise the unfairness that may arise under this measure. The Broken Hill Proprietary Oompany is, I suppose, one of the biggest paying companies in Australia, and it has just started an important branch of iron manufacture. This, of course, every one welcomes; but. because the company expends its profits in establishing this new branch of business- a hranch which, after the operation of this Bill expires, wiU he extremely remunerative-it is exempt.",40
137,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Is it? Look at the Newcastle balance-sheet of last year.

If this amendment is carried, all agents will be exempted, not only those who carry on an agency work solely, but also those who carry on businesses in addition to their agency work. Of two firms, one earning £5,000 a year from agency work solely, and another earning £5,000 from agency work, and an additiontal £1,000 a year from some other business, the former will be totally exempted from war-time profits taxation, while the latter will be called upon to pay to the Treasury three-fourths of its income above an allowance for its pre-war standard. My contention is that if it be a wise principle to exempt agents, any firm that can reasonably show that portion of its income is derived solely from agency work in which it has no capital invested, should be exempted to the extent of that portion of its income. If the principle of exempting agents holds good in one case, it ought to hold good all through. If the one class of trader is not to be exempted, then the other class, doing exactly the same business, should not be exempted. We should not create anomalies and unfairness between firms whose source of income is exactly the same. I ask the Treasurer to give the matter serious consideration, and apply a general exemption to all agents who can satisfy the Taxation Commissioner that portion of their income is earned from agency work in which they have no capital invested.",40
146,Mr RICHARD FOSTEE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wakefield) [2.35] - Some stock and station agents whose businesses are amongst the largest Australia derive a very large proportion of their earnings from commission work, and, as the stock they handle has doubled in value during these past few years, they have had a very big turnover during the period of the war. Will the clause exempt these big firms 1",40
147,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Dampier) [2.36] I am under the impression that this clause will exempt jobbers, a type of people who are living on the necessities of the community. They find where there is a scarcity of any particular commodity, and as they are in a position to get inside in formation they can use it to their own special advantage. Recently, I am informed, a commission firm, hearing that there was a possibility of permission being - given to export honey, bought up large quantities of it in New South Wales at a low figure, and shipped it away. As a result, they made a large profit. I understand that many of these jobbers in Melbourne and Sydney have made large sums of money during the period of the war. If that is correct, I cannot understand what is actuating the Treasurer in asking that they should be exempted.",41
148,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer). [2.38] - The object of the clause is to eliminate from taxation agency businesses that are mainly ""the result of personal exertion. The wartime profits tax is an impost on the proceeds of capital in excess of pre-war standards, but there is a class of agent who employs little or in his business. His peculiar skill or knowledge of selling on mission enables him to earn a good income. It was represented to the Taxation Department that it was quite unfair to assume that a man who does not handle his own goods, hut merely has an office and a very small staff, and practically no capital, should be put on the same basis as the man who buys and sells goods, particularly while we propose to exclude from the operation of the Act men who make incomes hy personal exertion in any occupation or employment.",41
149,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,Will not the big houses in Australia. motor people come under that heading?,41
150,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"I should say that they have a lot of capital invested in their businesses. This clause applies to the agent who has little or no capital invested in his business. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has said that the words included in brackets in the clause give inequitable treatment to the agent who carries on some other kind of business. There might be a good case put up for the honourable member's amendment if we had no knowledge of the nature of the various businesses which are carried on. The very words to which the honourable member objects, and which he seeks to have omitted, were included for the purpose of catching the class of persons upon whom the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Eoster) placed his finger. In the stock and station life of Australia there are different classes of agents; there are some men in large centres of population who are doing very large businesses and controlling a vast amount of capital.",41
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,They are having a pretty bad time at present.,41
152,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Some of them have had a very good time. But I do not wish to dwell on that matter. It is one which assessment alone can determine. I know one man who discounts all his own paper. He has one of the largest businesses in Vietoria. He has a huge capital in it,' and it is the capital as well as the experience and connexions of this person that has earned for him a very large in no capital come. Of course, it would he absurd to put him on the personal exertion basis comand give him the advantage of the exemption from war-time profits taxation. The bulk of his earnings are the reward of capital. There are other cases. I would like to be ahle to mention the name of this firm, because it would draw honourable members' attention to the class of cases I have in m in d ; but it would not be fair to do so. However, I may say that it is a highly reputable Melbourne firm with vast connexions and a huge business. It is called an indenting and importing firm, but it is one of the biggest merchant A portion of the business is agency work solely, but a tremendous lot of it is buying and selling as wholesale merchants do. I do not want these people to escape this taxation. Therefore, having been driven by the selective process to eliminate, as far as one could, the inequalities and unfairness of some of the original provisions of the Act, I have selected for exemption the man who is. simply an agent, and has no money in any other business. A man should be exempt if he has little or no capital in his business.. I u other words, his operations are an occupation, and occupations and employment are not taxed under the original Act or under this Bill . Of course, with any system of direct taxation it is impossible to be microscopically fair . This war-time profits taxation is' the hardest in Australia to adjust; I have not hidden that fact from myself or from the public. However, it has almost run its course, and what we are doing now is to arrange that during the liquidation process it shall sit as equitably as our experience can devise That is the task I am engaged in at the present time, and heing forced to a decision to relieve some people who are already unfairly taxed, without opening too wide the door for that larger class of agents who have a large amount of capital under their control, I have selected this comparatively narrow sphere of relief by exempting the agent who employs little or no capital. I think this provision will afford relief to a large number of people. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) referred to the jobber. I do not know whether he means by a jobber a man who buys and sells; if so, this clause will not exempt him. A jobber is a man who buys and sells with his own money. I think the honourable member really refers to brokers who operate on commission, and if they have little or no capital in their business and do nothing else but commission work, either as brokers or definite agents, they will be exempt. But a man who buys and sells in stocks, or commodities that are threatened with a shortage owing to lack of tonnage or supplies from overseas, will be treated as an ordinary merchant, and will be charged taxation if he shows an excess of profits. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [2.48] - In the country districts are many small auctioneers, who operate a small furnitur e business as a side line. Before the war such a mau may have had a commission business worth £800 per annum net. Owing to the deaths of a number of people and the disposal of several large estates his income may have in creased by £1,000 per annum during the war period. Will the fact that he conducts a small f u r n it u r e business debar him from getting an exemption which is given to the other auctioneer who has no small auxiliary business?",41
153,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,This clause gives exemption only to the man whose earnings are from commission alone. If portion of an auctioneer's earnings result from trading he will not get exemption.,42
154,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,That is most unfair. In Sydney and country centres there are scores of auctioneers who augment their income to the extent - of £10 0 or £200 per year by buying and selling furniture. Why should they be debarred from receiving the same consideration as is given to other auctioneers ?,42
155,Mr BOYD,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,If they earn anything at all from trade they will lose their exemption.,42
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,I hope the Treasurer will explain the necessity for what seems to be an iniquity.,42
157,Mr KELLY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wentworth) [2.52] Has the Treasurer considered the possibility of an agency being created by some oversea manufacturer, and, through an indent agency which employs no capital in this country, entering into a very happy competition with local manufacturers.",42

159,Mr KELLY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"An English or American motor-car manufacturer might employ an indentor to approach various firms for orders.

I have in mind large agents in Melbourne, nine-tenths of whose income is derived from agency work, the balance resulting from an inline denting business. According to the terms of this Bil l they would not be able to get the benefit of any exemption.

There are lose on them. stock and station agents who do not engage in legitimate business. They only operate on commission, but they buy stock on their own account and re-sell it. Those men should be classed as dealand ing pastoralists, and should pay the tax. There are also solicitors who are not only agents for life and fire insiu-ance companies, but are actually selling properties on commission. They should be taxed. On the other hand, a man who is engaged He solely as an agent on 2-J per cent, commission, should receive exemption. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) left upon the minds of the Committee a very erroneous impression regarding the stock and station agents. He said that in his electorate beef and mutton are being sold at lOfd. per lb., although in the Newmarket Yards it can be purchased at 3d. per lb., and he suggested that the agent getting the difference of 7-|d. A more very ridiculous statement was never made in this chamber. If stock were sold at 3d. per lb., the agent received only 2-£ per of 3d., or decimal 3 of one farthing.",43

But by these operamajor tions he makes several thousands of be depounds during the course of twelve months.

Now we are being asked to exempt another class of men who have made more than £1,000 per year during the war by personal exertion. To my mind, an agent who, without possessing capital, but by his own exertions, has made morethan £1,000 a year in war-time should be called upon to contribute towards the expenses of the war just as merchants and others are called upon to do so. But evidently the Committee favours this exemption, and therefore I draw attention to the gross unfairness of dividing agents into two classes, exempting those who devote all their time to agency business, and taxing those who devote part of their time to other business. That is an anomaly worse than the one which it is proposed to remove. All agents should be on the same footing.

Notwithstanding my natural objection to the middleman where he can be dispensed with, I was pleased to see that an effort is heing made by the Government to do some measure of justice to agents. In many country towns, when people wish to move, they would find no buyers for their furniture were it not for the agents who purchase it at a fair valuation, in the hope of disposing of it later.

Under the Act as it stands, members of certain companies who are or have been [3.13] - I on active service are exempt from its provisions. That exemption, however, does not apply to the class covered by my amendment.

I know of several such companies, agreed young men holding shares in which gaveup lucrative positions to enlist as privates. They had to insure their own lives, paying an extra war premium, and neither they nor any member of their family had any prospect of receiving money from the Commonwealth because of the r enlist- : ment. They knew that if they lost their lives, no member of their family would receive, by way of pension or otherwise, any consideration at the hands of the Government. These young men naturally feel that, in view of the many sacrifices they have made in fighting for K i ng and country, and the free Democracy of the Commonwealth, their interests in these businesses should he exempt from taxation. While away on active service they have lost opportunities for promotion as well as the increased salaries to which they would have been entitled had they continued to be actively engaged in their business. understand from the Commissioner that it is not permissible to deduct out of the excess profits of such, companies any sum to reimburse these young men in respect of loss of promotion or to grant them any bonus in recognition of their services to their country. No compensation can be given to them by the other members of the firm out of the profits of the business over and above the normal pre-war standard. I trust that in these circumstancesthe Treasurer will see fit to accept my amendment in the interests of young meu who have fought bravely for their country.

The point I had in mind related more particularly to section 3 of section 8.",46
177,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,It is proposed that amendment should be attached to that section.,46
178,Mr BRUCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Dealing , first of all, with the point raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay, it would seem in the business. that IKS proposal is that where a business is carried on by a small company, an exemption should be given in respect the distribution of - the profits amongst equitably. those of the shareholders who are or have been on active service. The danger such a proposal seems to me to lie in fact that it is almost impossible to a line between returns from personal exertion and capital. Under the Act a shareholder is entitled only to exemption in respect of the results of personal exertion.",46
179,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,That is so.,46
180,Mr BRUCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"If a shareholder has been actively working in the business he is entitled to an exemption in respect of his earnings therein. Even in the smallest private company shareholders who are actively engaged in the business I are nearly always paid a salary. It rarely occurs that the whole of a man's interest in a company of this kind flows from his shareholding and not also from salary, and it seems to me that it would be dangerous to introduce this new principle without hedging it about with stringent safeguards. Many members of such companies who have been on active service would derive no benefit whatever from the proposed amendment; they would not be allowed any exemption, since the interest they derive from the business would not flow solely from personal exertion. Where a father and six brothers form a company, and put the whole of their capital into it , the profits of the company are returns on their capital, and not from their personal exertion. - I have Mr COHSER - But in the cases I have in mind they are all working in the firm or company; they are devoting the whole find it some of their time to it .",46
181,Mr BRUCE,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"That is quite possible. Take the case of a famil y who have their over various invest the ments, but who suddenly decide to found a business, draw their money into it , and develop a very profitable trade. The resubturn they get from that business is not in respect of personal exertion alone; it flows also from the capital which they this have put into it , so that it would be necessary to give a soldier member of the firm an exemption in respect of his capital assets, and not only in respect of returns derived from his personal exertion I am not opposed to the amendment; I have not had time to study it , but without stringent safeguards of I think it might be found to work in I wish to raise a point in regard to the of position of soldiers who left for the the Front just at a time when, but for the draw war, they would have been entering into certain business enterprises. The question turns on the words in the section "" who have been actively engaged."" There are cases where a youth has an in terest in a pastoral or other business, and upon completing his education would have become actively engaged in it . Just as he had completed his education, however, the war broke out, and he enlisted for service, with the result that it cannot be said that he was "" actively engaged "" in the business before he went away, although it is obvious that he intended to engage in it . In such circumstances, he is not allowed any exemption. I know of two cousins who were inheriting the same interests in two pastoral businesses here. One was two years older than the other, and, having been in business for two years after the completion of his education, and before his enlistment, he secured an exemption under the Act . The other, however, enlisted in the first week of the war, and went straight from Cambridge or Oxford to the Front. He had just completed his education, but, at the very time that he would have been starting in business here he went to the Front, and for that reason-sinc e it cannot be said that he was actively engaged in this business before he want to the Front-h e is not exempt from the provisions of this Act. I recognise that it is difficult to deal with such cases, since any attempt to do so might open the door to the transferring of properties; but while I do not wish to press an amendment, I suggest to the Treasurer that some consideration should be given to such cases.",46

Corser) desires to accomplish. The clause he proposes to amend deals with exemptions. Sub-section 3 of section 8 of the principal Act provides for the exemption ofAny resident of Australia, who is on active service outside Australia with the Naval or Military Forces of any of the Allied Powers in connection with the present warwhois the owner of. or is a partner in a business to which this Act applies, and who before he went on active service devoted the whole or the greater part of his time in connection with the management of the business. . . . . It is a firing-line case, or something equivalent to it , and the person covered by this provision must have been an owner or partner in the business, and must have been devoting the whole or the major portion of his time to it . Such a person is exempt under the original Act. The honourable member now says that there are cases of family companies, or what are known in Victoria as proprietary companies, members of which, who devoted the whole of their time to the business of such companies, have gone on active service. To meet such cases, he proposes that the section in the original Act should be so amended as to read as follows: When any resident of Australia, who is on active service outside Australia with the Naval or Military Forces of any of the Allied Powers, in connection with the present war, is the owner of, or is partner in, a business to which this Act applies, Then the honourable member proposes to insertor is a shareholder of a company, the number of shareholders of which does not exceed twenty, and which carries on business, The original section goes onand who, before he went on active service, devoted the whole or the greater part of his time in connection with the management of the busi-. ness, The honourable member proposes to add these wordsor, in the case of a company as aforesaid, was fully employed in the service of the company. These are two amendments the honourable member proposes, and the effect of their acceptance would be to give the same exemption to the man who goes away as a partner or owner as to the man who is a shareholder. Having conversed with the Commissioner and the Treasury authorities, I see no reason to resist the honourable member's amendment, so far as these two first parts are concerned. They place on scratch the man in the partnership along with the man who is in a nominal company and on active service, and I am prepared to accept them; but I am not prepared to accept the amendment as to a refund in regard to the 1915-16 assessment. I do not know what it means, and as I am one who believes that it is hard to get butter out of a dog's mouth, I do not, at the present time, want any in mine.

I ask the Treasurer' to receive the amendment in the spirit in which itTis moved.",49
195,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Dampier) [ 3 . 4 4 ] - I do not know whether the honourable mem the amendment in my name, which follows his own, and has considered which of the two propositions would best serve the interests of those of whom he is now speaking. I would like an expression of opinion from the Treasurer as to how he proposes to treat pastoralists who had not earned sixpence u n t i l after the commencement of the war, but, on the other Under the hand, had always shown losses, and aTe now to he mulcted in very heavy taxation. Here is a letter from one of these pastoralistsWith reference to our conversation re the taxation, I will give you a few of the facts as it affects us. We started in 1007 with 3,000 sheep, and by hard toil and economy; in [3.42] - I 1911 we had fenced and put well down and done other improvements and built our flocks up to 17,000 sheep, all out of what we got from the station. In 1911 we had 4,500 lambs, and by March, 1912, all had perished, and from then on till November 14th it was to nothing but losses, and on that date when we got our first rains after the drought, we only had 4,500 sheep. To give you an idea of what we went through, we opened our fences in 1912, and let 14,000 sheep go and take care of themselves. The nearest fence to pull them up is somewhore in Queensland, and as we are the very outside fence sheep-run in the Gascoyne district, so you can see we had not much chance of making any income. From 1915 till the last shearing 1918, we increased our sheep to 19,000, during which time we sold 5,000. So now that wo have a chance to make a little profit after twelve years' hard work, we are asked to hand over the bulk of it to pre-war tax. And yet other station-owners who had thousands a year income previous to the war, and suffered no losses in the drought, get off practically free. This last year, 1918, we had 6,000 lambs, and they are taken as income, and we are taxed on them, and yet if we have another bad season this year, allmay perish, and we have to pay taxes on what we have lost. VVe do not complain about being taxed as we are quite aware that money has to be found, and quite willing to pay our share, but to let tlic men off free who are making large incomes and ask us to pay more than half what we made, and through no fault of ours, is unjust. I In another case a loss of £500 was shown in 1912, the year in which operations were commenced on the holding. The capital invested was £7,000, but they were not allowed to charge interest on it. In 1913-14 they showed a loss of £950. The total capital expended on the whole property by that time was £8,000; yet they were not allowed to charge interest on that amount. In 1914-15 they showed a profit of approximately £500 without any allowance for interest on capital. In 1915-16, the first year to which the wartime profits tax applied, they showed a profit of £1,500 exclusive of interest on capital; yet the Department refuses to allow them to deduct losses from profits during the pro-war period, and has called them to pay war-time profits taxation on £500. In another case the owner commenced with a capital of £7,000, and gradually worked up to an expenditure of £20,000 in the five or six years during which he was working the holding. He showed a loss each year prior to the war, but during the first year of the war he made a profit of £1,200 without allowing for interest on capital, and* in the next year, the first taxing year, £4,800. He has heen called on to pay £2,050 as war-time profits taxation, yet his neighbour, with a pre-war standard of £10,000 or £15,000, will not be called on to pay sixpence unless his profits have exceeded his pre-war standard. The trouble with the men for Avhom I am speaking is that they have no pre-war standard, and their profit may he represented by the increase of stock and not by cash, yet they are called upon to pay to the Department 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., as the case may be, of the profits which appear on their balance-sheets. My proposal is - that they should be allowed to set off 10 per cent, of their capital during the pre-war years against the war-time profits taxation assessment, and I hope the Treasurer will give consideration to it.",49
196,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Grampians) [3.54] - I best do not think that the public fully apprefall, ciate the position of the pastoralists the drought-stricken districts of AusThe tralia. The limitation of 10 per cent, for new capital put'into old businesses will be absolutely inadequate as applied the vagaries of seasons. to pastoralists who are engaged in the most hazardous occupation of endeavoursect ing to settle the dry districts of Australia [344] with stock. I purchased and took up a large tract of country which six months previously was so dry that for seventy miles a man riding through it could not get a drink for his horse. Sixteen years afterwards it was highly improved at a cost of £80,000, mostly borrowed money. It was divided into thirty paddocks, and each paddock had plenty of water conserved in it. The property covered 400,000 acres, and carried 80,000 sheep, but a drought came along, and'it was not capable of carrying more than 1,000 head of sheep. I had to ride through the Gulf territory and in the direction of Port Darwin in search of. country before I could succeed in getting a spot to which I could remove those sheep. It was in the days before motor cars came into use, and where I went it was useless attempting to travel with a buggy and pair, because there was not always sufficient grass available for more than one horse. It is preposterous to talk about a rate of 10 per cent, on capital which is invested in such a hazardous industry. I urge the Committee to do something to encourage those who may be expected to invest their money in it, and, at the same time, relieve the position of those who have invested their money in it in the past. I believe the whole matter is covered by an amendment which will be submitted later by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers), and at this stage I will not say more than that the pastoral industry is of the utmost possible value to Australia, and is deserving of as much consideration as is given to any other industry that can be named.  who were making big profits in the pastoral industry before the war were the earlier settlers who took up land in the districts, where there is a good rainbut as they all had big pre-war in standards, they escape this taxation. men whose position we have to consider mostly are those who have gone out into the back-blocks and fought against Apart from droughts, they have had all sorts of inplagues and parasites to combat. I have in mind one property in New South Wales which was taken up by two gentlemen six years ago. They have been improving the property to a high standard, and during the six years have not made sufficient profit out of it to pay terest on the expenditure. Since war, owing to the high price of wool, they have made a profit of £3,000. About six months ago, the rabbit plague attacked them, and they have had to expend the whole of their profits in netting the property and digging out the rabbits. Now, a drought has occurred, and they have been obliged to shift their sheep to another district 200 or 300 miles away. They have had to borrow from the bank so heavily that they do not know how they will be able to carry on. Yet they will be called upon to pay this taxation. I suggest that the Treasurer should get into communication with the pastoral boards with a view to creating drought-stricken zones, and giving exemption to the pastoralists affected. Otherwise, we shall be legislating by Bill for the' downfall of the people in drought-stricken districts.",50
197,Mr SAMPSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wimmera) [4.2] - Notice has been given of three amendments by different honourable members, all aiming at the same object as the honourable member for Maranoa seeks to secure. Of the three, I rather prefer the amendment that is to be submitted by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers); but I hope that the Government, in dealing with this matter, will consider the pastoral interests as being different from ordinary businesses operating under this Act. A three years' pre-war standard might be a quite legitimate and accurate gauge by which to calculate the normal profits of an ordinary business, but such a standard is quite useless in endeavouring to arrive at the average profits of a pastoral concern. Honourable members who are well acquainted with the grazing and pastoral industries know that one would never think of calculating the capital value of a property, based on the productive value, by taking the returns for any series of three years. In order to get at a reliable standard, it would be necessary to take the average profits over a period of twenty or thirty years. The pastoral industry is dependent entirely on the vagaries of the season. There are cycles of dry years and cycles of good years, and pastoralists have found it necessary in the good years to build up reserves which will tide them over theyears of drought. Therefore, it is uninreasonable to adopt a four-year period in the calculating the pre-war standard of profits, if no regard is paid to what the future may bring forth, or to what the losses had been prior to the accounting period. Any system of taxation based on the average profits of a limited number of years must necessarily do a grave injustice to the pastoral industry. Because of the war, and of a series of good seasons, the pastoralists have had good yields, and reasonably high prices; but those good seasons supervened on a cycle of dry seasons, and probably the recent prosperous period will be followed by another period of losses or small profits. This tax takes from the grazier the reserves he has built up out of the profits in the good seasons to tide him over the bad seasons which he knows are sure to this follow. It would have been fair if the original - Act had given total exemption to the pastoral industry, as well as to the dairying and agricultural industries, but that was found impossible, owing to the fact that it was known that big profits had been made out of wool in recent years. However, if the Treasurer is able to accept one of the amendments which have been circulated, that will afford relief to those graziers who have been overtaken by calamities due to circumstances over which they had no control. The pastoral industry certainly has been enjoying some good seasons following on a period of drought; but we know from experience that in Queensland, New South Wales, and other parts of the Commonwealth, we are about to experience, if not drought, at least lean seasons'.",51
198,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.10] - I have been able to give some consideration to the three amendments which have been circulated by the honourable member for  Gregory) and Wannon (Mr Rodgers) respectively, and which more or less attempt to deal - with the same matter. I have no personal knowledge of the difficulties against which the pastoralist has to contend, but any one who knows anything of the vicissitudes of the seasons generally in Australia is able to understand that a long course of years is the only fair measure of the pastoralist's risks and returns. In expressing sympathy with the pastoralist, who, during the war, has done mighty well, in my judgnient, I do not wish to let loose the flood-gates of sympathy on either side of the House. I listened to the honourable member for Maranoa a few nights, ago, and thought that he was the devil's advocate. was a generous-hearted Labour member espousing the cause of the poor pastoralist 1 I approach the question without prejudice one way or the other, but with a desire to recognise one difficulty. I am not concerned with the pastoral in dustry generally, but with the industry as it is carried on in some of the most difficult portions of the Commonwealth. A man who exiles himself away beyond the margin of cultivation, and even of civilization sometimes, and who, in addition, is subject outside the Goyder, line of rainfall to regular and almost habitually recurring visitations of drought, is entitled to the sympathy of every man, provided that it is not dealt out to him so generously that other pastoralists will feel aggrieved. The Commissioner is of the opinion that of the three proposals, the fairest and most reasonable, and the most easily worked, is that of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers). There are objections that might be offered to that of the honourable member for Dam,pier (Mr Gregory), and an objection to that of the honourable member for  not set out now. If the honourable member for Maranoa will withdraw his amendment, and will allow me to carefully review the wording of the new clause suggested by the honourable member for Wannon, I promise to accept the spirit of that clause, and to get the draftsman to give effect to it .

199,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Kooyong) [4.12]. - I had intended to propose an amendment on this clause, but as I do not wish to unduly embarrass the Treasurer, I shall, on Monday, move the insertion of a new clause which will provide what I wish to be provided, and give effect to the spirit of clause 10 of the Bill which was introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). The clause which I will propose will have for its object the averaging of profits during the whole period of the war. It is legitimate to ask a man to contribute to the revenue upon any excess profits over the average profits made by him according to the pre-war standard. I had intended to propose the omission from clause 15, sub-clause (1), of the words, "" actual profits arising in the accounting period,"" with the object of substituting for them the words, "" average annual profits arising since the 1st day of July, 1914, and extending over the period of the war."" That amendment, however, would have required the alteration of several - other clauses, and, therefore, after consultation with the Treasurer and the Commissioner, I shall move a new clause which will achieve the same result, but will do so more effectively from the draftsman's point of view.

The amendment of which 1 gave notice applied to other businesses beside that of the pastoralist, but the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) showed yesterday that a great many business men would have an opportunity to show a loss by unloading, and would thus escape the operation of this Act . The pastoralists, however, cannot deal in that way with their profits. Under the present law, if a pastoralist made a profit during the first year of the war and in the next three years made losses, he could not get any refund in'respect of those losses, but if he made a profit in the first year, a loss in the second, a profit in the t h i r d , and a loss in the fourth, the losses would be. taken into account. I have received several letters fro m pastoralists who have be*n h it hard by the operation of the tax. This is one of thorn - I can give the Treasurer the name of the writer privatelyDear Pigott,-There is an aspect of the wartime profits tax that I would like to see yon stress, as an instance I will give my own case. My profits for last year and the year before were very big on paper-fro m memory about £1,500 each year. These profits we're left in stock. This year, as you know, we have a drought, and the profits are now all dead, and the losses for the third year will be very much heavier than all the profits.",52

Every war loan up to the present I have k subscribed to. This time. I can't do anything, and I dread the new legislation now foreshadowed. I am going to write to the Prime Minister on the same subject. I cited a case where a person made a profit of. £3,000, and had no possible chance of making a further profit during this war. He is down and out. Every penny he has made has been irrevocably lost, and there is no possibility of his getting on his feet again in the next four or r five years. The Act allows him to deduct his losses from his future profits, but if ie has no chance of making future profits, the amount he has paid in tax under this legislation should be refunded to him . If ever there was a time when these men wanted sympathy from the Government, it is now. They are beaten and out. The banks have shut down against them. I speak feelingly in this matter, because I come in contact with these gentlemen. They are constituents of mine, and many of them life-long, friends. They have been fighting in the back-blocks for years against all kinds of disabilities. The Government should lend them a helping hand by accepting my proposal. I am merely asking for British fair play and British law. On a previous occasion the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) said that our Act was not nearly as drastic as the British Act. This is a part of our legislation which is more drastic, because the British Act gives these people some help and support. The British Finance (No. 2) Act of 1915, part 3, section 38, clause 3, providesWhere a person proves that in any accounting period which ended after the 4th August, 1914, his profits have not reached the point which involves liability to excess profits duty, I or that he sustained a loss in his trade or business, he shall be entitled to repayment of such amount paid by him as excess profits duty in respect of any previous accounting period, or to set off against any excess profits duty payable by him in respect of any succeeding accounting period, such an amount as will make the total amount of excess profits duty paid by him during the whole period accord with his profits or losses during that period.",53

They say that the loss of revenue which would result from the adoption of the British section, or the original Higgs clause, be so substantial that the Treasury could not afford to lose the money. That is the general view of the British section, if it is attempted to in troduce it into this Bill , as the honourable member for Calare evidently desires.",54

Under sub-section 13 of section 15 of the principal Act, it is provided thatWhere in the case of a pastoral business(a) any part of the profits arising during the last three pre-war trade years has been invested in the business, and have, in subsequent years, been wholly or partly lost owing to drought, adverse reasons, or other adverse conditions; and (b) any part of the profits of the current accounting period has been applied in extinction of that lossthen in estimating the profits a deduction shall be allowed equal to the amount of profits applied in extinction of that loss and any other loss which the Commissioner is of opinion has been recouped out of the profits of the current accounting period. I am not at all concerned as to the position of those who have been making big profits in the pastoral industry. I am fighting for those who, for seven or eight years before the war, were showing a loss, and are able only now to show a fair profit, with the result that the Commissioner is assessing them to the extent of 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of their profits. Here is the case of a man who showed a loss of £500 in the first of the three years preceding the war, a loss of £950 in the second year, and a profit of £500 in the third year; or, in other words, a loss of £950 in respect of the three pre-war years. In the next year, he showed a profit of £1,500, and he asked that his loss in the three pre-war year3 should be .allowed as a set-off against his profit in the first accounting period.

217,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Some time ago I submitted to the Treasurer a long financial statement of the operations of a man who had invested £20,000 in the pastoral industry. He went into the bush, and battled and struggled for seven or eight years, and during the whole of that time was unable to show a profit. Now that he is able to show a book profit, the Commissioner under the Act is compelled to tax him to the extent of 50 per cent, or 75 per cent, of his profit. He has no pre-war standard. If the Government are not prepared to accept my amendment, they must not think that the proposal made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) will cover it . I have in mind a case where, in six years, a pastoralist's outlay on his industry rose from £7,000 to £20,000. During the whole of that period he showed a loss, although he did not allow anything for in terest on his capital. In the first year of the war he showed a profit of £1,200, and in the first year of the accounting period he showed a profit of £4,800. That was his first profit, and on i the was assessed for £2,050. A closely adjoining neighbour made a profit of over £15,000, but as he was able to show a very high pre-war - standard, he escaped the t ax altogether. This Act is wretchedly inequitable, and I hope something will be done to protect the class of people for whom I am fighting. I would prefer a super-income tax rather than this wretched tax, which it is impossible to make just or equitable. It is one of the most preposterous taxes ever put on the statute-book. It is exceedingly difficult for the Commissioner to minister, and he must recognise how unjust many of the assessments are. I should like a promise that the Treasurer will endeavour to do something to protect these people. I am urging this because should not accept for a moment. those .who go into the Never-Never are doing what the pioneers of Australia did in Port Phillip in the early days. are the pioneers of back settlement, and others are to be found going beyond them. It is very hard just now, when they can show one year of profit, to find the greater part of it taken by the Government. As a matter of fact, they will in all probability have to borrow from the Government the money to pay the ° tax, because it is not a cash profit, that is shown, but an arbitrary profit on the stock, the value of which is fixed by the Taxation Department. I have letters which show that if people try to dispose of their stock at the present time they cannot realise within 50 per cent, of the amount on which they are assessed for in - stances. come tax and war-time profits tax - It is on book profits that they have to pay; and I plead, not for men who are doing well, but for men who are in danger of being legally robbed by the carelessness of this Parliament.",55

That people who entitled to a much fairer deal than is proposed should be refused because Treasury will suffer is one of the most - cynical suggestions I have heard in this Chamber for many a day. What is asked for affects most materially the existence of a struggling phase of production in Australia which is entitled to more consideration than the Treasurer seems inclined to give. When, on the ad- other hand, we find pastoralists who live in parts of Australia where they are practically . assured of success and prosperity, not taxed at all , the' position is one that this Parliament The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) points' out to me that the They concession he asks for in the case of these outside pastoralists is to a large extent in spirit and in practice given in other businesses. If there is any portion of the community entitled to special oonsideration at the present time it is those struggling pastoralists who are try ing to keep things going on the outside limits of settlement. They are not asking anything special, but merely something to which they are entitled, in common fairness. I trust, therefore, that the Government, if they desire this u n fortunate method of taxation to be tolerated, will realise that it must be made as equitable as possible under the circum much pleasure in supporting the amendment. * As already pointed out, a man who has put £8,000 into a pastoral business, and after working at it for five or six years, finds himself only paying exe penses, would have been much better off that had he invested on mortgage at 5 per In other businesses such cases are provided for to the' extent 10 per cent., and the-same should apply be in the pastoral industry. As to the plea put forward by the Treasurer, and the refersuggestion that if the amendment was. accepted the Bill might as well be with. drawn, that only means that we have a. choice between continuing this tax and the destruction of the pastoral industry in the There are two classes of of people on the land, the descendants of are those who came in the early daysand selected the best spots fifty or sixty years the ago, and those for whom we are now pleading-thos e who are now going 300 or 400 miles away from civilization to country with sparse rainfall. I call to mind a property, 400 miles from Sydney, where the average rainfall is 20 inches, and, so far this year, there has been only 6 inches. Many of the people there, who have made good profits during the last year or two with a rainfall of from 22 inches to 23 inches, will be called upon to face the Taxation Commissioner this year with a rainfall of 6 inches. The late Mr. Manifold, whose death we deplore, told me of a cattle station m the Northern Territory, a long way from the seaboard, where they brand something like 10,000 calves a year. The value of these calves has been placed by the Commissioner at £3 per head, but they have to be kept until they grow to maturity, because they are no earthly good until, say, this year. Suppose 10,000 calves reach the fattening age during the current twelve months, they may be wiped out by drought; but, all the same; the owners of the station will be called upon to pay on an assessed revenue of £30,000. They have yielded no profit at all, and yet the Commissioner of Taxation has been consistently taxing these people year in and year out on the value of these calves.

I asked1. Wliether it is a fact that Stead's War Facts was placed on the list of prohibited publications on the erroneous assumption by an Allied Government that it waa practically identical with another book to which exception was taken f 2. If so, will the prohibition against War Facts be withdrawn; and will any, and, if BO, what, compensation be given to the publisher?

I propose to read what Mr Stead himself has to say on the matter, when I shall the favourable oonsideration of his repreStead sentations by the Acting Prime Minister. In his letter to me of the 10th December, after referring to the fact that I had brought the matter of the prohibition his book under the notice of the House, Mr Stead writesI learn from the American papers that it must have been the American Government which requested the Australian authorities to place my book on the list. They assumed that my book was identical with one which had been issued in New York, and to which strong exception was taken by many people. The position is, that in response to a cabled request by the editor of the Review of Reviews in America, asking if I would allow him to use the material in my book for a publication he wished to bring out, I sent over advance proofs. These were used by him, but, in addition, he added a whole lot of more or less contentious matter, which I would never have dreamt of issuing here. This dealt with freedom of the seas, compared the methods Great Britain had employed to get her Colonies with those Germany was now using, touched on the troubles which had arisen between the TJnited States of America and Great Britain concerning the blockade, and generally expressed views to which I do not wonder exception was taken. When challenged in the matter, the editor, Dr Shaw, calmly sheltered himself behind me, saying that, as the proofs had been obtained from a son of W. T. Stead, he had not troubled to examine them closely. He further promised to eliminate all objectionable matter, and since then the book has, I find, been re-issued. His method of excusing himself naturally gave the impression that his book was practically a replica of mine. It is true that he used my material, but to the inoffensive information I gave connected with the war he added a whole lot of questions and answers which - dealt with controversial matters. For this, his book is suppressed, and, because of his explanation, my book is also banned. I have laid the facts before the Defence Department, but have received no reply. In a later letter of the same date Mr. Stead writesSince writing you this morning I have found further reference in the American papers to the suppression of the book Two Thousand Stead's Questions and Answers about the War. Jt appears that the portions objected to were at the beginning of the book, almost all of which had been added by the American editors. Yet, when I asked to be allowed to omit any objectionable portion of the work, I was informed that exception was taken to the whole of it, and not to any one specific part. ask I have a copy of a"" letter which Mr. sent to the Defence Department on this matter. It throws a rather interesting sidelight on the methods of the Deof fence Department in the exercise of the censorship. In his letter to the Defence Department, dated 10th December, Mr. Stead says The book quoted, Two Thousand Questions and Answers about the War, which was objected to by the American Government, has now been allowed to appear with the portions objected to omitted. I find that the section which omitted to conform with the wishes of the American authorities is the first portion of the book, to which, as I pointed out in my letter of 4th December, I myself would have taken exception. In this section, which deals with ""Main Springs of the War,"" "" The Balkan Powder Magazine,"" ""Austria and the Slavs"" ""The Tragic Wound,"" ""Alsace-Lorraine/' ""The Place in the Sun,"" ""How We got into It , "" and ""The Freedom of the Seas,"" there is very little of the material I supplied to the American publisher. In fact, the only questions and answers in this section which I supplied deal with nothing but statistical matter-for ' instance: ""How many People live in Roumania?"" ""What are the Religions of the Entente's Allies?"" ""What is a Czech?"" ""How long did the Franco-Prussian War last?"" ""What is the Area of Egypt?"" and the like. When I suggested that it might be possible for me to omit the particular passages objected to in Stead's War Facts, you informed me that this could not be done, as objection was taken to the whole tone of the publication. This objection was presumably taken by the American authorities. Yet this American book, Two Thousand Questions and Answers about the War, is allowed to be re issued after certain sections were omitted ihese sections contained admittedly contentious matter, but, as I have pointed out, there was in them very little of what I sent. The position seems to me to be as follows :The American Government, assuming that Stead's Wa* Fficts - and Two Thousand Questions and Answers about the War are practically same book, requests the suppression of Stead's War Facts. It . then permits the republication of Tioo Thousand Questions and Answers the War after material which did not appear in Stead'sWar Facts at all has been omitted. Yet, when I request that I may be allowed to omit anything deemed objectionable from Stead's War Facts, I am informed that the whole tone of the publication which jected to. It is quite clear to me that in suppressing Stead's War Facts"" the authorities here were acting under an entire misapprehension, error which has been a serious matter Not only has it meant considerable monetary loss, but the action taken has caused people to imagine that I was responsible for a publication the tone of which was objectionable. Mr Stead supplied his facts to the American editor, and the latter added certain material. It was because of that added material that the book was suppressed. It was at the request of the American Government that Stead's War Facts was suppressed. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr ""Watt) knows now that on the elimination of the facts added by the American editor the American Government have allowed the re-issue of the book, which contains the matter supplied by Mr Stead, yet the Commonwealth Government refuse to follow the example of the American Government and allow the circulation of the book in Australia. The whole trouble is obviously due to misapprehension. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to look into the matter, because the suppression of the publication of the book is involving the editor in monetary loss, depriving the public of a very useful compendium of facts concerning the war, and at the same time i? accomplishing no good purpose as far as the Government are concerned.  been informed that the transport Sardinia is approaching Fremantle w it i ninety cases of Spanish influenza on board. If it is true that Spanish influenza has broken out on hoard the vessel I would like the Acting Prime Minister to publish a list of those who have been stricken down. It will be a guide to relatives, who are anxious to go to the nearest port of disembarkation to welcome the-.returning men.",57
229,Mr ATKINSON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Wilmot) 15.5] the Some time ago I put a question on the notice-paper, in which I suggested that about the Acting Prime Minister should bring under the notice of the authorities who will he representing Australia at the Peace Conference the necessity for getting it is some control over Germany's vast deis obposits of potash, which is such - a necessary commodity for our producers, and without supplies of which they will be an in very serious trouble. Subsequently, into me. order to ascertain what steps had been taken in the matter, I submitted another question, and the Acting Prime Minister's reply was that the Government would endeavour to secure potash for the producers of Australia, but that he did not see how it would be possible to do what I asked in connection with the peace conditions. I thought that he would have cabled to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), requesting him to bring the matter under the notice of those who will represent Australia at the Peace Conference; in fact, I thought that this was the course he intended to adopt some time ago; and when I asked my second question I was hoping that I would learn what progress had been made in regard to the matter. I suggest now that representations should be made to the Prime Minister or some other authority in Great Britain, who will bring under the notice of those who represent us at the Peace Conference the necessity for doing the very best they can for us in regard to these potash deposits of Germany.",59
230,Mr CHARLTON,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Hunter) [5.8] - In the Buladelah district, in the Hunter electorate, there is a mountain, called Alum Mount, from which the Germans prior to the war were drawing supplies of potash, and I believe that a great quantity has already been broken and stored awaiting for export. I hope that if any inquiry is being made in regard to this matter the Government will see whether the deposit at Alum Mount may be utilized.",59
231,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Capricornia) [5.9] - I listened with a great deal of interest and a certain regret to the brief but most important statement made by the Acting Prime Minister concerning the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jensen), and I only desire to say, at this stage, that, i opinion, any one who read the report of the Navy and Defence Royal Commission in regard to the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works and certain vessels for the Navy Department must have come to the conclusion that, as the Minister whose actions have heen reflected upon declined to resign, there was ho other course opento self-respecting Ministers of the Crown than to remove him from office.",59
232,Mr SPEAK ER,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR," My attention has been drawn by the Crown Law authorities to certain references made in the course of proceedings in Committee yesterday by an honourable member of this House, and, after consultation with that honourable member, I directed the elimination of certain from the Mansard proof of his speech . referring to one of Great Britain's Allies.",60

235,Mr WATT,PROSECUTIONS UND ER WAR,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.11],-May I , in closing the debate, say I note with terest the comment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Higgs) has seen f it to offer concerning the nouncement I made to the House some few minutes ago. I do not desire to add to the areas. pain of the occasion, or to stretch wider the wound which has certainly been made; but I think it only fair to say that Mr. Jensen communicated to me his intention to address the House, probably next week, in connection with the matter. I think it only right to say this, because he is absent from the chamber. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) has asked me to make an investigation into Stead's Catechism or War Facts book. T read the catechism, if not the whole of it , then-most of it , as it was going through in Berial n my form, and I do not feel qualified at this stage to say whether a mistake has been made, or whether the censorship branch of the Defence Department acted with wisdom or otherwise. I know Mr Stead personally, very well. I have never doubted his loyalty, never for a minute.. And I will take the very next occasion that offers of having a look at the book to see whether it oan be released or not. I would ask the honourable member for  thing that he is hearing about the transports. I am informed by my colleague (Mr Greene), who is in charge of the Quarantine Department, that he has no information whatever of Spanish influenza having made its appearance on the transport referred to. Another member of the words House, alarmed at the rumour, communicated this afternoon with the Base Records Office, and has been advised that it is merely a rumour. I asked, a little while ago, that honourable members and the publio generally, should at this, time behave with restraint with regard to rumours of this kind. The circulation of, or the credence given to, them, may cause distress and alarm to a considerable section of this community. We are the most fortunate people in the world with regard to this influenza scourge, largely because of the decision to at once put it in the very best quarantine position, that is to say, higher up in point of gravity and urgency than cholera. The branch of .the Customs Department, in charge of quaranintine matters might, so far, very well be congratulated by a grateful people, and we may express the hope that the outanbreak will eventually be eliminated without extending beyond the quarantine I shall bear in mind what the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) said in endorsement of the remarks by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson). What appeared to be an evasive answer given by me to my honourable friend, the member for Wilmot, the other day was due. to the form i a which his question was couched. It rendered itimpossible for me to give anything but a' strategic answer. J ,»o not doubt that honourable merp.bers of the Opposition would call this side-stepping, but it was not. It was an attempt at wisdom- a maiden effort, possibly) but successful in a minor degree. I cannot pronounce on what the Peace Conference may decide with regard to deposits within the territory of the former German Empire, and I was anxious not to complicate the matter. My honourable friend may rest assured, however, that the Government knows the wants of Australia with regard to the potash supplies, and will endeavour to safeguard the interests of our primary producers. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.15 p.m.",60
