9,Mr CHARLES ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Isaacs) (2.03)-It is with great honour that I rise to nominate the honourable member for Henty ( Mrs Child) for the position of Speaker. The honourable member for Henty has earned the great respect of everyone in this House since she was first elected to the Parliament. That election was the 1974 Federal election. Indeed, through that election Joan Child became the first Australian Labor Party woman to be elected to the House of Representatives. Until that time the seat of Henty had been held by the Liberal Party. In fact, Mr Max Fox, until his defeat in 1974, had held the seat for some 19 years. So one can see that to win Henty in the first place was in itself no mean feat. Joan lost in the 1975 landslide against the Whitlam Government. However, not to be denied, she stood again in 1977 and 1980 when she won back the seat of Henty. She has, of course, won the seat twice more since then. It is indeed a mark of the great respect Joa-'s constituents have for her that she has swung Henty from a 9.4 per cent Liberal majority in the early 1970s to a 7.3 per cent majority for herself and the Labor Party today. Starting in 1972, therefore, Joan Child has fought the last seven successive Federal elections. However, notwithstanding what I have already said, it is Joan Child the woman, Joan Child a community worker over a lifetime and above all Joan Child the person who is respected by everyone who comes into contact with her. Since her return to Melbourne from Tasmania in the midI 960s after the tragic death of her husband, Hal, Joan has not only brought up five rather large sons whom, 1 may add, hover around rat-er menacingly if anyone dares to be nasty to their mother, but also she has been involved in - any community activities, helping many individuals and families through the health or social security system or some other community assistance. It is this great work over more than two decades that has made Joan a household name in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and it has also been the hallmark of a person concerned for others. Her compassion for her fellow human beings is unsurpassed. However, Joan has also earned great respect for her hard work, reliability and diligence in h-r elector-te and in the Parliament. Her toughml-ded attitude on issues in which she genuinely be!l-ves has been a thorn in the side of many MInisters of governments of both persuasions over the last decade or so. It is, sir, precisely because of Joan's sure-minded ness and toughness when needs be and the respect that she has earned from everyone in this Parliament-I repeat 'earned', because it is not lightly giventhat have led to her great success as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees during the last two years and ] am sure will continue into the position of Speaker of the House. . If 1 may, .1 would like to tell a little story before resumIng my seat. Whilst enjoying a cup of .tea and a friendly chat with Joan recently, which we are prone to do from time to time. I asked her whether, if 1 nominated her 1 wo-ld rec-ive - ny special privileges such as being able to Interject more than usual. She Ieant across the table and in a very polite fashion-I think she has done this also to the Prime Minister ( Mr !-Iawke)-and in a very firm manner said: 'David, If you put one foot out of place, you will be the first one to go out the door'. As most honourable members would know, her interests are many a-d varied: !?ey include her love for sport and leisure activities such as Australian Rules football, in respect of which she is a fanatical Hawthorn supporter. She is also a devoted cricket lover. I am. sure that, if asked, Joan could give the Australian team a few helpful hints on how to win back the ashes next year. All in all, sir, I am sure that. all honourable members can see that her many interests, which range right across the spectrum from her devotion to her family, her leisure activities to her involvement in many major issues of si-nificant economic importance in this country, including the very important subject of education on which she is one of the foremost experts in this Parliac ment, her compassion and concern for others and the respect she has earned in this Parliament as a member and as a Deputy Speaker in the last two years, makes the honourable member for Henty, Mrs Joan Child, the ideal choice for the position of Speaker of the House of Repres.entatives.",238
10,Mr NA BROWN ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Menzies) (2.07)- Mr Clerk, I have much pleasure in nominating the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, as Speaker of this House. Mr Rocher was elected to the Senate for Western Australia in 1977. He has served there and in this House since then with very great distinction. He has had long experience on the committees of bothÂ· Houses of the Parliament and that experience equips him perfe-tly well to take the high office of Speaker of --IS House. But he has other qualities in addltton. Mr Speaker Snedden said once that the desirable qualities of Speaker-and we can check these off against the honourable member-were integrity, and he has that, judgment, common sense, patience, tact, a sense of humour, selfconfidence, presence of mind and, most importantly, firmness tempered with kindness. Allan Rocher has all of those qualities in abundance. He will be a good Speaker of this House. Two other things must be said. The first is that Mrs Child has achieved a: rare distinction. She was the only candidate for the Government Party's nomination for Speaker and she was elected unanimously. It should be said that any - ember who obtains the unanimous support of hiS or her party for election to high office must have the universal respect of that party. We appreciate and understand that. However, secondly, it must be said that whoever is elected as Speaker has. the responsibility of upholding the rIghts of pnvate members of this House. The test of that responsibility comes most sharply, we would suggest, at Question Time. We say that because during the last session of Parliam-nt we were subjected to a series of longWInded sermons and lectures by Ministers. under the guise of answering questions. The worse offender,. of course, was the one who is already mumbling here now, namely, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). His answers frequently went for 15 minute- or more. We know that the Prime Minister is a comparative newcomer to the Parliament and has not yet adapted to its conventions and practices. However, he should have learned by now. The Speaker, of course, is limited by the fact that there is no standing order which gives him power to require a Minister to conclud y his EmptyHere edited the House of Representatives Practice, has told us that the Speaker may exercise persuasion, may emphasise the need for an-wers to be brief and may also draw Ministers' attention to the fact that they can always make a statement after Question Time to avoid a lengthy answer. I ask honourabie members opposite to stop mumbling for a minute and to listen. They might learn something and be better informed, even if no wiser. It should be of just as much concern to Government members as it is to Opposition members that the number of questions we are now able to ask is rapidly shrinking. In the last three years of the Fraser Government an average of 805 questions without notice were asked per year. In the three years of the Hawke Government, the figure has dropped from 805 questions per year to 607. That is a drop of 200 questions which were not able to be asked because of speeches made by Ministers under the guise of answering questions. Opposition members are concerned about this. We suggest that Government members should be equally concerned. In the same period the number of questions has dropped from 15. a day to 11, despite the fact that we now have an expanded Parliament and more members trying to ask questions. The view of the Opposition is that this simply has to stop. Members on the Government and the Opposition sides have a right to ask questions, and Ministers have an obligation to ensure that their answers are brief to enable as many questions as possible to be asked. The operation of this Parliament depends upon give and take. There must be common sense and fairness in Question Time. We ask Ministers, especially the Prime Minister, to show more of that commodity than we saw in the last session. Finally, we must say that if we do not see an improvement Ministers will simply have to learn the hard way. Co-operation is a two-way process. If we do not get co-operation from Ministers at Question Time,Â· we will use every tactic open to an Opposition-let me remind honourable members opposite that there are plenty of themto ensure that we do get a fair go. We have no doubt that Mr Rocher will show this concern for Government members, as he will for Opposition members. I am sure that Mrs Child would warit to do the same fOf both sides of the House, but to do that she would need the co-operation of the front bench-all of the Ministers. We hope and trust that, whoever is elected speaker, that co-operation will be forthcoming. For the same reasons I have stated, I urge honourable members to vote for Mr Rocher.",239
11,Mrs KELLY ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Canberra) (2.13)-After the gracious speech of the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), I am privileged to second the nomination of the honourable member for Henty ( Mrs Child) for the position of Speaker. This is indeed an historic occasion for this Parliament and for Australia, because it is the first time in Australia's history that a woman has had the opportunity to take the position of Speaker in the Federal Parliament. Making history is not new for Joan Child. In 1974, when she was elected to this Parliament, she was the first Australian Labor Party woman ever to sit in this chamber. Joan has always shied away from being stereotyped as the woman in the House. She made it clear when she was elected in 1974 that she was a politician who happened to be a woman. Inside and outside this chamber she has clearly shown an understanding of and support for the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the aged and the handicapped. When Joan is elected Speaker she will set a great example for the women of Australia. She has demonstrated that a woman from a very ordinary background, but with special qualities, . can succeed. I challenge anyone in this House to name a person who has greater determination and single-mindedness than Joan Child. When she was widowed with five sons to bring up she made sure that their living standards were not disadvantaged because she was a widow. She made sure that they did not suffer any stigma as second-class citizens just because she did not have a husband. She set out determinedly to prove that a woman alone in the world could survive. She fought for three years to win the seat of Henty in 1974, and when she lost it in 1975 she worked assiduously for five years to win it back in 1980. In an interview in 1975 she stated determinedly 'Henty is my seat and I am going to win it back' and that she did. As Chairman of Committees Joan Child has demonstrated the same determination to get on top of the job and perform it with dignity and firmness. In the Australian Labor Party Federal Caucus there are no special favours because one is a woman. Joan has today received the nomination of the Australian Labor Party because she deserves it. Never underestimate Joan Child; she is a very formidable woman. She may smile benignly from the chair and demonstrate a lively sense of humour, but she has had years of experience in managing a family of males with firmness and with love. There is no doubt she will demonstrate that same firmness and balance in her new role. Joan is immensely loyal to her friends, but one has to earn that loyalty. There is no doubt that if one is her enemy one will know it. I think there are a few who could testify to that. I recall the early days of the sitting of the 1980 Parliament, when I was sitting next to Joan on the Opposition benches. I was a new recruit, and on the first day of sitting Charlie Jones, who had served long in this Parliament; came in and looke- across the bench and saw that he had to sit next to Joan. He said at top note: 'It is bad enough having you sheil as here, but I have to sit next to one of you'. I was slightly taken aback by that. However, it did not ruffle Joan. She simply turned around and said: 'Sit down, Charles, and be quiet'. Of course, Charles meekly obliged, and he did not complain again. Joan Child will make at least one major change in this House. In February 1981, at the end of Question Time the honourable member for Henty asked the then Speaker whether he would cease referring to members as honourable gentlemen. 'It is starting to get a bit embarrassing', she the House. The Speaker acknowledged the error, apologised, and a minute later asked honourable gentlemen to resume their seats. Madam Speaker, I am sure, will never make that mistake. Today is not just a proud day for Joan's five sons and their families, who are here; it is a proud day for the Australian Labor Party and all her colleagues. She does us great credit by being our nominee for Speaker.",240
12,Mr SINCLAIR ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia)- Mr Clerk, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I second the nomination of Mr Allan Charles Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, as Speaker of the Parliament. I think we all need to understand that since the election of the Hawke Government the standards of this Parliament have declined significantly. There has been a constant attempt by members of the Government to denigrate the institution of Parliament. One need only look around at the standard of dress that so many members of the Australian Labor Party affect; to listen to the debate in this House and to the responses during Question Time by the man who very temporarily sits on the benches as Prime Minister; to see the degree to which he portrays an arrogance that shows little respect for the institution that is the Australian Parliament; to see the extent to which individual Ministers during Question Time are quite prepared not to do as they should-that is, to make parliamentary statements on matters of policy-but respond to Dorothy Dix questions, to know the degree to which this institution has been affected by the election of the Australian Labor Party. This election of Speaker is therefore particularly important. It is important not just for the quality of Parliament but also for the confidence of the electorate at large in this place as an institution. Honourable members will recall an article by Milton Cockburn in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 8 October, only last year. In that article Mr Cockburn referred to the complaint that Parliament is a declining institution, and he quoted statistics from the latest annual report of the Department of the House of Representatives to prove that that was so. Honourable members might recall that the forEmptyHere House of Representatives Practice noted the attributes required of a person who is to be elected as Speaker of this place. He said: One of the hallmarks of good Speakership is the requirement for a high degree of impartiality in the execution of the duties. told He refers to May's Parliamentary Practice when he states: Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, and many conventions exist which have as their object not only to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also to ensure that his impartiality is generally recognised. EmptyHere The Speaker shows impartiality in the Chamber above all else. That, I believe, is one of the attitudes we must look for in the person we are about to elect as Speaker. We respect Mrs Child as an individual and as a member. We respect her contribution as a parliamentarian. We compliment her on the fact that she is the first lady member to have been elected Chairman of Committees of this place. But, if one looks at the qualities required to dispense impartiality, one can only express regret with regard to an article in this morning's Age by Richard Guilliatt which states: Mrs Child does not share this reforming zeal. , So be it. But she does say that she intends to attend party meetings and she does intend not to be an independent Speaker because, she says, there is no such animal. r put to Mrs Child that, while we respect very much the contribution she has made as a member and while we believe that she has so many admirable qualities, it is important that, having assumed the mantle of Speaker-inevitably, the numbers will give her that responsibility-she should consider the adEmptyHere in his House of Representatives Practice but also in May's Parliamentary Practice, which is ultimately binding in the application of the rules of this place. There is also the fact that the Standing Orders not only of this Parliament but also of the United Kingdom House of Commons and others, such as the House of Commons in Canada, give to the person who is Speaker a measure of independence that requires that speakers on this side of the House, be it in Question Time, private members' time or any of the other procedures of the Parliament, be given at least equal and fair consideration. We will be looking forward to that being exercised by the person who is elected Speaker. I believe that Allan Rocher, above all, is the person who has those qualities. He has been a senator. My colleague the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has referred very fittingly to the description given by Speaker Snedden of the obligations of a Speaker. Mr Rocher enjoys them all. I therefore put to members of the Parliament that, in spite of party loyalties, it would be well for them to consider the necessity to ensure that there is impartiality and that we lift the standards of this Parliament. I submit to honourable members that the honourable member for Curtin is the one to whom the vote should be given and we look forward to all members of the House endorsing him as their choice.",241
13,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Moreton) (2.23)-1 believe that the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher) has qualities deserving of the position of Speaker because he, at least, will be a lasting Speaker. If we look at what has occurred over the last three years, we see that the intimidation of the previous Speaker by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) caused him to give the job away early. All members of this House will recall time and again the Prime Minister turning the ring on his finger, looking to the sky, almost demanding of the previous Speaker that he start to throw out members on this side of the House. I believe that Dr Jenkins made the decision that he would not put up with that intimidation and that it would be in the interests of the Parliament for him to accept the offer of a job in Madrid so that he would not follow down the same road taken by Jim Cope many years ago when he was summarily dismissed because he did not follow the dictates of the Government of the time. I believe that Mr Rocher is a man of strength, a man who will not be intimidated-this is not meant as a complete reflection on the honourable member for Henty ( Mrs Child)-a man who will say to the Prime Minister: 'Be seated, because we have reached a stage when the number of questions has been reduced over the last three years and the standards of the Parliament are slipping away because of the way in which you expect me to act as though I were an instrument of Papa Doc or Baby Doc in Haiti'. That is the way the Prime Minister expects this Parliament to be run and that is why I am proposing that Mr Rocher, who is a man of strength, integrity and dignity-the word 'strength' should be underlined three or four times-is the person most suitable to take the job. However, if he does not get the job I would like Mrs Child to understand that my contribution is not meant to be inflammatory and cause her to look upon me in an unfavourable way. In conclusion, I have a very high regard for the now departed from this place Dr Harry Jenkins. I am just sorry that he had to opt to get out because he could not stand the pressure of the Prime Minister.",242

15,The Clerk,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The result of the ballot is: Mrs Child, 78 votes; Mr Rocher, 64 votes. Mrs Child is declared elected. Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child)-I wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour the House has been pleased to confer upon me. Madam Speaker having seated herself in the chairMONICA",242
16,Mr HAWKE ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Wills-Prime Minister)Madam Speaker, all of us here today have been privileged to be part of history because we have participated in and been witness to this historic election of the first woman Speaker of this great House. Madam Speaker, it is both a great personal achievement and a strongly symbolic one. It is richly deserved. I assure you that you have the unqualified congratulations of the Government and, I know, of this House. For you, Madam Speaker, it is another step and indeed a highlight in a distinguished career which, as previous speakers have said, has seen you elected as the first Labor woman member of this House, the first woman Chairman of Committees and then ultimately, today, the first woman Speaker of the House. Madam Speaker, your new position reflects the esteem in which you are held by this House and is a measure of your integrity, ability and character. May I say that that is particularly reflected in the fact that in what is a tough sort of political apparatus on both this and the other side of this House you received the unanimous endorsement of your party. That speaks so highly of your character. There will be little doubt, if any, to any person in this House who knows you that you will discharge your duties with dignity and impartiality: It is a matter of pride on this side of the House that the last three years in this country have seen a considerable improvement in the recognition of the skills, abilities aspirations of Australian women. Your election is a symbol of that recognition. Madam Speaker, as one who counts himself as a personal friend of yours of many years standing, I regard today's events as a just reward not only for your diligence, hard work and fairmindedness but also for the great qualities of a human being that you have brought to this House. It must be a matter of great pride to you that those five sons whom you have brought up are here today to witness this great event. I know that your life has not always been easy and I have no doubt that at times your role as Speaker will also be difficult. Nevertheless, may I assure you that you will at all times carry with . you the best wishes of this House and our deep respect. We wish you well.",242
17,Madam SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,I thank you.,243
18,Mr HAWKE,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Madam Speaker, may I have your indulgence at this point to take this opportunity to pay a very brief tribute to the work of your predecessor, Harry Jenkins Senior?",243
19,Madam SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Yes, please proceed.",243
20,Mr HAWKE,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Of course, I dismiss the fanciful nonsense that comes, as we expect, from the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron). Harry Jenkins was a distinguished Speaker of this House. He was, without question, fair to both sides. There is no doubt that he preferred to settle any disputes that arose in our proceedings by the quick quip rather than by formality. He was respected by both sides of this House. Harry Jenkins had a long service in this Parliament after, as we all know, previous service in the Victorian Parliament. In his service in this House he not only brought great credit to this institution but also served the electors of Scullin well over all of that period. As he departed this place over the Christmas break, all of us did not have the opportunity to wish him a formal farewell. I wish now to place on record the gratitude of this side of the House for the role he played.",243
21,Mr HOWARD ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition)-Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition, I would like to associate this side of the House with the words of congratulation that have been offered to you by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). Despite the partisan nature of the ballot, I think I can say without equivocation that the pleasure of the historic nature of your election as the first woman SpÂ·eaker of the House of Representative is shared equally on both sides of the House. It is a remarkable tribute to your and career, courage, determination and hard work that, according to the political principles in which you believe, you have been able to battle your way to a position where you have been unanimously chosen by the Australian Labor Party as its nominee for the positiQn of Speaker. You are a person well liked on both sides of the House. There have been occasions in the past when there have been inevitable disagreements with your rulings as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. But I know that you enjoy a considerable degree of respect and regard on our side of the House arid we look forward to your period as Speaker of the House as being one marked by fairness, impartiality and a commitment to the parliamentary institution which, with all its faults and with all its detractors, is still the principal forum in which our democratic process is played out. While you maintain those principles you will have the great good will and the great support on our side of the House. I would like particularly to say to you, as the Prime Minister did; that it must be a great source of satisfaction to you personally to have all of the members of your family here today witnessing this very remarkable time in your career. So we wish you welL We look forward to your stewardship. We will follow it with great interest. We will give very great attention to your rulings. We know that you will take on board the very cogent arguments that were addressed by my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr N, A. Brown). The importance of this chamber as a debating place in which members 011 both sides of the House, not only those on the front bench, have the opportunity to have their say and to have their rights respected is something that all of us should very jealously guard. You assume the position as the first woman ever to become Speaker of the House of Representatives with the good wishes and the good will of the Opposition .. I also join with the Prime Minister in wishing your predecessor, Dr Jenkins, well. Although what he will be doing is not officially announced, I wish him an interesting period ahead. Rumour hath it that he may be taking up some position. If that is true, he goes with the very good wishes of the Opposition. We had some differences, and I certainly do not want to get into a debate about that now. Harry Jenkins is no longer a member of the House, but I know that all members of the Opposition wish him and his wife the best of health, the best of good fortune and a very enjoyable period whatever may be their lot.",243
22,Mr SINCLAIR ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"New England-Leader, of the National Party of Australia)-Madam Speaker, on behalf of members of the National Party of Australia, I, too, would like to extend our congratulations to you on the high office which you have assumed today. This is the first time that anyone in this Parliament has had the opportu- , nity to address a Madam Speaker. It is an who occasion which adds dignity and honour to this chamber and to the parliamentary institution. As I said when seconding the nomination of Mr Rocher, we regard you highly as a member of this chamber. We look forward to continuing that respect in relation to the decisions and rulings that you will give as a result of the authority that you exercise as the Presiding Officer of the House of Representatives. You now occupy a lonely position. It is. one that calls on one's reserves of energy It calls for qualities which are really quite different from those which are used in the normal function that each of us plays as a member of this Parliament. You certainly have shown determination and strength in your assumption of this office, in your performance in this House, and in your representation of your electorate. I wish you well. I know that today your sons will be as proud of your achievement, as, I have little doubt, you have been of theirs. I wish you well in the exercise of your office. On a personal level but, no doubt, on behalf of all members of this House, I extend my said sympathy to Mr Rocher, the unsuccessful ca-Â­ didate today, following the tragic death .ofhls stant wife only a fortnight ago as a result of an Illness. With regard to the former Speaker, Dr Harry Jenkins, and Wendy, his wife, I join with the remarks of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard). Harry was a long time and distinguished parliamentarian in the Victorian Legislative Assembly and, subsequently, here. As Speaker we did not always see eye to eye with him, but Harry made a very important contribution towards establishing and maintaining the standards which are an important part of a democracy. For all that he mayor may not take up another office, I know that, whatever he does, he will do it with distinction. I believe that in the past he has represented his country in an excellent fashion. To him and his wife, I wish long life and every success in whatever responsibilities he may be called on to bear. I know that all members of the House share these wishes with me.",244
23,Mr ROCHER ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Curtin)-In 1837, shortly after Disraeli was elected for the first time to the British House of Commons, he described to his sister Sarah Speaker Abercromby's re-election. He said: Shaw-Lefebre proposed, and Strutt of Derby seconded, Abercromby. Both were brief, the first commonplace, the second commonplace and coarse; all was tame. Peel said a little, very well. Then Abercromby, looked like an old laundress, mumbled and moaned some dullness, and was then carried to the Chair and said a little more amid a faint, dull cheer. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to note that your accession to the Speakership has been far more agreeable to this House than apparently was Abercromby's accession in Disraeli's eyes. Even the honourable member for Isaacs ( Mr Charles) and the honourable member for Canberra ( Mrs Kelly), who moved and seconded your nomination, may have done somewhat better than Shawand strength. Lefebre and Strutt of Derby. There are some dangers as well as duties and responsibilities that go with your high office, Madam Speaker. You may not know that Speaker Bussy, the last Speaker under Richard II was one of the first to deem it his duty to se-ve only the King and to keep the Commons subservient. His loyalty was to the King and not to the Commons, but he paid for it because, when Henry IV deposed Richard, Speaker Bussy was beheaded without trial. I suspect,. however, that any difficulties you may have will be of the type referred to by Speaker Selwyn Lloyd, who in defence of holders of the Speaker's office: Behaviour is under close scrutiny and subject to concriticism. If he is too authoritative, he is likely to be called arrogant. If he lets the House discipline itself or fails to do so himself, he is called weak. He can never do exactly right. Had Speaker Peel been around he may have advised you that without the support of the House a Speaker can do nothing; with that support there is little she cannot do. As for my unsuccessful candidacy, I am reminded of the story about Churchill's defeat at the hands of Attlee immediately after World War II. An Eastern European gentleman, whose name I cannot remember, asked whether Churchill would be shot for losing. I can say only that I do not know what my colleagues have in mind. Madam Speaker, my association with you over recent years, as one of your Deputy Chairmen of Committees and as a fellow delegate on a parli-mentary delegation, leads me to believe that you will earn the goodwill and respect of the Opposition in your new high office. I offer congratulations to you personally and to your colleagues on their choice.",244
24,Mr CHARLES ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Isaacs)-I do not wish to add much to what I have already said in presenting your nomination to the House, Madam Speaker. However, I would like to add that everything I did say was genuinely put before the House. It is a great day for the Parliament, in particular, everyone on this side of the House. It is a great day for the people of Australia, especially for the people of the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne where you are held in such high regard and respected so much. Congratulations, Madam Speaker. I am sure you will have a very successful and long life as Speaker of the House.",245
25,Madam SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,Thank you very much.,245
26,Mr SCHOLES ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Corio-Minister for Territories)-I will not detain the House for long. Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate you on achieving the office of Speaker. You are only the fourth woman ever to have been elected to this place. You are now the Speaker and I believe that as Speaker you will exercise all of the necessary qualities of that office. In concluding, I would like to congratulate and thank Dr Harry Jenkins for the service he gave to the House. He is present in the gallery. I think that is appropriate. It is always sad that an honourable member who has left after long service is usually out of the chamber and therefore cannot be given what I feel are the necessary eulogies.",245
27,Madam SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"May I again thank the House for the high honour it has accorded me in electing me to this position. I thank particularly my mover, David Charles, and my seconder, Ros Kelly, both good and close friends of mine. I appreciate their words, and everyone was true. I also thank the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) who, as he said, has been a friend of long standing, for the words he had to say. I was particularly pleased to hear what he had to say about the position of women both within the Parliament and within the community. I thank the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. We have known each other for quite a long time. We came into Parliament together in 1974. However, he withstood the 1975 challenge and I did not. I have had a respect for and friendship with the Leader of the Oppositiori. I know the words he said were sincere and I thank him for them. I thank also the Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair) for his comments. I thank the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher) for his comments. I thank the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) for the flowers. I am sure that the honourable member for Maranoa has achieved another first because I doubt whether any other Speaker, except back in the early days when they carried their herbs, has been given a bunch of flowers on attaining this office. I suppose the honourable member will bring me an apple next time. If I may, with the indulgence of the House I also thank Dr Jenkins, the previous Speaker, for a tremendous amount of assistance which he has given me in my term as Deputy Speaker. At the same time. I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay ( Mr Millar) who also has, when I have asked him for his advice, always given wisdom. Having said that, I would like also to reply to a few things said during the speeches. Firstly I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr M. A. Brown) that when he is getting irate about the length of time it takes for Ministers to answer questions he should remember that the remedy for this of course is in the hands of honourable members; it is not in the hands of the Chair. If the honourable member is so concerned about it he should put up a minute to the Standing Orders Committee and have the Standing Orders altered. If the House wants to say that Ministers may have one minute, two minutes, or three minutes in which to answer questions, so be it. There are limitations on the powers given to the Chair. I have read practices, principles and so forth. Sometimes persuasion does not work. I have noticed that that is the case in regard to both sides of the House. The only standing order that the House has given to the Speaker is that the. answer be relevant. So, honourable members should not look to the Speaker when they want to stop Ministers speaking; they should look to themselves and alter'the Standing Orders to suit themselves. The powers given to the Chair by the Standing Orders for dealing with disorderly conduct are rarely invoked. This is a testimony to the tolerance and respect for the institution held by my predecessors. Those are Harry Jenkins's words, but I say them too. He added-and I add-that there are absolute limits to the tolerance that can be offered. Honourable members should remember that point. The House itself determines its Standing Orders and its practice and the Speaker has the responsibility of ensuring that they are complied with. But this is a two-way street and it is the responsibility of all members of this House to keep order because it is they who give the Standing Orders to me. If honourable members have this deep respect for the institution of Parliament-and I was delighted to hear the Leader of the National Party, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister unanimous in their respect for the House-they, too, will look to the Standing Orders of this House and they, together with me, will ensure that, as the Leader of the National Party said, we lift the standards of parliament. It is in all of our hands, not just mine. Finally, I say to the Leader of the National Party that no one who comes into this House is independent. We all have an allegiance to a political party. Being impartial and fair is a quite different thing. The Chair intends to ensure that the House belongs to all members, not just to a few. I believe that this House belongs to the members of this House of the Parliament. I do not believe that they get a fair enough go to speak in it. But while I am sitting in the chair I will endeavour to insist on fairness. A degree of latitude traditionally has been afforded to party leaders because of the positions they hold. But with that, I remind them, comes a corresponding responsibility. Once again I say that I am delighted to have been elected to this high office and I hope that I can serve this House and the members of this House with integrity and impartiality. If any member would like to speak to me, my door is always open. NA",245
28,Madam SPEAKER,HOURS OF SITTING,While we are gathered together-we do not get together a great dealmay I make a brief announcement concerning the hours of sitting today in light of the unavailability of meals in the refreshment rooms.

Dr Henry Alfred Jenkins resigning his seat as member for the electoral division of Scullin. His Excellency issued a writ on 3 January 1986 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Scullin in the State of Victoria to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr Jenkins. The dates in connection with the by-election were fixed as follows: For the close of the rolls, Friday, 10 January 1986; for nomination, Wednesday, 15 January 1986; for taking the poll in the event of the election being contested, Saturday, 8 February 1986; for the return of the writ, on or before 28 March 1986.

EmptyHere I at the outset add my congratulations to you on being elected Speaker of this House and particularly on being the first woman Speaker this House; might I say, an extremely popular result. It is an honour for me to nominate my friend the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) for the position of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees this after-_ noon. I move: That the honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Leo MCLeay, be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. Mr Cunningham-I second the nomination of the honourable member for Grayndler.",247

36,Mr NA BROWN ,COMMITTEES,"I second the nomination, Madam Speaker.",247
37,Madam SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Is there any further nomination? The time allowed for nominations has expired. EmptyHere an honour for me to nominate my friend the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay). It is my very strong belief that since his election to the House of Representatives 1979 the honourable member has maintained record of involvement and achievement in the activities and life of the Parliament which him an eminently suitable choice as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. The honincumbent ourable member for Grayndler has been a memfive ber of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure since September 1979, including periods as Deputy Chairman 1981 and 1983 and Chairman since 1983. Under his chairmanship, the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee has undoubtedly grown in both stature and involvement. He has been a member of the Procedure Committee of the House of Representatives since its inception. In addition, he is currently a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House. He also served on the Joint House Committee. That this is an outstanding record of involvement in the activities of the Parliament is unThe questionable. That the honourable member's is one of achievement is also unquestionable and can, I think, be no better displayed than by the example of the report of the Expenditure Committee entitled 'In a Home or at Home', which was the product of his active of stewardship and which today is acclaimed by experts across this country as a landmark in the evolution of care for the aged. Indeed, it was of itself a catalyst for many of the Government's present policies on extending care to the aged. The election of the honourable member for Grayndler as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees would be a milestone along that path of interest, involvement and achievement in the activities and life of the Parliament and specifically the House of Representatives. It would be an honour for the people he represents in the inner western suburbs of Sydney. It is indeed a very long way from his first job many ago as a telegram boy at the Marrickville post office that today he is offering himself to his colleagues for election to this important position. I trust that honourable members will recognise the qualities and abilities of the honourable member for Grayndler and elect him as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives.",247
38,Mr SINCLAIR ,COMMITTEES,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.32)-It is with a great deal of pleasure that I nominate Clarrie Millar, the honourable member for Wide Bay, to be Chairman of Committees of this Parliament. As we all know, Clarrie won the respect in of people from both sides of this House for the a manner in which in the past he exercised the responsibility of the position for which I now makes nominate him. He has been the member for Wide Bay for many years and he has been an of the position of Deputy Speaker for years. Over that time both sides of the House found him to be a man who exercised the responsibilities with considerable distinction and between absolute impartiality. As I endeavoured to identify during the earlier discussion regarding the nominations for your position, Madam Speaker, there are a number of responsibilities which it is essential are exercised by those who sit in the Speaker's chair. These apply equally to the person who is the Chairman of Committees as' they do tc the person who happens to be Speaker. Certainl), Clarrie Millar has shown to all honourable members his ability to exercise those responsibilities. I think it is worth noting that comments from both sides of the House have paid tribute to the way in which he has, exercised those necessary judgments that being Chairman of Committees requires. For example, the Deputy Pfime Minister ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has said of Mr Millar: Millar is a gentleman and he is a credit to the Parliament. [ don't agree with his politics, but he's a man you would never disagree with personally. Charles Connelly, the President of the Small Business Association, which is quite outside the Parliament, said of Clarrie Millar: Clarrie Millar is a man or integrity and intelligence. I would like to see him in the Prime Minister's seat. This afternoon we are not talking about him being Prime Minister; we are quite content to have him appointed as Chairman of Committees. Perhaps of even more relevance in this debate are some comments which appeared in the Chronicle, which happens to be published in the electorate of Wide Bay. I am sure that the EmptyHere be interested to know that under the heading 'Punchlines' there was an anecdote about the honourable member for Wide Bay. It is interesting that you, Madam Speaker, are quoted. Apparently on an occasion in the House you said that Mr Millar had 'justifiably earned the respect of members on both sides of the House'. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is quoted as saying that Mr Millar had 'earned both the respect and the affection of all people in the House'. Your predecessor, Madam Speaker, said that he believed that Mr Millar 'set a wonderful example for future chairmen of committees'. It is worth noting that in ending 'Punchlines' Mr Kev Pearman, the correspondent concerned, said: Those who know our local Member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, would not be surprised by the tributes. As politicians go, he is a true straight-shooter. We know him to be a straight-shooter and a good fellow. We do know that he has exercised and would exercise these responsibilities in a very proper way. There is one other aspect of the responsibilities of the Chairman of Committees to which I wish to advert briefly. I think that in the past there have been far more opportunities for debate at the Committee stage of Bills before the chamber. We all recall that when Speaker Scholes was in the chair a committee of this Parliament looked at the possible extension of the role of committees of the House. I know that at the moment the House of Representatives Committee on .Procedure is considering some aspects of the general deliberations of this Parliament. I put to that Committee, to the House, and to whoever is to be elected as Chairman of Committees, that it could well be that the Committee stage of this chamber needs review. I believe that the person who is to be Chairman of Committees has a unique responsibility in that role. Of course, it is under your overall responsibility, Madam Speaker, but the Chairman of Committees does exercise the presidential responsibility at that time when the chamber is not in plenary session but is looking at the details of legislation before it. It is a stage which in the past has been more significant than it is at this time. If any of us are concerned about the freedoms of Parliament, the responsibilities of Parliament, and the ways in which we can implement the views of our constituents, then the Committee stage is an appropriate opportunity to show our concern. It is on that basis, and knowing Mr Millar's own concern in that area and the very high measure of respect that he enjoys from both sides of the House, that it is with a great deal of pleasure that I nominate him to be Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.",247
39,Mr CUNNINGHAM ,COMMITTEES,"MCMillan) (3.38)Madam Speaker, before speaking to the motion to appoint the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay), may I first of all congratulate you on your election to your position and also on the work you did in the position we are discussing at present. In speaking to the motion that the honourable member for Grayndler be appointed Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker of the House, I am sure that after the remarks by the honourable EmptyHere of the House will be fully aware of the work that Leo has done over many years since his election to the Parliament in 1979. He has worked very hard on many committees of this Parliament, and he has had a lot of experience as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. The Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair), who has just spoken for the Opposition, mentioned the procedures of the House. I am sure that in the position for which the honourable member for Grayndler has been nominated nobody will be more familiar with the workings of this House because he has had a great deal of experience in that area in the Procedure Committee. The honourable member for Barton spoke of the background of the honourable member for Grayndler as a member of other committees. I am sure that that experience will also stand him in good stead for the position. We have talked today about fairness and impartiality. We have talked about whether people in these sorts of positions, particularly the Speaker's position, should be independent. I believe that everybody who is elected to a position of such importance in this Parliament will show the impartiality and fairness that is expected. I am sure that Leo MCLeay will carry out those duties as well as anybody else has ever done. I am sure that in following our present Speaker into that position he will show the same skills in the job and the same impartiality and will carry out his responsibilities on behalf of the Parliament with complete fairness. It gives me great pleasure to second the nomination.",248
40,Mr NA BROWN ,COMMITTEES,"Menzies) (3.39)Madam Speaker, at the outset may I congratulate you on your election to your high office and wish you well in the discharge of your duties. I suppose, by way of an insurance policy, I should congratulate the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) on receiving the endorsement of his Party as a candidate for this also very high office and office of considerable significance in the workings of the Parliament. Finally, because I was involved in the by-election for Scullin, may I also congratulate the newly elected member for Scullin. He had a close shave, but he got here and that is what counts. The swing in Scullin was larger in the areas where I campaigned! It is with very much pleasure that I second the nomination of the honourable member for Wide Bay. He has had a long and distinguished career in this Parliament. He has considerable experience in the workings of this Parliament. Indeed, he has made the Parliament his life. Not only has he served on committees and been Chairman of Committees but also has he in fact been an Acting Speaker. Everyone agrees that he has discharged his duties with great dignity and credit to himself and this Parliament. It may not be widely known, but in fact, if I remember correctly, he invented standing order 303. His use of that standing order when in the chair indicates his firmnessa firmness which we expect from occupants of the chair-that has been matched only by his fairness and politeness to all sides of the Parliament. We, whether on the Government side or the Opposition side of the Parliament, can rest assured that our privileges and rights as members of this Parliament will be preserved, protected and enhanced if the honourable member for Wide Bay is elected Chairman of Committees. I therefore urge honourable members to support the honourable member for Wide Bay.",249

43,Mr HAWKE ,COMMITTEES,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Grayndler, Leo MCLeay, on his election to the important position of Chairman of Committees. I think it is well understood that the honourable member for Grayndler will bring . to this position very solid experience gained in this House and on its committees. I have no doubt at all, as I am sure all honourable members have no doubt, that he will undertake his duties with diligence and equanimity. This side takes pleasure in Leo's election to this position, and we wish him well in the days ahead. I know that Leo will not object in any sense if I add in my congratulations to him observations on Clarrie Millar of the same sort that I made on a previous occasion. I know that Clarrie will not take the vote as any adverse reflection upon him, because I have no difficulty whatsoever in associating myself, in all respects, with the adulatory comments that were properJymade about him by the Leader of his Party. He richly deserved them. As I have said before, he still has our respect and our affection.",249

46,Mr HOWARD ,COMMITTEES,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition, I also wish to offer congratulations to the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) on being elected Chairman of Committees and to associate myself with the spirit of the words just uttered by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) about the honourable member for Wide Bay ( Mr Millar). If I read my papers correctly this morning, I know that the honourable member for Grayndler will not take the 78 votes that he received in this ballot as 'the unanimous endorsement' of him but as the choice by the Australian Labor Party as related to the Speaker. In offering him congratulations, I say that we will follow with great interest his rulings and activities as Chairman of Committees. We wish him well. On behalf of the Opposition, I take the opportunity to thank both Allan Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, and Clarrie Millar for submitting themselves, on behalf of the Opposition, as nominees for the positions of Speaker and Chairman of Committees. Both honourable members enjoy the regard, support and respect of the members of the joint Opposition parties. In the nature of things, they were doomed to be unsuccessful today, but we certainly wish both of them well for the future.",249
47,Mr SINCLAIR ,COMMITTEES,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia)-I would like to join in the congratulations of the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay). He certainly managed to get the numbers right both in Caucus and in the House. For that achievement in this House of numbers I give him due credit. His predecessor as honourable member for Grayndler was a fairly redoubtable personality in this House. We remarked on the occasion of the honourable member's election that we looked forward to big things from him as the previous member's successor. I am not too sure, however, that I would wish him to exercise his discretion in the Parliament in the way the former member for Grayndler did as Leader of the House. Indeed, were he to do so, we would have every reason to complain about the way in which he performed as Chairman of Committees. We wish the honourable member well. His is an important responsibility. We shall be observing his performance with a considerable amount of interest. No doubt from time to time one may or may not have some cause to make comment on it. As I have not had the opportunity already, could I also congratulate the newly elected honourable member for Scullin ( Mr Jenkins) and say that I hope that he also achieves the same distinction in this House as his father did before him.",250
48,Mr MILLAR ,COMMITTEES,"Wide Bay)-Madam Speaker, with the indulgence of the House for a brief moment, may I congratulate my parliamentary colleague and friend the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) on his election to the position of Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. He will no doubt find it as challenging as those who have gone before him have found it challenging. Madam Speaker, as you can vouch, he will find it singularly unique. It has been accurately described as the hottest and loneliest seat in Australia. It is not always hot but when it is it is indescribably hot. It is always lonely. The honourable member will find in that singularly unique situation more challenges than he would imagine in prospect. Indeed, if I may offer one observation about the incumbency of the chair, it is an experience which every honourable member of this place should enjoy for the mutual profit of honourable members and the House. I do indeed wish the honourable member for Grayndler well and trust that the House prospers from his attention to his responsibilities.",250
49,Mr LEO MCLEAY ,COMMITTEES,"Grayndler)-I thank you, Madam Speaker and honourable members. At the outset I congratulate you, Madam Speaker, on your election as Speaker of the House of Representatives and the history that you have made here today. I am reminded of what a friend of mine said to me on the phone the other night. He said: 'Don't get too worried, Leo. You can make a little bit of history because remember that on Tuesday you will be the first male Deputy Speaker elected to serve under a female Speaker'. Madam Speaker, the history books will remember you. I thank also the mover and seconder of my nomination for their kind words.",250
50,Dr KLUGMAN ,COMMITTEES,"And the returning officer. Mr LEO MCLEA YThe honourable member for Prospect has reminded me that I should thank the Caucus returning officer, which I do. I checked his vote today; I never had a chance to check it the other day. While I was sitting here listening to other members congratulate you, Madam Speaker, I was reminded of another forum in which I have sat in a meeting context. The people who, in my view, have been extremely good in the chair in this House are you, Madam Speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay ( Mr Millar) and Dr Jenkins. I think that those three are excellent examples for me to follow. Of course, I then had cause to think of the other meeting forum in which I operated before I came here. I refer to the annual conferences of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party over which my great EmptyHere John Ducker presided. I can assure honourable members that I will be taking my example in this forum from the three whom I mentioned rather than the Treasurer and John Ducker. Madam Speaker, I noted that in your acceptance speech you also reminded members that they should not try your patience. I guess I also should put on a caveat and say that if honourable members try my patience too much I will take a leaf out of Keating's and Ducker's book rather than out of yours, Jenkins's and Millar's. I thank the House very much for the honour it has given to me today. I can assure honourable members that I will do my best to be fair, firm and impartial. Madam Speaker, I would like to echo what you said, that one can still be party political but be impartial. I shall do my very best to follow in the footsteps of those people who have done an excellent job as my forebears. NA",250
51,Mr HAWKE ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I move: That this House(I) expresses its deep regret at the death on 29 November 1985 of the Hon. Sir Charles Davidson, KBE, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Capricornia from 1946 to 1949 and the Division of Dawson from 1949 to 1963; (2) places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and (3) tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. Sir Charles Davidson was born in 1897. He served in two world wars and was made a Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1945, having been mentioned twice in dispatches. Sir Charles was a dairy farmer by occupation and a sugar cane farmer before entering Parliament. He was elected for the Country Party to the House of Representatives in 1946 for the Queensland seat of Capricornia. Following a redistribution he was elected member for Dawson in 1949. He was Country Party Whip from 1950 to 1956 before being promoted to the positions of Minister for the Navy, which he held from 1956 to 1958, and Postmaster-General, which he held from 1956 to 1963. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1964. Sir Charles was a long-standing and respected member of the House of Representatives and of the Parliament. On behalf of the Government I extend to members of his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",251
52,Mr HOWARD ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition)-The Opposition supports the motion of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) to convey our condolences and to record the regards of the House for the contribution to the Parliament of the late Sir Charles Davidson. He left this Parliament in 1963. As such very few honourable members now in the Parliament would have served with him. However, those who came into the Parliament after him and who would have followed politics would know of his great contribution to the affairs of the then Country Party, particularly in his native State of Queensland, the fact that he served with great distinction in both World War I and World War II and that he devoted considerable time in a voluntary capacity, to the work of the Asthma Foundation of Queensland, being President of that Foundation between 1964 and 1973. He continuously represented an area of Australia, namely the electorate of Capricornia, which has within it some of the more troubled rural indusDAVIDSON tries at present, with very great success and very great distinction. I know that all members of the Liberal Party and particularly some of his former colleagues in the Country Party, now the National Party of Australia, join in expressing sadness at his death and conveying our sympathy and condolences to his family.",251
53,Mr SINCLAIR ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia)-On behalf of members of the National Party of Australia. I long and join in the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard). Charlie Davidson, as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, rose to some considerable eminence in the ranks in the predecessor of the now National Party of Australia, the Country Party. He was a Queensland dairy farmer and subsequently a cane grower. He held high office in the cane growers' organisation and at the time of the consideration of British entry into the European Community contributed a great deal in debates on whether the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement should continue. I think it is of some interest that many of the problems that are today upon cane growers in Queensland would really not have occurred had Charlie Davidson and others of those days succeeded in achieving a continuation of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement in spite of Britain entering the European Community. Charlie Davidson was a Postmaster-General, a Minister for the Navy, a Whip for the then Country Party and, of course, a Deputy Leader of the Party. He was one of that generation of Australians who served their country in both World War I and World War II. In fact, he left his name on two particular ridges after campaigns in New Guinea in World War II and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel with the 42nd Battalion while serving in New Guinea. As theÂ· Prime Minister has said, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire, he was twice mentione.d in despatches and, of course, he subsequently became a Knight of the British Empire. Charlie Davidson was an outstanding Queenslander. He represented that State very forcefully in this House. Those of us who knew him here and elsewhere regarded him not only as a good frienq and a good mate but also as a great Australian. To Lady Davidson, their son and two daughters and other members of the faJIlily, on behalf of the Party, my wife and myself, I extend our deepest sympathy.",251
54,Mr CROSS ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"Brisbane)-I had the honour of representing the Speaker at the funeral of Sir Charles Davidson and I am one of the few people here who served in the House in his time. I remember that Reg O'Brien, the then member for Petrie, christened him 'Old Postiei-a name that was applied to him with great affection. I found him to be a most courteous man with a very broad knowledge of primary industry because he had a long term background in primary industry. I have seldom been more touched than I was at his funeral when the men of the 42nd Battalion, in which he served as an officer in the First World War and which he as lieutenantcolonel took to New Guinea in the Second World War, paid a very sincere tribute to him. When I was elected to parliament it was the policy of the then Government to replace the Brisbane General Post Office with a new building. He was the first Minister that I as the newly elected member for Brisbane, call-d on to make representations to retain that fine colonial building that nobody in his right mind today would suggest demolishing without incurring the wrath of the populace. I found him to be the very courteous, attentive man that we all knew him to be. It was an honour to serve with him and I share with other members regret at his passing and offer my sincere sympathy to Lady Davidson and his family.",252
55,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"Dawson)-As the member for Dawson I would like to relate the feelings of the constituency that Sir Charles Davidson represented from its inception in 1949 and express the regrets of the people of Dawson, and my regrets, to Lady Davidson, her son and her two daughters. While Sir Charles Davidson served in this House he occupied the positions of Minister for the Navy and Postmaster-General, as it. was then known. I note that during the valedIctory on the. night of his retirement Mr MCEwen, later Sir John MCEwen, had this to say about him-among quite a lot of other words-which I believe indicates the man that he was: My deputy leader, the Postmaster-General, the Honourable Charles Davidson, has served this Parliament and our Government with ability, distinction and unchallenged integrity. How many of us would like to leave this House on retirement with those words having been said about us? I would say that few of us could do so. That was the kind of man he was, not only in this Parliament but throughout Australia. In whatever position he served, he served in that manner. The tributes that have been paid with regard to his service in this House are well known. But it is interesting to note that his total service was to the country of Australia, both in peacetime and wartime, and to this Parliament. Quite a few years ago I read a book entitled S'pose I Die-the story of Evelyn Maunsell, the mother of former Senator Maunsell, which was written by Hector Holthouse. Her experiences with regard to the young Charles Davidson-later Sir Charles Davidson-were rather interesting. At that time he was a dairy farmer on the Tablelands. She stated: One day, plodding along the muddy track through our scrub, I met a bullock team pulling a wagon-load of logs and driven by a young man so spotless and clean in fresh trousers and Jackie Howe singlet that I stopped to talk to him. His name was Charlie Davidson he was just back from the war, and was staying with his sister and brother-in-law and helping out by driving the bullock team. I met him again several times after that. . . He was always so neat and spotless that the name suited him. After rising to the rank of colonel in World War II he played a prominent part in the organisation of the Country Party, became Postmaster General and now he .is Sir Charles Davidson. But I shall aiways remember him the way I saw him that first day up at Malanda, spotlessly clean in the mud, and driving a team of bullocks. I wonder how many times when he was a member he had to drive the bullocks in this House to try to get the direction right and the emphasis straight. That occurred just after the !'irst World War when he went into primary mdustry. He not only served the constituency of Dawson but also was a cane farmer within it. He represented the sugar industry in many different ways, including in a secretarial form within his own cane growers organisation and for a time with the. Australian Sugar Producers Association. While he wa- a member of this House he represented the mterests of the sugar industry right down the line and was the best advocate for it. He served the country people. It is interesting to note that he is given credit for the regionalisation of the Australian Broadcasting Commissian, as it was then known, in Townsville and Rockhampton. It was a matter ,of some moment to me when those facilities were removed. They were instigated during Sir Charles's time. He certainly set a standard of performance within the electorate of Dawson that we have found very hard to follow. But I believe that George Shaw for a short time and Dr Rex Patterson for a period of 10 years showed that same example of service to the community as did Sir Charles. His war service was rather interesting. It has been noted that during his war service he had a hill and a ridge in New Guinea named after him. If one looks at the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 September 1956 one will see an article which mentions that during the biggest mail strike in Australia's history the posties in Sydney named a walkway between piled up bags of mail Davidson's Alley after him. He had a great capacity as a man. As I say, he served his country in many different ways. He set an example. He was probably able to do more in his 87 years than any of us would achieve in several lifetimes. I would like also to mention the tribute of the ex-diggers from his battalion. I was moved by the comment by a sergeant, I believe, who served under him in New Guinea who simply said, as a final farewell tp him at the grave, that Charlie Davidson had the capacity to make every soldier a hero. I believe that that was a fitting tribute to a man who led that battalion. For those of us who met him in civilian life and during his parliamentary career he was also the person who made each of us feel a little more important and, perhaps, prouder to be Australians.",252
56,Mr SLIPPER ,DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WILLIAM,"Fisher)-I, along with my family, would like to be associated with the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair) and other honourable members. Sir Charles Davidson, KBE, was a former Deputy Leader of the National Party under its previous name, a former Federal Minister and a former Federal member for Capricornia and Dawson. Although I never met Sir Charles, he was a lifelong friend of my grandfather, Mr D. A. (Archie) MCIntyre, who is now 87 years of age and a strong National Party supporter. The association started when they sat beside each other in class at Townsville Grammar School in north Queensland during their period of attendance at that school in 1912 and 1913. It continued until Sir Charles's death on 29 November 1985. Coincidentally, the late Mr A. D. Hooper-grandfather of my wife Lyn-who is in the gallery today-was also in the same class. On many occasions Sir Charles visited my grandparents at their home in Mackay. He shared with them a love of fishing. In fact, like many of us here, he was very fond of Queensland mud crabs. I was speaking to my grandfather on the weekend and he told me that, when he visited Canberra in the 1950s, he was the guest of Sir Charles Davidson and former Prime Minister Sir Arthur Fadden. The latter he had come to know through their joint interest in Souths Football Club in Townsville. Sir Charles was never lost for words. My grandfather once asked him how he managed the portfolio of Postmaster-General. Jokingly, the reply came back as quick as a flash: 'Just leave it to the bureaucracy'. Some people might be unkind enough to suggest that Sir Charles was a prophet. Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with other members in extending my condolence and sympathy to Lady Davidson and to members of her family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA NA",253
57,Mr HAWKE ,THORBURN,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 January 1986 of Mr Ray William Thorburn, a former member for the division of Cook from 1972 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his wife and family. Ray William Thorburn was born at Sutherland, New South Wales, on 15 November 1930 and was educated at Sydney Technical College. Ray had a strong interest in his community and local government throughout his life. In 1964 he was elected to the Sutherland Shire Council and remained a member until his election to this House in 1972. In his later years as a shire councillor he was President of the Sutherland Shire and an executive member of the Local Government Association of New South Wales. From my own experience, I can pay tribute to the intensity of the commitment of Ray Thorburn to that important tier of government-local government. On his election to this House in December 1972, as Â·part of the historic return of the Australian Labor Party to government, he brought to this place his strong concern for the role of local government in Australia and its relationship to State and Federal government. He brought as well very real concerns for those he served and their problems. He was, in addition, a loyal member of the Australian Labor Party and its strong supporter. He held the position of Vice-President of the Cronulla Branch from 1956 until 1970. Ray Thorburn's premature death on 30 January this year was a loss to his Party and to Australia. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his family-his wife, Joan, and his children, Peter and Ann-our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",253
58,Mr HOWARD ,THORBURN,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition)-The Opposition supports the motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). I remember Ray Thorburn well, having served with him for a period of some 20 months between 1974 and when he left the Parliament in 1975. I certainly recall his very strong interest in local government and his very deep commitment to the civic and political affairs of the Sutherland area of Sydney, having served not only as President of the Sutherland Shire but also for a period of three years as the member for Cook. He also showed a very deep interest in the fortunes and activities of the Australian motor vehicle industry, having had a very considerable association with aspects of the motor manufacturing industry. His death at the comparatively early age of 55 was untimely. The Opposition, and in particular the many members on this side of the House who remember Ray as a member of the Parliament, extend their sympathies to his wife and children.",254
59,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,THORBURN,"Kingsford-SmithAttorney-General)-I join briefly in endorsing the remarks of previous speakers. Ray Thorburn was a great acquisition to the Australian Labor Party and made a very significant contribution to it in terms of local government, representing it here in the short period of the Whitlam years. His death was untimely. I am very mindful of the fact that during the many election campaigns in which he participated he always invited me and others to assist in trying to win a very difficult seat. Subsequent to his retirement from politics he was kind enough to invite me to endeavour to assist him in establishing a business in which he hoped he and his family were going to enjoy some success. Due to ill health that was not the result he achieved, but from the point of view of the endeavour of the man to assist his family one could see the intensity he had exhibited here in earlier days. He was a quite outstanding Australian and was very dedicated to the cause of the nation, very dedicated to the interests of the Labor Party, and particularly dedicated to his family. I regret that I was unable to attend his funeral because of other commitments. I take this opportunity of expressing my condolences to his widow and children.",254
60,Mr SINCLAIR ,THORBURN,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia)-Madam Speaker, on behalf of the members of the National Party, I join in the condolence motion and extend our sympathy to the widow of the late Ray Thorburn and to his children, Ann and Peter. Ray Thorburn was well known to those of us who were in the Parliament in the period between 1972 and 1975. He served outside this House in local government, where he won great respect in the St George and Sutherland areas. In an analysis of the 1974 campaign in the Sydney Morning Herald I was interested to note that he was known locally as Mr Nice Guy. He was certainly a very likeable man. He served the Australian Labor Party well. Those of us who knew him in this place regarded him as a pleasant member and a very pleasant companion. I am sure that all members share in extending our deepest regrets to his widow and to his children.",254
61,Mr DOBIE ,THORBURN,"Cook)-I rise to join in the tribute to my good friend Ray Thorburn, who died on 30 January at the early age of 55. Ray and I were opponents in five campaigns from 1972 through to 1980, Ray having beaten me to enter the House in 1972, while I returned in 1975 by defeating Ray. Such is the nature of politics in the Sutherland Shire that all the campaigning did not affect the close friendship that had developed from the days when Ray first became a councillor on the Sutherland Shire Council in 1964 and I became the Federal member for Hughes in 1966. Over many years we attended the same functions, performed similar duties together, and grew to know each other very well indeed. As with all his friends, I washocked by his early death, though we had known he did not enjoy robust health for a long time and, in fact, had been in very poor health recently. I was most disappointed that I was in the Philippines for their election and was unable to attend the funeral and pay my last respects to a good friend who was a worthy opponent for many years. I do this today. Ray Thorburn was a-. man of quiet and gentle disposition who represented the area in which he was born with an application and dedication which won him the respect, admiration and affection of all whom he served. Ray was a genuinely nice fellow and a fine man. Born in Sutherland and orphaned before the age of 12, there can be no doubting that Ray Thorburn overcame many disadvantages in his life. There can also be no doubting that Ray's greatest strength came from his charming and lovely wife Joan, whom he married romantically on Valentine's Day 1953, his son Peter and his daughter Ann. The House has already heard of his role in the Federal Parliament and his importance as a councillor and as the President of the Sutherland Shire Council. Let me repeat that Ray dedicated himself to his onerous duties as a member of this Parliament - nd as Shire President, which duties he combined for over a year, without the slightest concern for his own welfare or health. He will be long remembered in the Sutherland Shire for the great contribution he made over the long period he served in public office. It should be mentioned also that, Ray, in his retirement, was a director of the Sutherland Hospital Board for five years; a post from which, ironically, he was removed by his own Party in State politics. He and I had many a chuckle about the irony of this. He will be remembered also for the nine years he served as President of the Cronulla Labor and Workingmen's Club Ltd through a time of that club's great difficulties. I know he would not want me to mention the discussions we had, but this too was part of the man's great service to an isolated and insular part of Sydney which will remember him with great affection and respect. To Ray's wife, Joan, daughter, Ann, son, Peter, daughter-in-law, Nadia, and his granddaughter, Candice, who arrived a week before he died-it was one of his great and last joys that he was able to nurse his first grandchild-Ray's passing has been the cause of much grief. I offer to his family my thoughts and prayers at this time of their loss and sadness.",254
62,Mr LEE ,THORBURN,"Dobell)-I wish to associate myself with the motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). Ray Thorburn served in the Australian Parliament as the member for Cook for three 'years, as previous speakers have mentioned. During that time he was not only my local member of parliament but also a fellow member of the Cronulla branch of the Australian Labor Party. Ray Thorburn served as a councillor of the Sutherland Shire Council. Even after his election to this chamber, he continued to fulfil his duties as a local councillor until he had served out the full three-year term to which he had been elected. On the election of Arthur Gietzelt to the Senate in 1971, Ray Thorburn became the Shire' President of the Sutherland Shire. As Shire President he was responsible for many local initiatives, including the development of the Sutherland Civic Centre and the expansion of the E. G. Waterhouse National Camellia Gardens at Caringbah. The first political rally I attended was held in 1972 at Miranda. The current Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) spoke .most eloquently in support of Ray Thorburn's candi-' dature for the seat of Cook. Ray Thorburn was recognised as a hard working and accessible local member. I believe his greatest achievement was his success in persuading the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, in 1974 to purchase the Towra Point wetlands to ensure that this unique wildlife refuge on Botany Bay was preserved for all time. Following victories in the 1972 and 1974 elections, Ray was unsuccessful in 1975. Despite a devastating political and personal loss and a great deal of anger and bitterness amongst his supporters, Ray Thorburn conceded defeat with dignity and honour at the Liberal Party of Australia's election night celebration. Ray Thorburn also served his local community as a member of the Sutherland Hospital Board, a member of the Miranda Co-operative and as the President of the Cronulla Labor Workingmen's Club Ltd. Ray Thorburn spoke at the first meeting which I attended of the Cronulla branch of the Australian Labor Party in October 1972. The last time. I attended the Cronulla branch of the Labor Party was as a visitor in June last year, when Ray Thorburn played an active role in the debate on tax reform. ' On behalf of all current and former members of the Cronulla branch of the Labor Party and all honourable members of this House I extend to his wife, Joan, and his children, Peter and Ann, my sincere condolences on the loss of an Australian who worked very hard for the Sutherland Shire throughout his public life. EmptyHere associate myself with the motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). The Prime Minister has already outlined extensively Ray Thorburn's very great political career, both in local government and too short a career in Federal Parliament. I think that Federal Parliament-with no disrespect to his Opposition candidate-would have been much the better for Ray being here longer - As the honourable member for Cook ( Mr Dobie) mentioned, he did not enjoy good health for a number of years; albeit, to the residents of the Sutherland Shire, Ray Thorburn's death was still a shock. It was certainly a sad loss. As several speakers have mentioned, he was always a very friendly, warm and genuine man and I am sure that is a feeling that is felt across political boundaries in the Sutherland Shire area. Ray Thorburn was a very great servant of the Australian Labor Party and his loss to the Sutherland Shire, in particular, which borders my electorate of Barton, will be greatly felt. I join with other members in sending my condolences to his wife and family. I am sure that Ray Thorburn will be remembered by the Sutherland Shire and its residents for Illany years.",255
63,Mr TICKNER ,THORBURN,"Hughes)-I too seek to join with honourable members in supporting the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in his condolence motion in respect of the late Ray Thorburn. I do not think that it is appropriate to go over many of the things that have been said already about Ray Thorburn. People have already spoken about his extensive involvement in local government and his parliamentary service, which ranged across a number of areas and included a very deep commitment to Aboriginal affairs. I would, however, without injecting any partisan note into this motion, seek to say briefly something about the philosophy which guided Ray Thorburn throughout his life. He was very much a political animal. He dedicated much of his life to service to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people whom our Party seeks to serve. He was an avowed supporter of the democratic socialist traditions of the Labor Party. Whatever view honourable members might have about those principles, I hope that they would all recognise that he held those principles dearly and he worked conscientiously throughout his life to promote them. His commitment to a more just, humane and co-operative society, I believe, has been vindicated in part at least, by your election today, Madam Speaker, and I am sure that he would be very proud to see you occupy that position. He was held in very high regard in the Sutherland Shire. That was borne out on the occasion of his funeral when people from all walks of life and all political persuasions so crowded out the church that it was simply impossible for all the people who sought to pay tribute to him to attend that service; such was Ray Thorburn and his respect throughout the Sutherland Shire. I join with honourable members in expressing my very deep condolences to his wife, Joan, his son, Peter, and daughter, Ann. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA",256
64,Mr HAWKE ,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Wills-Prime Minister)-I inform the House of the following ministerial arrangements: The Minister for Trade ( Mr Dawkins) is overseas on government business and will be absent from Australia until 16 February. He is visiting Europe and the United States for talks on trade matters and in particular the United States farm Bil\ The Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Kerin) will act as the Minister for Trade until his return. NA NA,256
65,Mr HOWARD,PETROL PRICES,"Will the Prime Minister honour the frequent promise of his Government to reduce the price of petrol in line with recent falls in world oil prices and allow all Australian motorists the benefit from the 7c a litre or $3 a week reduction in petrol prices, or does the Prime Minister propose to cheat Australian motorists and other consumers out of those benefits?",256
66,Mr HAWKE,PETROL PRICES,"I suppose that when it comes to{comments upon cheating, we have the benefit of listening to Australia's No.1 cheat, in that he was-Opposition members-Withdraw! Â· Mr HAWKE-No. I did not introduce the language, Madam Speaker.",256
67,Madam SPEAKER,PETROL PRICES,Order! The Prime Minister will continue.,256
68,Mr HAWKE,PETROL PRICES,All Australians will recall-MONICA,256
69,Mr SINCLAIR ,PETROL PRICES,On a point of order: Under our Standing Orders a personal reference against a member is a matter which the Speaker normally asks to be withdrawn. I suggest that the Prime Minister withdraw that personal imputation against the Leader of the Opposition.,256
70,Madam SPEAKER,PETROL PRICES,I remind the Leader of the National Party that the phrase was first directed to the Prime Minister by the Leader of the Opposition.,256
71,Mr HAWKE,PETROL PRICES,"All Australians will recall that one of the first acts of the now Leader of the Opposition in his then capacity as Treasurer in 1978 was to rip back the handful of dollars, the tax deductions, that had been given in the pre-election situation. So when it,comes to this matter-I will not use the word again-we are certainly listening to a master. The situation in regard to oil prices is quite clear, I have already announced that the relevant Ministers will be meeting on this matter on Thursday of this week. There will be a Cabinet meeting on Friday, and our decision will be announced and that decision will take account of the best interests of all Australians. SOCIAL SECURITY: PHONE-IN",256
72,Mr HAND,PETROL PRICES,"I congratulate you, Madam Speaker, and welcome the Chairman of Committees to this corner of the House. I refer the Minister for Social Security to the calls made during the parliamentary recess by the Opposition spokesman on social security for a 'dob-in a-dole-cheat' phone-in, similar to Operation Noah which would be aimed at reducing social security fraud. Does the Government consider such a proposal would be effective? Would it be in the interests of Australian taxpayers and to the long term benefit of Australian social security pensioners and beneficiaries?",257
73,Mr HOWE,PETROL PRICES,"I have to say that my holiday at Mimosa Rocks was interrupted by the crackling of the transistor which indicated that even on New Year's Day the Opposition spokesman was at work calling on a campaign against people receiving pensions and benefits. It is interesting to see that the honourable member for Richmond apparently believes that pensioners and the unemployed ought to be dealt with in a similar way to drug dealers. Indeed, that is typical, if I might say so, of the attitude of the Opposition. To the Opposition, people on social security are fair game to be victimised because they are old, sick or unemployed. The Opposition apparently sees some mileage in prancing around the country spouting fanciful figures concerning so-called social security overpayments. The Leader of the Opposition on the Mark Day Show last year said that on the basis of investigations made over the years we will probably be looking at 15 per cent of social welfare payments. The honourable member for Bradfield talked about overpayments representing $300m a year. The reality is that as a result of a range of Government initiatives, net annual overpayments last financial year were less than $20m. That is less than half of one per cent of a total bill of almost $ 15 billion that we spend in the social security area. When we talk about the loss of money we should remember that at the end of the Fraser-Howard years the Joint Committee of Public Accounts found that almost $3 billion was owed in tax. In 1984 the Public Accounts Committee said that the amount of tax outstanding was a matter of concern. At 30 June 1983 it was $2,904m; 90 per cent of which was income tax-$2,604m. So when we talk about overpayments and when we run around the country talking vague figures we ought to remember that $2.5 billion-nearly $3 billion-was owing to the Australian Taxation Office when we came into power. It was that kind of stewardship which we saw. We heard a great deal over the break about supporting parent benefits. We could pay for supporting parent benefits three times over if that kind of money had been collected under that previous administration. That is a subject that the Opposition is extraordinarily silent about when it talks about overpayments. I want to make a couple of quite serious points about this subject. When we talk about overpayments and about setting up some kind of campaign, let us get into our minds what has happened over the last decade in terms of the distribution of low income people. As a result of a range of policies there has been a vast concentration of low income people and pensioners in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, in high rise estates, in the inner urban areas and in areas like the Hunter and Wollongong. Across this country there are substantial areas of such very high concentration. Many of these people are living on common estates. This kind of call that was put out by the honourable member for Richmond-who perhaps ought to move around and look at some of these communities-is essentially setting neighbour against neighbour. It is setting up a scare campaign which would have a massive impact on the social fabric of these communities. It would victimise innocent people and waste their time and resources. I refer to one example of what occurred under the kind of policies of the previous Government. It is an example which is a shame on any government and on the history of social security in this country. It is the example of the so-called Greek social security conspiracy case. The Greek communities of Melbourne and Sydney were victimised by the Government of the time and yet ultimately no one was convicted of any crime. That is what comes out of this kind of emotional approach to a subject that has to be put into proper perspective. Let me assure the House that the Government, where necessary and where possible, is committed to seeking to reduce overpayments to the smallest extent possible, but we will not achieve that goal by that kind of emotional suggestion made by the honourable member for Richmond that people ought to be dobbed in. NA",257
74,Mr HUNT,FUEL PRICES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and relates to fuel pricing for farmers. Is the Prime Minister aware of the fact that the farmers are amongst the heaviest per capita users of fuel in the nation, using about two billion litres of fuel per annum? Is he also aware that if they receive the full benefit of the reduction in crude oil prices it will benefit the embattled farming sector to the extent of $140m a year. Mr Jacobi-What is your question?",258
75,Mr HUNT,FUEL PRICES,"The question is: Is he also aware that a full flow-on benefit woulo save the average wheat farm about $1,700 per annum and sugar farmers about $1,100 a year? Before taking a decision this week, to be announced on' Friday, will the Prime Minister give an assurance that he will take the farming crisis into account to ensure that the farmers do receive the full benefit of the falling crude oil prices?",258
76,Mr HAWKE,FUEL PRICES,"I appreciate the question and the manner in which it was put by the Deputy Leader of the National Party because I know the reality of the concern for the constituency to which he refers. Firstly, he would be aware that in the last Budget, looking at the diesel fuel aspect of the cost component for farmers, we gave a rebate. r am not in any sense trying to say that that discharges the responsibility we have in the area the honourable gentleman is questioning me about. I am simply saying that it is indicative of the concern that we have about the problems in that area. In the considerations that we will be undertaking later this week the matters that the honourable gentleman refers to will be an important part. I go further than that and say that the Minister for Primary Industry will be bringing submissions to the Cabinet in the relatively near future taking into account the crisis considerations that the honourable gentleman has been referring to in his question. So it will be not only in the considerations this week but also in other considerations before the Cabinet in the near future that the problems of the rural industry in general will be taken into account, and part of those considerations will be the question of fuel costs. NA",258
77,Mr LANGMORE,PHILIPPINES,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and relates to the Philippines election. I ask the Minister: What is the Government's response to the intensifying impasse in the Philippines in which Mrs Aquino claims to have won majority support during the presidential elections but Mr Marcos refuses to concede defeat?,258
78,Mr YOUNG ,PHILIPPINES,It is like Queensland.,258
79,Mr HAYDEN,PHILIPPINES,"At least in Queensland they pretend they have boundaries, first of all. MrMadam Speaker--.!",258
80,Madam SPEAKER,PHILIPPINES,"Madam, yes.",258
81,Mr HAYDEN,PHILIPPINES,"Or is it Speakerperson, to get the non-sexist terminology these days? In answer to the honourable member, it is a little early to make any definitive statement about the position on the part of this Government. The honourable member would have noted that other governments are adopting the same attitude by prac"" tice. The reason is simply that the count of the vote in the Philippines has not been concluded. As honourable members would be aware from newspaper reporting, under the Constitution the count has to be conducted in the National Assembly. Under the Constitution it is supposed to be completed within 15 days unless there are pressing reasons of national importance which justify its being extended. I would sincerely trust that that provision was not invoked because I think it would add to the suspicion and doubt which is manifest concerning this election. The Government feels gravely disturbed at the accounts which have come forward about irregularities and fraud in connection with the conduct of this election. As soon as the vote is concluded and when substantial and substantiable reports on the conduct of the election by observers are available and have been studied, we will be in a position to make a considered statement, and that statement will form the basis of our attitude in the bilateral contact we have with the Philippines thereafter. The things that disturb us are, for instance, a statement issued on 10 February by the joint leader of the international observer team organised by the United States Republican and Democratic parties institutes observing that polling and counting proceeded in some areas without incident. It noted, however, that irregularities and abuses had occurred. It referred, to be specific, to irregularities in polling procedures, such as improperly locked and sealed ballot boxes and election returns, the absence of voters' names on voting precinct roles, especially in Manila, and the ineffective application of measures to prevent multiple voting. The leaders referred also to abuses designed to affect the outcome of the vote, such as vote buying, intimidation, snatching of ballot boxes, tampered election returns and refusal of admission to polling places of observers from the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL. Officials of the independent NAMFREL have cited fraud in 56 of the country's 74 provinces. Senator Lugar, leader of the United States official has expressed concern about a deliberate delay in the pUblication of voting figures which could facilitate manipulation of the vote. At a more immediate and domestic level, an Australian commercial television team from Channel 7 was interrupted at a polling place by a team of what were described as 'armed goons' who took away their television and sound recording equipment. One of these so described 'armed goons' held a gun, a cocked firearm, near the head of the cameraman and fired it, leaving the cameraman in an understandable state of stress and shock for some time after. I under stand these 'goons' sought to tamper with the voting boxes at that ballot centre. We note with concern these reports of serious anomalies and fraud. As I said, we will carefully consider all the facts which become available to us. Having said that, I think it is very important to put this on the record: The serious economic and social problems which afflict the Philippines are not going to be fixed up by an election, whatever its outcome. They will require the application of determined policies to bring about social and economic redistribution as a consequence of a wide-ranging program of reform. In turn, that will require determination on the part of whoever the authorities are to confront entrenched interests in that community, be they cronies or oligarchs, or the strong-armed goons who were described to the House by me a few seconds ago. Unless government is prepared to do that, I am afraid the prognosis for the social and political future of the Philippines is a very depressing one. NA",258
82,Mr NA BROWN,FUEL PRICES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In the light of the Prime Minister's answer to the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, will he in his deliberations on Friday take into account-simply take it into account and consider it-an equally important matter, that is, the wages question facing farmers today? The Prime Minister would know without my telling him that this year there is to be a drop to 18 per cent of the average wage-and only that-in farmers' incomes. In view of the productivity case and the national wage case going on at the moment, will the Prime Minister in his Cabinet deliberations on Friday consider some way by which there can be an exemption, either in whole or in part, from the effect on farmers of one or other of those two imminent economic consequences, and will he let us know the outcome of those observer team, deliberations?",259
83,Mr HAWKE,FUEL PRICES,"On the considerations which were before my Ministers on Thursday and the basis on which they will come to Cabinet on Friday, all those matters which are relevant to fixing the price of crude oil and petrol in this country will be taken into account. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia now goes to issues which are of importance to farmers-the level of wage rates and appropriate wages policies. We as a government will be considering and have considered the position that will be put before the national wage case hearing. That is where our position on wages policy will be put. I do not wish to take up a great deal of time here because I am conscious of the desire for further questions to be asked, but I simply say this to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party: We are prepared to stand on our record in the area of wages policy, because that wages policy has produced the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country since 1969 and has produced record rates of employment growth. If at some point the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party would like to have taken into account the judgments that are made by the business community generally in regard to our wages policies and those he has pedalled before the business community at the Business Council of Australia meeting, I am quite prepared to discuss that. He emerged out of that meeting without a feather to fiy with. The meeting told him that he did not know what he was talking about. It told him that he was foolish. It told him that unless he got his game together he would never have any chance of forming another government in this country. NA",259
84,Mr LINDSAY,DEFENCE FORCE HOUSING,"Is the Minister for Defence aware of newspaper reports quoting the Opposition spokesman on housing and construction, the honourable member for Deakin, condemning the Government's recently announced Defence Force housing scheme and advocating privatisation of Defence Force housing, with the alleged subsequent saving of $120m in a full year? I ask the Minister to inform the House of the impact this example of the Opposition's privatisation policy would have on housing for defence personnel.",259
85,Mr BEAZLEY,DEFENCE FORCE HOUSING,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question and compliment him on the way in which over the last several months he has consistently represented to me the interests of his constituents who have a 'very direct.Â· concern with defence housing. On my visits to Townsville I have made sure that I have had the views of both the defence forces and their families put before me very firmly. Among the views they have put forward to me and to the housing task force we have had in operation, and also the views in that regard of the Returned Services League and the Armed Forces Federation of the Services, there has been a very firm presentation of cogent argument against the course of action suggested by the honourable member in that Press release. There are many very good reasons for that. One is the unique nature of service conditions, the circumstances in which service personnel are obliged to move around the country frequently because they get frequent postings. They find themselves in a position in which, if they are placed in an uncertain rental market, an uncertain environment, very grave inconvenience is caused to their families, on top of the inconveniences they already suffer from those frequent shifts and changes in their children's education experiences and the like - To impose on service personnel the additional burden of finding a house in what will often be an uncertain rental market and certainly a changing rental market from city to city will be a very considerable burden indeed. Furthermore, operational questions are involved in the need to provide adequate housing. Those operational questions are related to a requirement to make absolutely certain that the armed forces are readily available in circumstances in which they may need to be deployed and are also readily available for the purposes of training. This would also be considerably aJfected by any proposition to move over to effectively a free market rental situation for the defence forces. Very considerable damage would be done to morale in the defence forces by pursuing the course of action now suggested by the Opposition. As to the question of the $120m savings that are proposed, I do not know exactly where those savings come from. If they include a saving, as suggested, in the area of Defence Force housesour annual allocation forÂ· defence houses is upwards of $60m-that explains about half of that figure. I can only assume that the other half of that figure denotes an intention on the part of the Opposition not only to throw theÂ· defence forces on to the - rivate market but also an intention to ensure that the defence forces pay something like market rental. The circumstances that would emerge from that would mean a very substantial diminution in service conditions. In the circumstances in which members of the defence forces now find themselves, in which there is a substantial concern among them regarding their conditions, they would be faced with an imposition which I think many of them could not bear. The fact of the matter is that this Government is seriously considering the position of service personnel in many areas of service conditions, which is in marked contrast to the actions of our predecessors. I am not surprised. that the Opposition wants to walk away from the question of an obligation in the public housing sector to the defence forces. After all, at the end of the 1970s the previous Government was spending about $4m a year on Defence Force housing. It managed to get up to about $16m a year. We have taken it to $60m. Under the propositions which we are putting forward now upwards of $700m will be spent over the next decade. That will ensure that members of the defence forces in the first place get the type of housing that they deserve, that they can experience the normal-as normal as possible-housing conditions of the rest of the community and are not treated as second rate citizens and are not at a severe disadvantage. In addition, it is our intention-I state it here quite firmly-that we will not be moving to a situation of effectively imposing full market rental rates on service personnel, as apparently at least is implied in the positions being adopted by the Opposition. Our view is that that is a necessary and a just condition Â·of service. Our concern is to . ensure that service personnel will be effectively placed in the situation in which they are placed at the moment. Of course from time to time there will be reviews of rent. Those reviews will take placeas was set up by the previous Government-on an annual basis in about April of each year. The types of adjustments which they will receive are the types of adjustment to which they have been used to this point. We are not .just mindlessly pursuing that policy. It was part of our decision that where there was a circumstance in which service personnel desired to be able to move into the private market that should be facilitated more. than it had been in the past. It is possible that some savings will result from that. I state quite clearly, because there has been a considerable amount of nervousness in the Services on the future of Defence Force housing, that we in this Government will not adopt the Opposition policy of privatisation in service housing. We will not adopt the policy of moving service personnel to effectively paying full market rental prices. Both those options would seriously damage the operational capabilities of the defence forces and would be a marked injustice on service personnel. NA",260
86,Mr CARLTON,OIL PRICING,"Madam Speaker, may I begin by congratulating you on your election as Speaker. I ask your good friend the Prime Minister a question. I refer to the answer by Senator Button in the Senate today as to the Government's commitment to the income tax cuts announced in September last year. Senator Button said: Of course, in the consideration of the oil price the extent of the income tax cuts will have to be taken into account. Does this mean that the Government's previously firm commitment to cuts in marginal income tax rates in September this year and July next year are now cast into doubt?",261
87,Mr HAWKE,OIL PRICING,No. NA,261
88,Mr DUNCAN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"Did the Attorney-General see the editorial in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald suggesting that the judicial inquiry into the Chamberlain case be handed over by the Northern Territory Government to the Federal Government? What is the Government's attitude to this suggestion? In light of the widespread and justified concern over the Northern Territory Government's capacity to conduct an impartial inquiry, will the Attorney-General offer to make available a Federal judge to conduct the inquiry?",261
89,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"Madam Speaker, at the outset I congratulate you on your elevation to Speaker. In answer to the very important question raised by the honourable member for Makin, yes, I did see the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald. I must say that it was more than fair comment as to the now very widespread concern across Australia as to what might have happened in the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, particularly in respect of this trial. It is well known that a family tragedy has occurred. Also it should be pointed out that in the administration of justice it is expected that there would not be an overzealous zeal to obtain a prosecution if there were not sufficient evidence to warrant it. In fairness to the administration of justice, it is also very important that no unfair emphasis be placed on evidence which might be to the detriment of the accused. As I understand the present situation, and rather surprisingly, the Attorney-General in the Northern Territory has announced, as a result of the finding of what is deemed to be a further piece of evidence, that the accused mother has been released and irrespective of the outcome of the inquiry which he proposes to institute no further action will be taken in respect of her alleged involvement in that tragedy. I think that it is worth commenting now-the Sydney Morning Herald adverted to it-that there appears to be very strong evidence that the forensic tests that were carried out were not in accordance with established procedures and issue, that was known to the prosecution. There is other evidence from forensic experts in Australia that the evidence given was not in accordance with what one would call scientific capacity or understanding of what should have happened in terms of undertaking those tests. That was not adverted to. Further, when the inquiry was instituted, particularly involving the appropriate agents that were to be used in pursuing those tests-they came from Germany-the responsible scientist there was not consulted as to whether the tests carried out would be accepted as being proper evidence to justify what was led by the prosecution in endeavouring to obtain a prosecution. Finally, there seems to be the further evidence that when there was a reassessment of that inquiry by the Solicitor-General in the Northern Territory it was not a fair reassessment because those matters were not brought into consideration. Therefore, we have the position that forensic experts in Australia say that the evidence led was not in accordance with forensic skill or capacity, the further doubt that it was known allegedly to the Northern Territory that the tests carried out were not conducted in accordance with what the German authorities would have regarded as being suitable and, further, when the evidence could have been submitted to the appropriate German scientist concerned it was not submitted to him. The allegation is that there has been an attempt to cover up the actions of the administrators of justice in the Northern Territory-actions in endeavouring to obtain a conviction rather than looking at the fairness of the evidence that should have been presented to the jury. It is a matter of record that there is some comment from one member of the jury that the jury now feels that it might have had at least an opportunity to acquit the accused rather than otherwise. These are not new accusations; they are known to the Government of the Northern Territory. The significant thing that is very important is that the Northern Territory has a responsibility to do something about this matter pursuant to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act passed in 1978. The self-government Act of 1978 appoints the Administrator who is responsibiIe for the maintenance of laws in the Northern Territory and the administration of justice. Also, he has the advice of an Executive Council, which is made up of appropriate Ministers to advise him whether justice has in fact been carried out because there is a respon. sibility there to maintain law and order and particularly the principles of justice. One of the matters of concern is why that has not been acted on before in view of the fact that it was known that there was evidence that obviously ,had not been led. It will obviously come out in the course of an inquiry. I think what the honourable member has said today is mostÂ· appropriate because what the Sydney Morning Herald has said adverts to the concern in Australia that perhaps a trial had taken place and the full facts had not been placed before the jury. There is serious concern whether there was not a personal inwlvement in an endeavour to get a prosecution rather than looking at it in terms of what evidence was available and the appropriate test.",261
90,Mr CADMAN ,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,Get to the point.,262
91,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"I will get to the point on this basis: The article said that it would be appropriate to have a fair, wide-ranging inquiry not only in respect of the evidence that was given and the availability of the evidence itself but also what might have been the actionÂ·s of certain officers in the Northern Territory in pursuing the accused and what action they could have taken.",262
92,Mr SPENDER ,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,Are YOJl not prejudging the issue?,262
93,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"I am not prejudging it because we know now that the Attorney General said that he does not intend to take any further action against the accused irrespective of what comes out of the inquiry. I am trying to make the point that the inquiry has to be wideranging enough not only to look at the evidence or the lack of it but also to look at the actions of the individuals who were involved in producing that evidence. That is the important part. There is an obligation on the Northern Territory to have such an inquiry. I also want to mention a notice of motion that was given to our Party yesterday by the honourable member for Charlton who adverted to all those facts. He has an obligation because, as honourable members know, one of his con-Â· stituents happens to be Mr Chamberlain himself. Naturally we can understand the tragedy to this family. However, let me come to this point in respect of the administration of justice: I think it would be appropriate to have a judicial inquiry. I think it is important that it must be wide-ranging. The terms of reference must be such that they would not be limited only to the evidence introduced into the case. They also must be related to the conduct of the officers concerned. In that respect it would be appropriate for the inquiry to be taken by some judicial officer outside the Northern Territory. In that respect I would say that it would be quite appropriate-in fact I would welcome it-that there be a request from the Northern Territory to make available a Federal judge or some other appropriate person to conduct such an inquiry. I think it would be in accordance with the interests of theMONICA",262
94,Mr NA BROWN ,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,Haven't you enough problems?,262
95,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"We have plenty of problems. However, it must be recognised that from the point of view of the administration of justice this is a major concern. The Territory has an obligation under the Act of independence to administer the laws.",262
96,Mr TUCKEY ,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,You have said that.,262
97,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHAMBERLAIN CASE,"I have said it. The obligation now is to guarantee that the inquiry be far reaching, wide-ranging and impartial. The only way to achieve that would be by having an independent inquiry with somebody appointed from outside the Northern Territory with the capacity to examine all the evidence that is now available. NA",262
98,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the honourable gentleman recall saying to the Sydney radio interviewer, Mike Carlton, on 24 January last, that the right level of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar was of the order of 72c t6 75c? In view of the fact that the Australian dollar has not reached 72c since August 1985, why has the Australian dollar not reached its right level, according to the Prime Minister's definition, over the last six months and when does he expect the right level to be reached?",262
99,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR,"I recall an interview in which I indicated that a number of analysts and observers had thought that that sort of range may be an appropriate level. It is fair enough that those comments should be made. As to what is going to happen to the level of the Australian dollar in the immediate future, I am not going to comment. All I will say is that this Government will continue to administer the economic policy of this country in a way which will continue to give it what those in opposition were never able to do, that is, a rate of economic growth almost double the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. . The OECD predicts an average of about less than 2-1per cent for 1986. The figure for Australia is 4t per cent. We will have a situation in which Australia will be the only country in the OECD which will be reducing its unemployment level. That management of the Australian economy will be continued in a way which will be appropriate. In that context, those things over which we have control will be administered to achieve the results of maintaining steady economic growth at sustainable levels of inflation. There are some elements in regard to the operation of the Australian economy which are outside our control and it would be inappropriate in the light of that fact for me to suggest what the level will be in the near future. NA",263
100,Mr GAYLER,CYCLONE WINIFRED,My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. What action has the Federal Government taken to assist those affected by the widespread damage and human suffering caused by Cyclone Winifred in far north Queensland?,263
101,Mr HAWKE,CYCLONE WINIFRED,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. I am sure that I speak for all members of this House in conveying the sympathy of the Parliament to all those Australians in the region who suffered as a result of the impact of Cyclone Winifred which hit the .north Queensland coastline on I February of this year. The severe damage associated with that cyclone extended from the north of Townsville to Cairns and west to the Atherton Tableland. There was very considerable damage. I will not go into all of it. However, some indication of the ferocity of the cyclone may be gauged from the fact that 213 banana growers have lost all their crops. As honourable members will know, many sugar producers were very hard hit. Of course, the narrow economic base in the atea affected means that unemployment is likely to be more pronounced than it would otherwise be. We in the Government were deeply concerned about the impact of Cyclone Winifred. I asked the Minister for Primary Industry immediately to fly up there, which he did. I am indebted to him. The Minister was able to give me a direct first hand report on the impact of the cyclone. We moved immediately as a government to extend aid under the Commonwealth-State natural disaster relief arrangements. Under those arrangements, Queensland meets the first $1O.48m of expenditure in 1985-86. As I understand it, Queensland has already spent more than that on natural disasters this year. Under the terms of the scheme that means that further payments will be shared equally by the Commonwealth and the Queensland governments for the next $7.86m of assistance and thereafter the Commonwealth will fund the additional expenditure in terms of a ratio of 3 to 1. While talking about payments, we ensured that the Department of Social Security acted quickly so that it would be in a position to handle claims for assistance very expeditiously. Following the report from the Minister for Primary Industry on the damage caused by the cyclone and discussions between Commonwealth and State officials, Cabinet has also agreed on the following additional measures: The possible diversion of employees on existIng community employment program projects to assist with immediate clean up activities in the affected areas and the provision of funding to various local councils through the Commonwealth element of the CEP for a Cyclone Winifred special area rehabilitation program. I am also pleased to say that through the Commonwealth local government development program we have made arrangements for Mr Duncan Beggs, the city engineer from Darwin, to assist the Johnstone and Cardwell shires organise clean-up and reconstruction work. Honourable members would appreciate that his experience in the aftermath of cyclones Tracy, Gretel and ,Max in northern Australia should be of particular value. I say also that the Government has welcomed the establishment of a national appeal for victims of Cyclone Winifred, and donations of over $2 to that appeal are an eligible tax deduction. I think that honourable member will see that the Government expeditiously and with full understanding moved in its various arms of government to do everything that it could to assist. In the very first place, the full relevant services of the defence forces were made available. Following that, in the aftermath of the cyclone, we have taken the steps to which I have adverted. Further consultations will take place between officials of the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government. In the light of those discussions and when the full financial impact of the cyclone can be determined, the arrangements to which I have referred will flow through. TAXATION: NEGATIVE GEARING",263
102,Mr CARLTON,CYCLONE WINIFRED,Is the Treasurer aware that by simply refinancing a rental property acquired before 17 July 1985 that is not negatively geared the taxpayer may offset net income from that property against a loss on a negatively geared property acquired after 17 July 1985 and thus overcome the policy of the negative gearing announcement? Does this mean that the Government's negative gearing proposals will have little effect on wealthy taxpayers with a spread of rental properties while the small investor who buys a rental property as a retirement nest-egg will be severely affected?,264
103,Mr KEATING,CYCLONE WINIFRED,I am sorry that I did not pick up all the threads of the argument. Mr CarIton-I am quite happy to repeat the question.,264
104,Mr KEATING,CYCLONE WINIFRED,"It would be more appropriate to put the question on notice. If the point is that the refinancing of an existing mortgage means that in some way it would become a new financial obligation, that is not the case. If an existing mortgage is refinanced, it would stand as part of the debt. For instance, some peoplemay enter into a negatively geared situation and have a three-year bill or bank bills which expire every 180 days, if they are rolled over. Mr CarIton-That is not the point.",264
105,Mr KEATING,CYCLONE WINIFRED,Would the honourable member repeat the question?,264
106,Madam SPEAKER,CYCLONE WINIFRED,"As the honourable member for Mackellar has the question written out, I suggest that he pass it across to the Treasurer. Mr CarIton-1 think that honourable members opposite might also like to hear it.",264
107,Madam SPEAKER,CYCLONE WINIFRED,Go ahead.,264
108,Mr CARLTON,CYCLONE WINIFRED,ls the Treasurer aware that by simply refinancing a rental property acquired before 17 July 1985 that is not negatively geared but acquired before that cut-off date a taxpayer may offset net income from that property against a loss on a negatively geared property acquired after 17 July 1985 and thus overcome the policy of the negative gearing announcement?,264
109,Mr KEATING,CYCLONE WINIFRED,"I will just have to look at the implications of this question. I cannot give an answer off the top of my head, but I am happy to have a look at it. AUSTRALIA CARD: SUBMISSION BY NA",264
110,Dr KLUGMAN,MR CQSTIGAN,"Has the Minister for Health noted the submission by Mr Frank Costigan to the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card? In view of Mr Costigan's previous behaviour in relation to illegal phone taps and the smearing of individuals, is this a spectacular conversion, or should he be nominated for the position of hypocrite of the year?",264
111,Dr BLEWETT,MR CQSTIGAN,"In replying to the question from the honourable member for Prospect, I must say that I have read some of the statements by Mr Costigan. Mr Costigan also appeared before the Caucus committee dealing with the Australia Card. So I have heard many of his views before. I have considerable puzzlement with regard to the position taken by Mr Costigan, be- / cause, in fact, his report to government and his stressing the need for identification of bank accounts and the ability to trace the money trail were a major factor in propelling the Government towards the solution of a whole range of these problems that has been adopted by proposing the introduction of the Australia Card. When Mr Costigan, under questioning by the Caucus committee, suggested some of the proposals that he has now made public, he was finally put in a position of agreeing that if one were to have a tax file number of a sufficient integrity it would have to be supported very much in the way we intend to support the Australia Card. I must say that Mr Costigan's contributions to this whole debate have been somewhat puzzling. NA NA",264

In his article he made a number of very important errors which I would like to clarify for the record. For example, he claimed that the delegation edged Australia into a new involvement in the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border problems. I emphasise that at no stage did the delegation, any member of it, or I as leader, express such a view. We did not, as was alleged, at any time speak of a direct involvement for Australia in the Papua New Guinea-West Irian border issue. In fact, we emphasised that the matter was entirely a bilateral issue between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and that Australia had no direct interest other than an understandable desire to see stability in the region which includes our own common sea border. In another part of the article he referred to a meeting which the delegation had with a number of people who had been sent back by Papua New Guinea across the border into Irian Jaya. He referred in the article to 'a private meeting requested by the MPs with the prisoners'. The fact of the matter is that at a dinner on the previous night I had inquired of the Governor of Irian Jaya whether he was holding persons in his gaols who were previously border crossers. He affirmed that they were and then said 'Would you like to see them? We have no secrets', or words to that effect. On the basis of that, of course, we accepted and on the following day a visit to the gaol was arranged. To suggest that we actually initiated a request to visit the gaol is completely false and only adds substance to his allegation made earlier that we were in fact forcing Australia into a closer relationship or closer involvement than had previously been the case.",267
150,Madam SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member must realise that when he makes a personal explanation it is on his own behalf and not on behalf of a group.,267
151,Mr CONNOLLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Furthermore, I am reported as follows: Mr Connolly had been publicly pushing the message that Australia had an important and direct stake in the exodus of Irianese across the border into PNG and into Australian territory on Thursday Island. As I stated earlier, the message I was putting over quite clearly was that, where there is a common border between Irian Jaya and Australia, of course we have a direct interest and a stake. Equally, we have an interest in the overall stability of the region. At no stage did I say that we were involved in any way with the Papua New Guinea-West Irian border. NA",267

They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historiCal origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3.

Overseas Students To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: (i) We regret that the $4,595 tax Free threshold for overseas students was recently abolished by the Government.

Part-time working opportunity has served to alleviate increasing financial problems in the past, and we hope that this will continue to be so. Therefore, we the undersigned citizens of Australia and overseas students call upon the Government to; (i) Reinstate the tax-free threshold for overseas students. (ii) To reform the Overseas Student Program by taking measures such as abolishing the discriminatory fees, stamp out racism and streamlining the program's administration.

A. Brown. Petition received. Small Businesses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: Introduction of any additional capital gains taxes, wealth taxes or death duties is opposed on the grounds that: they adversely affect the small and medium size businesses in Australia, destroying incentive and discouraging investment in this important area of the economy; the Australian economy, and employment in particular, is heavily reliant on growth in small businesses; any capital gains that might result when owners of small businesses finally fall gains' but the result of many hard years of work and sacrifice, with very little being taken out of the business by way of salaries so that the maximum amount of money can be ploughed back into the business to create growth and jobs; the owners of small businesses often depend on a capital gain-which are simply deferred salarieswhen they eventually sell their business to sustain them in retirement; Your Petitioners request that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, will protect the rights of private enterprise and reject any inequitable additional taxes.

Any such proposal to require compulsory unionisation of Architects discriminates against and inhibits progress within the profession and the building industry and curtails employment throughout the Nation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled reject proposals For compulsory unionisation within the architectural profession and support the profession and the building industry in its independence and standing for the promotion of independent and high standards within the profession and the building industry.

We request that these courses be restored to their 1985 level, as they provide a valuable personal component for those people with increased leisure time; the' unemployed, the employed and in particular, the pensioner groups.

It is essential that this situation be rectified, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Howard. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia showeth that: Your petitioners pray that Your Honourable House will reject the proposed Australian Bill of Rights Bill 1985 for the following reasons: I. We believe as a matter of faith and judgment that the proposed legislation is anti-God and its implemention will result in attacks on the Christian church and the promotion of a State religion based on secular humanism; 2. That there is no need for legislation of this kind since the principles of freedom are already enshrined in Common Law and that it will cause more problems than it seeks to solve. 3. That there is a potential threat to our national security through making treaties of this kind with foreign nations, many of which do not share a common heritage and do not practice many of the principles that they have covenanted to uphold; 4. The methods being used to introduce this legislation are secretive and a blatant misuse of the external affairs powers under Section 51 of the Australian Constitution and that further more are contrary to the spirit of the Constitution; 5. That the implementation of the legislation through a process of new educational initiatives will result in the centralised control of education and this will inevitably lead to the destruction of States' rights. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Dr Blewett, Mr Duncan, Mr Hall, Mr Jacobi, Mr O'Neil, Mr Wilson and Mr Young. Petitions received.

Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",282
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUEL PRICES,"Madam Speaker has received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The damage that will be done to the living standards and security of Australians and their families if the Hawke Government refuses to pass on to all Australians the full benefit of the fall in world fuel prices. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",282
157,Mr HOWARD ,FUEL PRICES,"Bennelong-Leader of the Opposition) (5.54)-This Government and this Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) have broken many promises made to Australians and to Australian families. They broke that well remembered promise not to introduce a capital gains tax; they broke that well remembered promise that interest rates were going to fall in 1985 and they have broken many other promises. The Prime Minister, by his posturing, his dodging and his equivocation, made it very clear today that he is on the brink of breaking yet another promise. Let me read from a statement made only a couple of years ago. It reads as follows: Government policy ties Australian petrol prices to the price of crude oil from Saudi Arabia. Any fall in the Saudi price must be passed on to Australian motorists in lower petrol prices. That was not my statement, it was not a statement made by the Opposition spokesman on resources and energy, it was not made by the Leader of the Australian consumer group; it was none other than a statement made by Paul Keating as the Opposition spokesman on minerals and energy. One could go back through the Hansard and through the political history books and there are enough promises from the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister in their present and earlier capacities to cover every wall of the Lodge and Kirribilli House to boot on the subject of petrol prices. If ever a group of people was jammed on petrol prices, it is the Hawke Government because everywhere it went in opposition and everywhere it has been in government it has said that if the world price goes down the Australian consumer ought to get the benefit. Yet now, faced with the opportunity of passing on the benefit of a fall in the world price of oil to Australian consumers-the farmer, the small businessman and the Australian motorist-of giving Australian consumers the benefit of a 7c reduction, what is the Prime Minister going to do? He is going to cheat the Australian public of the benefit of the fall in the world price of oil; he is going to tear up all of the promises he has made and he is going to go running around the country Uriah Heap-like and he is going to say: 'Oh, we can't really afford to do it. That promise we made you was all a ghastly mistake'. It is like the prediction he made a couple of weeks ago on Mike Carlton's radio program about the level of the Australian dollar. Apparently now, on II February, Prime Ministers do not make predictions about the Australian dollar, but on 24 January, less than a month ago, it was all right for him to say that the real value of the Australian dollar was about 72c to 75c. The problem is that when he made that statement it was not at 72c; immediately he made that statement confidence ebbed in the dollar, interest rates started edging up again and the Treasurer came storming back from his holidays and said: 'For heaven's sake, will you shut up and stop making predictions about the future level of the Australian dollar because you will make a fool of yourself and you will have a very damaging effect on financial markets'. So now, very contrite, the Prime Minister says: 'Oh, that promise was a mistake; that prediction was a mistake'. Over the next couple of weeks he is going to try to persuade the Australian public that all of the promises he made about petrol prices were a ghastly mistake. On 9 February 1983 during the 1983 election campaign He stated: Petrol prices will be immediately cut by about 3c per litre under a Federal Labor Government. That was a promise made by the then Leader of the Opposition. We heard nothing more about that. Mr Keating, the present Treasurer, the then spokesman on minerals and energy in 1979, then talked about the great petrol rip-off and how it had to be ended. We all remember his phrase about the establishment of a branch of the Taxation Office at every petrol bowser. Not only has he gladly embraced all of those branches, but he has gone forth and multiplied those branches. Having been given the opportunity to do something about them, what does he do? He runs like a dog from the promises that he, the Prime Minister and other Ministers made that, if the world price goes down, our price ought to go down. It is a very simple proposition that is going to be understood by the Australian public. It is going to be understood by every farmer, every small businessman and every motorist that if it is good enough for this mob to rip it off them when the price goes up, it is only fair that they get the benefit of any fall in the world price. I say to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister that if they think they can talk the Australian public out of the logic of that, if they think they can sell the Australian public a bill of goods about it all being too difficult and about the revenue impact, they are not really going to get toÂ· first base. Which government used his money to underwrite the present levels of expenditure that we now have?",283
158,Mr KEATING ,FUEL PRICES,You did. You spent the lot.,283
159,Mr HOWARD,FUEL PRICES,"It was not the former Government, it is the present Government. It has been in power now for three years. Mr Keating has been Treasurer of this country for three years and if it is good enough for him to claim credit for any good things about the economy at present, heÂ· has got to cop the blame for the problems that he has. He gets absolutely no credit for going out fQ the Australian community with some cock and bull story about it all being some kind of inherited problem. If the Treasurer had been smart and understood what was going to happen to world oil markets, he would not have jacked up expenditure so that now, in order to give the full benefit of the fall in the price of oil, he has a huge budgetary problem. If the Treasurer has a budgetary problem, it is his fault and, nobody else's. He should not go crying to the A-stralian public, saying: 'Please let us off this promise, please don't exact any political price out of our hide because we have a budgetary problem. We ask you to overlook the fact that we created the budgetary problem; we ask you to overlook the fact that we let expenditure rip; we ask you to overlook the fact that we promised things that we should not have promised, because we were trying to get elected'. That deceitful promise in December 1984 that interest rates would fall in 1985 is a promise that every home owner, farmer and small businessman literally spit out when they think of the interest rates they have to pay at the present time. There were other quite deceitful promises, so the Treasurer should not imagine that he can wriggle out of the commitment that he made on oil prices, because if ever anybody in this country has been identified with a commitment about reflecting falls in the world price of oil in domestic oil prices, it is the present Treasurer. He had more to say about that than anybody else and he is the person who will be held more accountable and punished more politically by the inevitable decision of the Government. The dogs are already barking, depending on who one talks to and what the version is. One version is that the Government will let the fall flow through to the domestic price,then put on an excise and say: 'We let it flow through fully, but we will put on an excise'. I wonder, if that version happens, what the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations ( Mr Willis) will have to say about it. On 14 December 1979, as shadow Treasurer, this is what he had to say about that particular version of what the Government might do: Petrol taxes are highly regressive, so this increase in petrol prices will be totally inequitable with the greatest burden Falling on lower income earners. That is what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations had to say about it. What will the Treasurer do about the impact ,on Australia's inflation rate of the failure to pass on the full fall in the world oil price? Does the world's greatest Treasurer not understand that our inflation rate is now double that of our major trading partners and treble the inflation rate of Japan? Does he not understand that this country now has' the highest real ihterest rates in the Western world and our competitiveness has already been destroyed by the fact that we have the highest interest rates in the industrialised world and the worse level of interest rates since the late 1920s? What will he do about that situation'! On top of that predicament, on top of our uncompetitiveness and on top of the lack of international confidence in our dollar, he will burden Australian producers with further uncompetitive impusts. If we do not get the benefit of the fall in the world price of oil and producers in other parts of the world get the benefit of that fall, our competitive position will be made even worse. What makes Australian farmers bitter at the present time is the fact that they are carrying burdens that no other farmers around the world are required to carry. If this fall in the world price of oil if not passed on to Australian farmers, and they are singled out for this kind of discriminatory treatment and kicked in the teeth again as they were with the Keating tax package, their already parlous position will be made even worse. It would be bad enough if this alone were the only thing being done to Australian primary producers, but it is not the only thing being done. At the moment, when they face their worse crisis for generations and the Prime Minister prattles and rabbits on about how he will try to do something about it, the Treasurer, who is now sitting at the table for the Government, is to bring in two taxation burdens that will do great damage to the Australian rural industrya capital gains tax and his lunatic proposal on off-farm income. That particular proposal, which has been attacked and branded as lunatic by the Opposition from the moment it was announced by the Treasurer, has already had catastrophic effects on the value of rural properties. On top of that, what is the Government proposing to do? The Government is proposing to cheat the Australian farmer and the Australian consumer, and become the petrol cheat of 1986. The Government will cheat the entire Australian public of the full benefit of the fall in world price of oil. It will cry poor mouth and it will say: 'We did not know that it was going to happen. You ought to understand'. No doubt the Government will say: 'You should be sympathetic to the Government's predicament. You ought to understand the problem we have. We made a few promises too many; we wanted to get elected'. It wanted the Australian public to believe those promises and they did believe those promises. They believed that the Prime Minister would cut the price of fuel by 3c a litre. Many of them believed the Prime Minister when he said that the had planted the seed and he was going to reap the harvest of lower interest rates in 1985. Many of them believed the Prime Minister when he said: 'I want to make it perfectly clear, in language that everybody will understand, that there will be no new capital gains tax'. So this Government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister cannot duck the political odium that is theirs because of their breach of so many electoral promises. The Australian public has endured high fuel prices because the world price has been high and it has made sense that we price our fuel at the world level. Now that the world price is coming down, the Australian public demands the full benefit of the fall in that price. No amount of backing and filling or inventing of excuses by the world's greatest Treasurer will allow him to escape that political 1 regard the promises that have been made by the Treasurer and the Government on this particular issue as the most iron clad, the most oftrepeated and the ones that will come home to haunt them over the weeks and months ahead. The failure to pass on the fall in the world price of oil and the failure to give to the Australian motorist and farmer the full benefit of it is an act that will damage the living standards and security of individual Australians and families. When one looks across the whole gamut of policies being followed by this Government, one finds again the again actions taken by the Government that are damaging the living standards of average Australians and their families. We find it with interest rates, taxation and petrol prices and in relation to the small business community and the farming community with the productivity deal. How on earth in all justice can the Government ask farmers, who will suffer a drop in their real incomes over the next couple of years, to cop a 3 per cent productivity claim? How on earth can the Government say to somebody who has an income of less than $5,000 a year: 'You can pay 3 per cent out of your hide for a so-called productivity rise. '? That is the kind of injustice that the deal made by the Treasurer with the trade union movement of Australia has inflicted upon battling farmers and battling small businessmen. He will pay a great political price for it.",284

Mr Rocher- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Standing Orders clearly state that when referring to another person in this House an honourable member shall use that person's title. That clearly was not the language used by the Treasurer. I ask you to request him odium. to observe Standing Orders.",285
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,FUEL PRICES,Mr Leo MCLeay)-If the honourable member for Curtin feels aggrieved 1 will ask the Treasurer to refer to the Leader of the Opposition as the Leader of the Opposition. 1 also point out that 1 therefore expect the Leader of the Opposition to refer to the Treasurer by his title rather than as 'this man'.,285
163,Mr KEATING,FUEL PRICES,"The Leader of the Opposition-his oiliness-had the distinction, in the five years that he was Treasurer, of lifting the oil revenue of the Commonwealth by 700 per cent. He took the tax on oil from the people of this country from $346m when he became Treasurer to $3,400m when he was defeated. This is the man who has the temerity, without any shame at all, to stand up and talk about the living standards of Australians. He even has the temerity to talk about the labour costs of farmers when his Government wrapped a $39 a week increase around their necks with the metal trades decision in 1982, in the middle of the drought. He should not lecture us about the effect of wage increases on farmers. The fact is that when he became Treasurer in 1977 crude oil receipts were 1.4 per cent of Commonwealth receipts. When he left they were 9 per cent, or a 700 per cent increase. When the then Opposition talked about the dramatic lift in oil prices, the dramatic, brutal result on our inflation rate and our competitiveness, it was ignored by the former Treasurer. He knew that every time he took the easy resort to lazy oil money it went straight into the inflation rate, straight into wages, and destroyed our inflation rate and our competitiveness. Is it any wonder Australian manufacturing industry folded? Is it any wonder we were curtailed on world commodity markets as our competitiveness fell? Having taken the money and spent the lot, having addicted the Commonwealth Budget to oil revenue, the Leader of the Opposition now wants this Government simply to tear all of that expenditure out of the cloth of the Commonwealth's outlays. John Howard, Treasurer and oil money spender, now demands of this Government that overnight, without even giving the Government the courtesy of time to consider the issues, it tear out those outlays. When asked the question about where he would cut Commonwealth outlays he had this shockingly unprincipled answer: Well, that is a matter for the Government in detail to come up with and I don't intend now or in the immediate future to be detailing the alternative expenditure plans . . . In other words, he is saying: 'It was all right for me, John Howard, to spend the money, to spend the ill gotten gains of the crude oil levy, but do not ask me where to cut the receipts. I spent it on my priorities but I will provide no priorities to you on where I would save it.' That is the Leader of the Opposition's proposition. That is the unprincipled, hypocritical proposition from the Leader of the Opposition. 'I spent the $3 billion on my priorities, but I will not say where I would unspend it. That is a problem for this Government.' Do honourable members really think we are going to say: 'Oh God, John Howard said that. We are mortally wounded'? The fact is that the deficit reductions in the Opposition's time never came out of the three or four months onerous expenditure cutting exercise that this Government has been involved in. The previous Government brought down deficits simply by throwingÂ· the oil money at them. It sat on its backside and chucked the oil money at the deficits and they fell. The other thing it did was to cheat on the outlays by moving Australia Post and Telecom out of the Budget so that it could fudge its outlay figures. It never did any decent outlay savings in its life. It left us with a Budget deficit which no one ever expected we would need to deal with, at a time when the oil revenue had stopped growing. It was able to reduce Budget deficits with this massive growth in oil revenue. When the oil revenue stopped growing it gave us first of all a negative moment in oil revenues and then the biggest fiscal deficit of any in the Commonwealth's history. That is what this Government inherited, yet the Opposition has the hide to talk about oil revenue. We will make up our minds about oil revenue, as the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said, when we consider all the issues appropriately in the Cabinet context. What really makes me sick is the tone of this proposition that damage will be done to Australian living standards. The hypocrisy of that, coming from the man who put 300,000 families into poverty through unemployment-they have a decent old living standard on the dole!-and from the person who says that he has opposed all wage indexations since March 1983. He talks about the damage that will be done to living standards and the security of Australians and their families by not passing back 7c litre, or whatever it is, for petrol, but it is okay to say: 'Do not pay them any wage increases, refuse them wage indexation, never give anybody an even break, take the money from them, let inflation rip their pay packets apart, do not pay them indexation. We, the Opposition, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, oppose all those increases. ' Let me say this: Indexation since March 1983 is worth $54 a week to the Australians those opposite supposedly worry about, to those families' living standards. It is $54 a week they would not have if those opposite had had their way in opposing wage indexation. They cry crocodile tears about 7c a litre, or $3.50 a week I think, was the figure mentioned in Question Time, in the Opposition's own shonky fashion. That is after it said it would oppose the tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong said: 'If it came to a choice between lower receipts and tax cuts and a lower Budget deficit, there should be a lower Budget deficit. We should not give the tax cuts.' So the $7.60 we gave to everyone in the work force in 1984 would have been opposed too. The Opposition is saying: 'We oppose the tax cuts; we oppose wage indexation'. Taking the $54 a week for wage indexation and $7.60 for tax cuts, wage earners are $60 a week better off. The Opposition says: 'We oppose all those, but we have a puny motion about living standards-a piece of hypocrisy about living standards-and about oil tax of 7c a litre'. Opposition members are a' joke. Do they think there will be any moral support for their proposition while they hold those positions? Nobody will take any notice. The Opposition opposes Medicare. The poorest of people, families, who could not even insure themselves against sickness, and there were lots of them who could not afford to pay $30 and $40 a week to insure themselves against sickness, are now protected. The Opposition opposes that. It ogposes wage indexation, tax cuts, Medicare. As if the Liberal Party ever did care about ordinary Australians! It never did care. All it ever thought about was looking after its own skin and the people it represented. The Deputy Leader of the National Party talked about the bush. I will tell him about the bush and his overvalued exchange rate. He was a member of a government which kept the exchange rate overvalued because it had no wages policy, no anti-inflation policy. We have given Australian farmers $1,500m this year in Australian dollar receipts on their agricultural proceeds, and they would not have got that without the floating dollar and without the onerous burden that float has put on this Government. Despite the fall in world commodity prices there is $1,500m more in the pockets of Australian farmers than they would otherwise have received. What about the 1982-83 drought? What about 1981-82? Honourable members opposite robbed Australian farmers of $3 billion in two years by keeping the exchange rate overvalued. They robbed Australian farmers of $1 ,500m a year by keeping their rotten exchange rate policy. Why did they keep that? They kept it because they never had the guts to stand up to Malcolm Fraser and they never told him to get a wages policy. Honourable members opposite should not lecture us about farmers. We have done two things. Not only are farmers $1,500m better off than they otherwise would have been;Jas well as that we have reduced their costs by $500m a yearI stress a year-by giving them a wage and cost and inflation structure that is less than half the one honourable members opposite had. We have wage movements of around 6 per cent. In 198283 they had wage movements of 14 per cent after giving the metal trades $39 a week in the middle of a drought. So honourable members opposite in the National Party should not talk about farmers. They have bludged on farmers all their lives. They have told farmers they represent them while they have come down here and added protection by way of tariffs for manufacturing industry. They supported an overvalued exchange rate which ripped farmers' incomes, to pieces. That is what they did. They supported a rotten, corrupt inflation policy which gave farmers a 14 per cent wage structure while they were battling like hell on their farms to make a go of it. So honourable members opposite should not tell us about farmers. In every respect, when we look at the living standards of Australiansbe it in wages, be it in after-tax income, be it in lower inflation that is not ripping at and raping pay packets and savings-people are much better off, immeasurably better off, under this Government. The Opposition has brought in this proposition, worrying about fuel prices, when the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) is the member of this Parliament who lifted oil taxes by 700 per cent and spent the lot-on Burdekin dams, on airports, on all sorts of pork barrelling around the countryside. He did everything but give tax cuts. He used the money for everything but tax relief. He took the money with a smug look on his face. He rammed the costs right into the Australian wage and price structure, right into the Australian inflation rate-he took Australia's inflation rate back to II t per cent-and now he is in here today talking about what the Opposition said at the time. Of course we said that he should not have grabbed the money at the pace he did. He took the rate from $2 to $30 a barrel in 18 months. He thought: 'Let's sock the mugs. They'll never know. They'll just have to cop it'. In 1983 they would not cop it any more. They got rid of the previous Government, and they will stay rid of it. ( As far as this Government is concerned, as the Prime Minister said, we will look at all the issues in respect of oil pricing. We realise what is happening in the world oil price markets. But I just make this point: This Government has been responsible for carrying the onerous burden of this enormous problem of fiscal policy while at the same time providing tax relief of the only genuine kind in living memory. To have the Opposition talking in this Parliament about living standards while it would say to the work force it should have no wage indexation, while it would not have paid the 3.8 per cent last November, while it would not have agreed'to the $7.60 tax cut in 1984 really is nothing but a cruel hoax and a joke. It is really deluding itself if it thinks that anybody out there is fooled by this. The greatest joke of all is today's report in the Australian Financial Review of the Leader of the Opposition saying he will not detail the expenditure cuts. He spent the money; now he wants this Government to unspend it, but he will not say where. He has got no gl!ts. He will not do the right thing. We reject this proposition absolutely for the humbug which it is.",285
164,Mr CARLTON ,FUEL PRICES,"Mackellar) (6.24)- Mr Deputy Speaker, you would hardly know it from the ranting and raving in the response of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), but all we are asking is thatÂ· this Government meet its stated commitments. It has made commitments to give tax cuts in 1986 and 1987. It has made a commitment to move petrol prices up and down with world prices. We ask it to meet that commitment. It will not have met that commitment unless in March there is a 7c a litre drop in the price of petrol. It is perfectly simple, 7c a litre at the pump in March or this Government will not have met its public commitments. In addition, if it does not do that it will not have acted sensibly on economic policy. Indeed, if we go to the stated economic policy of the Governmentwhich is, under the accord, wage indexation, a reduction in inflation-not only is it essential in fairness to the Australian community to pass on the 7c a litre at the pump; it is also essential to use that to reduce inflation at a time when our inflation rate is double that of our trading partners and rising. There are two things we are asking and they are perfectly simple: For the Government to meet its stated commitments on tax and to meet its stated commitment on petrol prices. By doing those two things at the very same time the Government will be assisting its own economic policies. All I can say is that I am astonished. I must say also that the cat is clearly out of the bag because the Treasurer and the Government obviously have decided to steal at least some and possibly all of that 7c. There is no explanation for IS minutes of ranting and raving about total nonsense other than that the Government has already decided to grat> the 7c from the consumer. It has done that already. We have seen this sort of thing before. Before the 1983 election the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said unequivocally: 'There will be no capital gains tax'. Before the 1984 election, when the Prime Minister was asked about tax, he would not answer. We have recently had two State elections and we have had by-elections in two States. During those election campaigns we put it fairly and squarely' to the Prime Minister: 'What is your intention on petrol tax? Are you going to bring down petrol prices in accordance with the fall in world prices?'. He dodged the question. It was a repeat .of the pattern we had seen in the 1984 election campaign. Of course, immediately after the 1984 election it became absolutely clear that the Prime Minister had no intention of meeting his commitment on capital gains tax. Certainly in this area it was obvious from the way he dodged the questions in the by-elections and State campaigns that the Government had already made up its mind to renege on its promises on oil prices. There is no excuse for this. The world's greatest Treasurer would have known without doubt in September when he made his tax cut promises, as everybody knew, that oil prices around the world were going to fall in 1986. The Government knew that. In fact, Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister who passes for the Minister for Resources and Energy in this Government, in April last year had to explain what for him was an embarrassing increase in the price of petrol when the value of the dollar changed. The dollar dropped and prices went up. The dollar dropped 25 per cent over a year and, of course, prices went up. Senator Evans was asked on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation PM program in April last year: . . . but if and when the value of the dollar improves, will you drop the pump price of petrol in Australia? He answered: Yes, we will. That is the bright side of the equation.",288
165,Mr HUNT ,FUEL PRICES,Who said that?,288
166,Mr CARLTON,FUEL PRICES,"This is Senator Evans speaking last year. He continued: Sooner or later the dollar is going to float back to more realistic levels. Although we were overvalued on the world market, I don't think anybody seriously thinks that the present level of the dollar is an accurate reflection of our economic strength. That was quite interesting in April anyway, because the dollar took another dive after he said this: It will float back in due courseThis is a Minister floating all over the place. He continued: and when that happens, obviously consumers will get the benefit of that in terms of reduced prices at the pump and the Government will lose the additional revenue that flows from yesterday's decision. That is what Senator Evans said in April last year. It was well known what the Government's commitment on pump prices was, right at the time the Cabinet was leading up to the September statement, right through the ridiculous Tax Summit, right up to the September promise to give us tax cuts in 1986 and 1987. If the Treasurer, who has now scuttled off into his hole and will not listen to what is being said-he is probably listening on the blower in his office-did not know, when he was making Cabinet submissions on tax policy in September of last year, that there was going to be a fall in oil prices had not talked to anybody. If he did not know that, very clearly he is not only not the world's greatest Treasurer but also the world's most hopeless Treasurer. Everybody knew that petrol prices around the world would fall this year. They had to be factored into the Government's equations. Of course, when the predicted falls started to occur and the Prime Minister was asked 'Will you do what Senator Evans said; will you do what's in your policy; will you give us the 7c a litre at the pump reduction which we deserve, which we need to be internationally competitive and which the farmers desperately need?' he said: 'We might have some revenue problems. It might cost us $1.7 billion extra'. the Government did not know that when it was doing its tax package the whole tax package was a fraud. The whole damned set of promises that it put out was a fraudulent set of promises. The Government must have known then. Presumably, it had no intention of either meeting the promises or of reducing petrol prices at the pump. It cannot Rave it both ways. Either way, its statement of 19 September last year was fraudulent. Why is this a desperately serious matter, quite apart from the cheating of the consumer and the breaking of promises? It is an extraordinarily sensitive issue because we are at a stage where we are uncompetitive on world markets. We have not done sufficient things to take advantage of the devaluation. Our inflation rate is rising again. It is 8.2 per cent, and rising, and that twice the average rate of our trading partners. Our interest rates are 20 per cent. Under the accord, all those traded areas of the economy which have to compete internationally will have wage rises of about \0 per cent this year. There will be the discounted wage rise of 2.2 per cent in April and an increase of 3 per cent if the Australian Council of Trade Unions deal on productivity goes through in July. That will impact in full on traded parts of the economythe ones that have to compete internationally. They will get all of that in July. Other parts might not but they will. Because of rising inflation and full indexation there will be a further 5 per cent increase in October. That adds up to a wage increase of 10 per cent over the course of this year. Heaven forbid! If Australia is in a position in which it has rising inflation, if it looks forward to a 10 per cent wage increase in the traded areas of the economy and if it has an indexation policy which will pass those through, prices will go up. They he will go further into wages. We are at the very point where it is essential to bring about a one time reduction in inflation in order to break this cycle. The Government can do this by meeting its own commitments and promises. It does not have to go beyond those. If any belt tightening is needed at the time of the Budget surely that was foreseen when the Government made its tax statement in September. If it was not foreseen, if it was not factored in, the Treasurer acted fraudulently in putting forward the September statement. He would have to have done so if it was not factored in. We are asking for a 7c a litre reduction at the pump in March to bring the price down in line If with falls in oil prices. We are asking for the full tax cuts that were promised. We are asking for everything that was promised on 19 September together with the promise to reduce the price of petrol. The Government must have known all the factors that were going into 1986 at the time it made its promises. I ask everybody to watch the pumps in early March. If the price of petrol is not down by 7c a litre at every pump this Government stands condemned.",288
167,Mrs KELLY ,FUEL PRICES,"Canberra) (6.35)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your election to your high office. I am sure that you will do the job in the fine style that you did your job as the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. The ability of honourable members opposite to do an about face on any issue never ceases to amaze me. In is the debate on this issue we have seen the ultimate in hypocrisy. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard), who was responsible for the greatest recession since the 1930s, seeks to lecture us about the damage to living standards and the security of Australians and their families. What a farce. It was, as the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) reminded us, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) who increased the Commonwealth's oil revenue by 700 per cent in 1977. Mr Braithwaite-What happened in the last 12 months?",289
168,Mrs KELLY,FUEL PRICES,"Members of the Opposition do not want to listen to any of the facts. The facts are that in 1977-78 Commonwealth oil revenue Fuel Prices was $476m, but by 1982-83 it was $3,486m. So the level of hypocrisy which we have witnessed here today is astounding. Who was responsible for the erosion of the living standards of ordinary Australians? It was the members of the Opposition, led by the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Treasurer. Who pushed inflation into double figures and what impact did that have on the Australian family? Who milked Australians and their families for this $3,486m yet still allowed the deficit to blow out to over $9 billion? Who at the same time also managed the enormous feat to put 10 per cent of Australians on the dole? What did the coalition do with this massive amount of money in the taxation coffers? Did the coalition hand it back to the Australian family? No. Did the coalition give it to people in increased welfare payments? No. The coalition frittered it away on every pork-barrelling exercise it could think of in its desperate effort to try to stay in government. It had an attitude of 'spend now and pay later'. That was the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. That was the attitude of the coalition Government. That was the attitude that brought the Australian economy to its knees. Here today we see this attitude repeated. The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton) are not prepared to outline their offsetting expenditure cuts. All they are interested in doing is grandstanding. They want their cake and they want to eat it too. That is what they see as the role of the Opposition. That is why they will continue in opposition. Until they start to outline - hat their options are the Australian people will not see the Opposition as an alternative government. It is all very well to stand up in this House and call for all the goodies. I used to do it when I was in opposition too. One gets up and calls for all the goodies but one never outlines what it will cost and what other cuts have to be made. One cannot have one's cake and eat it too. One cannot call for all the goodies and never suffer any of the costs involved. The honourable member for Bennelong was irresponsible when he was the Treasurer and he is irresponsible now. He is running away from the hard decisions. Members of the Opposition are economic cinderellas. They live in fairyland. What we are seeing today is the Opposition crying crocodile tears for Australian families. It opposed tax cuts last year, it opposes tax cuts this year and it will oppose tax cuts next year. It does not want tax cuts for the Australian family. The Opposition opposed full wage indexII February 1986 REPRESENTATIVES 277 ation .. Although it advocates real wage cuts for Australian wage and salary earners, cries about the standards of the Australian family. It also opposes the universal health care system and a universal superannuation cover. The Opposition does not care about the living standards of the Australian family. In fact, the reality is that the Opposition when in government set family living standards nosediving. It is the Hawke Labor Government that has arrested this free fall. It is the Hawke Labor Government that is beginning to lift the standards of the Australian family. What does the Opposition do? It just barks"" barks and barks and presents no alternative policy. The Government is considering a range of options following the fall in world prices. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have already said that this matter is under consideration by the Cabinet. Of course, it is a complex issue and a number of points have to be considered. One is that the world oil market is very fluid at present and it is important that the Government makes the correct decision for the long term benefit of all Australians, and that is what is critical. The current reduction in prices could well be temporary as it is clear that the strategy of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to force non-OPEC producers to cut their production in the interest of maintenance of profitable prices. To follow world prices blindly in these circumstances could adversely affect Australia's conservation dnd exploration effort. If we compare the Australian level of petroleum excise with that of other industrialised nations we will find that, with the exception of North America, Australia has the lowest petrol excise of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members. The excise in Australia is lOc a litre compared with an average of 30c to 40c a litre in Western Europe rising to 80c to 90c a litre in Italy and France. They are the facts that the Opposition just wants to ignore. It is the Hawke Labor Government that has a record of assisting the standards of the Australian family. We saw a decline in family living standards during the time when the previous Government was in power. It is useless for the Opposition to stand up here and present hypothetical assertions about what should be done when the previous Government was never prepared to make any tough decisions. It continued toÂ· spend and the Opposition continues to live in its own fairy world as economic Cinderellas.",289

The Australian Capital Territory organiser of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union has advised that this strike will be followed by a series of lightning rolling stoppages in support of their claims for a new awardMONICA",291
171,Mr SLIPPER ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"Shameful, shameful!",291
172,Madam SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"Would honourable members notice that I am standing. The organiser has advised that the stoppages will be in support of their claims for a new award which includes satisfactory pay rates and more appropriate conditions of service. The staff of the Parliamentary Catering Service and its union had previously notified the Joint House Department of concern with the classifications and conditions of service applicable under its award. Since October 1985 the union has sought to change the basis of classification for the catering staff. Discussions have been held between the union and the Joint House Department but a proposal has not been able to be developed that comes within the national wage case guidelines. The Public Service Board has been informed of the current situation and its advice and that of officers of the Presiding Officers Advisory Group have been sought in an endeavour to seek a solution. The Joint House Department has proposed discussions between itself, the staff of the Parliamentary Catering Service and the union on 12 February to seek to achieve withdrawal of the threat of further disruption whilst discussions continue and a basis is developed for the ultimate resolution of the dispute. JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendment. Senate's amendment. 'Page I, clause 3, lines 9 to 15, leave out the clause, insert the following new clause: Indictments ""3. Section 69 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in sub-section (3) 'or refer the matter to such legal aid authorities as the Attorney-General considers appropriate' after 'the accused person'. "".",291
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"Kingsford-SmithAttorney-General) (6.48)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. Although I have acted with goodwill in this respect, I must say that I cannot see that the amendment improves what we were about originally. The Opposition, with the concurrence of another party in the Senate, feels that the rights of a person would be affected if we were to do what was intended, that is, to make it very clear that section 69 (3) of the Judiciary Act, which has been in force since about 1903, need not remain because a number of applications to courts and judges are no longer appropriate in that legal aid is available through the respective legal aid commissions. Relatively recently a person who had been refused legal aid sought an order from a judge. The judge was quite understandably critical and said that he really should not be trying to determine administrative matters such as whether a person was with or without adequate means. In the particular case in question, it was alleged that the person seeking legal aid was in fact able to gain adequate support from other members of his family. I think the situation was accentuated when the person concerned continued to drive to the court in a Rolls-Royce. That created some public disquiet. However, legal aid was provided in the sense that a figure was eventually agreed on. The point I am trying to make is that every person who faces trial is entitled to legal aid when he or she does not have adequate means of paying for a defence. The amendment leaves such provision in sub-section (3) but proposes that it state: '. the Judge shall certify this to' the Attorney-General, who may if he thinks fit'-that is, having had a certification that a person is without adequate means to provide a defence for himself-'cause arrangements to be made. or refer the matter to such legal aid authorities as the Attorney-General considers appropriate'. 1 do not argue against the Senate suggesting this amendment because it feels that otherwise a right is taken away. However, under this provision the courts will receive a number of applications from people who say: 'I will go off to court and get an order from a judge'. The judge will then have to work out whether that person is without adequate means of support, when that is normally done by the legal aid commissions. The matter would then be referred to the Attorney-General, who in turn would have to refer it to the Legal Aid Commission. We spend a great amount of time and effort on the legal aid commissions; we give substantial funds to them and they do their duty very well. However, 1 can see what might happen, and in fact it has already happened in the Edwards . case last December. (Quorum formed) The amendment certainly meets the spirit of what has always been intended in that there would always be a legal aid commission to ascertain whether a person is without adequate means of support to defend an offence. However, what will happen now is that a person will be able to go to a court without going to a legal aid commission. The courts may well find themselves bedevilled by a number of applications. A person will go along to a court and say: 'I am here, I have not got any adequate means of support, and 1 want an order'. The judge would probably agree with that request and an order would be made that the Attorney-General make provision or refer the matter to the appropriate legal aid authority, and that would be the Legal Aid Commission. We are trying to regularise the system and to prevent the courts from having too much work in the sense of their doing the work that the Legal Aid Commission is now doing. A precedent was set in the Edwards case last December when a person went along to a court and said: 'I want legal aid' but that person had not gone to the Legal Aid Commission. It will be an embarrassment for the courts to have to deal with these matters when they could be dealt with by the Legal Aid Commission. 1 endeavoured to persuade the Opposition not to proceed with this amendment, which was moved at the time the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives. 1 was not successful, and the Bill has now been returned from the Senate on the basis that the law be let stand but that provision be made to allow for reference to alternative legal aid authorities. In a nutshell, I am not here to argue the matter any more. I think this amendment is counter-productive because .of the time and effort that the Â·courts will now have to spend in dealing with applications from people who have no obligation at all to go to the Legal Aid Commission. They will merely go to a court and get an order, and I can see that that will be encouraged. If the courts find themselves overwhelmed with these sorts of applications, it might be appropriate for this House, and the Senate particularly, to reassess the situation. I accept the amendment on the basis that there is a concern that the courts ought to look at the question of legal aidÂ· rather than the administrative area. I think that will cause some difficulty, but 1 accept the amendment given to us by the Senate.",291
174,Mr SPENDER ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"North Sydney) (6.57)-I am glad to accept the expression of goodwill from the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen), even though 1 feel that the way in which his arguments were put did not really live up to that expression. He seems to be concerned about the way in which this amendment will operate. Listening to what he has had to say, one can only assume that it is an amendment the Government was not really in a position to accept, but the Attorney-General has said he will accept it and he does accept it. 1 suppose that must mean that he sees more merit in having it on the books than in not having it on the books. So at least we have got that far in terms of agreement. The Attorney-General has expressed the fear that under this amendment the courts again will be bogged down by applications for legal aid. Let me remind the Committee of what the amendment we propose to section 69 (3) of the Judiciary Act will do. What the Government proposed was to get rid of section 69 (3) in its entirety. Under sub-section (3) courts are given power, on the trial of Commonwealth offences, to make certain provisions for the defence of people. Let me read the relevant part of the sub-section, which states: If it be found to the satisfaction of the Justice or Judge that such personthat is, an accused personis without adequate means to provide defence for himself, and that it is desirable in the interests of justice that such an appointment should be made, the Justice or Judge shall certify this to the Attorney-General, who may if he thinks fit thereupon cause arrangements to be made for the defence of the accused person. So we have these ingredients: We 'have an offence charged; we have a judge who hears an application, and he has to be satisfied that the accused person is without adequate means to provide defence for himself, and he has also to be satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that an appointment of counsel should be made, in which event he so certifies. The last time we were debating the Judiciary Amendment Bill the Attorney-General was complaining that that sub-section in effect left him with no discretion. He said that everything should be handed over to the legal aid authorities, that they were the answer to all these problems, and that the courts simply should not be involved. As I understand him, that is what he is saying now. What we are saying is that of course there is a legal aid system in this country but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as this Government sometimes suggests that it is. We say that there may well, be cases, and that these cases should be guarded against, where legal aid is refused, where a person is accused, where a person is on trial for a Commonwealth offence, where that person does not have adequate means to provide for a defence and where the interests of justice require that there be a lawyer to defend that person. That is the situation that we seek to protect. We did it by an amendment which, I am glad to say, the Australian Democrats in another place have supported. By that amendment, which is the amendment before the Committee today which was moved by me on 13 November 1985, where a judge comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to provide for the defence of someone because that person does not have adequate means to provide for his own defence and that therefore it is desirable in the interests of justice there should be an appointment of someone to defend him that judge can certify to the Attorney-General who, under the alternative we offered, may, if he thinks fit, thereupon cause arrangements to be made for the defence of the accused person; or the Attorney-General can refer the matter to such legal aid authorities as he considers appropriate. It is, I should think, no more than raising spectres to say that courts will be bogged down by these sorts of applications. If a person is on trial and cannot afford a lawyer to defend himself the first thing he is going to do if he has any sense at all is to apply to the legal aid authorities. There may be cases where, for whatever reason, an accused person will decide that he will chance his luck with the court. These circumstances would be exceptions because it would be an extremely stupid, unwise and venturesome accused person who would not want to get a defending counsel engaged at the earliest possible opportunity. Most-the overwhelming number of such people-would want to go to the ordinary legal aid system to try to get it that way. The Attorney-General provided the reason for this amendment the last time we debated this matter. He told us that all of the 10 applications made in 1986 were made by defendants who had previously applied for legal aid and who had been refused. What we say is that a supervisory role should be maintained for the courts. We do not assume that the courts will be involved in a day to day investigation of people's finances but we do say that courts are, by the nature of the business they have to look after, by the experience of the judges, better placed than anybody else to determine whether the interests of justice require that a lawyer be appointed to defend somebody who is on a Commonwealth charge. The Attorney-General has shown some concern for the administration of justice. At Question Time we heard him talking about the Chamberlain case and the concern that he had with the possible irregularities in relation to that case-the concern that he had that the outcome may not have been a just one. I welcome his concern generally for the administration of justice, but I think that he allowed himself to be too easily influenced by the departmental view that a nice neat amendment should be brought into take away from the courts any power to exercise a supervisory role in the interests of justice where an accused person comes before a court and says: 'I am accused. I could go to gaol. I do not have adequate means; I cannot afford lawyers. The interests of justice require that I should have a lawyer'. In those cases I would have thought that the Attorney-General would agree that such a person should have a lawyer even if the legal aid authorities have refused him. I am sure he is not going to tell us that the legal aid authorities cannot err, just as I will not tell him that the courts cannot err. There will be cases where both make mistakes. However, to retain a supervisory rQle is an added safeguard in the interests of poor accused persons. Certainly, it is not one-I entirely agree with the Attorney-General-to be abused by rich accused persons. If abuses take place it is up to the courts to meet those abuses. Therefore in sum we welcome his acceptance of the amendment and we welcome its passage through this chamber.",292
175,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"Kingsford-SmithAttorney-General) (7.06)-1 thank the honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Spender). I pick up the point which he has a tendency to think represents the position. He says that a person who has been refused legal aid is entitled to go here. I will not quibble about that. However, the point I make is that people will now be able to go to the court without having any refusal of legal aid first. I think that will be a problem for the court. However, the test of it will be in its performance in the next 12 months. I am sure that the honourable gentleman will agree it is possible that the courts could come and say that they are bedevilled with applications by people who do not go anywhere near the legal aid commissions but who say 'We are penniless' and that the courts will have to make orders, spend a lot of time working out whether the person has means or not and then send them to me. I in turn must then make arrangements. In the cases where legal aid commissions have declined in the past to give legal aid-something which the honourable gentleman quite fairly adverted to-it was not that they refused legal aid at all but refused it on the basis of quantumthe amount sought. The honourable member will find that in most cases it was a matter of listening for hours to tapes; it was a question of what one could afford to spend. From recollection, in the 10 cases concerned I was talking about looking at individual costs of $200,000 in some instances. No judge would ever conduct a trial with an accused not being represented. I am sure that the honourable gentleman would agree with that. However, the issue is what is fair and reasonable in the provision of legal aid. It does not alwaysJollow that the accused is entitled to get whatever counsel he wants at whatever seniority he feels is required. It is a question of taxpayers' money, to the extent now of about $90m, being devoted to legal aid and a fair share being given to the accused. I do not want to delay the chamber. I accept the view that the honourable gentleman is putting. He and I would both agree that we might find that as a result of this amendment courts are being cluttered up by applications from people who have gone nowhere near legal aid offices. These are the people he has said have been refused legal aid. In the Edwards case no application was even made; however, it went to the court. We will continue to have that problem because the way the section is worded at present everybody can go off to the court first and then to the legal aid office. I was merely making the point that the legal aid commissions have a duty. In fact they are representative of the profession in the need to guarantee that nobody is denied legal aid. I would have thought that that would have been sufficient. As it turns out it is not. I accept the amendment.Â·",293
176,Mr SPENDER ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"North Sydney) (7.08)-I wish to make one point again. When this Bill was before the House on 13 November 1985 the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) pointed out that 10 applications had been made that year. When I asked whether they had previously applied for legal aid, he said: Yes, they had; the honourable gentleman is entitled to ask that question. They had previously applied for legal aid and had been refused by the respective commissioners. That is the case that concerns us.",294
177,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,On the amount. It was refused because they wanted an additional amount.,294
178,Mr SPENDER,PARLIAMENTARY CATERING SERVICE,"That is not what was said here. I do not want to take up time on this matter, but the Attorney-General said that they had been refused as to the amount. That was certainly not what was said. If one looks at the cases one sees that there have been cases before the courts in which individuals have been refused legal aid and have then sought an order under section 69 (3) and then got the order. It would be an extraordinarily unusual case that where there had been a grant of legal aid the court would then entertain a quibble whether a few dollars more should be awarded. That would be quite outside the province of the sort of thing which the courts would concern themselves with. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments. Senate's amendments No. I-Page 5, clause 5, at end of clause, add the following new sub-clauses: ""(3) Where, before the commencement of this Act, a purported election of a person as the staffcelected Director or as the deputy of the staff-elected Director was held or commenced to be held in a manner approved by the Board, the purported election so held, or the purported election so commenced to be held as completed after the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have been or to be as valid and effectual as it would have been or would be if it had been or were held after the commencement of this Act in accordance with sub-section (2).

"". No.3-Page II, after new clause 19, add the following new clause: Broadcasting or televising of political matter or controversial matter ""20. Section 116 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting sub-section (2)."".",294
179,Mr DUFFY ,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Holt-Minister for Communications) (7.12)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. This situation arises as a result of amendments moved in the Senate. Briefly, the amendments to be approved by the Committee are as follows: The amendment to' clause 5 is a Government amendment which ensures that an election completed in December 1985 in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is valid for the purpose of appointing a staff-elected director. The amendment to clause 5 is technical and became necessary because of the time taken for passage of the Bill which was introduced in the 1985 autumn sittings. It was a purely technical amendment and, as I indicated, was moved by the Government. The second amendment is an Opposition amendment to repeal section 116 (2) of the Broadcasting and Television Act which imposed a five-year ban on televising a dramatisation of any political matter. The Government does not oppose this amendment as it reflects a recommendation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. The Government has previously indicated that it would put forward such an amendment in another piece of legislation and therefore we do not oppose that amendment. The third amendment relates to section 100 (6) of the Act. This is an Opposition amendment to introduce a 60-day time limit on section 100 (6) of the Broadcasting and Television Act within which the Department of Health may approve or disapprove the text of an advertisement relatto'which irig to medication. The Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) may speak on that matter. But at this stage as far as the Government is concerned the position is no different from what it was when the legislation first came into this House. We do not see any reason for this amendment. In fact, the amendment as moved by the Opposition could well cause considerable problems which could affect appeal powers of interest groups. However, we do not propose at this stage to oppose the amendment because we do not want to delay the Bill as a whole. In relation to the matter that I have mentioned, namely, that this amendment could affect the appeal powers of interest groups with regard to this section, the matter can be further clarified at some stage in the future in a statute law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. Because of the necessity at this stage to pass the Bill we will not oppose the amendment. I foreshadow that it is the intention at a later date, by way of a statute law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, to raise this matter again in some detail.",295
180,Mr MACPHEE ,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Goldstein) (7.l5)-The Opposition, needless to say, supports the motion moved by the Minister for Communications ( Mr Duffy). We, of course, were responsible for two of the three matters that are now before the Committee. I will speak only to the third of those matters-that is, the one concerning the amendment moved by Senator Puplick which deletes the section limiting the dramatisation of material. I refer honourable members to the remarks made by Senator Puplick on 29 November, as recorded at page 2621 and follo.wing pages in the Senate Hansard, when he pomted out that there are still some absurdities in the Act, in spite of the amendment which t-e Minister has now moved. In respect of sectIOn 116 in particular, I point out that the section as it is now worded states: The Commission or a licensee shall not broadcast or televise a dramatisation of any political matter which is then current or was current at any time during the last 5 preceding years. Of course, each of us now knows that that was designed just after World War II when a Labor government then resented some of t-e m-terial which was being used by the fledglmg Liberal Party. The history of that section is set out in some quite important documents which were incorporated into the Senate Hansard of the date I have mentioned at page 2626 and following pages. I shall not recite what is contained in those documents, except to say that, not only have we matured as a nation and can cope with dramatisation of matters such as occurred then, but also, of course, we have the Max Gillies Show, Mike Carlton's puppets and various other forms of satire which are very close to dramatisation. So we feel that a responsible electorate can soon judge those who are dramatising events which are current or which have occurred within the last five years. Therefore, we do not need a provision of this nature. I would like to lend some personal support to the views that Senator Puplick set out regarding section 64 of the Act. I draw the Minister's attention to that section, which states: Subject to this Act, the Commission shall broadcast or televise free of charge from all the national broadcasting stations or national television stations, or from such of them as the Minister specifies, any matter the broadcasting or televising of which is directed by the Minister in writing as being in the national interest. I know the philosophy of the Minister at the table-and I have a similar one-that is, that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ought to be as autonomous as possible and ought to be accountable to this Parliament through the Board which is appointed by the Government. On this occasion that Board was appointed in consultation with the Opposition. I would have thought that this Minister would be most unlikely ever to use section 64 to give a direction to the ABC about what he or the Government thought was in the national interest. If anyone were to do so, I would have thought it would perhaps be done by a resolution of this Parliament, but even that procedure is hazardous unless it is a bipartisan process. My instinctive reaction when looking at that section is to say that it also is now outmoded and ought to be reviewed. I simply draw that point to the Minister's attention. We most firmly support each of the three amendments. EmptyHere port my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein ( Mr Macphee) and to explain, in very brief terms, why we were moved to suggest this amendment in relation to advertising for pharmaceutical products. One of the problems that confronts the health industry is the administration under this Government of the Department of Health. We are inundated with complaints from pharmacists of delays in paying their bills which are submitted to the Department for drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Pharmpay scheme has led to enormous delays for pharmacists and, in addition, the cost of medicare is out of control. Medical benefits payments are substantially over budget. One of the reasons is that again the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) and the Department have not stepped on fraud and overservicing, which continue to be a problem in the delivery of health ser'lices in this country. The administration of the Department is deficient in a number of areas. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products wish to advertise those products within the law. In order to be able to advertise those products they are required to obtain the approval of the Commonwealth Department of Health. Section 100 (6) of the Australian Broadcasting and Television Act states: A licensee shall not broadcast or televise an advertisement relating to a medicine unless the text of the proposed advertisement has been approved by the Director-General of Health . . . We were approached by members of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. They explained that, in some cases, there were undue delays in obtaining that approval. A voluntary code has been proposed and, in fact, applied. It has been proposed by the broadcasting industry and applied by the Department of Health. Unfortunately, whilst the code suggests a lO-day approval time for applications for advertisements, that is not stuck to. In response to my suggestion when I first moved this amendment the Minister said: 'Well, that is not true. Ninety per cent of the cases are approved within 10 days; 10 per cent of the cases are not because of the intervention of holidays, Christmas and other things'. That is just patently false. The complaints we have had are not in relation to some period over Christmas or any other holiday period; they are delays in the administration of his Department. Therefore, we were forced to move for this time limit which prescribes a time in which the Department of Health must make a decision on the application. The Minister also said: 'Oh, well, we haven't had any complaints. No pharmaceutical manufacturer has complained about the delays in approval for advertisements'. Later on he said: 'During the year I did have a complaint, but not from a pharmaceutical manufacturer'. We are not told who made the complaint, but he has had complaints. Nevertheless he said he got his private secretary to ring up the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters to ascertain its view, which was that the voluntary code was working well. I agree with that and so do the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The code is working well. The problem is that the Department is delaying approvals under the code. In fact the Government is supporting the case we have put up that the voluntary code is working well. Applications made under that code are in accordance with the code and there should not be these long three and four-month delays. Therefore we have been forced to move a 60day time limit to ensure that pharmaceutical manufacturers are fairly dealt with by the Department of Health. When we moved that amendment the Government opposed it in this House. However, as it has been forced by numbers in the Senate, where this amendment was carried, it now accepts the amendment because it has no alternative. I accept the suggestion by the Minister for Communications ( Mr Duffy) that some consequential amendment of which we are not aware at this stage may be required. Certainly we would only be too willing to look at consequential amendments which may be required as a result of the passing of this amendment. We believe that the administration of the Department of Health ought to be improved. We are concerned that pharmacists are facing substantial delays in reimbursement under the Pharmpay scheme and we are concerned about maladministration in the fraud and overservicing section. Fraud and overservicing remain rampant. Medical benefits payments are substantially overbudgeted, as I have suggested. We are also concerned that in the area of advertising undue delays have disadvantaged pharmaceutical manufacturers. We have had an opportunity to do something about this area. We have moved an amendment and we have forced the Government to accept it. In government we will move in the other areas to correct the maladministration as well.",295
181,Dr BLEWETT ,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Bonython-Minister for Health) (7.36)-This amendment has been rightly described by my colleague Senator Walsh as the sleaze bag amendment. He pointed out, quite clearly, that the only reason for this amendment being brought forward is that some particular vested interests-he described them as either spiv sleazebags or snake oil merchantsthat hang around the Liberal Party have been lobbying Opposition members pn this matter. (Quorum formed) With my colleagues here, it gives me a chance to repeat the accusation of Senator Walsh that this is simply a sleazebag amendment; that is, it had no justification at the time it was first moved and was completely unsubstantiated in argument. In fact we have heard nothing this evening to repeat the argument or to reinforce it in any way. In fact, the EmptyHere completely refused to meet my challenge on the last occasion. I quoted specifically from eration of Australian Radio Broadcasters. This was its comment on his amendment: In response to this morning's telex I confirm that to the best of our knowledge there have been no significant delays or problems associated with the Department's administration of section 106 of the Broadcasting and Television Act. Interestingly enough, today he has made no reference to the people who know about how this scheme has been operating, but he has come along here quite prepared to make these unsubstantiated charges about the administration of the Department of Health in an area where the people who deal with the Department are totally confident about the way it has been operating. As I have said, his ill-conceived amendment will cause some further concern. It will make appeals by public interest groups more difficult, but no doubt that was intended in the interests of his friends, and we will have to repair the damage he has done. As it is important to get this measure through, we will accept this amendment at this stage. At the first opportunity, when a general Bill is introduced, we will correct the defects of the amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.
