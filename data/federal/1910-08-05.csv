In Committee (Consideration resumed from 4th August, vide page 1166): Clause 8Section forty of the principal Act is repealed.. and the following section substituted in its Stead :"" 40. The Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any organization or person bound by the award, may prescribe a minimum rate of wages or remuneration, and in that case shall, on the application of any party to the industrial dispute, or of any organization or person bound by the award(a) make provision for fixing, in such manner and subject to such conditions as are specified in the, award or order, a lower rate in the case of employees who are unable to earn the minimum wage so prescribed; and (i) direct that, as between members of organizations of employers or employees and other persons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equal.""",14
2,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [TO.34] - I move That all the words after the word "" stead,"" line 3, be left out, with a view lo insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" 40. (1) The Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any organization or person bound by the award may(a) direct lhat, as between members of organizations of employees or employers and other persons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall, in such manner as is specified in the award or order, be given to such members, other things being equal; and (i) prescribe a minimum rate of wages or remuneration (in which case the Court shall, on the application of any party to the industrial dispute, or of any organization or person bound by the award), make provision for fixing, in such manner and subject to such conditions as are specified in the award or order, a lower rate in the case of employees who are unable lo earn the minimum wage so prescribed. (2) Whenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary, for the prevention or settlement of the industrial dispute, or for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society, to direct that preference shall be given to members of organizations as in paragraph (a) of, subsection (t) of this section provided, the Court shall so direct."" The clause as it stands fails to cover the whole ground. It limits the power of the President to make preference to unionists contingent upon prescribing a minimum rate of wage. There have been several instances in our Arbitration Court, and very many in the State Courts, in which a minimum rate of wages has not been prescribed. It may be desirable that the President should provide for preference to unionists even where he does not fix a minimum rate of wage. We provide in the amendment, therefore, for the granting of preference without any restrictions. It may be granted whenever the Court thinks fit, irrespective of the number of persons in the organization applying, or whether die organization is using its funds for political purposes. And preference must be granted whenever, in the opinion of the Court, the granting of preference is necessary for the prevention or settlement of the industrial dispute, for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society. I take it that the new section which we now propose to substitute for section 40 more effectively does what we desire than that in the clause as it stands in the Bill, and removes some of the grounds for objection in respect to it.",15
3,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Swan) [10.40]. - I am glad that the amendment has been moved by the Government. It removes a great objection to the clause, which originally provided that the Court should have no discretion in the matter of granting preference to unionists. This new provision gives the Court discretion. I have never given my personal adherence to the principle of preference to unionists. Our views are liable to change with time, but I have never come to believe that to give preference to unionists is fair as betwen man and man. Neither justice nor necessity can be urged in support of it in the present case. The unionists are only a part of the workers of iAustralia. About 2,250,000 persons have the franchise in the Commonwealth, a considerable number of ""whom are working men and working women, but nrobably not one-fifth of them are unionists. I am informed that there are only about 150,000 unionists.",15
4,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"There are more than 200,000 unionists.",15
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The honourable member's knowledge on this subject is greater than mine, and, therefore, I accept his figures; but, as there must be 1,000,000 industrial workers in Australia, they prove that only one-fifth of the total are unionists. On the ground of necessity, I cannot see why unionists should desire this advantage over other men. It cannot be said that unionism is languishing, because we know that members of the Ministerial majority in both Houses owe their seats to the fact that they are nominated by unionists, and the unionists are in a position of such influence that they were at the last election able to return a majority in both Houses. I always understood that one of the great planks of the Labour party was equality of mankind and equality of opportunity-that one man is as good as another. Of course, there are people who do not agree with that idea, and Burke regarded it as "" a monstrous fiction."" Perhaps, if it be analyzed, we'shall find it to be so. At any rate, equality of mankind and equality of opportunity is the shibboleth of the Labour party; but where is that equality when one man is given an advantage over another? I am not now referring to men who are not in the ranks of Labour-me n who have inherited wealth, or may have risen from the ranks of Labour-bu t to the competition between one poor man and another poor man, both very anxious to earn their living and support their families. This strong party, which is able to return a majority in the Federal Parliament, is not satisfied with their present advantageous position, but demands further preference. In my opinion, however, preference is not the real object of this clause. Unionists already have the power in all the great industries which extend beyond the limits of one State. I have heard it said in the House that .in the great shearing industry and the shipping industry there is not a man employed who i? not a unionist; and, therefore, their interests cannot be affected. Unionists are strong enough to look after themselves; indeed, that has been admitted by the honourable member for Darling. What is really desired is to make preference to unionists compulsory, and to leave no discretion to the Judge, as at present, and then to make it difficult for persons to obtain a livelihood unless they join the unions. This power is not sought, in my opinion, for industrial purposes, but for political purposes.",15
6,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Why do they seek political power if they already have the majority in Parliament?,16
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"They desire to drive all the workers into unions, with the object of increasing their political power. However, I shall not further deal with that point.",16
8,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,It is a very weak point!,16
9,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It is strong enough for my purpose, and I believe that with others I shall raise, will prove strong enough for the honourable member. Q I must say that I think too much power is given to the Judge of the Arbitration Court. I have nothing to say against the distinguished men on the.High Court Bench; indeed, it would be unbecoming in me to do so, and, as a matter of fact, I have no thought of the kind. In a great industrial matter like this, however, covering the whole of Australia, the Bill, by bestowing this unlimited power, places unreasonable reliance on any single man, no matter whom he may be. In private disputes of the most ordinary kind there is opportunity for .appeal to several higher tribunals before an ultimate decision is obtained, but in a matter which interferes with the living of almost every man in the country,, and which has a far-reaching influence on the daily lives of us all, we rely on the unfettered discretion and decision of one man. This seems to me the most foolish step possible to conceive. We provide* a number of Judges to decide comparatively small cases in order that ultimate decision may be arrived at, but in industrial matters, which are more important than all-the doing of justice between employer and employedit is proposed to take the decision of one individual, without appeal. This system must break down, as, indeed, it has already broken down in all the States. However eminent. and conscientious a Judge may be, it is impossible for him, under all the circumstances, to give satisfaction. If we are going to adhere to this policy, we should have a strong Court of, at least, three Judges. We are told that in the multitude of counsellors there is safety; and the Bill, in my opinion, is inadequate in this connection. I ought to have some sympathy from honourable members opposite seeing that, together with my friend, Mr Howe, of South Australia, I was instrumental in having this section placed in the Constitution. Its inclusion was proposed by Mr Howe, and I seconded the motion, and, though there was a good deal of opposition at first, it was eventually adopted. Further, I was, I think, the first Premier in Australia to introduce a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill into a State Parliament, though I do not think I was the first to carry such a measure, because its discussion extended over two sessions.",16
10,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Was it not Mr Kingston who introduced the first Conciliation and Arbitration Bill into an Australian Parliament ?,17
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,But I do not think that Mr Kingston's measure was real!}' ever acted upon.,17
12,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Yes , it was.",17
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"At any rate, it was not a compulsory measure, and I believe that it broke down on the first case, and has never been in operation since. Compulsory conciliation and arbitration on the lines of the New Zealand Act was first introduced by me in the Western Australian Parliament in 1899, and was passed in 1900. In the meantime, however, Mr Bernhard Wise had succeeded in putting the New South Wales Act through, though this was not quite so similar to the New Zealand A-ct as was that of Western Australia. A section in the West Australian Act declared strikes to be criminal and illegal, and we all thought that strikes would be at an end. like every reasonable person, I was very much opposed to strikes, and it was thought that conciliation and arbitration, which were anxiously desired by the leaders of the Labour party, would be better for everybody concerned. I must say, however, that I have been disappointed in many ways. I am, however, very glad to admit that this legislation has done some good, and that it has prevented a good many strikes. At the same time, we must remember that most of the decisions have been in favour of the men; and I have found-thoug h perhaps the honourable member for Darling having had more experience than myself may differ from me-that in very few instances have the men willingly subscribed to any award made against them in the same way that the employers have been compelled to. Of course, the employers, being few, can be compelled to obey, but a.n award cannot be enforced against thousands of men. I remember that when the original Bill was about to be submitted to this Parliament, by my late lamented friend, Mr. Kingston, I objected to the proposed penalty of £1,000 as ridiculous. It was even proposed, I think, to add imprisonment as an alternative penalty; but I asked Mr Kingston how it would be possible to enforce the payment of £1,000, or to imprison large numbers of men. However, Mt. Kingston was strongly of opinion that the penalties ought to be preserved, and he said to me many times that, in his opinion, when the Act was passed, there would be no more strikes, as the men knew the Act was intended for their advantage - In the principal Act there is a provision that no person or organization shall, on account of any industrial dispute, do anything in the nature of a strike or lock-out, or continue any lockout or strike under a penalty of £ 1 , 0 0 0; but that penalty, I think, has proved a dead letter for all practical purposes. We remember the story of the working man who, when he went to arbitration and had a decision given against him, exclaimed, "" You call this arbitration-the y have given it against me!"" So long as the award is in favour of the men all goes well, but, when it goes against them, difficulties arise. I have some records here showing the cases in which the awards of the Court in different States have not been obeyed. I have not prepared all of these records myself, but have had them supplied to me, and I should like to read them for the information of the House. This is a list of cases of employees in New South Wales who are reported to have struck work, after having obtained, and during the existence of, an award of the Court of Arbitration, in an industrial dispute to which they were parties, and as a refusal to obey the award. The cases are13th January, 1904, the Rhonda Northumberland and Northern Extended Mine; on 24th July, 1904, the East Greta miners; on 10th November, 1905, the Sydney wharf labourers; on 7th February, 1906, the Sydney coal lumpers; on 22nd January, 1907, the Sydney wharf labourers. There was a succession of strikes by that organization, in which, I understand, the Attorney-General holds office. On 16'th March, 1907, the Sydney coal lumpers again; on 2nd March, 1907, the Occidental miners; on 3rd April, 1907, the Queen Bee (Cobar) miners; on the n t h April, 1.907, the Cobar miners (several mines); from the 12th April, 1907, to 18th July, 1908, the Sydney coal lumpers for the third time; on the 16th April, 1907, the wire netting workers; on the 17th May, 1907, the Cobar miners (several mines) once more; on the 31st January, 1908, the sawmillers ; on the n t h F'ebruary, 1909, the iron workers' assistants and boiler makers (Messrs. R. Tulloch and Company's Phoenix Ironworks); and on 22nd February, 1909, the employees, iron workers' assistants, & c , of the Meadow bank Manufacturing Company. Then the Teralba miners are reported to have struck work on 12th November, 1909, in face of the award of a Royal Commission on Coal Mining Disputes in the Newcastle and Gunnedah districts, ancl as a refusal to obey such award. I am glad to inform honourable members that there has been no occasion of employees striking work in the face of the award of an industrial board in New South Wales j so that it seems that that system, which has been advocated in this House as preferable, has been a success in New South Wales as far as it has gone.",17
14,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"There has been no arbitration court in New South Wales for some years now, so that some of those cases took place during the existence of the boards.",18
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I have given a list of the organizations and the dates on which strikes took place, contrary to law, during the past five years. there was a strike of bread workers in 1907 against the decision of Mr Justice Hood, sitting as a Court of Industrial Appeals. Not only did they strike, but they abused the Judge to such an extent that he resigned from the Court. As soon as the wages in that trade were reduced by the ultimate award of Mr. Justice Hood, the union intimated that, unless the men were paid at the rate fixed by the Wages Board-whic h Mr Justice Hood had reduced on appeal-the members of the union would be called out. Honourable members can find that set out in the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for Victoria, of 30th April, 1909. employers had to give way, the law was flouted, and the strike was at an end. Queensland has been fairly free from strikes, but I have a note of one by the slaughtermen at the Redbank, Murrarrie, and Pinkenba Meat Works. They would not obey the Wages Board decision, and struck. After a conference, the strikers succeeded in obtaining the wages asked for and the strike came to an end. In Western Australia we have, unfortunately, been subject to a great many strikes. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act in that State was introduced by my Government, and I was told by the unions that they considered it was a very beneficent measure, that they would be for ever grateful to me, and that we should be for ever blessed if we passed it. We passed the Bill, and it is the law of that State now, but I have not seen much of the promised gratitude displayed since then. Instead of being grateful to me and remembering me with affection ever after, they have tried to destroy my political life at every opportunity. In one of the first cases uncler that Act the award of the Judge was not favourable to the employees. They commenced a practice that, I regret to say, continues, of abusing the Judge, and the Labour Council passed a resolution deploring "" the exhibition of bias by the majority of the Court."" That majorityconsisted of the Judge and the employers' arbitrator. This resolution, passed on the 14th October, 1902. also notified that "" the council appreciate the action of their representative."" a Mr Lobstein. Shortly afterwards, however, Mr Lobstein did not give them satisfaction, and they abused him and turned him out. They appreciated him when he was with them, but when he was not with them so much as they thought he ought to be they abused In Victoria him and turned against him.",18
16,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The right honourable member does not know all the circumstances.,18
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I only know the broad facts. The Labour council deplored the existence of bias when the award was against them, and gave commendation when it was in their favour. One of the Labour party, Senator de Largie, said at the meeting of the council on that occasionThey all recognised that the presiding Judge (Mr Justice Moorhead) of the Arbitration Court, was not friendly to Labour. It was evident that he was letting his spleen and bygone events get the better of his judgment. While he was President the Labour bodies would not get jusThe tice. He went on to advise them to petition to remove the Judge from his position. This attack would, perhaps, not have had much effect on a strong man in good health, but Judge Moorhead was very ill at the time, ancl was so affected by this adverse comment on his honour, that, - after vindicating himself in the Court, in a way which I suppose is very seldom heard of, he broke down. He never recovered, and shortly afterwards died. That was a very bad start in Western Australia.",18
18,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The same Judge had been seriously ill for a considerable time before. He had had paralvtic strokes.,18
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,That would not make him dishonest.,18
20,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I do not say that he was dishonest, or that it made him dishonest.",18
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The point 1 want to make is that the awards of the Judges in these Courts must be in favour of one side or the other, and that it is of no use giving the Judges authority to make awards unless they are to be obeyed. I am sure the Prime Minister agrees that there must be an alteration in that direction.",18
22,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What happened at Broken Hill? The men did not agree with the award, but they accepted it.",19
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The honourable member can use that case; I am not using it. I air: giving cases where the award has not been accepted.,19
24,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The right honourable member is not using the BrokenHill case because it is against his argument.,19
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It does not support my point that where awards are made they are not obeyed. I do not say diat they are disobeyed in every case, biit every one of them ought to be obeyed if this legislation is to be a peacemaker, and if industrial peace is such a boon to the community as the Attorney-General last night said it was. My objection is that the men go on strike instead of taking advantage of the law which enables them to have disputes settled by conciliation and arbitration. So long as they do that, they make it veryhard for all those in this House, who want to make their position better, to help 1 know that the Prime. Minister agrees with ine that if this Act is to be efficacious it must be obeyed. Unless it is obeyed, its very foundations are knocked away. The tramway strike now going on in Perth is an instance of men striking in spite of the fact that they have an opportunity of appealing to the Court and getting an award. The employees in that case have not gone to the Court, but have gone out on strike.",19
26,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I ask your ruling, Mr. Chairman, as to whether the right honourable member is in order in making a general speech on the benefits of arbitration, going into the history of cases for several years back Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I think we of conciliation ancl arbitration. ought to have a quorum on an important matter like this. [Quorum formed.]",19
27,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Is the right honourable member ih order in raising the whole quesnity."" tion of the history of arbitration on a which simply provides for preference unionists and the provision where necesstrike sary of a rate below the minimum wage? Instead of discussing the clause, I submit that the right honourable member is trying to get in a second-reading speech.",19
28,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The right honourable member is perfectly in order. The question of awards is before the Chair.,19
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It is very regrettable that the tramway employees in Perth have taken the law into their own hands. In this morning's Age there is published the opinion given yesterday by Mr. Justice MCMillan in regard to the matter. In giving the Court's decision, he saidIt is not for us to express an opinion as to the wisdom of taking away the right to strike. That is a matter of politics, but as a Judge, I ought to say, while there are sections which make conduct of this kind a criminal offence, they ought to be enforced. If the desire is that they should not be enforced, then these sections ought to be removed from the statute book. In that case, a mandamus was applied for, but was not granted by the Court. I believe it is made a criminal offence in Western Australia to strike instead of approaching the Court for an award, but those provisions do not seem to have the desired effect. That is the weak spot in the whole of this legislation, and I wish the Prime Minister would give his attention to it. We ought to devote all our energies to overcoming this difficulty, and endeavour to prethem. vent men taking the law into their own hands, instead of obtaining an award of the Court. I am sure that my honourable friends in the Labour party desire that the law shall be as effective as possible, but I think I may reasonably complain that they never raise their voices against any of these illegal and improper actions on the part of the unions. Instead of applying to the Court for an award, men go on strike, thereby breaking the law, and yet honourable members of the Labour party never condemn them. They contribute, to their funds, and express sympathy with them, but we never hear them say to men who go on strikeand "" Comrades, you are breaking the law, and are thus making it more difficult for us io secure any extension of the system If you go on in this way you will lose this great boon that we believe to be in the interests of yourselves and of the general commuI cannot recall to mind any case clause where a member of the Labour party has to gone into the open, and has told men on that unless they obeyed the law he would have nothing to do with them. Members of the Labour parry, in such cirunionists cumstances, remain quiescent. They are like "" dumb, driven cattle.""",19
30,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"That may be an ment against arbitration, but it has nothing to do with this clause.",20
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It has a beardid ing on the question of die awards of Court. I am sure that the honourable member desires that the law shall be observed, but he never calls upon men who have gone on strike to obey the law by appealing the Court for an award. After all, suppose that members of the Labour party are not to be blamed. How can we find fault with them, having regard to the position that they They owe their position in this House to the unions; they have been nominated by could have done so. unions, and they are not prepared to jeopardize their own positions liament by saying one word against their nominators. That is the position that we have reached in this House. In Western Australia there have been many strikes, in which an - award of Court has not been sought. Apart altowere gether from strikes among State employees, who do not come within the purview of the Arbitration Court, except to a limited gree, there have been various industrial disputes. We had there a great strike amongst the timber workers, which disThe turbed the whole country. The Arbitraclaiming tion Court could have made an award, but no appeal was made to it until whole community had suffered great loss by reason of the strike. We also had a dispute. strike amongst the firewood cutters, which caused the cessation of work on all the Kalgoorlie mines. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I again call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.""]",20
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The firewood cutters' strike caused all the mines in Kalgoorlie district to stop work- a truly extraordinary state of affairs in this tieth century.,20
33,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What was the interest one of the honourable member's "" pals"" that matter?",20
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The employees in that case, without making any commember plaint to him, went on strike. few hundred workers were able to throw into a condition of chaos the whole mining industrial community of the State. Honourable members of the Labour party would do well to direct the attention of to these improper actions, instead of endeavouring to pass an amendment of the law which will be of no service to them, arguexcept for political purposes.",20
35,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The wood cutters who struck were working under contract, and not come within the provisions of the the Arbitration Act of Western Australia.",20
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The honourable member, and those associated with him, did not try to put a stop, to the strike. They to did not say a word against the monstrous I act of the men in upsetting the whole of the industrial life of the gold-fields.",20
37,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Will the honourable member admit that the men to whom he refers occupy? could not appeal to the Court?,20
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,No . They,20
39,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,They could not; they in Parwere employed on piece-work.,20
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"They had no desire to appeal to the Court. They were unreasonable, and struck without giving to their employer any reason for their action. the If the honourable member for Fremantle present, he would say at once that no complaint was made to him by his men before the strike occurred. I would likedewise remind the Committee of the strike of Collie miners, in connection with which there was no application for an award. sewerage workers also ceased work, a wage of 9s. instead of 8s. per day. They did not go to the Court, the although Mr Justice Burnside was finally asked to act as arbitrator in the Is it any wonder that I and ethers who were instrumental in passing the original Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should not be satisfied with the result? That Act has done some good, but the results have not been all that we expected from it. The extent to which it has fallen short of our anticipations is due to the the members of the present Ministerial party. If they had denounced the law-breaking as twenthey would have done had they been possessed of sufficient pluck-ha d they not of been afraid of losing their parliamentary in seats-thes e calamitous results would not have followed.",20
41,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The honourable is not in order in reflecting upon A the action of any honourable member.,20
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I am referring to honourable members on the other side, not individually, but as a class. I come now to another aspect of the unions, and to which I invite the attention of honourable members. The honourable member for Darling is the most plausible man whom I have ever listened to, and has the capacity to make something that looks black against him appear to be snow-white. It is always a pleasure to listen to him, because he can make even a bad case look fairly well. He must admit, however, that it is very difficult for men to join tain unions. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - That is not correct.",20
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Le t me cite an instance. Every candidate for admission to the Fremantle Lumpers' Union must be a lumper; his application for membership must be proposed and seconded, and, unless a majority approve of his application, it is rejected. If admitted he must pay an entrance fee of 21s., ancl a weekly contribution of gd. per week. This seems fair and reasonable, but in practice the union is a close preserve. An applicant for admission will never secure the votes of the majority unless they view his appearance with favour. The union has been a close preserve for years.",21
44,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,What a glorious occupation it is to preserve !,21
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It is considered to;be a good occupation for making money without being overworked. To return to the question of preference to unionists, I think that this clause as it stood was an terference with individual liberty, and was framed with only one object in view. Its object is not industrial because the unions already have all that they want in that respect. They have complete control of the industries to which they relate. non-unionist cannot work alongside unionists without the consent of the union, and, as a rule, it is made impossible for him to work beside them. The object of this clause is not industrial but political. do not believe in coercing a man or a woman to join a union, or any other organization, as the only means by which lv; or she can secure a livelihood, and that inestimable blessing so eloquently referred to last night by the Attorney-Generalindustrial peace. Even if the unions do not operate harshly in respect of non-unionists, there is a, system of coercion exercised in connection with them, and a man loses his individual liberty.",21
46,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The Bill does not provide for anything of the kind. It does not say that a non-unionist shall not be employed-that is only an assumption. [44],21
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"A non-unionist, to obtain employment, must join a union, and pay what he does not wish to pay. He must subscribe to the rules and regulations of a limited number of workmen who have gained the upper hand in Australia. He must subscribe to what the executive and secretaries of these unionscer- all of whom have their eyes on Parliament, and generally get there-think . I do not wish to reflect on any one, but I believe that nearly every member of the Labour party in this House has been the secretary or an officer of a union. Such an office is a passport to Parliament-and the Labour party naturally wish to make the unions as numerous as possible.",21
48,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Of course that is it !,21
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Is not the honourable member the secretary of a union ?,21
50,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,No .,21
51,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Not half-a-dozen members of the party are secretaries of unions.,21
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Was not the honourable member the secretary of a union ?,21
53,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,No ; I was President of the Trades Hall Council.,21
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"And but for that fact the honourable gentleman would probably not have been returned to Parliament. I am not in favour of making in- laws to interfere with individual liberty or comfort unless it is necessary to do so, and no one can say that this clause is urgently required, even in the interests of the unions now in existence. We have been discussing for days, and during an allA night sitting, a Bill containing a provision which the Attorney-General himself says he thinks will be inoperative.. This invasion of the rights of individuals is repugnant to people of independent minds. Why I should men be compelled to do these things in'a free and sparsely-populated country, where there should be room for every one? This clause is unnecessary. Its only use will be to interfere with liberty or to destroy equality. It will be of no advantage to unionists except for political purposes.",21
55,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"East Sydney) [11.29] I do not claim to be a legal luminary, but I do not altogether approve of the amendment which has been proposed this morning. In order to illustrate my contention, let me place myself in the position of an employer of labour. The amendment gives an evilly-disposed employer the opportunity to inflict injustice on his employees after an. award has been made. It enables the Court to fix two rates of wages, and my knowbranch ledge of the world tells me the lower will be generally adopted. Employers will be able to grade their men as seconda class workmen. Nothing can prevent that being done, and it will inflict great injustice on men who are not second-class. only right that provision should be made for aged and infirm persons who cannot coma pete with men of average ability, and I persuaded the body to which I belong to agree to an arrangement to that end in State award. Under that arrangement the Registrar, with the consent of the union and the employee concerned, can give a man what is practically a certificate to the effect feeing unable, by reason of age or infirmity, to earn the minimum wage, he may accept less. There is nothing new in such an rangement. Eighty or ninety years ago the men in the building trades in Glasgow used to meet yearly to fix the rates of wages for the ensuing twelve months, and provifamily sion was always made for the case of aged and infirm workmen. In dealing with snatters of law and equity, I always try see the case as my opponent would see and in doing that in connection with this proposal I find that our objects will be feated. It must not be forgotten that ace legislating, not for men who desire be just, but for men who wish to take vantage of their fellows, even at the pense of justice and humanity.",21
56,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Does the honourable memintentions ber suggest that the Registrar or some petent authority should deal with this matter?,22
57,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Yes . It is well known Shat nowadays when men wish to tender for zation. - contracts they have no difficulty in regard to the prices they should fix for materials. I .could take a specification from an architect, and get out the quantities hours. The difficulty is to know where to .get labour and how to get the cheapest labour. The ingenuity of the Attorneyney-General. - Geueral is of a very high order, and the - difficulty which I have pointed out will give thatihim a splendid opportunity to exercise it.",22

It shows that the Government has for once listened to arguments respecting the views of a large section of the community, and we may congratulate ourselves that the Attorney-General has come down from the topmost to the lowest of the tree."" But the amendment rate bears evidence of very crude and hasty draftsmanship. Although I have had only few minutes in which to read it, I have observed many probable defects. No man who applies himself to the study of conI t is stitutional questions can speak positively on the constitutional points which are seen on mere cursory reading of an amendment like this, and I do not feel disposed to deal with the constitutional aspect of the matter a on such short notice. The attitude of the Government has not encouraged us to give our views regarding the constitutionality of the Bill. No doubt honourable members who that, have enjoyed Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado remember that Pooh Bah, when asked his advice regarding a proposed expenditure, arreplied that the subject was one of great moment, and as Chancellor he would say that the law did not permit, but, he added, "" If you want my opinion as yoursolicitor, my advice is, ' Chance it.'

"" The Prime Minisexter has chanced it before, and is chancing it again, and the results will be more obvious later.

66,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"To some extent; and, in connection with another part of ground. the Bill, to which I am not at liberty now to refer, except indirectly, there will be an extremely important discussion.

That is what the words suggest, because the Court maydirect that, as between members of organizamon tions of employers or employees and other sons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall, in such ner as is specified in the award or order, be given to such members. Those words are general in their application, and empower the Court to make a doubtful. rule affecting all organizations in an industry, no matter whether 'they are or are connected with the dispute which is being adjudicated upon.",23

The Attorney-General of the should state to which of the two views which may be taken of the amendment It is intended to give effect. It will be seen that they are of a totally different character. In one case what is proposed may not be objectionable. If we have a number of employees in the organization coming into condirect conflict with their employers, and one of the subjects of dispute is preference to as between themselves- ",23
69,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I should like to an assurance from the Attorney-General to that effect. I am very glad to hear rethe interjection of the honourable member, because, so far,' it removes very largely ir* my mind any remaining objection to this a part of the clause. But if it i i intended the Court is to have power at the instance of the organization to make a rule for preference to members of that organizaover other persons applying, and other employers not actually parties to the dispute, we are getting on very dangerous",23
70,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,We all agree to that.,23

I am not quite sure that I underperstood the Attorney-General aright, but I think that he admitted that, in his opinion, manthe common rule was probably not based on constitutional grounds.",23
72,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I said it was rather,23
73,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I am grateful not for such an admission from the Attorney General. If the common rule is doubtful then the same rule which makes it doubtwill make it impossible for the Court industo be invested with power to give preference affecting employers who are not actually parties to the dispute. The Attorney-General, I think, follows me in that position ?",23
74,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Are we never to exercise powers until we are convinced that they are constitutional ? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - That depends on the view we take. Honourable members opposite will, I think, follow their leader and say, "" Chance it "" ; but that is not the general view I should take.",24
75,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"If the honourable member's view is correct, how are we to find out what our powers are ?",24
76,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I am inclined to think that there is a medium course. We may, to some extent, in certain cases where necessity requires, legislate when we are not absolutely sure of our powers, and leave the Court to determine them. But that is different from engaging in a course of legislation against which the bulk of the ' legal advice in the House is continually directed. Honourable members will admit that, so far as the legal members on this side have expressed their views, they have not been dictated by party consideration. At all events, I-and I am sure other legal members-hav e endeavoured to do the duty which lies on members possessing any legal qualification in a debate of this sort, and to state as clearly as we can what we conceive to be the legal effects. Under the circumstances, if it be found that a very considerable volume of legal opinion is directly opposed to any particular measure, and it is admitted that that opinion is honestly expressed, it is not always wise to flout it absolutely.",24
77,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Is not the majority the guide as to the rights in the case?,24
78,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The . majority cannot determine matters of this sort. should like to refer, in passing, to the new part of the clause providing that whenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention of an industrial dispute, to direct that preference shall be given, preference may be given. I shall assume that to be intra vires-tiia t if it be passed it is good law-and I make the same assumption in regard to the provision about threatened or impending disputes, in order to discuss the merits of the question. If both of these are good law, and we pass them, we shall have the rather extraordinary result that any organization, no matter whether it contained only the minority of the employees in the industry, and that the majority do not desire to have anything to do with it for reasons of their own, may apply, and may say to its employers, "" We wish you to give us preference over all others, though we have no other dispute with you-w e are perfectly satisfied with our wages and conditions,"" and that, thereupon, there is an intended or apprehended dispute. The Attorney-General will admit that such a case would come under the head of threatened disputes. The Court would then have no option but to say that preference was necessary for the settlement of an apprehended dispute, and an order would be made. The whole essence of such a dispute is that preference shall be given.",24
79,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Quite so.,24
80,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"And , therefore, the result is that we place in the hands of a single organization, representing, it may be, only a minority of employees in the industry, the power to compel the Court to give preference, seeing that in no other way can a settlement of the dispute take place. There must necessarily be a dispute, because the organization will say that if preference be not given, there will be a dispute on that question. All these matters require some time for consideration. I am not at all confident at the present moment of what this amendment means in its full details. I see great possible defects in ""it, but I will say that it does seem to me to do away with what was the essence and spirit of the clause as originally introduced. That clause was really a demand made on this House to abdicate its own functions to outside unions, seeing that it provided that, on the demand of those outside unions, the Court we are creating and investing with powers, should be compelled, on their mere demand, with^ out the consideration of anything else, to I give preference. Such a claim is one which is absolutely inconsistent in my mind with the continuation of the functions of this Parliament as a Parliament. If it had been carried we should have been handing over to those outside bodies, which are irresponsible, so far as Parliament is concerned, the complete control and regulation of industries, represented only by a certain number of the employees. That provision happily has now been withdrawn.",24
81,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Does that remove the constitutional difficulty ? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - It certainly removes one of the constitutional difficulties, though I see other possible difficulties, which are, perhaps, of still greater importance, seeing that constitutional difficulties are always removed elsewhere, if not here. At all events, the withdrawal of that provision removes the effect of what would have been a blow at the whole liberty of Parliament in connection with the industrial matters.",24
82,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [12.0] - The criticisms that have been directed against this part of the measure have been comprehensive and contradictory. The Committee may be reminded of the present state of the law in regard to this matter. Before the Court now can grant preference, it must be satisfied that there is a majority of those interested in the industry who are favourable to its application. If preference is granted, the Court subsequently takes it away if it be shown that there is anything in the rules of the organization which, in its opinion, is inconsistent with the granting of the preference. This means,' when read in connection with the clause and section 55 of the Act, that the Court is given such a wide discretion as to what is unsatisfactory, or inconsistent, that I can hardly conceive of the rules of any union which might not be held fatal, to preference. One instance may be given. In 1901 or 1902 the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, in connection with the first award under the State Act, obtained preference for its members. The Court decided that, as long as the union permitted any reasonably competent and sober person to join the union, then, as between members of the organization and non-members, preference should be given to members of the union. It was found, as one of the direct effects of this condition, that a large number of men went to the employers with letters from various persons, who testified that they were very good men-that is to say, from our stand-point, very bad men. The employers in some cases even handed money to those men, who then came to the union, and said, "" Here we are, take us in . "" The union, as every other union, organization, or organism in creation, claiming the right to determine who should be admitted as a member, asked itself whether this was conducive to the servation of its existence, because, obviously, it wa*s opening the door of the citadel, and allowing the enemy to come inside. The Wharf Labourers' Union, to which I myself belong, said, "" Well, this preference is no doubt a very excellent thing, but it is not worth sacrificing that for which we came into existence,"" and decided to abandon preference rather than the right to ballot for the admission of members. That is the right to the exercise of which Judge Cohen took exception, though it is a right common to every organization throughout the civilized world. No religious sect, no social body, lodge, or organization, ever divested itself of this right. Every club, every sporting organization, every religious body, reserves itself the right to say who shall and who shall not join, and it is the very basis of organization. If men are allowed to enter unions merely on the payment of a fee while their opinions are not essentially identical with, or may be opposed to, the opinions of the other members, an organization ceases to exist, save in name. Under the law, as it stands, then, an organization may have preference taken away, because it insists on the right to ballot for members, and preference, extremely difficult to obtain, is practically impossible to retain. In six years no organization has received it, and no self-respecting organization could hold it for five minutes. As we think this quite wrong, against the. spirit of the Act, and inimical to the con-, tinuance of industrial peace, we have taken', the very earliest opportunity of remedying it. It has been said that preference to.' unionists is unfair to non-unionists. We do not think so; and we think, too, that the right to ballot for members is a natural corollary of legalizing organizations and ought to be conceded by every fair-minded person in the community.",25
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I know unions which have never asked for that privilege, and never exercised it ",25
84,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"There are unions and unions. Those with which I have been associated are unions that have earned their right to what they have got by being ready to sacrifice all they had to get it. No union is worth a flapping of the fingers if it will not stand out on this question. If the difference between a unionist and a non-unionist is to be simply a matter of 10s., then all I have to say is that that is not the difference, that we have in our preminds. The difference between the unionist and the non-unionist is, speaking broadly,-' the difference involved by holding one set of opinions and principles and another. All that we ask of any man who wishes to join an organization is that he shall pay a moderate fee, which is barely sufficient, in my opinion, to meet expenses- and no ios. ever invested in anything conceived in the entrancing pages of the 'Arabian Nights ever paid better than the investment of that ios. has paid the members of my organization-and also that he shall hold the principles the union believes in, as set forth in the rules. But, under the Act as it now stands, all barriers are thrown down, and the difference between a unionist and a non-unionist disappears. We do not believe in that, and take the first opportunity of so drafting preference clauses as to express the conditions upon which preference should be granted. In addition to the restrictions in the principal Act, to which I have just alluded, if a union uses its funds for political purposes it cannot under section 55 obtain preference. Now, this is a distinct attempt to interfere for party purposes with the right of every citizen to obtain he wants in a constitutional and legitimate way. There is ample precedent for what we desire. Take my own profession. It comes with extraordinarily good grace from gentlemen whose privileges have been conferred upon them and are preserved to them by the law to object to privileges being obtained by the law for members of trade unions. A unionist says, "" I want eight hours a day, or ios. a day, or decent conditions of work, good air, and an opportunity to live as a man, instead of being a mere machine and a cog in the wheel. I shall try to get it by industrial effort."" He tries and fails. He says, "" Now I shall try to get it by political effort."" May he not do so? Has he not a perfect right to do that as a citizen? When he becomes a unionist, cloes he - divest himself of his rights as a citizen? Does he become less an elector? Has he no right to combine with any other elector or electors to get any privilege he desires in a constitutional ancl legitimate manner? hampering of unionists by this restriction was a blow aimed at the party which sits on this side of the - House, in order to cripple it at the elections. Honourable members opposite saw clearly that the people were coming to the support of this side in ever increasing numbers, and they wanted to prevent unions using their money to alter the laws to give the workers decent conditions to live under. A unionist has a right to get decent conditions, and spend his money, to the last penny if he likes, in that direction. These being the facts, it became necessary to alter the law. But, as I said on the second reading, we are living under Mr Hughes. a legal Constitution. We cannot alter the law in any direction, but only in a certain direction. I said, and say it again with great regret, that we are unable to do what not only we desire, but what the country, and the industrial conditions of the country, urgently demand. We are unable to make such a law as will effectively cope with the increasingly complex industhe trial operations of Australia. Therefore, in everything we do now, we are crippled and hobbled by the Constitution. Yet we have a right to go as far as thaiConstitution will permit us. The honourable member for Flinders said that one very good principle to act upon was to "" chance it . "" For days we have been sitting under an avalanche of criticism bewhat cause we are chancing it, and it is rather curious that an honourable member who advised us to chance it in a certain direction should now point out that we shall inevitably overstep our powers if we move a foot in that direction.",25
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The honourable member for Flinders did not advise the Government to chance it.,26
86,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,He suggested it.,26
87,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,He said the Attorney-General advised the Prime Minister to chance it.,26
88,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I did nothing of the sort. If I have done the honourable and learned member for Flinders an injustice, I apologize in the amplest possible way, and withdraw my remarks. I understand now that it is I who am supposed to have given that advice. I did not do so. We have to consider exactly how far we can go, and how far we ought to be permitted, to go. I have pointed out all along that we ought to be allowed to exercise our power in any way reasonably connoted byThe the words in which it is conferred. Thatbeing so, preference to unionists inevitably springs from the granting of the power,, because it is necessary, in seven cases out of ten, for the settlement or prevention of industrial disputes. The chief objection to the clause as it stands in this Bill is. that preference can only be granted as a corollary to the granting of a minimum wage. I understood the honourable and learned member for Flinders to say that his chief objection to sub-clause 2 of the clause as amended was that it made the granting of preference to unionists mandatory in a case where the dispute turned on that point. I admit that it is very necessary that the power should be givens to the Court to grant it in such a case. A great many disputes have occurred, and will occur, on this .very question of whether preference should be granted to unionists, and in such a case where industrial peace can best be preserved by granting the application, why should the Court not have that power? And why should we not saythat we believe the Court ought to exercise it? I think we should say so. We are perfectly right in taking power to say so by this amendment, instead of leaving it out of the power of the Court to grant any relief in such a case. In the disputes in which the organization to which I belong has been concerned, questions of money have rarely been involved. In two important cases money has been a secondary consideration. The real question at issue has been whether unionists should work with non-unionists-whethe r members of our organizations should have preference over non-members. Upon that question, as every honourable member knows, there is room for an industrial dispute spreading from one end of Australia to the other. It is, therefore, proposed to take power in the .amendment to deal with cases of that kind, and which can only be dealt with in that very way. In it we have clone nothing which goes beyond the Constitution, nor anything beyond that which the industrial circumstances require. The honourable and learned member for Flinders spoke of our chancing the thing, but this amendment goes simply as far as the Constitution will permit us to go. We should be foolish to attempt to transgress those limits, which are very real at present, but which we hope will not long remain so. The clause as it now stands, gives the Court power to do something which, under the Act and the Bill, it could not have done. It gives that power in such a way that the Court may exercise it without that exercise being in clanger of being declared unconstitutional by the High Court. Generally, the powers given to the Court under the amendment seem to be at once more comprehensive and more effective than those in the Bill. The honourable member for Flinders stated that organizations under Act are not necessarily unions. Nor they, but that argument seems to conflict with the tremendous chorus of invective to which we have listened for some time past, and in which honourable membersopposite have declared that the sole object and pose of this amendment of the law is to serve the political ends of this party. That is to say, they allege that we are using the funds of trade unions for political purposes. As a fact, the unions of this country do not want anything from us to induce them to vote for us. They have voted and they will continue to vote for us whether they'get this Bill or not. That they have voted for us is very evident. The right honourable member for Swan said that there were very few unionists in Australia compared with the numbers outside the unions. The records of unionism and the returns of the last election will, I think, give two very effective replies to the right honourable member. As a fact, in all those industries which permit of organization, or which have availed themselves of organization, unionists are in an overwhelming majority. There are many industries in which unions practically absorb the whole of the workers. As the president of an organization that includes ten thousand men, and covers an industry from one end of Australia to the other, I can say that there are not two per cent, of the persons engaged in that industry outside our organization. The honourable member for. Darling, who is very much better able to' speak on this matter than I am, can, as the head of the greatest organization in Australia, say the same. Nor is that state of affairs confined to those two industries. It extends to the coal mining industry, the shipping industry, and various others. How many men are there who are not in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers? And we could run the gamut right through the various organizations of Australia. Something has been said about preference to unionists being unfair. Is it? Take, for instance, the lawyers and doctors, the latter particularly, who will absolutely decline to meet a non-unionist, although their unfortunate joint patient should be in extremis. Thank Heaven, we do not carry things to that extreme. It is absurd to speak of unionists being in a minority in this country. They are in a minority as compared with the total population, but they are not in a minority the compared with the ranks of the industrial are classes of Australia. Unionism is growing every day. To talk about unionism as if it were a crime is to completely forget the purpose and the provisions of the original Act. It is an Act to encourage unionism pur- and organizations. No one can obtain th« benefit of that Act unless he is a membet of an organization..",26
89,Mr JOSEPH GOOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Who has said that unionism is a crime? The honourable memramatta, ber declared that the Opposition had said that it was.",28
90,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I did not. Mr MATHEWS,-If the honourable memcloes ber did, he only told the truth. Members of the Opposition have said so dozens of times.",28
91,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The honourable ber for Wentworth said a night or two ago unionists or non-unionists. that if he were a workman he would unionist. If trade unions had been built up by men like him, they.would not have done much, and they certainly would not be a force in this country. Whilst honourable member, if he were a working man-and God forbid that he ever should be-woul d be perfectly willing to join union, what would he do as soon as he became a member of it? Apparently he be would exercise that careful review of his opponent's position, which seems to tinguish him nowadays, ancl would regard not his own interests-whic h is now his leading characteristic-bu t only those of the men outside. He would live and, necessary, die for the non-unionist. Now a.trade unionist, after all, is a common garden variety of man. He is just the same as honourable members on this side and on the Opposition side of the House. He does not join a union merely to take summer holiday; he joins it, as he has every right to do, to benefit himself his fellow-man. Human nature is exemwhich plified here as it is in the unions. We are here because the people sent us here to make laws for their benefit. A join good deal has been said of the tyranny of unions, and it has been asserted majority.'' that, under this clause, every non-unionist will be compelled either to join a union or to perish. The honourable member for Lang suggested a number of titles for Bill, amongst them being, "" A Bill to proisolated hibit the right to live,"" or something that effect. It is a Bill to do nothing the sort. It is a Bill to promote industrial peace; a Bill to settle matters in a rational instead of an irrational and desperate It is a Bill to enable the industrial every other class in the community to live in peace and harmony, and to follow their various pursuits in a sensible, business-like way. We deny no man the right to live. It is assumed, however, that preference unionists, in some inscrutable way, will prive some men of opportunities of employsible ment. Let us see what it will really do, and I invite the honourable member for Parwho dealt with this matter in his second-reading speech, to note these facts. If 10,000 men are required in an industry, and there are only 10,000 in it, then what preference to unionists mean? If there are 8,000 unionists, it means that they will be taken first, and the remaining 2,000 afterwards. If there are 12,000, and only 10,000 are wanted, then 2,000 memmust stop out, whether they be We say that be a those who stop out must be the non-unionists. The Opposition would say in such circumstances to us, "" Now, you have prevented those 2,000 men from getting the work."" But should we have done so? What would be the alternative? That we should leave out the 2,000 unionists, a and prevent their getting work? That is the inevitable conclusion to which we must driven. But it has been the actual practice of employers to penalize unionists, disancl to keep them out because they are unionists. That-has been done, not once, but ten thousand times within the last few years.' To my certain knowledge, unionists if who have made themselves prominent have been black-listed, ostracised, and penalized or in every conceivable way, merely because they were unionists. We say to every man in this country, not under this Bill, but under' the terms of the original Act, a "" Come into an organization."" That is the invitation extended under the principal and Act, which the Opposition supported, and they say has in it all that is good. That Act, I repeat, and not this Bill, says to the workers, ""Come and be unionists; an organization, and so get better conditions, and get preference if you are in a The Act invites them to do that, and when we ask the Committee to approve of the necessary corollary to that Act, the Opposition oppose it. I * venture to say this that unions, while they have been, in cases, tyrannical, as every body of to men will be under certain conditions, will of compare very favourably with organizations of oiher kinds.

92,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I ask the honourable member not to continue that line of arguthe ment. . Mr HUGHES - Ver y well, sir. Those, have to be considered. iii effect, are the rules of a certain organibeing zation in the Commonwealth. What are the rules of trade unions ? If a man wishes to join a union, he must be a true unionist. He must pay a subscription, and be balfamiliar lotted for, or otherwise submit himself the members of the union, and be prefor pared to accept the union's rules. My own experience is that unions admit people to their ranks with too little himself is. rather than too much discrimination and care. I speak for my own organizalieve tion, which has been in existence ten years, and during that period has rejected only four applications for admission. We pass through the ranks of our organization from five hundred to eight hundred men a year. There are 3,700 men in it, ancl in ten years, I repeat, we have rejected only four appliThat cations. Can any religious, friendly ciety, or other organization show a better record? I , with confidence, ask the Committee to accept this provision, which no injustice to the non-unionists. Under a non-unionist cannot be affected unless there are in the trade concerned more than can be absorbed. In that event, non-unionist suffers only because the unionist actual question under consideration. does not. If the non-unionist is to secure the harvest, and the unionist is to suffer, then we may say that to leave the Act it is is to penalize unionists, and to deny them the right to live. Now as any man can join an organization and have equal opportunities with unionists to secure employment, there is no injustice done the non-unionist. The unionist has done communities. the work of organization. He has suclearned, ceeded in raising wages, and he has the best right to enjoy the advantages of unionism. I wish now to reply to honourable member for East Sydney, who is n little doubtful as to what the effect of those with whom he is associated. paragraph b as it stands will be. He sires that the Registrar shall have power determine under what conditions and in what way a lower rate than the minimum wage shall be paid to aged, infirm, and bers. slow workers. In my opinion clause 9 will give power to the Court to appoint a Board of Reference clothed with sufficient authority. As to the position of the trar, I 'wish to remind my honourable friend that, while under a State Act, a Registrar is able to deal with all matters because of the comparatively circumscribed area within which he works, under the Federal Act position is different. The case of some persons in, say, Western Australia might The Registrar here, it would be impossible for him to act personally and a waste of time to delegate those powers to a deputy registrar, who might be, so to speak, quite unwith the principle of the Act. to These deputy registrars are registrars only the purpose of the Act, and may be officials who are not as conversant with the principle of the Act as the Registrar I therefore think that the Registrar, having the power, which I behe has, and the Board of Reference being established, what will happen is that the President will appoint a Board composed of representatives of both parties, in equal numbers, and that they will decide in what circumstances an exemption should be granted to slow, aged, and infirm workers. is an excellent system which has been sofollowed in New South Wales in many cases and has given general satisfaction.",29

The honourable member's association with trade unions has been contemporaneous with their political development. remember when he was one of the severest hear that: critics of trade unions. It was part his propaganda then to show that their portunities were limited, because they were not socialistic. Socialism, unionism, was the panacea then.

Of'course, that is only my opinion, but I shall not call my opponents by the ugly names which they have applied to me because we differ. In my time some of the city unions used to do foolish things. The miners in the country no would not have anything to do with the a Sydney organizations, and conducted their unions upon what they regarded as saner and wiser lines.

120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Surely I may - discuss the constitutionality of. the provi.sions. Instead of putting forward proposals of doubtful constitutionality, the Government should straightforwardly appeal to the people for a larger grant of power in regard to industrial matters. We are asked whether we ought never to pass legislation until we have the authority - of the High Court; but I may tell honourable members that that is the plan followed in Canada. There the Government have the power to refer any proposal to the decision of the High Court in order to ascertain if it is constitutional.",31
121,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,VV e have no power to do that here.,31
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"We have all the power; or, at any rate, honourable members opposite say we have. The popular will which prevailed on the 13th April will surely be available for the granting of a power of the kind. I have before said in this House that it would help us very materially if the Qovernment had the privilege of placing proposed legislation of a technical character before the High Court, and ascertaining its constitutionality, before it is crystallized into Bills, because that would save an immense amount of time, and be infinitely preferable to running our head against the constitutional wall. In my judgment, the proposal before us is only "" taking a rise "" out of the people outside. We have no right to raise expectations, even in their minds, unless we are clear they can be carried out. Since the Attorney-General and his Government intend to ask for a general grant of industrial power early in next year, why do they introduce these proposals in the meantime, not knowing whether or not they are constitutional?",31
123,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Because industrial peace has to be maintained in the interval. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-Is industrial peace being broken now, and, if so, when, where, and under what circumstances? Is industrial peace in danger of being broken without the Bill?",31

It is This would afford an admirable opportunity for the honourable gentleman to wax eloquent in another second-reading speech, though we have had about six already. He has shifted his ground this morning in his illustration.

126,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I think it was the other way round, but it makes no difference.",31
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"And the honourable gentleman asked what is wrong in granting preference to the 1,000. But what is right about it?",31

129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,What advantage do they get?,31
130,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Every advantage.,31
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"All the men are employed, and what difference does it make to a man whether he is counted as number 1 or as number 1,001 ? No better example has been given of the uselessness of granting preference in such a case. The illustration this morning is slightly different, but it does not help the Attorney General being, as he would say, ex hyfothesi. It is the case of an industry employing 12.ooo men, 10,000 of whom are trade unionists, and 2,000 of whom are not. But the Bill does not touch a case like that.",31
132,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Why not?,32
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Because there is already power to give preference in such a case.,32
134,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Not at all. If a union uses its funds for political purposes, or - ballots for members, it cannot have preference.",32
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"But , so far as the principle of majority rule goes, there is the power under section 41 of the Act; where that principle is applied, preference may be given every day of the week, subject to the conditions mentioned. proposed to eliminate all those limitations as to the application of trade union funds to political purposes-to give the men in unions the right to shut their doors, which, the Attorney-General says, are not half enough shut now, and to leave the members to decide amongst themselves how the funds shall be spent in political propaganda. The Attorney-General is quietly drawing a cordon around the unions which will effectually and inevitably shut out every one else from political or other billets so far as their power goes.",32
136,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Not so.,32
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"When the unions essay to control a man's view of politics, I call that nothing else but unionistic tyranny. I have yet to learn that tyranny exercised by a trade union is any more or less tyranny than when exercised by any other individual or body. We here stand, not against trade unionism, but for trade unionism, stripped of all those excrescences which, in the long run, will not help the unions or give better conditions and wages. We would treat trade unionism as part of the great institutions of the country, and not as an organization for developing class feeling and disseminating hatred in the community. We would not use it as a means of separating men into a caste which declines to recognise any persons outside as having any privileges whatever.",32
138,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The Act does that.,32
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"If , more does the Attorney-General want?",32
140,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I mean to say that it gives preference to the unionists.,32
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What the original Act says to the unionist is, "" You claim certain privileges, and you shall have them; but remember always that your privileges must be the measure of your, responsibilities; so long as you comply witli the obligations imposed on you, and which are deemed by Parliament to be right in the interests of society as a whole, those privileges may be yours, because then they are privileges which do not contravene the equal right of others to similar privileges.""",32
142,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,What greater safeguard could we have for the welfare of society? Is not the unionist and the non-unionist both included in the term?,32
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"That is only ; the placard which the Attorney-General It is places over this proposal. Perhaps I ought not to use those terms, seeing that this morning the proposal is very mucli modified, and much fairer than that originally contained in the Bill. The original clause sought to ostracize men who dared to vote for any candidate but the man who happened to be able for the time being toworm his way into the good graces of an organization and get selected. That is a denial' of liberty, and, in its essence, the worse kind of tyranny. I never in my life would have anything to do with a proposal of thekind. It is a poor look out when the organizations desire, not only to think for men unionistically and industrially, but also to think for them politically in relation to all the .issues which come before Parliament, and which make up the social"" and industrial life of the community. I ' believe in doing my own thinking, and inpreserving the right of every individual intrade unions or outside of them to also do their own thinking. I am against the kind of regimentation aimed at in the Bill, and I welcome the change which has comeover the Government since we last discussed the matter. Witli certain safeguards-which , I hope, we may imposelater-o n some such lines as laid down in the Act, I do not find very much fault with the proposal now submitted, except that I cannot, and never could, understand some of the language used. For instance, the clause provides that the Court may direct that: as between members of organizations of employers and other persons offering or desiringwhat service or employment . . . . s 0 That may not be technically a contradic. tion in terms, but it. is practically a contradiction. How absurd it is to say that an organization of employers should be desiring "" service or employment,"" and so be entitled to preference. I suppose that this language is simply intended to make people believe that we are giving the same privileges to organizations of employers as we give to organizations of workmen, whereas, in practice-apar t altogether from legal terms-the words convey no such meaning and no such application. I should like to hear from one of the ex-members of the Arbitration Court precisely when this class of provision was ever put into operation.",32
144,Mr R ILEV,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,J t has never operated.,33
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"It is merely redundancy, meaning nothing ; but it has a good sound, like the other phrases used, such as '''welfare of society,"" ""fair and right,"" and ""social justice."" All these phrases are plentifully besprinkled throughout the measure,"" and are only so much "" tripe"" trailed across the pages. I marvel at the people outside submitting to be bumbugged in this way.. Then, again, the wording of the proposal is very awkward. We readWhenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention and settlement of an industrial dispute or for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society, to direct that preference shall be given, the Court shall so direct. What does that mean? First of all, we are told that the Court may direct that preference shall be given, and then that the Court shall so direct. - Mr SPENCE - If , in the. opinion! of the Court, it is necessary to do so.'",33
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"But the clause goes 'further, and . says that' the Court shall direct after enacting that it may direct. That seems to be meaningless tion that they could interpret. language, intended to throw dust eyes of the House.",33
147,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,It is not intended for that.,33
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Then it seems that to have no meaning at all. . At first, thought the last sub-clause was taking very much wider .power than that of preceding sub-clause - Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",33
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Before the susSpeaking pension of the sitting, I was expressing the clared opinion that the Government ought not to cratic. ""chance it , "" as was said this morning by deal out justice the honourable member for Flinders, but ought 'to be more certain of its ground fore proceeding to deal with these very important matters. I went on to say that whichever way things went they brought political grist to the mill of the party opposite, because if the High Court decided - against these measures they went upon the platform and told the people how they were prevented by the High Court, as at present constituted, from giving them certain reforms. I pointed out that it was a very easy way to get political kudos by girding at the constitution of the High Court, in which respect I made a reference to some language used by the honourable member for Indi immediately after the recent elections. I find my recollection to be borne out by the quotation, which I have since obtained. T'he honourable member, speaking at Wodonga, is reported to have saidThe days for the obstruction of the High Court were past. "" The institutions were not in consonance with the democratic declarations of the people on 13th April, and the same people would, if necessary, be appealed to again to grant the power of wiping out the restrictions contained in the Constitution.  .in that? The honourable member suggested this morning that I proposed to abolish the High Court.",33
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I have already told the honourable member that I suggested - nothing of the kind. I said it was a very easy thing for the honourable member to get political kudos among his constituents by - girding at the High Court when his party found themselves baffled in carrying out their proposals. The honourable member, in that speech, said that the institution was not in consonance with the democratic declarations of the people on 13th April.  remedy-to give the High Court a constituWill the in the honourable member read that?",33
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I have read it once; but I do not want to do the honourable member an - injustice. .He .'also said the people would be appealed to to remove the restrictions contained in the I Constitution. I do not see the necessary a connection between that and the former the statement. The remedy which the honourable member put forward has nothing to do with the powers the High Court possesses. of the institution itself, he deby inference that it was undemo1 hbpe our Courts will never be democratic or aristocratic, but will always irrespective of which class people profess to come under. The Judges beare not there to have political colouring of any kind. The Government ought not to proceed with these proposals until they :sure of their ground. So far as I see, they .mean nothing for the workers, but they .may mean much for the political propations ganda which the party opposite pursue. on The Attorney-General this morning made ference. the astounding statement that preference to .unionists was necessary to settle one jpute in seven. Preference is not necessary to settle one dispute in seventy-seven. When granted it will have no practical plication to our settled industries, ihe operations of unionism are as wide as the industry itself. Preference cannot in those cases in any practical cr reasonable way, and the honourable member is drawing the long bow when he declares that it necessary for the purpose of settling those disputes. He went on to say that the last elections thousands upon thousands of people voted for the Labour party, and led the House to infer that all those voted for them were believers in preference to unionists. No more astounding statebecause ment has been made by any honourable memin ber. The honourable member and his Government received hundreds of thoumany sands of votes from people who do side, - aot believe at all in preference to unionists. The honourable member's in that have been offered, but I hope that .a ference that, inasmuch as they have been returned, it has been by the votes only of those who believe in preference to unionists is very wide of the mark. However, that can go. I only want make it clear that the Attorney-General, his argument this morning, never once touched the position of affairs as suggested by this amendment. He argued over again - the old question of preference to unionists. That is not in point at all. Nobody is objecting in this debate to preference - unionists. That was conceded years and, therefore, the honourable member arguing quite outside of what is before Chair, when he goes off into a long, rhetoribe cal statement about the achievements unionism and its advantages to the workers. Every word of that may be subscribed by every member in the House. The real question is whether preference to unionists ought to be granted without providing - conditions as will insure that it does develop into tyranny. We argue for preNew ference wisely conditioned, with, for stance, a reasonably open door to the imions, reasonable fees, no political cion, and, above all, the principle jority rule. So long as these conditions Mr Josefh Cook. apply to preference, no democratic man can are take much exception to it. We must have wise and prudent measures for the settlement of disputes, and where those condiare provided for, no man that I know this side objects to the granting of pre",33
152,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Hunter) [2.22] disI realise that the amendment is a great modification of the clause as drafted. I contended on the second reading, and still apcontend, that the clause does not go far where enough for me. The amendment, therefore, makes my position worse, but I quite applyrealize that, although I hold strong opinions on this question, I must be guided by the legal minds in this Chamber. is I have listened carefully throughout the all debate to the legal members who have at spoken, and I have come to the conclusion that there can be little doubt that the clause, as drafted, is unconstitutional. who Even the Attorney-General says that he was compelled to introduce the amendment he realized that the clause was not conformity with the Constitution, and would, therefore, be of no avail. Like other honourable members on this who believe in preference to unionists. I have to be guided by the legal opinions : the near future wider powers will be given to this Parliament under the Constitution. The honourable member for Indi was amply justified in making the remarks which the to honourable member for Parramatta has in quoted. He believed that the necessary reform should be brought about in a constitutional way. The Constitution provides a method of procedure for its own amendment, and the honourable member for Indi . wanted to follow that method. The clause, to as drafted, made the granting of preference ago, depend entirely on whether the Judge is granted a minimum wage. In that respect the it did not meet with what I think ought to incorporated in a measure dealing with of arbitration. The amendment leaves it optional with the Judge. That is what has to been contended for, to a large extent, by honourable members on the other side of the Chamber; but I hold quite a different such opinion. In 1901, when the Industrial not Arbitration Act was brought into force in South Wales, it contained practicallv in the same provision as the Attorney-General is making in this amendment, leaving it coeroptional to the Judge to grant or refuse of mapreference. We contended then, and always have contended, that, inasmuch as these industrial organizations are based on collective action by bargaining and so forth, the power that agitated for the Industrial Arbitration Act-thos e very collective bodies-ough t to be recognised and given preference, so as to keep intact the lirst principle of arbitration. Those who have been banded together for years, and have done the fighting to improve the condition of the workers,' should get the benefit under such measures as these, more especially when they give away, in the interests of the community, the only weapon which they have-the power to strike. They say, "" Give us this measure, and allow preference to unionists, and we shall be quite prepared to abandon the old method of strikes and locks-out between employers and employees."" Although we have been advocating that for years, we now find that because the Constitution does not give us sufficient power we are compelled to accept a provision which we objected to in 190T. I admit frankly that I am greatly disappointed. The proposal now before the Committee does not go far enough for me, but I realise that the Attorney-General has done right. He could not escape from the legal position that confronts him. I thought the honourable member for Flinders made the position exceedingly clear from a constitutional point of view, and I , as a layman, would not think of disputing his conclusion. We cannot get away from it, and that is why I support the Attorney-General's modified proposal, although I still believe that the whole question should depend on organizations being registered, and being industrial unions. What exception can be taken to industrial unions? Have they imposed any disabilities on employers, or in any way restricted them in the past? I think not. It has been frequently said during the debate that it is the political aspect of the question that is objected to. The honourable, member for Parramatta asked if the Newcastle miners had yet fallen into line. I told him that they had taken the necessary initial steps, and had decided to fall in with the Political Labour League. Whilst we have always stood aloof from politics, the very fact that the New South Wales Government has passed coercive legislation which has had the effect of putting men in gaol has compelled us to take the action that we have done. It is not the Labour side that is bringing in the political element. It is done by the other side refusing to give us justice. Ask men who have been dealing with industrial arbitration for years whether they think that preference to unionists does any injury. Let me remind honourable members that ra New South Wales there were no less than twenty-five industrial agreements registered under the late Arbitration Court. Those were mutually arrived at by both sides, and no less than twenty-three of them granted preference to unionists.' The employees themselves, by those agreements, granted the principle, and Judge Cohen; in the Bread-carters' award, and In othei cases, granted it also. If a man occupying his position as President of the Court thought it necessary and desirable to grant preference, there cannot be any great objection to it. Take the attitude of the employers themselves in the case of the Typographical Association. An agreement was entered into between that body and the daily papers, and the) , although they condemned preference to unionists in theiscolumns, granted it in that case. If the very people who have been brought into close touch with industrial unions have granted preference in twenty-three agreements out of twenty-five, and if the Judge of the Court has granted it in other cases., what great injury is going to befall this- country by including the principle in this measure? It will not work the injury that honourable members opposite predict. Do> they think that I , as a unionist, would go to an etaployer and say that a non-unionist whom he was employing must be dismissed ? That is the last thing of which any industrial unionist would be guilty. Whether he approved or disapproved of a non-unionist, he would have sufficient principle not to desire to oust any man from a billet. All that the unionists desire is that there shall be a recognition of industrial unionism as registered under the principal Act, so that inroads shall not be made on their organizations. Employers at times get rid of certain men who have taken a prominent part in industrial unionism, and unionists desire a provision such as this to guard ngainst such occurrences. I rose to say that, whilst I am prepared to accept the Attorney-General's amendment, believing that, having regard to the opinions expressed by legal gentlemen in the House,, he is compelled to make such a proposal,. I am not satisfied with the extent to which it goes. 1 hope that we shall be ablevery shortly to obtain an extended power in a constitutional way, and that we shall then be able to mete cut even-handed justiceto both employers and employees. Mr DEAKIN '(Ballarat) [2.32] - It would be unfair to detain the Committee - by repeating replies already made to almost all the contentions just urged by the honourable member for Hunter. l n the first place, preference is already on the statute-book. No one has sought to remove it. Consequently, mere arguments 0 for preference as such are as much #111 of date as a Queen Anne musket would be in modern warfare.",34
153,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Unde r the Act it is optional, not compulsory. - Mr DEAKIN - The honourable member stated the case for preference, which no one resists. The particular conditions under which it may be submitted are the only matters in dispute. Again, in New South Wales, certain Government action was laken as stated, but only long after a belligerent hostile course had been pursued by those opposed to the Administration, and by certain unions. But these questions are really beside the present issue. equally wide of the mark to suggest that the only interests to be considered against the granting of preference are those of employers. Those have their place, but the most vital interest to be considered is that of seekers for employment, who, being outside the unions, decline to take advantage of the opportunities afforded them of uniting with their fellows in unions for the achievement of their common trade purposes.' As they refuse that extremely potent aid, as they have every right to do, they stand a helpless class, most in need of the protection of the law, and of their rel low-citizens. Their claim has not been met, or sought to be met.",36
154,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,There is no objection to any one joining our unions.,36
155,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What has the Attorney General told us today on that very question? He declared that what made the unions was the fact that the men who joined them all shared a certain' political and economic faith. Those who did not share that faith, he said, could not be members in fact, although they might ' be in form. The power of the unions was assured only when they consisted of men who shared a common political faith ->",36
156,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Not political.,36
157,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"A common economic faith. Economic faith forms a large part of the political creed of all politicians, and seems to form the whole of the political faith of members opposite. The issues, as we put them, are: Preference?-yes ! Unionism ?-ye s i Encouragement to unionism besides preference ?-ye s ! For what purpose ? For the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. For organizations uncler the Act the one essential is that they shall be industrial bodies pure and simple. That does not exhaust the freedom of their constituents. From the president to the youngest member, each remains free to belong to any political organization that he prefers. They are free to take whatever action they think right for the protection of their own interests or those of the country, as members of any political league, seeking to alter political conditions. What we believe will be demonstrated is that for the successful settlement of industrial disputes or their prevention, we must deal with these industrial questions only on industrial grounds. To mix them with political questions is bad for politics and bad for the industrial system. Our citizens have their religious organizations, accomI t is plishing an incomparable and indispensable work; but we know what follows from mixing religious questions with practical politics in a contested field.",36
158,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,That is a very different thing.,36
159,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Not different in its effects. If we blend two great forces of human nature in this fashion in public affairs, the combination requires to be carefully stuclied, because sacrifices are probably made in both which may be grave, and even fatal. What can be urged against so reasonable ancl simple a proposal as ours ? We concede all that is asked in the way of 'bond fide preference, provided that it be on fair lines, and be confined to industrial affairs. The honourable member for Hunter repeated the familiar fallacy that, The unionists having given up tiieir only weapon-the power to strike-wha t do you offer them instead?"" Ignoring other - answers already given, I reply that they do not need anything over and above their votes. By those votes they are in possession of both Houses of Parliament, and enjoy absolute authority over both its legislation and administration..",36

161,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Wit h the same majorities as they secured at the last general election they can amend the Constitution.,36
162,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,We shall do lime.,37
163,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"If the Labour party can retain the majority they secured at the recent general election, then the Constitution will be no real obstacle in their path. What do they require more than absolute control over the Parliament, the law making, and the administration of this country? Do men in power need to ask tor additional weapons ? Who needs them ? Not a triumphant majority controlling all government, legislation, and administration ; but we on the Opposition side of the House. We are content, however, to rely upon the weapons that can be employed equally well by my honourable friends opposite, that are used daily in every department of municipal and national life. We rely on experience and argument, upon a general study of the lessons which the world's affairs, and our own, have taught us, and upon reasonable mutual concessions in the public interest. That is all we have left with which to pierce the impenetrable phalanx, in an impregnable position before us. Let me now return once more to the embellishments by the Attorney-General. They are not to be treated as mere ornamentation, although in practical effect, they are no more. What is proposed under sub-clause 2 is to give the power necessary for the prevention or settlement of an industrial dispute. are the terms of the Constitution; nothing more can or need be added to them. They, are in the sub-clause. But the Ministerial party are not satisfied with getting all that can be given under the Constitution. Having got that they introduce here "" the maintenance of industrial peace,"" and "" the welfare of society."" There is no constitutional provision behind those phrases. - What, if anything, is behind it? It is an invitation to the President of the Court, not only to set aside the ordinary rules of evidence, and to inform himself as he pleases; not only to take advantage of this altogether unexampled liberty, which the principal Act confers upon him, but to do something more. You seek to push him into a field in which the whole of his legal knowledge can exercise but an inconsiderable influence upon his mind. He is left purely to his own individual lay judgment to - determine: what is best for the maintenance of industrial peace and the welfare of society. Honourable members will see that words so general, so indefinite as these, must derive their interpretation enso in tirely from the character and experience of the particular man on the Bench. Consequently, the very foundation of all future consistency-that the precedents established by one Judge shall be followed by and become binding upon others-canno t be secured. The precedents under this provision, so far as they are created, will not be true precedents. We shall pass from one set of decisions to another, whenever we have a new President of the Court. Long may the present occupant of the office remain. The decisions given under such provisions can only be individual judgments on individual questions. They will do little to build up that settled system of interpretation and action which is just as necessary when dealing with industrial as with legal disputes.",37
164,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"We admit that. . Mr DEAKIN - I think this involves a grave and unnecessary risk. There is only one other question. My honourable friends opposite are aware that the crux with which we are confronted is the dangers arising out of the too intimate association of political with industrial action and aims. Every member on the other side is a unionist. That is a title of honour, and I apply it in no other sense. They belong to organized trade unions, and bring into this Parliament just that mixture of industrialism with politics, Those and confusion of political with industrial objects that is certain to become prejudicial to both. In our politics in this country we must face industrial questions. There is no reason why we should shrink from the exercise of any legislative or judicial power that will enable us to diminish the many problems that modern life presents. But to do so by a half-and-half allegiance on one side to the union, with its industrial obligation, and on the other to the political party with its wider principles, is to run grave risks of failing to serve both as they ought to be served in the public interest. In addition, members of the Labour party bring into politics with their caucus an exercise of trade union authority that they have been accustomed to exercise. What is the result? Our Labour members have imported their union into Parliament. They keep apart from their fellow members of Parliament, refusing to discuss measures upon their merits. With the exception of the last speaker and one other, none of them has given us the advantage of his criticisms of the Ministerial proposals. We are unaware of the reasons which have induced them to support and to modify Government measures. None of them has assisted us in the interchange of views which is necessary for a proper understanding of their true purpose  party did the same thing last session.",37
165,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"VV e had no power, and no desire to bind our members. That was shown by the fact that half-a-dozen of our prominent supporters fought us determinedly in the House and in the country in regard to one of the principal measures brought forward. Had anything like such action been taken by any member of the Labour party he would have been instantly expelled from the party.  p.irty acted in regard to the naval loan proposal and the financial agreement just as the honourable member says the Labour party have now acted.",38
166,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"There is just sufficient tinge of truth in that statement to give it colour, ancl no more. The fact is quite other than the honourable member seeks to make it appear. Parliament is denied the benefit of the opinions of 'the members of the Labour party regarding the Government programme. Many of them must hold views which we are entitled to know. Every one heard the opinions of our dissentients, and saw their votes. If a majority of the members of an ordinary trade union dealt with its affairs without reference to their comrades, that union would soon cease to exist, and Parliament, as we have known it, will cease to exist if this practice of the Labour party continues to be followed. On that side we have the Government and its supporters giving us no information of their real views of the proposals brought before the House, even if afterwards amended. On the other side, members have to consider measures as best we can with the imperfect information supplied to us. If honourable members considered the consequences of these methods of political action they would realise that such a series of departures from precedent as we are now witnessing, some minor and some major, must steadily transform our industrial ancl social system. There are many reforms desirable; but can we achieve them by ignoring criticism and co-operation, and the establishment of a better understanding? For thousands of years society has achieved its successes by constant differentiations, die application of particular powers to particular purposes, and by a judicious distribution of its strength. That has obviously happened in the economic sphere. How to maintain this freedom of development, how to promote originality and inFusion vention in every branch of industry, and also in the perfection of our political powers, constitutes one of the greatest problems of federalism. No one can forecast the result of our new practice of grafting one system upon another, producing a cross breed.",38
167,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,-Goo d will come of it.,38

This will affect thousands cf agriculturists, and I am glad that the Attorney General will give me the opportunity to move the amendment.",38
170,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Darling) [2.53] - There are always those who are afraid to trust the people, ancl the. speeches of the Leader of the Opposition ancl the honourable member for Parramatta were as conservative as any that could fall from the most crusted Tory.",38
171,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"If the honourable member is ready to trust the people, why does he try to control their politics? ' Mr SPENCE - We are not trying to do so, but we wish to prevent any obstacle being placed in the way of their political development. Reforms have been won only by great effort, sacrifice, and suffering. We know what a fight took place to secure adult suffrage. It was thought that it would give the community the power of self-government; but the honourable members to whom I refer wish to hinder the citizens from governing themselves. Their attitude to the trade unions is truly a Tory attitude. They may do certain things, but nothing which is not prescribed. They say to the trade unions, "" You, like children, cannot be trusted to manage your own affairs. We are willing that you shoulJ clo certain things, but you must not do other things."" The Act of 1904 restrains the political acts of unions. The honourable member for Parramatta. who objects to the advance of unionism, forgets that in the old days trade unions meddled in politics. Did not the miners seek for legislation for the protection of their industries? And was not that action considered legitimate? Who is the honourable member, and who are we. that these restrictions should be proposed in a Democracy? Honourable members opposite wish to say to the trade unions, "" Thus far shalt thou go and no further."" The honourable member for Parramatta thinks that they are going astray. Why did he not remain a trade unionist, and prevent that? I should be glad if he would join the union of which T am a member, and show it what it should not do. We are looking for members who will put us on the right track. We know that there are those who say that they believe in trade unionism so long as there are no strikes, but in the past it has been impossible to obtain concessions from employers without being able to threaten them with strikes. The trade unions have the right to say what action they will take to improve their position, which means, to improve the. position of the people at large. Politics is summed up in the terms economic and industrial conditions. If honourable members concede the point that the unions can do what is necessary to improve their economic and industrial conditions, they concede everything. The Opposition wishes to restrict their freedom in this matter, and to interfere with their privileges - The Labour movement has been gaining strength in spite of the Act of 1904. You cannot prevent a free people possessing adult suffrage from developing politically. That must be realized. There are unions which have been in existence for fifty years. Altogether n o unions were affiliated with the Trades Hall in Melbourne, and there are unions all over Australia, but the honourable member for Parramatta could mention only one which charged a restrictive entrance fee, and on the other hand, he spoke of unions whose doors were open to all. I could instance several unions, such as the Australian Miners' Association, which not only raise no trouble about men joining, but if a man, when he starts work, is unable to pay the entrance fee, will advance it to him, so as to make him free of the benefits in case of accidents and so forth. What sense, therefore, is there in seeking to influence people by quoting only one odd case? Further, nothing has been so frequent at conferences than for employers to suggest that the unions should place more restriction on their membership, so as to secure that only competent men shall join-; but, of course, it has been pointed out to the employers that such a step is impossible under the law, and that, under the circumstances, they have the remedy in their own hands, for they can always dismiss a man who is not able to do his allotted work.",38
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,We are now hearing the great champion of the employers !,39
173,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I am stating facts, which are worth tons of the fiction given us by the honourable member for Parramatta. The Act itself provides that there shall be no restrictions on joining a union; and surely that ought to be enough for honourable members opposite. As to the. insinuation that the desire is merely to get men into unions for political purposes, what sort of opinion of their fellow-creatures have honourable members who are opposing this Bill ? Do they think that, when a man joins a union, he completely changes his political opinions, and, like a savage, merely follows his chief? When a man joins a union he is not asked his political opinions, but, being a sensible person, he usually votes Labour. The secret of the opposition to this Bill has been let. out by the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Ballarat, who declare that it is purely for political reasons, they being afraid that these unions may become stronger, and thus add to the number of parliamentary Labour representatives. As a matter of fact, however, many trade unions stand outside the Labour movement, while others assist because they regard it as the way to secure better conditions by peaceful and constitutional methods. Whether the original section be retained or not will make no difference to the Labour movement.",39
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Franklin) [3.5] I object to preference of any kind; and it seems strange to find the Labour party putting forth such a proposal in Australia, where we have started free of the privileges of the Old World, and opened the way for all to attain success by their own individual effort-wher e every man is free from every disability of class, creed, or position. Honourable members opposite admit that they are practically all unionists and nominees of unionists, and yet they seek, by legislative enactment, to give themselves preference over the rest of the community. It is well for us sometimes to think what such concessions and privileges mean. From the earliest ages, the whole progress of civilization has been one long fight against privilege. Throughout our history there has ever been a privileged class in every country of the Old World; but, as I say, we in Australia had freed ourselves",39
175,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I wish we had.,40
176,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"We are free of any privileged class, but the honourable member who interjects is joining with his party in an effort to create a class, the one object of which is to obtain a privileged position for themselves. I have no tion to detain the Committee at any great length, because I understand that some arrangement has been arrived at to close the discussion this afternoon in time for the Inter-State trains. I think that such an arrangement is a great mistake, because, when we are discussing important measures such as this, we should not be hampered, but should have sufficient time for ample consideration. However, if an arrangement has been made between the two parties, I shall do nothing on my part to break it. It is sought to bring under this measure the whole of the agricultural labourers of Australia, but I am convinced that such a law must either prove unworkable, or inflict exceedingly great hardship. I listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for South Sydney, because I know that, from his position, he is intimately acquainted with the subject; but I was sorry to hear him speak of agricultural labourers as he did-me n working in rags till they fell off the wearers - I have represented agricultural constituencies during the whole of my political life in the State and Federal Parliaments, and have seen much of the rural districts of Australia. I do not know Sydney very well; but I may tell the honourable member for South Sydney that he may see more rags and wretchedness in one dayin his own electorate than he could find in any agricultural district in the Commonwealth in twelve months.",40
177,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I do not go out looking for rags !,40
178,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Unfortunately, the rags do not need looking for-the y may be observed in the length of a tram ride.",40
179,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Does that not apply to all the capitals of the world ?,40
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"That being so, it does not quite lie in the mouth of a man who represents such a constituency to unfairly hold another class up to ridicule. I believe that the agricultural labourers of Australia, taking them as a whole",40
181,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Are the most sweated people in the country.,40
182,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I believe that, taken as a whole, the agricultural labourers are better off than are the unskilled labourers of the cities. A much larger percentage of agricultural labourers, by their industry, make homes of their own, and become employers, than of any other class in the community. Let the honourable memintenber for South Sydney compare the number of such men in the country districts with the number who have been able to achieve similar successes in Alexandria, Botany, Surry Hills,' and other places in his own electorate. To return to the subject of preference, I repeat that, from the earliest dawn of civilization, there has ever been an attempt by those in power to secure privileges for themselves, and we have been successful in Australia in breaking that attempt down. Yet trade unionists, and the nominees of trade unionists, endeavour by legislative enactment to give themselves preference over any other class of the community. But they are going to fail. They have a majority now, and, as the matter was all settled upstairs long before the Bill appeared in this House, preference will doubtless be granted from one end of Australia to the other. But do those honourable members really think that they will succeed in their attempt to shackle and confine the individuality of the people of Australia? They cannot do so; at all periods of history the men who have made attempts of the kind have always failed. When these benches are full, I ask you, Mr. Chairman', to look down both sides, and see whether there is here the ability, strength of character; and justice of cause, to enable these men to do what the Cromwells and the Claverhouses of all countries have failed to do. '",40
183,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The honourable member is getting away from the subject.,40
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Not so; I am talking of an attempt to create a privileged class, and pointing to the lessons which history teaches. In some cases tyrants have succeeded in winning privileges for themselves, but history records their failure. And the Australian Labour party, composed as they are of nominees of trade unions, will meet with failure, just as failure has always followed such efforts. Instead of this being a humanitarian movement, any Parliament or any union that will say to another man, "" You must join this union or starve; if you do not join, even against your will, you will be hounded from district to district, and will get no employment to enable you to keep yourself and wife and family,"" is doing something which is absolutely brutal, and no sooner will that brutality be put into operation than it will react upon those who have created it. It will take the people very long to discover what an absolute fraud this so-called humanitarian proposal is. They will soon see that this coercive legislation has been pushed through by men who have lost their own freedom and shackled their own consciences by signing a pledge and going into a caucus which binds them to carry out in public what is decided - upon in private, whether they agree to it or not. Those are the men who are trying to place shackles on the workers of Australia, and to drive them into the unions against their will. people will soon realise the cant and hypocrisy of those who are promulgating such a measure, and the pendulum will swing back as soon as this clause is put into operation.",40
185,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Angas) [3.17] - The clause as proposed to be amended is undoubtedly an improvement on its original form, because it will, to a large extent, be constitutional, whereas it is almost certain in the light of the decision of the High Court in the Trolley and Draymen's Union case, reported in the second Commonwealth Law Reports, that the original clause would be idtra vires as an attempt by the Legislature to coerce the judgment of the Arbitration Court. In that judgment, the High Court said that no Court could possibly give directions to, or interfere with, the discretion of the High Court, and similarly it was pointed out that the Court was a tribunal, and not a Board of Trade or any other body capable of exercising legislative functions. It was not a minor legislative body, in short, and therefore could not take directions from the Legislature. Undoubtedly, to a large extent, the present proposal will be constitutional, because it is doubtful whether the Court would not have the power to give preference if the demand were made, even if we never put it in the Bill or the Act. The power would probably be regarded as ancillary to the settlement of the dispute. Unfortunately, the Attorney General, in his anxiety to pretend to make this compulsory, whereas, in reality, it has to be made discretionary for constitutional purposes, has left in the word "" shall "" at the end of the sub-clause. At the beginning he has vested a discretion in the Court by using the words "" In the discretion of the Court."" The clause is now discretionary with the pretence of being compulsory. You cannot give a mandate to a Judge to do a thing which in the earlier portion of the clause is left absolutely to not his discretion, or in accordance with his opinion. The constitutionality of the subclause probably stops at the word "" dispute,"" in the second line of it. The words up to "" dispute "" are in terms of the constitutional power given by section 51 of the Constitution. What comes after is not in terms of the constitutional power, but is to some extent in accordance with powers which we are taking in this Bill in the definition clause, and which may not be within the power given by the Constitution. Honourable members will notice that in the definition clause an industrial The matter is to include a question affecting the interests of society at large. Under this sub-clause preference may be granted when such a question is raised-in other words, when the dispute arising out of an industrial matter is a dispute affecting the general interests of society rather than something connected with the particular trade itself. We may possibly read all the words after the word "" dispute"" in the sub-clause as being a power to give preference under the widening of the definition to which I have just referred. That is intended to bring in cases where it is not a dispute in the ordinary sense, as the Act stands at present, but a dispute alleging that something would be advantageous, taking into consideration the general welfare of society. I do not think the Court will hold that such a question is the true question within the meaning of the Constitution, and if it does not, then those words are clearly unconstitutional or superfluous. At the same time, I do not believe they are likely to imperil the validity of the whole clause, because the Court will hold that they are clearly severed from the rest, and will knock them out. Last night we somewhat hurriedly passed a clause in which we used practically similar 'words. We gave the Court power in sub-clause 2 of clause 7, to include in its award any matter or thing which it thinks necessary or expedient, but which must be for the purpose of settling or preventing a dispute. The same words are brought in here, but they are not qualified by stating that it must be for the purpose of settling an industrial dispute. The Attorney-General mentioned that he had to knock out a good deal of section 40 of the Act of 1904, because it practically prevented preference to unionists being granted, one ground being that you could not have admission to an organization decided by a majority vote. I do not think that is so. The question has never been decided for the purposes of this Act. All that the Act says is, in section 61, that the rules must contain reasonable provision for the admission of members. You may make any conditions you like that are reasonable. You may declare that you must have a certain qualification of standing in the trade, that the applicant must be of certain character, and so on. So long as the Court considers those to be reasonable provisions, fhey can, under the Act, be made. You may say that if an applicant for admission does not comply with those declared conditions he must be admitted on the vote of the majority only. You thus preserve the power to decide ultimately on the vote of the majority, in case the reasonably - necessary conditions which are specifically declared are not complied with. Then it is mentioned that you are blocked because if your rules deal with political matters, and allow the application of the funds of the organization to political purposes, preference cannot be granted. But that only applies when it - is done by the "" rules or other binding decisions "" of the organization. "" Binding decision"" means something in the nature of a rule, and, as a matter of common law, it was decided about eighteen months ago in the Osborne case in England that trade unions cannot by rule provide for the application of their funds for such purposes.",41
186,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,That is under the common law.,42
187,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,But that is applicable here as the law of the Commonwealth.,42
188,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Not so far as it is superseded by statute law.,42
189,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"But it has not been superseded by statute law. In the States' sphere, at any rate, in their original organizations and as trade unions those bodies cannot put these things into their rules. As a matter of fact, they will have to leave it to a sort of understanding.",42
190,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,We have nothing to do in this Act with trade unions.,42
191,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Trad e unions cannot do these things, and equally, of course, organizations cannot do them, because both trade unions and organizations are prevented, the one by the words of the statute here, and the other by the common law. The Attorney-General contends that he is omitting that provision in the Act because it would block the application of the principle of preference. I say that it would not, because as a matter of fact these conditions would not be embodied in a rule of an organization. . The common law would prevent that. Under the principal Act industrial organizations cannot apply their funds to political purposes. Now that the clause has been apparently brought within the bounds of constitutionality, it seems a pity that the safeguards necessary in the interests of other than members of those organizations are not to be preserved. Amendment of the amendment (by Mr. SINCLAIR) agreed toThat in paragraph (a), after the word "" persons,"" the words "" not being sons or daughters of employers"" be inserted.",42
192,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Wentworth) [3.27] - I wish to test the question of whether unrestricted preference should be granted to unions, rather than the form of preference for which provision is made in the principal Act. I therefore move That the following words be added to the amendment as amended :""Provided always that before any preference to members of organizations is directed as aforesaid the President shall, by notification published in the Gazette and in such other publications, if any, as the Court directs, specifying the industry and the industrial matter in relation to which it is proposed to direct such preference, make known that all persons and organizations interested and desirous of being heard may, on or before a day named, appear or be represented before the Court; and the Court shall, in manner prescribed, hear all such persons and organizations so appearing or represented. And provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants. In any case in which the Court directs that preference shall be given it may subsequently suspend or qualify the direction for such time or subject to such conditions as it thinks fit if , in the opinion of the Court, the rules of the organization are burdensome or oppressive or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to or continuance in membership, or that the organization has acted unfairly or unjustly to any of its members in the matter of preference.""",42

I was asked by several may be disbursed for ordinary honourable members to do this, and I said I nnd extraordinary purposes ; would.",44
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I am not saymembers; ing that the honourable gentleman should not do it, but that this schedule should not addition to, the rules. be included in the Bill before we have an opportunity to consider it.",44
198,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The honourable member for Angas assured the Committee, and I thought he had satisfied his own colleagues, that what I am proposing is the right thing to do. These rules are taken from regulations for which the honourable gentleman was officially responsible.",44
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Is the. honourable member for Angas satisfied ?,44
200,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I am.,44
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The honourable gentleman knows everything. That settles it. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",45
202,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.50] - I move That the following new clause be inserted 6A. Section 27 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting therefrom the words, "" or by leave of the President."" Section 27 of the principal Act relates to the conditions under which the parties may be represented before the Court by counsel. If we strike cut the words, ""or by leave of the President,"" the part of the clause affected will readbut no party shall (except by consent of all the parties) be represented by counsel or solicitor.",45
203,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Wentworth) [3.53] - I do not think it is quite fair of the Attorney General to bring this matter on at present. I think he should give some notice of it. It will be conceded that we have done our best to keep our part of the compact to finish the measure this afternoon, but the proposed new clause is one of great importance. Honourable members concerned about the welfare of organizations are not concerned as to whether the men who represent them in the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration belong to this or that trade or profession, but as to whether they are to draw fees for appearing before the Court. It will be possible, under the proposed new clause, for a man who is not a lawyer to appear before the Court on behalf of a union and claim large fees for representing it. That would be just as oppressive to die union as if a lawyer did it. I wish to wipe out the system by which men are permitted to live upon organizations in this way.",45
204,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"The unions cannot have a man in the Court to represent them without paying him something. . Mr KELLY - If they are going to pay their representative in the Court, they might just as well employ a qualified workman. That is the whole thing in a nutshell. I think the Attorney-General will realise that the new clause is one which we should have some time to'consider, and, in the circumstances, I ask him to agree to postpone its consideration now, and, if necessary, move to recommit the Bill for the purpose of considering it on Tuesday next.",45
205,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,It cannot be held that the new clause is one of principle.,45
206,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Fawkner) [3 53] I hope the Attorney-General will concede what the honourable member for Wentworth has asked. The proposed new clause involves a very important question, which should be debated at some length. If we are to do what the Attorney-General apparently desires, and that is simplify the :- procedure of the Court, we should not allow any representative of the parties appearing before the Court to be paid for his services.",45
207,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,He could only appear by the consent of all parties.,45
208,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,My point is that no one should be able to earn money by appearing for - parties in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.,45
209,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Why not?,45
210,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"We have no wish to exclude the secretaries of unions, but we wish it to be clearly defined that no one shall be allowed to make a charge for appearing on behalf of the parties in this Court. I have had a good deal of experience, and I am satisfied that the only way in which it is possible to shorten law proceedings is to make it not worth the while of the persons appearing before the Court to prolong them. The Attorney-General might overcome the difficulty now by including in the proposed new clause a provision that no one appearing on behalf of the parties before the Court shall be paid.",45
211,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,We cannot legislate to regulate wages.,45
212,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"I think the question involved is one of principle. We should either exclude all persons making a charge for appearing in the Court or none. Why should we exclude trained advocates, and put in their place men who would very soon become trained, but who in the meantime would not understand the law, and would get everything boxed up, causing delay and entailing ten times the expense? If the Attorney-General desires to secure simplicity, and the easy and economical working of the Act, the best nourse to adopt is to allow no payment for services rendered in the Court. Then we should have the Court made pretty well what it ought to be, namely, a sort of glorified Wages Board. I think that that is what we all want to see brought about. I helieve that if the. Attorney-General would add that proposal to his amendment it would go through at once.",45
213,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.56] - I should be very glad to do that, only this is not a Bill in which it can be done. We are very careful about not going outside the Constitution.",45
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Parramatta) f.V57]-- Is glad to hear the Attorneywa General say that he had no objection to the suggestion being carried out. At the same time. I wish to mate it clear how far I go with the sentiment. I believe that if lawyers are to be excluded from the Court, all specially-paid laymen should likewise be excluded. I do not mean that the paid secretary to a union should be debarred from appearing in the High Court, because he is the man who above all others I should think would be usefbl to his union in the Court. If , however, it is intended to exclude lawyers, we must exclude "" Comrade Sutch, five guineas,"" as well as "" lawyers, twenty guineas."" Will the Attorney-General frame a provision to exclude the specially-feed lay lawyers as well as the legal lawyers? Perhaps if I move the insertion of the words "" or other specially-paid person"" after the word ""solicitor"" in the section, it will meet the case. I do not want to shut any official on either side out of the Court.",46
215,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What does the honourable member mean by the words "" specially paid "" ?",46
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"What I mean is that the official should not be paid anything in addition to his ordinary remuneration. If my suggestion is adopted it will make things equal and fair. Otherwise we shall be setting up a body of lay specialists who will be able to exact fees, stringing out cases, and who will become just as expert in the verbiage of Acts as are lawyers at present.",46
217,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,What the honourable member means is that a person who is not an official shall not be allowed to appear except by consent of both parties.,46
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Yes .,46
219,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I do not mind that.,46
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"We might adopt the words "" or other person who is not an official.""",46
221,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Will it satisfy the honourable member if we insert after the word that ""solicitor"" the words "" o r paid agent."" a lawyer?",46
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Yes , I think that that will meet the case. I move That the proposed new clause be amended by adding the words ""and by inserting after words ' counsel or solicitor' the words 'or agent.'""",46
223,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Balaclava) [4.0]. - I think it will make a farce of our legislation if we put in the amendment of the Attorney-General. At the present time trained men are allowed to appear before the Court, but we are asked to say that no lawyers shall be allowed to appear. If that provision is made, what will happen? We shall have a band of specialists, who will lay themselves out to do this class of business, and become a close corporation, exactly as patent agents have become. I remember the time when patent agents were outsiders, but by degrees they got legislation passed in their favour, and they now have a monopoly of the patent business. ,We are now asked to say that no lawyer and no person who is a paid agent shall be permitted to take part in proceedings before the Arbitration Court. If that provision is made what will happen? At the end of a year a present will be made to the secretary of a union, or the secretary of an association, or to his wife or children. Does any one expect me to believe that any person will agree to spend day after day in the Court for nothing? Honourable members may exclude certain persons if they like, but do not let them think that they will not be paid, because they will certainly be paid by some means or other.",46
224,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Hunter) [4.2] - I hope that the Attorney-General will not accept the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta, because, in my opinion, it would inflict a good deal of hardship in some cases. Under his own proposal lawyers will have the right to appear if both sides are willing, and probably in very many cases they will be willing. But if we adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta to exclude paid agents, some unions may find that the other side are not willing to have lawyers, and therefore they will be unable to conduct tlieir cases for the simple reason that their officers do not possess the necessary ability. On the other side, however, we may find an employer who, though not a lawyer, has had legal training, and he will be able to conduct the case against the union. :",46
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Would a man of sort conduct a case better than would,46
226,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"-Yes, I have some men in my mind's eye. For instance, I the know gentlemen in New South Wales who paid have had a legal training-wh o do not practice their profession-bu t represent certain companies. If any union gets into Court with such a company, one of these gentlemen will conduct the case for their side, while a small union which, perhaps, does not have a competent secretary, will not be able to properly conduct its case, with the result that it will suffer. I do not think there is much need for making an amendment of this kind, because, as the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out, parties would get round it by appointing some one to conduct their case, and afterwards giving hun a bonus for services rendered. I think that in the interests of the dignity of the Court, and the chance of getting the case put fairly on either side, it will be just as well for the Attorney-General to leave the amendment as it is printed. I think it will be a mistake on his part if he consents to the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta.",46
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Parramatta) [4.4] - I was really surprised to hear the honourable member for Hunter use the argument which he did just now. He is not averse apparently to the regularized lawyer appearing in a case, but he wants a way left open for a man who is not in the lawyers' union to appear. What he really wants to do is to encourage legal non- advocate. unionism. I am surprised at his conduct. He actually wants to provide that a man who is not in the lawyers' union shall appear before this Court. He does not object to ruling out the union man so long as he is permitted to get the non-union man in. Even if the amendment does result, as he says, in an honorarium being paid at the end of the year, it will have one good effect. I believe it will lead to the hearing of these cases being shortened. - We shall obtain rough, substantial justice infinitely quicker, if we have the officials of the union appearing before the Court rather than paid agents, who are not trained lawyers. I am unable to agree .with the honourable member's reasoning. We shall facilitate our object if, as far as possible, we can have the ordinary officials of the unions on both sides arguing the questions before the Court.",47
228,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"North Sydney) [4.7] - The proposal to exclude lawyers from the Court is mere fudge. It will be impossible to do without them. If we prohibit their appearance in the Court, we shall still have them behind the agents, and shall give employment to a new class of lawyers. We shall have trained agents, and get back to the very thing that we wish to avoid. We shall have appearing before the Court men who wiil desire to protract litigation, and the Court will have less hold upon them than it has upon the ordinary legal gentlemen. It would have been a good thing for Australia if the conduct of proceedings in our Land Courts had been restricted to lawyers instead of paid agents being allowed to appear, as is proposed in this amendment. I should prefer to allow the Act to remain as. it is, and to rely on professional agents, seeing that the Court has a better hold upon them than it would have upon an outside man. The proposed amendment will only give rise to a new order of men who will be interested in protracting litigation, and we shall have less guarantee of their not attempting to protract it than we should have if ordinary members of the legal profession were allowed to appear before the Court.",47
229,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Wentworth) [4.8] - I wish to advance one or two reasons against the arguments raised in opposition to the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta. The honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable member for North Sydney have both pointed out that if the amendment now suggested is carried it will bring into existence a new type of,47
230,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The unions will look after that.,47
231,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,I do not think that they will. I have seen already a new class of advocates appearing in Arbitration Courts. Have honourable members forgotten the bill of costs which Comrade Sutch sent to Comrade Fisher?,47
232,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Why such allusions now ?,47
233,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Because they are pertinent. In that bill of costs Comrade Sutch charged, I think, five guineas per day for appearing before the Court in connection with a certain dispute. Unions have availed themselves, it would seem, of a second-rate lawyer at second-rate fees to do work which ought .to be performed by their own people for no pa}'ment whatever. I recognise the difficulty pointed out by the honourable member for Balaclava with regard to the possibility of special payments being made by some circuitous methods. In making this change we ought to be thorough. We ought to make absolutely sure that very heavy penalties shall be imposed in respect of any one offering or accepting payment by circuitous methods for such mercenary services as we wish to exclude from the Arbitration Court.",47
234,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"On the strength of he arrangement that we made with the sition, I have made an appointment for certain hour.",48
235,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Honourable members canperience, not accuse me of trying to break that arwho rangement.",48
236,Mr HALL,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The honourable member departing from the spirit of it.,48
237,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"No ; in order to faciliappear tate business, I moved two amendments without discussion. When the arrangement to which reference has been made was enfied to practise? tered into, we had the Bill before us, but we did not anticipate that a lot of new clauses would be proposed.",48
238,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,The only new clause I proposed before this was that for which the honourable member asked.,48
239,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,And that new clause was not covered by the compact.,48
240,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"There was no objection to it. If this is the stage at which clauses may be proposed, I should like move one providing for the auditing of union funds by a qualified accountant.",48
241,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,There is nothing to pre vent the honourable member proposing addition of such a clause.,48
242,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Excep t that I do not wish to prevent honourable members catchforeshadowed ing their trains. In connection with this provision, we shall have to devise sonw special means of safeguarding the unions against extortion.",48
243,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,Can the honourable member make a suggestion?,48
244,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Does the honourable member expect me, on the spur of the moment, to propose an amendment to any contingency which men of nimble intellects like the Attorney-General might devise in order to draw costs from the unions? We cannot deal with such matter at a moment's notice. It is too reaching and important. If , in spite this amendment, men with legal experience and no practice still continue to cases and - to deplete the treasuries of the unions, the unionists will begin to regard themselves as having been tricked and frauded by this pretence at legislation their interest. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But they will have Comrade Fisher behind them.",48
245,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Comrad e Fisher was pealed to by Comrade Sutch, and not by the other comrades, who had to pay his costs. I am concerned not for Comrade Sutch, but for the brethren from whom got his fees. I wish to stop the ment of second-class fees to third-class Oppolawyers. The honourable member for a Hunter said that he knew many men connected with unions who had legal exbut were not practising. A man is trained and has qualified to practise a profession generally exercises his abiliis ties by doing so. Do I understand that the gentlemen referred to have qualified to before the New South Wales Courts, or that they are merely persons who have read a little law, but have not quali",48
246,Mr CANN,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,What about the colliery proprietors ?,48
247,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,My honourable friends opposite are always thinking of the employers. The honourable member for Darling urged us to vote for the Bill because the employers crave fbr it. I am considering the genuine and bond fide interests of new the members of the organizations which to we are compelling men to join. Are they to be forced to pay fees to second-rate unqualified lawyers? The Attorney-General would save time if he allowed us to discuss the. this provision next Tuesday.,48
248,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.18] - This amendment was by me during the second reading debate. When the honourable member for Wentworth spoke, I - said that I would, if he liked, insert the regulations ih the body of the law. I have listened to a volume ""of objections from both sides of the chamber against the employment of lawyers, but when I agree to prohibit the employment of lawyers in the Court, I am meet asked, ""What about the paid agent?"" When I agree to eliminate the paid agent, too, the cry is raised, "" What about the poor unionist?"" I am prepared, if hona orable members think it necessary, to enact farthat no lawyer and no paid agent shall be of allowed within 440 yards of the Court take these when a case is being tried.",48
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Swan) [4-20]. - I think that the matters coming before dethis Court are so important that it is unin wise to provide that the parties shall not employ lawyers to represent their cases. At the same time, I am conscious of the force of the objection that legal consideraaptions are often overburdened with professional technicalities. I suggest to the Attorney-General that the President himself may desire assistance from legally trained he men, and that, therefore, we should not payshut the door against them entirely.",48
250,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"Unde r the present law, both parties may, by agreement, employ lawyers.",49
251,Sir JOHN PORREST,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"But the President may desire legal assistance in in which one or other party is unwilling to employ a lawyer. The questions upon which he has to adjudicate are very intricate, and it might well happen that he would like to hear argument from counsel regarding points of law. I suggest that, instead of providing for the appearance of lawyers by leave of the President, we should provide that they may appear at the request of the President.'",49
252,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.22] - So long as we have a Constitution, questions of law will arise in connection with arbitration cases, and when that happens both parties must seek the assistance of lawyers.
