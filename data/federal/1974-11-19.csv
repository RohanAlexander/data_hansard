2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of eduundersigned cation expenses under Section 82 J of the Income Tax AssessThat ment Act from $400 to $ 150 is That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nonthe government or government; and particularly more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom availof able to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already for the overcrowded and understaffed. That the parents to benefit mostrelativelyfrom educational income tax deductions, the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and making an important financial contribution to Australian educauon over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, adopted as being more equitable for all parents with chilTo dren at school. To compensate for the losses proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray Wales that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled Franchise should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits ranted additional to parents, at least at the 1973-74 taxation deductions or through taxation rebates.

The humble petition of the citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: we strongly oppose the Family Law Bill in its present $50 below the 1956-57 figure. form. That we believe that the Government has no mandate for radical changes in the Bill, and that there is no obvious on parents with demand for them. That the Bill in its present form will diminish the stability society and will lead to a society that regards marriage as a temporary association and not a permanent union where children are reared in the love and security of the family. That we regard the concept of matrimonial fault necessary justification of divorce, and for a fair decision on the custody and maintenance of the children. Therefore we deplore its exclusion from the Bill. in the past and even more in That none of the foregoing is acceptable to us.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nicholls. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That they are deeply concerned that the Family Law Bill will undermine rather than buttress the stability of marby riage and consequently undermine the stability of Australian society. (2) That Clause 26 of the Bill will enable the unilateral termination of marriage in such a manner as to render the State powerless to act in any which will obviously undermine the stability of marriages of the very young and marriages which have not endured for at least 2 years, and (3) That Clause S1 will weaken the position of a rejected wife.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the ComHonourable monwealth respectfully showeth: That we support the concept of no fault divorce in the the real value Family Law Bill because: (1) Marriage is not merely a contract it is a relationship. (2) That if a party withdraws from that relationship for whatever reason there is no good to be achieved by insisting on a continuance of a contractural shell.

3,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Health, Dr Doug Everingham, who left Australia on 16 November to lead the Australian delegation to the 4th Commonwealth Medical Conference in Sri Lanka, will be returning on 2 December. In his absence the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, Dr Moss Cass, will act as Minister for Health. (3) provide for a longer period NA NA",19
4,Mr MACPHEE,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,"Has the Minister for Manufacturing Industiy been acquainted with the serious situation obtaining in the flat glass indushumble try? By that I mean and include the manufacture of float glass, sheet glass and the processing of national health scheme is not free than the safety glass. Does the Minister realise that 550 people have been or will have been dismissed because of the closure of plants? Is it a fact that representatives of the company involved, namely, Pilkington ACI Ltd, has made representations to the Minister to explain the seriousness of the problem? Does the Minister realise that early in the new year virtually all oftheflatglass industry in Austraha will have been closed down? Is he oblivious of the cumulative effects on the company, its people and the people dependent on the services of the company? Is the Minister aware that a major contributing factor to this sorry state is imports which have been arriving at approximately double the rate oflast year and are now taking up SO per cent of the market which, because of the Government's economic and fiscal pohcies, is sadly diminished? What is the Minister doing to urge acceptance of the company's proposals for assistance, bearing in mind that a high proportion of the imported glass is coming from so-called less developed countries?",19
5,Mr SPEAKER,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,Order! Will the honourable member ask his question.,20
6,Mr MACPHEE,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,There are a number of matincrease ters raised and the Minister is familiar with the problem. I would like an indication of his attication tude to the company's problems.,20
7,Mr ENDERBY,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,"I am aware of certain dement cisions taken by the company in recent times indeed I have had a number of discussions with senior officers of the company, the most recent those discussions having taken week. A number of allegations has been made concerning the situation as it relates to the company. For example, one allegation is that diflicultyflowsin large measure from the import competition referred to by the honourable ber. It has been suggested that the company is itself partly responsible for that import petition, either because of its associations with overseas exporters or in other ways. That matter has been the subject of discussion with officers the company. I should add that import competition is times put forward to suggest that, in large measure, unemployment as it exists in Australia today flows from it. The most recent figures available to me negate-rebut-that suggestion. The last figures I have seen- I beheve I am rect in saying that they go to the end of OctoberHouse suggest that the amount of unemployment of the attributable to import competition is certainly less than 10 per cent and is in the area of 7 cent of the total. If that is correct situation where unemployment is part of a cyclical downturn and the decisions of companies like Pilkington ACI to retrench a number of their employees and to suspend operations are in large measure related to the cyclical business downturn which exists in Australia at the moment. As the honourable member knows, the Government has taken a number of very active and imaginative steps in recent times to stop that cyclical business downturn. I refer to the Budget and the Government's monetary poUcies and fiscal policies. A time lag is involved but it is confidently expected that these steps will be very successful. Many of the decisions taken by PUkington ACI relate to the situation in the motor vehicle industry and the building industry. That is as far as I can go, but I will be happy to give the honourable member any additional information he seeks. AMPOL PETROLEUM LTD: OIL PRICE",20
8,Mr KEATING,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,"I direct my question to the Minister for Minerals and Energy and refer to the outrageous application by Ampol Petroleum Ltd to the Prices Justification Tribunal for an in the price of Australian crude oil from $2.23 a barrel to $6.38 a barrel. Was the applia breach of the agreement made between a former Australian government, the governled by Mr John Gorton, and the Bass Strait and and Barrow Island producers? WUl the Minister explain why a regulation was gazetted to exclude of the matter from investigation by the Prices Jusplace only last tification Tribunal?",20
9,Mr CONNOR,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,"The position is that had the the application been successful-and I make no speculation on that score-it would have been a memgolden handshake of $668m a year from the Australian motorist to the Ampol and other procomducing compames. Ampol is a company which merely had a one-seventh interest in the Barrow Island operation and was not supported by either of of its 3 co-partners-Shell , Cal-Asiatic and Texaco which each have a two-sevenths interest and which, moreover, knew nothing of the applisomecation. In 1968 the then Government announced an indigenous crude policy which still continues in force. That poUcy gave Australian producers an assured domestic market for 10 years commencing from 1970. The price was fixed up to corSeptember of next year. I might remind the that no less a personage than the Leader Country Party is on record in respect of the former Prime Minister as supporting his policy per and saying it was fixed, permanent, and would one gets to the not be changed.",20
10,Mr ANTHONY,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,But you were against it.,20
11,Mr CONNOR,FLAT GLASS INDUSTRY,"Yes. But a good man and a big man is prepared to admit his mistakes. The appUcation to the Prices Justification Tribunal is in respect to a matter of about 5,000 barrels a day. The total production from WAPET on Barrow Island is 40,000 barrels. Production from Bass Strait is approximately 400,000 barrels. I repeat that we consider the price to befixeduntil September 1975. There is no country in the world more dependent on motor transport than Australia. There is no country in the world where an increase in price wiU have a more drastic and dramatic effect. For that reason we intend to keep the price as low as we possibly can as an offset to the ever-escalating price of imported crude. NA",21
12,Mr ADERMANN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I preface my question to the Prime Minister by noting that in Queensland over the weekend the Prime Minister has been confidently proclaiming to us in reference to inflation and unemployment that we wiU have turned the corner by the middle of next year. I ask the Prime Minister: Is this the same corner as he said we had turned during the election campaign of April and May of this year-becaus e that was a disastrous turning-and , on turning this elusive corner which is still in the future, we now have any confidence that we shall arrive at a different and happier destination?",21
13,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Statistics at home and Western abroad have deteriorated unexpectedly in the last few weeks. I am satisfied that the I announced in Parliament a week ago can give us confidence that the position wiU be improved well before the middle of next year. It would very much easier to be confident ofit if the 4 LibNo eral and Country Party States which have said that they wiU oppose wage indexation in the I Arbitration Commission were in fact to cofication' operate with the Australian Government and tirely with employee organisations, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional AssociThe ations and the Council of Commonwealth PubUc ate'. Service Organisations, in obtaining that very great improvement in our wage-fixing structures. The only government which completely supports indexation in any respect is the outgoing Queensland Government which supports discussed indexation for members of Parliament and Minthe isters of the Crown; it opposes it for people dinary awards. I have yet to hear any response from any Liberal or Country Party Premier the Australian Government's proposal to ask Arbitration Commission to take into account very substantial income tax reductions which the Australian Government is making and which should compensate for any increases in prices in the consumer price index in the current quarter. NA",21
14,Mr COLLARD,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"Has the attention of the Minister for Minerals and Energy been attracted to an article in the 'Kalgoorlie Miner' of 4 November in which Senator Durack accuses the Minister of ignoring Western Mining Company with respect to the development of the uranium deposit at YeeUrrie in Western Australia? Is not the article simply another deliberate falsification of the actual situation? Is it not correct that frank and useful discussions have taken place between the Minister and a representative of the Western Mining Company? Finally, is it not correct also that as a result of those discussions the way is now open to arrive at an arrangement for the development of the deposits which wiU be beneficial to everyone concerned, including the people of Australia?",21
15,Mr CONNOR,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"The statement made by Senator Durack is in fact a falsification. I repeat, it is a falsification. Worse than that, it is deliberate falsification. Having put back the development of uranium for 6 months by his activities in the can Senate, the honourable senator now chooses to apply his doubtful talents in another field. In point of fact there will be no discrimination whatever between the Northern Territory and Australia. Some 12 months ago I contacted a representative of Western Mining Comsteps which pany with regard to the YeeUrrie",21
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"I rise on a point of be order, Mr Speaker. Standing order 75 states: Member may use offensive words against either House of the Parliament or any Member thereof . . . would suggest that the words 'a deliberate falsiused by the Minister are not only eninaccurate but also designedly inaccurate.",21
17,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,The point of order is valid. Minister must withdraw the word 'deliber,21
18,Mr CONNOR,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"Sir, I withdraw the word. The YeeUrrie deposit contains 50,000 short tons of uranium oxide. Some 12 months ago I contacted a representative of Western Mining Corporation, the position with him and suggested Corporation would be well advised to wait on orfor the market to mature. Some 2 months ago I was again in contact with a representative of the to same company-it has the advantage of being a the well managed and overwhelmingly Australian the corporation-and suggested that we might have a look at the matter further. I met a representative of that company last week. We compared notes as to the Corporation's plarming and development and we have arranged for appropriate co-ordination. It is of the utmost importance to Austraha that that 50,000 short tons of uranium oxide be available. It is available of course, under the laws of Western Austraha, but we are interested in ensuring that it is released at the proper time and at the proper price. There would be no one in this House who would gainsay me when I assert that we have shown ourselves as a government capable of getting a proper price for mineral exports. We will get the exact planning of this company and we will closely co-ordinate with the company. We are interested in co-operation and development and it will be carried out with a good Austrahan company and in the best interests of Austraha. INFLATION: OVERSEAS INFLUENCE",21
19,Mr SNEDDEN,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"I ask the Treasurer Is it not true that Australia's inflation rate has accelerated faster than that of any other country of the Organisation for Economic Coinsulated operation and Development? Is it not true that the Australia's unemployment rate is now double our long term average as compared to the WestAustralia's ern countries and northern American countries, where it is marginally above the long term rate? Is it not true that Australia has been insulated product. more than any other economy from the effects of the world energy crisis? WUl the Treasurer make a detaUed statement showing precisely how world economic conditions have affected or are expected to affect Australian economic conPrices ditions? In doing so, wiU he there has been no major injection of overseas . . . . Uquidity into Australia for 2 years, that there has the been no general coUapse of Australian exports of private and that the Government itself claims that capital import prices have not made a major contribumaintain tion to inflation in this country? How then can overseas conditions have influenced our domsearch estic crisis?",22
20,Mr CREAN,WESTERN MINING COMPANY,"The right honourable gentleto man's words are more a series of affirmations than a question. He asked specificaUy about the rate of inflation in Australia relative to some most OECD countries. The Australian rate is lower than that of some of these countries and higher than that of others. The right honourable gentleman is mterjecting. He has asked a tion and I am giving an answer, if he wants it. The rate of inflation is higher in Japan, which an OECD country, than it is here, and it is lower in the United States than it is here. The right honourable member referred to unemployment. Again, unemployment is higher in Australia than in some places and lower than in others. For instance, unemployment in countries with which the honourable member hkes to compare us at times, such as the United States and Canada, is significantly higher than it is in Australia. I believe that the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment in Australia are higher than any of us would Uke, but I think it is about time we stopped trying to score off each other about the unfortunate circumstances and began to look closely at the reasons for them. I have endeavoured in recenttimesto try to indicate that unless employer and employee groups can get together in some sort of trustful co-operation in relation to the problems I think we are likely stiU to finish up in the wrangle that because of price rises increased wage demands are sought and when increased wages demands are conceded this becomes an excuse for further price rises. The two are intertwined, and the sooner we acknowledge it the better. The right honourable major member asked whether Australia is more than most countries from the effects of energy crisis. It is true that we are, but nevertheless, as my colleague has pointed out, imported oil bill is some $600m more than it might have been. This surely must make some difference to relative shares of the gross NA",22
21,Mr ANTHONY,OIL SEARCH,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls writing to the Chairman of the Justification Tribunal on 12 November in bear in mind that these terms: the Tribunal should give parucular attention to problems of sustaining and stimulating an adequate level investment and of maintaining rates of return on which will induce the new investment required to economic growth and employment. Is the Prime Minister aware of the fact that the for new oU deposits in Australia has virtually come to a halt because of the low return to Australian producers in comparison with return producers in other countries, and because of the withdrawal by the Government of oU search incentives? I ask the Prime Minister whether it or might not be in the interests of the Australian people, who are already paying nearly $ 1,000m a year for imported fuel, to adopt the policy of the Opposition Parties, which is that oil pricing quespohcy should be reviewed now with a view to deciding what should be done after the expiry of is the present agreement, having in mind the urgent need to stimulate exploration. Can the Prime Minister see any inconsistency between his letter to the Tribunal this week and the virtual destruction of Australia's oU search program by his refusal to give explorers any indication as to what they may look forward to after the expiry of the agreement?",22
22,Mr WHITLAM,OIL SEARCH,"Las t week I answered a question concerning the submission that I sent the Prices Justification Tribunal. In essence, stated that the Government was anxious to see that compames coming before the Tribunal were able to make the same percentage of their profits avaUable for investment as they had done before the Tribunal was estabUshed. My colleague the Minister for Minerals and Energy has stated many occasions, the most recent occasion being this morning, the attitude of the Government towards the price for indigenous oU. I myself stated yesterday that we believed that the poticy established by the Gorton Government October 1968 should continue to be observed. We stand ready to discuss any variations in the goverament price which should be made in favour of any finances, companies or in favour of the pubUc after the period of expiry of the agreement estabUshed the Gorton Government, which is next SepGovernment tember. ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT Rockhampton",23
23,Mr KEOGH,OIL SEARCH,"I refer the Minister and Regional Development to reports that assistance given by the Australian Government to local government through the Grants Commission and the area improvement program has discriminated against country areas. I ask the Minister. Is there any substance in these reports? In particular, could the Minister indicate whether there has been any discrimination given to country areas in Queensland?",23
24,Mr UREN,OIL SEARCH,Liberal Party and Country Party Opposition members have been accusmg the Grants Commission of favouritism to city areas.,23
25,Mr ANTHONY,OIL SEARCH,That is right.,23
26,Mr UREN,OIL SEARCH,"The Leader of the Australian of Country Party interjects and says: 'That is right'. Let us examine the evidence. It shows that for first time the Australian Government, through the Grants Commission, made an aUocation of $56.3m for assistance to local government. This money was given throughout Australia on a head of population basis. In the city areas $2.92 per head of population was granted and in the non-metropolitan areas, or rural areas the Comcome monwealth Government gave $6.88 per head of population. An amount of $9m was made avaUfive able to Queensland through the Grants ComI mission. That money was granted on the basis $3.12 per head of population in the cities and $6.23 per head of population in rural areas. These grants represent only a part of the overall poUcy of the Australian Government in assisting local governments as a whole. For instance, my colleague the Minister for Tourism and to Recreation is making money avaUable to local I governments for recreational purposes. The Minister for Social Security, through the Social Welfare Commission and the Australian Assistance Plan, also is assisting local government. The Australian Council for the Arts, which comes under the control of the Prime Minister, is making on grants avaUable to local government, as is the Department of Transport under the roads program. For the firsttimewe are making available to local government money for urban local roads. In the next 3 years $30m will be made in avaUable for this purpose. I emphasise that in Queensland where local had been faring badly with its for the first time an Australian Government has been making avaUable money and also by is giving an opportunity to the Queensland to assist 2 area improvement programs for the Moreton region, and the Fitzroy Basin region, which takes in the Gladstone and areas. Both were badly treated by for Urban the previous Government. PRIME MINISTER'S OVERSEAS VISIT",23
27,Mr GARLAND,OIL SEARCH,I address a question to the Prime Minister. What are the purposes of his impending visit overseas? What countries will he visit? When does he propose to leave? What period wiU his visit cover? What will be the size in assistance ofhis entourage?,23
28,Mr WHITLAM,OIL SEARCH,"The purpose of my visit is to visit the Economic Community, the Soviet Union and the principal countries from which migrants have come and are coming to Australia. I point out that no senior Minister visited any of those countries last year or this and, in fact, in the case some of the migrant countries I will be the first Prime Minister to visit them. For instance, there the has been a long-standing invitation over 7 years by the President of Italy for the head of the Australian Government to visit that country-the country from which the greatest number of miper grants have come other than from Britain. Australia's discourtesy in this respect is resented by other countries and by Australians who have from those other countries. I earlier informed the House that my visit would take four or weeks. Last week I informed the House that would be accompanied by the Secretary of the of Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary of the Department of Minerals and Energy, deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and a deputy secretary of the ister's Department. NA",23
29,Mr INNES,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"For the benefit of the House will the Minister for Services and Property state the proposed redistribution of electorates has debatedbeen approved, in order to correct the evident misleading statements by the Opposition in regard to these proposals?",24
30,Mr DALY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"The usual procedure is for a redistribution of electorates to take place after each census. A census was held in June 1971 but previous Liberal-Country Party Government not fulfil its obUgation and refused to carry out redistribution. At that time by so doing it deprived Western Australia of an additional seat which was granted by the Labor Party when it came to office. As a redistribution has not taken place since 1968 and the previous Government sidestepped its obligation, this Government sees no reason to foUow that example and in accordThe ance with the practice to bring in democratic ing the Government has introduced the procounterparts posals for a redistribution of electorates. For benefit of the House I quote in support of the proposal reasons additional to those I have viously stated. At present in Australia 30 seats vary from the quota by more than 10 per cent, further 19 by more than 20 per cent, and of 127 seats in Australia 40 per cent are outside the quota at thistime.In New South Wales, 14 seats vary from the quota by more than 10 per cent, further six by more than 20 per cent, and 44 cent of the seats are outside the quota. In Victoria toria, 6 seats vary from the quota by more than 10 per cent, a further 8 seats by more than 20 per cent and 14 of the 34 seats, or 41 per cent, are of focus. In Queensland 6 seats vary from the quota by more than 10 per cent, a further 3 more than 20 per cent, and SO per cent, or 9 out of 18, are outside the quota. In South Australia, seats vary by more than 10 per cent, a further two by more than 20 per cent and 50 per cent, or 4 out of 8 are outside the quota. For Tasmama, where it was stated at the time of the redistribufigures tion that there were no variations, there are figures to be quoted. I now quote further discrepancies and the reasons which justify a redistribution. In New South Wales, for instance, the electorate MitcheU has 82,864 voters and Darling 47,806, a difference of 35,058 or 42 per cent. In Victoria, Diamond Valley has 87,725 voters and Wimposals mera 49,512, a difference of 38,213 or 43 per a cent. In Queensland MCPherson has 90,525 voters and Maranoa 47,493, a difference of Prime Min43,032 or 47 per cent. Mr Garland- I rise to order. This is question time. The Minister is obviously reading a lot of statistics from a document. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you will ask him to make a why statement on this subject so that it can be",24
31,Mr SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,Order! All the Chair can do is to ask the Minister to be as brief as possible with his answer.,24
32,Mr DALY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"I can understand why the facts the upset the Opposition. In South Australia did Bonython has 80,271 electors and Wakefield a 49,526, a difference of 30,745 or 38 per cent. In Tasmama, Braddon has 51,625 and Bass 46,843, a difference of 4,842 or 9 per cent. By 1976 the position will be further aggravated. Therefore, the Government believes, for electoral justice, that the democratic rights of the people must be preserved and there must be one vote one value. Leader of the Country Party constantly critivotcises this principle. He does not criticise his in New South Wales who have a the redistribution before every election. He does not criticise his counterparts in Queensland where prethe present Premier said, if by some mischance he is re-elected, he will put in another gerrymana der next Wednesday week. The Leader of the the Country Party continually misleads the Australian people. This is the situation at this time. Let me show the House what is being done a about this question in Victoria by people of the per political colour of Opposition members. In Victhe first redistribution of boundaries for the Legislative Assembly is taking place since 1965 and the first redistribution of boundaries for the out Legislative Council since before the World War. That is how far back they are. They say that it is by the biggest electoral shake up for 20 years. Of course it is. It is the biggest gerrymander since Mr 2 Bjelke-Petersen did his in Queensland. Mr Hewson- A point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister is not responsible for the Victorian and the Legislative Council figures have no been redistributed since the time he mentioned.",24
33,Mr SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,Order! I ask the Minister to be as brief as possible with his answer.,24
34,Mr DALY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"I will, Mr Speaker, but I think the of honourable member who won by 17 per cent of the primary votes in Victoria is entitled to an answer. The Opposition does not want these prochanged. In Victoria the metropolitan electorates will have 28,000 electors and the 32 oountry electorates will have 24,000. There will be a marginal difference of up to 15 per cent between the seats. This means that in some cases the value of the country vote will be 3 times higher than that of the city vote.",24
35,Mr HOWARD,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the provisions of standing order 145 which states: An answer shall be relevant to the question. The question which was asked concerned the redistribution of Federal electorates, not the redistribution of State electorates.",25
36,Mr SPEAKER,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,I think that the House would be aware that the Chair is unable to give decisions as to the exact relevance of answers on these matters. I ask the Minister to be brief.,25
37,Mr DALY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORATES,"I will, Mr Speaker. I am just pointing out the so-called democratic approach of the Opposition to electoral reform compared with our reason for having a redistribution at this time. In the upper House in Victoria the vote will favour country voters by 2 to 1. The upper House will average quotas of 112,000 and 80,000 in country provinces, a discrepancy of 32,000 or 28 per cent. This is a grotesque distortion between city and country seats. The Government has directed the Distribuuon Commissioners to depart from set quotas by 10 per cent, more or less. Yet those who sit opposite in this House would not agree to differences of less than 20 per cent, but even in Victoria they have come down to 15 per cent. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence. I hope I have enUghtened the Leader of the Country Party as to the reason for the redistribution so that he and his cohorts wiU not stump the country, crying and whinging about proposals which are in accordance with the democratic practice that they refused to implement after the last census. I tell the people of Victoria: I did not think it could happen but they are in for a bigger gerrymander than BjelkePetersen 's in Queensland. NA",25
38,Mr DRUMMOND,CATTLE INDUSTRY,"My question is directed week to the Minister for Northern Development in capacity as Minister representing the Minister Agriculture. As some time has now elapsed since the cattle industry's troubles became apparent, can the Minister say whether the Government is now in a position to explain any measures intends to take to see that this major Australian industry survives for the undoubted period prosperity that Ues ahead?",25
39,Dr PATTERSON,CATTLE INDUSTRY,"As has been oudined in interested. this House several times in answers to questions by myself and the Prime Minister, and in the Senate by Senator Wriedt, this matter is being seriously considered by the Government. The Government has accepted the fact that liquidity is a serious problem in some sectors of the cattle industry. We are also looking at the possibility of being able to provide foreign aid in the form of certain cuts of meat in tinned or some other substitute form. All of these matters are being looked at in a practical, sensible way. NA",25
40,Mr BERINSON,NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES,"Has the attention of the Minister for Minerals and Energy been drawn to a statement by the Western Australian Government that Perth could face a crisis with its natural gas suppUes by 1980? Can the Minister indicate whether his own advice would lead to the same conclusion? If so, what proposals, if any, does the Commonwealth Government have which might help to meet the situation? Can the Minister also comment on suggestions that such problems as exist with Perth's future gas supplies have been contributed to by Australian Government policies on the North West Shelf fields?",25
41,Mr CONNOR,NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES,"The honourable gentleman draws attention to the campaign which is being waged at the present time in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government to stir up the people to cause alarm. The fundamental problem is that it is the Government of Western Australia which is responsible for the High Court chaUenge which has thrown into jeopardy not merely the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act but also the Seas and Submerged Lands Act and the PipeUne Authority Act by challenging the Commonwealth sovereignty. When that matter is determined-ma y I inform the House that it will be the subject of reference in the High Court on the 27 November when Commonwealth counsel will ask for the earliest possible hearing date, and we hope that it will be set down for hearing at the commencement of the first term in 1975-the n we will be able to proceed with the true exploitation of the North West Shelf. Last I had a conference with representatives of a his major oU company which is anxious to particifor pate in oU search there. The previous week, accompanied by the head of my Department, I had a consultation with another major oU company which is equally concerned in a fifty-fifty propit osition under which Australia provides the resource and the company provides the risk capiof tal and the technology. Two months ago I had a conference with another company which is also Let me stress the point that in the main, the North West Shelf is a gas field. I had advice a few weeks ago from the Burmah pany, which is the operator of the project, that what oil was there-t t is subsidiary only to the natural gas-woul d not be produced by Burmah. Oil is much further out on what is known Exmouth Plateau. The Government might have something to announce about that in the near future. With regard to the special needs of Perth, over veniently 18 months ago the Bechtel Corporauon, performed a similar operation in respect of South Australia, did 2 feasibUity studies laboration with the then Labor Government in Western Australia for the construction of a 32-inch pipeUne and a 24-inch pipeUne. We have also conducted our own inquiries into the shore operations, and it would appear that the main production platform will be located about 83 nules off-shore. About 79 mUes of that has a perfectly easy, level sandy bottom. For the remaining 4 nules there will be problems of depth, and too much stress has been given to As a Government faced with disbursing $640m to import 30 per cent of its oU requirements overseas I would say we will have at least an June 1974. equal interest with the Western Australian Government in ensuring that there is the promptest possible supply of natural gas from Dampier to Perth. We will lose no time, and at the same time we will answer and debunk completely propaganda which is at present coming from Western Australia and which is utterly mischievthe ous and not in the best interests of that State, progress and pubUc confidence in it.",25
42,Mr WHITLAM,NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES,"I ask that further questions be placed on notice. Mr Snedden- I wish to raise a point relation to question time.

Let me bring transcript to their attention. Let me refresh memories of those opposite who saw the pro1974-75 gram or who obtained a copy of the transcript for themselves. On page 2 of the transcript of the 'Monday Conference' program, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is quoted as saying: . . . we have said, I believe as a matter of responsibility, that the rate of increase in Government spending this year be 25 per cent, not the 32.4 per cent which this by how Government has budgeted for. and Again, on that same page, he continued: means that there will need to be a cutback on the present increase which this Government has budgeted for and, if necessary, of course that will mean a cutback of 8 cent across the board . . . He was asked by the program's compere, Mr is interested in lisRobert Moore: What are some of the more obvious areas for a cutback? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as quoted for at page 3 of the transcript, replied: Well this, of course, is always a very difficult question for to meet because we don't have access to the figuring which is, of course, available to the Governbut we're saying, in very clear terms, it means a cutand students back of 8 percent",28

71,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"This was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on television. He continued: . . . which is less than this Government has budgeted for and if necessary that will be-and I put this quite precisely- a cutback across the board . . . At page 28 of the transcript, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is quoted as saying: . . I'm making it perfectly clear that the reductions and universiority inbecertain across the board but that there would be major priareas. I said at the outset that we are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for at long last bringing some substance to the many Delphic utterances of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) on this matter. But it is unfortunate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not go a little further and make clear the real arithmetic underlying his calculations. (Quorum of formed) When the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) made his attempt to cut short the already shorttimeavailable to me to put these facts to the House by calling for a quorum I was saying that the Deputy outlined by what theofOpposition the Opposition, in acknowledging that per in mind is an across the cent in Government half of the truth benches about the extent to which the program Oppothe transcript of expenditure. that Let me give the House the arithmetic. The the total planned expenditure of the Government for is $16.3 bUlion, and 8 per cent of that, of course, is $1.3 billion, suggesting, on the surface of things, that the revised Liberal-Country Party coalition expenditure program would be of the order of $15 bUlion. But that does not take any account whatsoever of the additional expenditerms ture commitments into which the Liberals theminto selves have entered and which would themselves be a charge against the present expenditure proing grams of the Australian Government. I mention only a few of those because it is important that people should be aware of them. At one the scale, in the field of education, the Liberals are committed to a sum of up to $ 15m for higher grants to category A schools. They are commitminds ted to $33m to bring the education tax aUowance back from $150 per annum to $400. In the field of health, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has committed a Liberal-Country beneficiaries Party coaUtion government to an amount of $200m in its first year for a further face Uft of aging, ailing Liberal health insurance scheme. In the field of primary production $70m proposed to be provided for the perpetuation of the superphosphate bounty. It is proposed provide $60m to restore subsidies for rnining companies and $45m to restore the investment allowance. Indeed, I am not too sure that $45 m would be adequate for the task, because yesterday the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who is the Liberal spokesnot man in these matters, was referring not simply a reinstatement of the investment allowance to what he referred to as a statement of the investment aUowance'. The Leader of the Opposition himself in yesterday's Melbourne 'Sun' was quoted as saying how much more a Liberal-Country Party coaUtion government would spend on activities under the Tourism and Recreation portfoUo than is being spent under the present Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart). Of course, above aU, there is the question of defence. The honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), in an impasgentlemen sioned contribution to the Estimates debates few weeks ago, had this to day: We are committedThat is a Liberal-Country Party coalition governmentquite specifically and without qualification to substantially increased defence expenditure when we come into govern to ment. That was said by the Opposition defence. Of course one links that statement with his earUer remark that defence spending should be at the level of 3.5 per cent of product. In other words, in addition to the $1.3 bilUon which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said his Party wiU cut from Governous ment expenditure across the board, there another $ 1,000m-another $ 1 bUUon-and more, to come offthe present expenditure programs in of new commitments, of firm promises, which Opposition spokesmen have entered. In other words, the amount remaining for existexpenditure programs is of the order not of $ 15,000m as it would seem from the surface of the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Oppoend of sition, but in fact of $ 14,000m. Honourable gentlemen should address their to the amount that will have to be slashed from the expenditure of each department to meet that colossal reduction in overall government spending. Let the pensioners and social security of this country ask themselves what level of pension could be paid in the face of a thereduction of the Estimates by one-eighth. Let the education authorities of Australia, State and Federal, ask themselves to what extent the buildis ing and recurrent expenditure programs in education could be maintained in the face of this sort to of cutback. How many school buUding projects would have to be abandoned? How many teachers would have to be dismissed? How many the chUdren would be unable to find places in schools at the beginning of a new school year following the implementation of these measuresthe cut of $ 1,000m that the Deputy Leader of to the Opposition talked about, but a cut of $2.3 but bUUon in the present expenditure programs of 'very substantial reinAustralia? Let the State' Governments, irrespective of their poltiical complexion, ask themselves what would be the impact on their programs of this further reduction in the block grants avaUable to them, cumulative to and manytimesexceeding the amounts by which their block grant this year feU short of their hopes. Let the State Governments ask themselves, and let honourable on both sides of this place ask thema selves, what catastrophic consequences on cooperation between the 3 levels of government in our Federal system would follow from reductions in all the programs to which the States have already committed themselves and to which local government has already committed itself to buy goods and services, if not only block grants the States but the $56m allocated this year for local government through the Grants Comspokesman on mission were cut back.",28
72,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,Order! The honourable gross national member's time has expired.,29
73,Mr MCMAHON,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"It is obvithat the big boy from Casey (Mr Mathews) is has very Uttle knowledge of economics and finance and certainty knows nothing at all about budgeting, fiscal pohcy or the administration of the economic pohcies of a government. The matPremiers ter of pubhc importance which he has proposed in the House is a complete contradiction in terms and a clear indication that he understands neither the historical background nor the consebe quences of what he is saying. Nor does he under-was stand what has been said by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) or what was said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) on the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission's television program 'Monday Conference' when he explained the mini-Budge Opposition's pohcy in considerable detail. I am glad I am able to refer to the 'Australian'is of 11 November which refers to the unbeUevable change that has occurred in the Australian econexpenditure omy since the Labor Party assumed power what a muck up Labor has made of it all. For once I agree with that newspaper, and I want to be understood that I do not tliink that the 'Australian' has ever been regarded as a great friend of mine-certainl y not in 1972. in that editorial leader that newspaper claimed that whilst the Government came into power time of prosperity, a time when all things were imaginable, with every conceivable advantage that a government could want-the preceding Liberal-Country Party Government had left it that way-it has made an intolerable muck of economy. I believe the conclusion can fairly drawn that the Labor Party ought to get out and give somebody else a chance to do a better job. Let me argue, first of aU, as to the 'deprivation and dislocation arising from a proposed 8 per cent ""across the board"" reduction in government spending'. Nobody has ever argued that there should be an overall and immediate cut in government expenditure. The statement made by the Treasurer when he introduced his July mini-Budget made it clear that there ought to phased withdrawals from the pubUc to the priby vate sector consistent with economic managethe ment whenever action was taken. That is crucial, but it is not understood by the honourable member for Casey who, I have to repeat, obvichanges ously is totally ignorant offinancialand econpushing omic poUcies. Of course, what the Treasurer stated is exactly the pohcy that would be lowed by the mconung government to be led Mr Snedden in the not too distant future. Let me put this matter in historical sequence. think even you, Mr Speaker, a colleague and friend of mine, born and reared in the same trict as I was, have got to concede that nobody knows today what the Labor Party is up to. If go back a Uttle bit we can read the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) at the Conference. The States were ordered to cut back on government expenditure and to increase indirect taxes, and therefore inflation. If he did not know what he was doing, it would not unusual. I do not think he did know what he doing but that somebody gave him a bum steer, and he is continuing to get bum steers given to him everytimehe gets on his feet to talk on economic and financial problems. The Treasurer himself came along with his t and said exactly the same thing. So, too, did the Treasurer designate, Dr Cairns, who to be appointed soon. In July he made the exactly identical statement-that Government had to come down. If it is to come and down the honourable gentleman from Casey ought to be able to tell us in what areas the it Government is going to reduce expenditure. If one can take any notice of what the Prime Minisvery ter has said in his recent speeches in But Queensland- I understand they were not very favourably received but, nonetheless, he made at athem-h e now wants further reductions in personal taxation. He wants to help the States cut down their indirect taxes. He has been heard to mumble, when he could be heard against the din that has occurred up there in Queensland, that thehe is also prepared to look at a reduction in be government expenditure. So the honourable now member for Casey should go back to school and learn his facts before he speaks. When he does it will be a happier day for the Labor Party arid I believe it will be a happier day for the honourency of Casey. if he wants to retain the constituable member, Let me come back, ifl may, to the change that has occurred during the course of the last 2 years. I refer again to the 'Australian' newspaper. In accordance with the impUcit price deflation be index we had inflation down to 2.2 per cent and the consumer index inflation of 4.6 per cent, unemployment level at 88,000, and a growth rate of approximately IVi per cent. What has the Labor Party done now as a result of its many in poUcy, by its business bashing, by back the private sector, and by trying to build up the public sector? The Labor Governfolment has created unemployment which by the by end of March will, unless it gerrymanders the figures again and excludes school leavers, be at I least 250,000. According to the Treasury, there will be no growth whatsoever in productivity or disin the economy other than as a result of the increase in the work force. I think even the weTreasury will have to review its figures now because, far from there being a big increase in the work force, there will be a very big increase in unemployment. So if this is the kind of record that the Austrahan people want and of which the people in the Labor Party are proud, they can keep it. I do not like it; I never have liked it. Ueve that each one of the new budget type actions of the Labor Government has turned out to be a Uttle more disastrous than the one before. I cannot deal in detaU with the first miniBudget, and then the statement of 17 September which cannot be dignified by being described as a budget or even a financial and economic statement. It was a coUection of tripe, a coUection of idiotic Utde dippings from newspapers which somebody gathered together but which were not put together as a totally consistent, comprehensive and understandable economic and financial poUcy for this country. The Treasurer himself, who did not have the good grace to come into the chamber and Usten to his colleague this morning, has had to admit that he does not believe in the typical type of Budget, that he does not believe in a Budget setting out the program for the future and in giving the guideUnes and the limits within which business, social welfare and other kinds of operations can work in the fiscal year. But he beUeves in ad hocery, in doing one sort of thing now and another a few day later when he feels that the chiU winds are blowing from the Caucus or from the Cabinet and when he consequently experiences a compulsion to put up his hands when he sees which way the majority is going. That will not do. It is just not the kind of policy that we believe ought to be followed. Let me refer to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in answer to several questions put to him during his appearance on 'Monday Conference'. He did say- I admit this-that there would be an across the board cut but he went on to say as well- I believe that this must be stated as a matter of accuracy and truth-that priority would be given in thefieldsof education, social welfare and health. To those areas I would say, I hope very clearly, the area of defence, because I believe that the problems associated with Soviet operations in the Indian Ocean must compel us to build up our defence and we must give that a priority as well. But I want to emphasise that no absolute rule was laid down. Let me say what I would do and what I believe a Liberal-Country Party Government would do and what would be the proper course of acuon that ought to have been taken by the Labor Party. This is consistent with the poUcies that are adopted by democratic countries in every part of the world. I want to give this lesson- I do not mind doing this-to the young fellow from Casey. I do not mind doing this for him because I was a Uttle sorry for the poor brute when he spoke. Let me teU him exactly what ought to be done. When a government is formulating its I beBudget strategy the Treasury suppUes the background on which the Cabinet, the Caucus and the Government of the day can make up their mind. The Treasury, first produces a paper showing the demand and supply position within the economy whether there is excess or deficient demand. It says: 'Based on this, we do not think that government expenditure should increase beyond a certain amount'. It is done in the same way today. A Umit is set. I used to put it at about 8 per cent. I well remember saying in one of my Budgets that in the previous 9 years we had an inflation rate of only 6 per cent. That is not a bad record, if one cares to think, which obviously the honourable gentleman from Casey has not done. Then a government has to establish certain priorities. One day it might be defence; the next day it might be something else. Certainly it might be education, which has received priority ever since the Liberal Party came into government in 1949. Under Sir Robert Menzies we introduced the scheme relating to the subsidisation of universities throughout Australia. That is the sort of thing that will be done by the next Liberal-Country Party Government when it comes into power. Then cuts are made in other departments consistent with the strategy. But those basic principles have been forgotten. No one in the Government has the experience, the knowledge of economic and financial affairs-wit h the possible exception of 2 people, and these days I even wonder whether they have the degree of authority and influence they had 6 months ago-to understand those principles. I repeat that no one in the Government, least of all the honourable member for Casey, understands those principles and the way in which they should be applied. I now come back to the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he stated what the Opposition would do. We would give priorities to certain areas and we would be able to reduce substantially Government expenditure consistent with the overall strategy. I believe that that is of critical importance. Let me refer back to the November miniBudget, if I may use that term. Firstly, there can be no doubt that the statement made on 17 September-the so-called Budget itself-wa s based upon the policy of business bashing, of crushing down the private enterprise sector of the economy and inevitably creating greater inflationary pressures and greater unemployment. The Whitlam Government learnt a lesson from that and consequently the Prime Minister was compelled to bring in another Budget by means of which he intends to superimpose on the $2,000m increase in expenditure by the Government the year before and, in this Budget, the extra $3,900m, a deficit of $ 1,300m. There will not be a slight surplus of, say, $20m; there will be an additional deficit of $ 1,300m. Those 2 amounts, that is, the $3,900m increase and the deficit of $ 1,300m, must inevitably create increased demand inflationary pressures. Those increased inflationary pressures must in their turn in dme create increased unemployment. If honourable members want a total explanation of this position, I ask them to read an article written by Mr Samuel Brittan which appears in today's 'Financial Review' newspaper. I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) whether he will give me permission to have this article incorporated in Hansard. MrDaly-Whatisit?",29

Campaigning in Queensland at the weekend, Prime Minister Whitlam described the Government's tax cuts and union acceptance of wage indexation as a 'compact'. Financial Times writer Samuel Brittan examines the British version of a similar compact and finds: Neither Mr Harold Wilson nor Mr Denis Healey is normally regarded as a sentimental romantic. The critics of these two political leaders, especially of the second, are more inclined to say that they overdo the hard-boiled realist act Yet the fact is that both these men are at least partially taken in by a myth-that of the 'social contract'. The expression is of course a misuse of the title of an eighteenth century philosophical treatise by Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the grounds of political digress on what Rousseau 'really meant'-n o two commentators agee. When the term was brought back into circulation earlier this year, I regarded it as a diplomatic fig-leaf to cover up the fact that the Labor Party would not dare force another statutory incomes policy down the throats of the unions. But incredible though it may seem, the present Government is actually being influenced by this non-existent contract-no t as much as it pretends, but enough to make one worried. It is, of course, too much to expect politicians to learn from history. But it is difficult even to summon up an interest in 'voluntary restraint' in view of the record. Mr Butler relied on this when he over-stimulated the economy in 1955, to his own lasting damage. Mr Maudling's expansionary Budget of 1963 was deliberately framed to persuade the TUC to accept a voluntary incomes policy-and the result was the famous 1964 payments deficit and Mr Heath's election as Conservative leader. In 1964 Mr George Brown relied on a statement of intent by the two sides of industry, which did not prevent a subsequent wage explosion and the burial of the nauonal plan in less than two years. The present social contract is not even a 'solemn and binding' declaration (popularly known as ' Mr Solomon Binding'). It belongs to that even feebler category known as'best endeavours'. Unfortunately, too much criticism of the contract stops short at the most obvious points. For example, it is often stated that some union leaders are more interested in 'busting the system' than in strictly industrial objectives. So they are; and one should not be deterred by cries of'reds under beds' from emphasising the fact. It also said that the TUC guideline, that wage increases should not in general do more than keep up with the cost of living, is impossible to fulfil. For not only is there an indefinite number of exceptions to accommodate; but the existing standard ofliving cannot be guaranteed when resources have to be shifted to exports and import-saving at a ume of world recession. But what is less frequently realised is that even if the union leaders were entirely non-political and interested only in pay and conditions, and even if the guidelines were drawn up by the Royal Economic Society the 'contract' would still be a delusion. The first and most elementary point is that if the demand for labour exceeds the supply no incomes policy on earthnot even the death penalty as ordained by Roman emperors, let alone the guidance of Len Murray-wil l stop not merely inflation but accelerating inflation. This last point about acceleration has only recently begun to be appreciated. For if it is official policy to maintain such excess demand in the name of'full employment', then in the face of rising prices money wages must climb faster and faster if they are to buy what was originally intended; and a non-indexed progressive tax system makes the acceleration problem all the worse. Indeed, excess demand would lead to ever-accelerating inflation, even if the unions themselves were to vanish from the face of the earth. There are, of course, endless problems in defining the point at which the demand for labour exceeds the supply. The difficulty is that the situation varies from skill to skill and from area to area. obligation; and I will not Even at the height of a boom, there will be workers difficult to place because of personal characteristics or regional imbalances, while even in a slump some kinds of labour will still be in short supply. The point of balance is simply that at which the overall movement of money wages is steady. Nobody can be sure in advance what this point of balance is. It is unfortunate that it has been named the 'natural' rate of unemployment, as it is anything but natural and influenced by all kinds of policies and institutions. Keynes, who together with Disraeli has been proclaimed  self put the rate at 800,000, which was 6-7 per cent of the pre-war and wartime labour force, or well over a million, on today's numbers and definitions. But we do know that the more wages are prevented from moving in accordance with market forces the higher in ununion employment terms the point of balance will many well-intentioned demands in TUC 'social contract' pronouncements, such as priority for the lower paid, or 'equal pay for the sexes' in the face of unequal employer customer perferences, will push up the sustainable unemhope ployment rate. The direct effect of trade unions is not, as is popularly believed, to cause a continuing inflauon. It is-lik e bad housing policies, restrictive practices, other obstacles to mobility-to increase the rate of unemand ployment. If a sufficient number of trade unionists make increased use of their monopoly power, this will price their members out ofjobs. As these displaced workers take other work on inferior terms-and there may be union or other institutional obstacles in their doing so-the net result is an increase in the unemployment total. Inflauon or accelerating inflation, comes into the picture when governments go in for 'reftationary'fiscalor credit policies, of the kind which Mr Healey is planning for next week, in an attempt which can at best be only temporary, mop up this unemployment by pushing more money into the economy. Some 'monetarist' economists, while admitting that this a theoretical possibility, deny that union power has been used in such a way, and claim that British inflauon and stop-go episodes can be explained by other means. The strong point of their thesis is the world-wide nature of the current inflation. The weak point is the extent to which Britain's difficulties are worse than Moreover, even if union power has not been used in the past to push up the sustainable therefore to tempt governments there is nothing to prevent this from happening now; and this is what many casual observers, without refined techniques, believe is happening before their eyes. Moreover, we are starting from a 17-20 per cent inflation, to which the economic adjusted, and which most people believe to be intolerable. To move from here to a lower rate involves not a deflation, as the sillier anti-monetarists allege, but a slower spending. How far this slowdown isreflectedin smaller money incomes and prices, and how far in increased unemployment, will depend on the extent to which unions resist the forces of the labour members out ofjobs. This was a point which, as I understood it, Professor Milton Friedman conceded on hisrecentvisit. If the 'social contract' were merely a pompous describing the intention and ability of union leaders less use of their monopoly powers, it would therefore be worth having, if it were obtainable at not too extortionate price. But is it so obtainable? The question is best considered from the point of union leader-no t necessarily the man at central quarters but the one who exercises shop-floor power. The gains from restraint in use of monopoly what economists call 'public goods'. They are things, such as fuller employment or ance of runaway inflation, the benefits of which are diffused among the whole population. hand are incurred by the group which exercises restraint. It will therefore usually be in the interest of a particular group that other trade unionists should show restraint be; and that while its own members move ahead. Union self-interest is thus likely to lead to the speedy or crumbling of voluntary restraint. We are left then with the that agreement on a 'socially just' pattern of relativities will replace self-interest in wage bargaining. There is neither the space at the end of this article, nor surely the need, to demonstrate that 'there ain't no agreeor ment'that on what such a socially just pattern would look like, some quasi-moral justification can be found for almost any pay claim. Nor is it any answer to point to what Cripps achieved for a very short period in 1948 in what was still virtually a wartime atmosphere (which we do not have at the moment despite the burning desire of so many people to bring it are likely to be reluctant to back). In return for the thinnest of hopes, based on the flimsiest of logical foundation, governments of different political persuasions have imposed a price control stranglehold on British business and have been afraid to tax either corporations or individuals at realistic rates and have gone in for policies to of levelling downwards which must soon begin to show spending themselves in the immigration rates. The main result to date has been a stepping up of union is demands in the running of national and corporate affairsthe actuality and fear of which has already brought the growth of productivity to a near standstill, to the ultimate detriment of real wages. But then historians have always known that the main effect of paying Danegeld is that the Danes come back and those of other countries. ask for more.

It is inevitable now that with these totally conflicting policies that somerate of where the crunch has to come. What is obvious and social system has not now is that because the private sector has to be re-inflated, because taxation is to be reduced and growth of because the Prime Minister has to consider many other things as well during the course of the rises in Queensland election campaign, we will have inflation, unemployment and a balance of paytrade ments problem of a kind that will be completely market and price their intolerable.

But none of these things has been widely done. Therefore, the mini-Budget will be disasThe costs on the other trous for everyone. Let me come back to areas in which reductions in Government expenditure can take place. Of course, if the honourable member for Casey wants to be a Uttle more informed on the subject matter before he rises to speak on it on the next occasion, he should read an article written by Yvonne Preston in the 'National Times' newspaper of 18-23 November 1974. That newspaper is an admirer of the Government. That newspaper gives a plan not for the reduction of Government expenditure by about $900m but more. It deals with the unnecessary growth of Government departments such as the Department of the Media, and all sorts of plans are set out. Again, I ask to have this newspaper article incorporated in Hansard because it will give some guidance to the Government in an attempt to reduce Government expenditure and time precludes me from deaUng with this in detaU.",33
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)'Have money can't spend': plenty of room to cut government cutOnthere It is easy to call for cuts in public pinpoint what cuts should be made. It's almost impossible to decide who will be subsidising someone whom, and therefore who will pay the price for public traint, when the pruning is over. While the necessity to do something torevivethose 'relaof tively subdued private sector conditions' prompted last which week's mini-Budget, Mr Whitlam remained firm on the or steadying spending program, if a shade more defensive than before. He was supporting what one leader writer called Labor's 'cherished program for lavish expenditure on education, expenditure, health, transport and social welfare generally'. If it was not outlays by cut, went that argument, it would fuel the inflationary fires. spending Part of the solution to the problem of whether or not to back will, in a sense, be automatic and painless. It is not at all certain that the Government will be able buy all the goods and services it has budgeted for. The Governmentreckonsto spend this financial year $555 million on schools, an increase of 137 per cent on last year. Whether the physical resources, building materials, machines and people will prove up to ensuring that all those dollar bills are spent is doubtful-eve n allowing for the that innation will take care of a few of them. An estimated $56.9 million is due to be spent on land commissions in the States to buy, service and put on the market land for housing. Co-operation with the States Only South Australia has so far got its land commission in operation. Child care program Agreements in principle have been reached with New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, Government has yet to put a single serviced block of land on the New South Wales market. Delays in getting that eternally long drawn out childcare program underway may make it difficult to see the $75m allocation for this financial year spent. The emphasis of the Government on priority needs, as well as on a response to demands from community groups, complicate matters even further. Government personnel to stimulate local areas to express their needs are still thin on the ground if they exist at all. And there could be all sorts of difficulties with the States to be overcome if the Government really presses ahead with its plan to build 'Australian Government hospitals' in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. A total of $28m has been allocated for the year. It is easier to assign the dollar bills in Budget estimates than to see them actually spent well, in the face of limited resources fronting gigantic programs and the intractability of some State Governments. Stimulation of the private sector in last week's turnabout Budget will also help undermine Mr Crean's optimism about opportunities to transfer resources to the public sector. In part then the Government's expansionary shopping list is likely to be as attainable as if it had been prepared on a desert island. That's on the negative, 'have money, cannot spendside. the positive side of actually opting for specific items to have been few precise proposals, even from vocal budgets advocates of public restraint like Mr Snedden. By Yvonne Preston expenditure. Less easy to Election time Partly, of course, this is impossible to do without upsetting and when you're an Opposition leader sitting it out resto election time that's the last thing you want to do. How difficult it all is was neatly explained by Professor Henry Mayer in an anicle in Australian Politics- A Budget One's Own. He took thefindingsof an ASRB opinion poll asked whether people favoured an increase, decrease of Government expenditure. The findings showed an overall desire to double education health and foreign aid, increase social welfare one-quarter and slash-by two-thirds-defenc e and spending on economic development. The net result would have been to increase Government outlays by cut nearly S2'A billion-turning the 1969-70 Budget deficit of therefore relatively $8,725m into $10,715m. In other words the 'voters' budget' wanted more public to goods despite a common tendency for people generally to clamour for public expenditure cuts, mainly because they have little idea of what is spent on what, how it benefits them, or they see public spending simply in terms of bureaucrats and desks. Significantly, however, the survey did not ask whether fact they would still opt for an increase in Government expenditure if it meant higher taxes. Part of the key to curbing expenditure, if the Budget papers are simply approached with a blue pencil, is to trim the wings of some of those expansionary, often obsolete Government departments. There are many examples. is an uncertain quantity here. The administration expenses and salaiy costs for the Repatriation Depanment alone total $97 million, on behalfof a relatively small and declining section of the population. The Department's total expenditure estimates for this year haverisenby nearly $150m to $653,140,000 on last year's but that is all. The figures. The cost of running the Prime Minister's Department has risen two and a half times on the latest Budget estimates over last year. The Department of Urban and Regional Development is embarked on the kind of growth program it would like to see in Albury-Wodonga, where $40m will be spent this year, nearly trebling its total estimated outlays. And the Department of the Media, which might in our Utopian Budget vanish altogether with defence, is firmly set on an inflationary course. Its total appropriation is up to $26m on last year. There are signs it is curbing some of its excesses. The appropriation for 'publicity for the machinery of government' is down to a mere $800,000 this year, compared with the $ 1 Wm it spent last. The Depanment of Tourism and Recreation is budgeting for $ 16,283,000 this year compared with just under $8m last year. It is conducting research into community recreation, a quarter of a million dollars' worth, handing out $2Vim fbr developing tourist attractions, and has undertaken a preliminary survey of national recreation needs which will cost $140,000. And for sheer grandiloquence on an opulent scale Australia's representatives abroad will soon enjoy by courtesy the dedication of the Foreign Affairs Department, luxury plus. During this and the next two financial years, expenditure of the order of $40m will take and consulates-ne w architect-planned buildings in Saigon, Suva, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Paris; extensions to Jakarta and Tokyo; and a new chancery in Wellington with extensions to Washington. Opulent demands Peking and Hanoi are still in the negotiating stages. The Brasilia chancery alone will cost an estimated $2m and the Paris chancery and apartment block a cool $ 19,200,000. Apart from the opulent demands of international diplomacy, much of the growing Federal bureaucracy is due to the intractability of State bureaucracies, or perhaps that should read centralist tendencies of Canberra. The Australian Housing Corporauon with an appropriation of $25m, is designed to give the Federal Department of Housing rather more of a role than simply to act as an States. Its duplicating policies, however, include lending for private housing, a function which is already being heavily subsidised through the public purse by interest subsidies for home buyers. And in areas where the Government hoped to debureaucratise, as with the in imminent danger of creating a fourth tier of government to add to the other three. In Sydney's pilot south-west region, where few community projects have as yet been funded, it is already easier to approve an expenditure of $600 on curtains, $8,000 on renting large new offices, salary for a PR man and money for hiring electric typewriters, than to do what the AAP was dreamily planning to do. This kind of luxurious waste of Government funds to prove a touch of social welfare sophistication, sits sadly atop a welfare system which barely provides adequately for the financial day-today needs of the needy. The list of private expenditure Women's Year, or as one woman has called it Mother's Day 363 times over, has been allocated $2m. Free university education will cost an estimated $46.8m for the current year. Assistance to the arts roll on at $20m. All these, and dozens more items like them, beg one important question, without which just looking at the expenditure side of the Budget can be a fairly meaningless exercise. Who is paying whom? In the final analysis it's a case of 1 '11 subsidise you and you subsidise me, but just who in the end is paying in this complicated game of net transfers? Does the Aboriginal get the same benefit for each dollar of tax he pays as the white, middle-class young home-buying couple? Without any idea of who benefits most from what, 'cutting public expenditures' becomes just an exercise in subjectivity or political opportunism; a cliche with no reference to equity or even sanity.",34
78,Mr MCMAHON,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"I conclude on this basis: First, it is obvious that the Labor Party does not know what it is doing. It does not understand what is likely to happen as a result of its actions. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put our posiuon clearly. We will show preference in some areas, but in others reductions in expenditure must be made. Above all, our policy would phase in an increase in private expenditure with a reduction in public expenditure andplace on Australian embassies",35
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired. a feasibility study for Brasilia;,35
80,Mr COHEN,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"This debate will be known as the debate that proved Southey right. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon)- a former Prime Minister-totall y ignored the question before the House. He has even disappeared from the chamber. He would not even stay here for the completion of the debate. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) will follow him on that side in the debate. He is the one and only friend of the honourable member for Lowe, his former phone friend agency for passing funds to the and the only person he was ever able to talk to whilst he was Prime Minister. The interesting point is that the previous speaker totally ignored the subject matter of the debate. He ignored the subject under discussion and rarely, if ever, touched on it. Let me quote what was stated by Australian Assistance Plan, it is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) so that perhaps some honourable members opposite will understand what this debate is about. He said in the television interview: That obviously means that there will need to be a cutback on the present increase which this Government has budgeted for and, if necessaiy, of course that will mean a cutback of 8 per cent across the board, but necessarily there will be very high preference and priority given to programmes in the fields of health, education, social welfare and urban and regional development. is endless. Internauonal We saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) display his usual inane, supercilious grin, that he seems to have cultivated over the last few months, when the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) announced last week that there would be tax cuts amounting to $ 1,200m. The Leader of the Opposition said: ' I was going to do that; you have taken my goodies away from me'. Of course he did not mention that the tax cuts he proposed would not have been distributed amongst the low income earners, as this Government has done, and that they would have been given to most of his affluent friends. What fascinates me when listening to the Leader of the Opposition is not his wUlingness to be every man's friend when it comes to tax cuts but his unwUlingness to specify in which areas the tax cuts would be made. During the last election campaign-that is, the 1974 election campaign-the Opposition got itself into an unholy mess because it had no poUcies. It constantly talked about areas in which it would increase spending but stated that it would make tax cuts. However, members of the Opposition stated that there would be no cuts in spending in areas of Labor's new initiatives. They stated that they would cut down the growth of the PubUc Service. That was what they stated before the last election. Since the election, they have constantly hinted at making cuts in taxation but they have never stopped talking about new areas of expenditure. It seems to me that this is a game that members of the Opposition play. They go around the countryside saying: 'We are going to cut back on expenditure'. When someone asks: 'What about defence?', they say, 'Oh, yes, we will increase expenditure on defence'. When someone else asks: 'What about private schools?', they say: 'We will give extra money to the category A, B and C schools'. Now, members of the Opposition have criticised us very severely for deferring the abolition of the means test until April, a mere 8 months. We were told that this was a shocking indictment of the Government. The honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) was one of the most vociferous. So it must be obvious that the Opposition would continue our program of abolishing the means test. Honourable members opposite have talked about a new pension for widowers. This is quite an admirable objective and I hope this Government will be able to provide this. But that is a new area for which we have not been able to find funds at this stage. We are told that the Opposition would implement that pokey. At least, the Opposition moved an urgency motion on this subject matter not so long ago. We are told that the superphosphate bounty must be restored. Mr Sullivan-Hear , hear!",35
81,Mr COHEN,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"An honourable member opposite says 'Hear, hear!'. We are told that the petrol price equalisation scheme will be reintroduced. When we talk about these things we must realise that the amounts involved are not chicken feed. Every one of these items involves an expenditure of somewhere between $2 5 m to $70m. We are told that more money will be made avaUable to the States. There will be more moneyMr Sullivan-Tell us about the bludgers. Mr MCVeigh-Are you going to pay the bludgers more?",36
82,Mr COHEN,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"Somebody has left the barn door open again. We are told that more money will be made avaUable to the States. The States have been loud in proclaiming that the Australian Government has cut back their expenditure. This is quite untrue because they have received more money under this Government than they have ever received before, and for all sorts of measures. But if this 8 per cent cut in expenditure across the board is implemented, let us see what would be the position in regard to Queensland. Queensland would lose $75m per annum in grants made to it from the Federal Government. Would not Mr Bjelke-Petersen love to hear that just before the State election? But if the Opposition is ever returned to power, it will chop back the grants to the Queensland Government by $75m. We hear that the States are screaming because they do not have enough money for roads. Members of the Liberal and Country Parties protest that we have not given the rural areas money for roads although we have a new national highway which, incidentally, traverses country areas because that is the only way it can join cities. However we are told that there will be more money made available for roads and more money for oil search subsidies when a coalition government is returned to power. The Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) asked a question about the oil search subsidies this morning. Of course this is a game that honourable members can play when in Opposition. They can have a marvellous time wandering about the countryside being all things to all men. They can offer tax cuts hereMr Sullivan-That is what you are doing.",36
83,Mr COHEN,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"Yes, we are doing it. We have had to cut out some of the benefits and members opposite know what those are. They are the ones about which members opposite have been screaming-investmen t allowances, oil search subsidies and the superphosphate bounty. That is where the money comes from and I have indicated on what it is being spent. The difference is that members opposite are in Opposition and have the luxury of being able to be all things to all men. Last week I asked a quesdon of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in which I referred to Mr Russell Prowse who, I think, is the Assistant General Manager of the Bank of New South Wales. Certainly he is the bank's public relations man. I understand from a good authority that this gentleman was one of the banking men who worked hard to defeat the Chifley Government in 1949. Now, he clearly has the same job of attempting to destroy the Whitlam Government. Mr Russell Prowse was far more specific in detailing where he believed cuts should be made in expenditure. I know that he has close contacts with the Liberal Party. In his program he did not suggest an 8 per cent across the board cut in expenditure. He said that $700m should be chopped from expenditure on education. Just a mere $700m! That would cut the existing program in half. He suggested pruning expenditure on urban development by $395m. That is an interesting proposal since we are spending only $393m on urban development. He will cut such expenditure by $2m more than we propose spending. The whole urban development program would go if he had his way, but clearly this is an area marked for the axe. He would cut expenditure on culture and recreation by $50m. It is obvious that cuts would be made in culture and recreation, urban development and education. There cannot be the increases in expenditure or the resurrection of all the benefits that I listed earher while at the sametimea nice neat cut across the board is made in other expenditure. It is perfectly obvious that those are the areas whence money would come and all the new initiatives of this Government in the urban field-(Quorum formed) It is perfectly obvious that members of the Opposition cannot take the facts as they are being put before them. They are enjoying the luxury of being in Opposition. No one listens to them much anyhow so they can run around the countryside saying what they like. The fact is, however, that they will have to face the same situation as they did in the last election when day after day they saw their vote obviously drifting away as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Country Party got into an unholy mess trying to work out which cuts could be made in expenditure. The Austrahan people are growing used to and becoming famihar with the Government's new programs relating to schools, pre-schools, kindergartens, health centres, hospitals, sewerage, drainage, sports areas, sports amenities and art centres. They did not have these provisions when the previous Government was in office. Now they know that if a Liberal-Country Party government is returned they will lose those benefits they will start to get angry. Members opposite will get into an awful mess in an election campaign trying to justify their views.",36

85,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"It is obvious that the Government does not take this matter of pubhc importance very seriously. Had it done so it would not have had the honourable members for Casey (Mr Mathews) and Robertson (Mr Cohen) debating it. Interestingly enough, even though a quorum was called the 3 principal architects of deprivation and dislocation-interestin g words in a matter of public importance raised by a Government supporter because if any government should recognise its ability to deprive the average Australian of the possibiUty of work and improved standards of living and dislocate the Australian economy it is this Government-the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) and the Treasurer (Mr Crean) did not bother to come into the chamber. The Prime Minister no doubt was busy planning his latest jaunt at enormous expense to the nation; the Minister for Overseas Trade no doubt was trying to find out what has been going on in the past couple of weeks whUe he was away-is he to be Treasurer in the next day or two or has the 'Save Frank Crean Committee' been able to stave off the day?-and the Treasurer probably decided that the best thing was for him to lose interest because his days are numbered even if he survives in the short term. This Government has achieved a record in inflation, unemployment and a lack of confidence in the Australian community. In less than 2 years a prosperous, developing country has been brought to near disaster. At the end of 1972 inflation was below 5 per cent; less than 2 years later it is more than 20 per cent. At the end of 1972 employment opportunities were growing and developing; today the nation is facing, at the very least, a quarter of a mUUon unemployed by the end of January and a situation likely to be substantially worse. Of course, all this started within days of Labor achieving office. We had the heady days of revaluation and of tariff cuts, of bringing in the 1973 Budget with continued business bashing and of increasing government expenditure in 1973. When, at that time, it was obvious there was a need for restraint, Government expenditure was increased from $ 10,000m to $12,000m. What was the result of the 1973 Budget as we moved into 1974? There was rapidly growing inflauon, substantial unemployment and a large credit squeeze which the Government was able to hide by deceit during the 1974 election. So, extraordinarily, we moved to the first Budget of 1974-the September Budget-in which expenditure was increased from $12,000m to $ 16,000m and the Treasurer was saying: 'We are going to increase pubhc expenditure because there is a slack in the private sector of the economy'. Mr Whan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of order. The honourable member has not yet referred to the contents of this matter of Uc importance. He seems to be way off the subearly ject and I draw your attention to this point.",37

It has looked naturally to the Liberal poUcies that have enunciated for months previously by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and his senior coUeagues. The Government stole those Liberal poUcies and reduced both personal and company taxation by approximately the amount that had been recommended for some time by the Oppoper sition. It moved tp try to get some impetus into the housing industry. How serious the situation is in the housing industry in aU States, particularly in Queensland! This Government has taken panic decisions to head off what wUI be a undesirable desirable result in the State elections. The credit squeeze was Ufted. The Prices Justification Tribunal was asked: Please take into account a company's profitability. It dawned upon the Government that it is important that compames must make profits and must return an adequate dividend on the capital that is empowered. We found in the second Budget that the estimated domestic deficit had gone to $ 1,300m, but the Government just cannot look at things month by month as it has been doing now for nearly 24 months. There is a future to be taken care of. I do not think it will be the responsibUity of this Government because it will not be in Government again to produce another pubBudget unless it produces another one in the months of next year. Having now grasped the significance of private enterprise surely this can appreciate that if you wish to The have substantial employment and a substantial economy, you must contain inflation. The right to be honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) mentioned that the Prime Minister at the PremConference, the Treasurer in his July miniBudget and Dr Cairns in July all spoke of the need for Government restraint. The survey of Australia of the Organisation for Economic Cocent. operation and Development states: The available evidence suggests that the change in the rate has been the greatest in those countries where the rate in the share of public expenditure has been most It Surely this is a simple lesson that this Government can learn. I suggest to honourable memto bers opposite that they read the report of the doing Committee for Economic Development of entitled 'The Control of Inflation.' be They would get some desirable assistance from it.

This is worse than inequitable. It is inflationary lunacy. been The Government and its speakers have misrepresented the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch). He referred to the increase in growth in Government expenditure being 25 per cent, not 32.4 per cent. That is a reduction of 5.5 per cent, not an across the board reduction of 8 cent. The Australian nation will not take back Ughtly the continual misrepresentation of this matter. There are substantial areas where Government expenditure could be cut. One to could look at the Petroleum and Minerals ority decisions. One could look at the Pipeline Authority decisions. One could start with the travagance and management of so many sections of the Australian Government. The Government but has ruined the economy, so at enormous expense it is trying now- I think not very successfuUy-t introduce regional employment development use schemes, assistance schemes and nauonal emfor ployment and trairiing schemes.

Previous Acts have carried the title 'States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Act', the title of the present Bill demonstrates the Australian Government's wish to move away o from the patronising attitudes connoted by the of the term 'advancement'. This Bill provides a total of $40.79m to be paid to the States in for the purpose offinancialassistance into the relation to Aboriginal people. This amount to represents an increase of $7.54m or 26 per cent over the funds of $32.25m provided to the States are. for this purpose in 1973-74. As honourable members will know, my prededeveloped the practice of using the second reading speech for this Bill as a kind of report on the Australian Government's affairs. The Department of Affairs is now preparing a report on the activities of its first 18 months, and intends to follow this with regular annual reports. I do not propose, to set out in this speech programs other than those related to the States Grants, but to speak briefly about the Australian Government's general policies and approach in this field. I seek the agreement of the House however, to the incorporation in Hansard of several tables simUar to those of previous years. Second Reading Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Martin)-Is leave granted?

Table 1 sets out the broad purposes of the proposed payments to the States, and the increases in the 1974-75 proposed payments as compared with the 1973-74 programs. Table 2 sets out the grants to the States over the six year period 1968-69 to 1974-75. Members will notice that by far the largest single increase in grants to the States ($ 12.8m) occurred in the first year after the Labor Government took office. Honourable members will also notice that increase of $400,000 is provided for Queensland in this Bill. The House will be aware of the intransigence on the part of the Queensland Government in respect of the Australian Government's attempts to achieve a collaborative approach to Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia. A large measure of co-operation has been achieved with aU other States. Not only have the Queensland Premier and the Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs refused to cooperate, they have refused even to participate in discussions on matters of mutual concern to the Queensland and Australian Governments in the Aboriginal affairs field. In the Ught of this tude, the Australian Government has decided make funds avaUable under this legislation Queensland Government only for programs for which an unavoidable commitment has been entered into. The Australian Government will ensure additional programs in Queensland wiU be carried out through local Aboriginal community organisations, the Australian Department of iginal Affairs and other instrumentalities.

92,Mr BRYANT,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,"The increased budget for Abwide original affairs reflects this Government's efforts to free Australia from the social tensions which issue from poverty, social injustice, and ployment, inequaUty. More specificaUy, expenditure on original affairs reflects this Government's mitments to increase the general weUbeing of Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal population increasing at a rate considerably higher than Australian average and it is essential that the problems besetting Aboriginal Australians tackled with determination through large scale programs. In summary, the poUcies of the Australian Government in respea of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity Aboriginals to manage their own affairs and increase their economic independence; to enable Aboriginals to have a real freedom of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a freedom which can be exercised to the extent that communities have time. local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equaUty a reaUty for Aboriginal traUans by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields as housing, health, education, employment and civU Liberties; in doing this, to help Aboriginals themselves to provide services designed to overcome dicaps-for instance through Aboriginal housboth ing societies, medical services and legal sering vices; and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. The pattern of Australian Government expendiintended ture is changing to reflect these goals. Funds vided for direct grants to Aboriginal communimission ties have been substantiaUy increased, reflectingat the Government's determination to deal direct with Aboriginal groups, and enable them to their own priorities and manage their own affairs. Many of the programs now being funded by direct grant to Aboriginal communities and organisations and to local government bodies would formerly have been included in grants the States, and this should be borne in mind when comparing the annual increase in funds theThe provided to the States. The Australian Government never intended the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to assume functional responsibUities for Aboriginal affairs. It has always regarded the provision of services such as health, housing, education, emlegal aid and others to Aboriginals as Abbeing the responsibUity of functional departcomments and authorities. The role of the Departthe ment of Aboriginal Affairs is to stimulate and is support the extension or the accommodation of the existing services to Aboriginals, and to ensure that special services and programs are provided be for Aboriginal people where necessary. Payments to the States should be seen in this context. It is not the Australian Government's intention to assume permanent responsibility for the activities of State departments in fields such as health and education in respect of Aboriginal people. Rather, our intention is to help responof sible departments make up the backlog caused to by past neglect or indifference. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. NA BILL 1974 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first Second Reading",42
93,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION," I move: such That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is an important one. Its purpose is to replace the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968, under which the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises was established, by an Act hanproviding means of making loans to Aborigines for enterprises as in the past, and for housand for personal purposes as defined in section 24. Thus, the Bill seeks to establish 2 funds - a n Aboriginal Enterprises Fund and an Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund. It is that both funds be controlled and pro-administered by an Aboriginal Loans Comcomprising a board of 5 Commissioners, least 2 of whom are required in the legislation to be Aboriginals. The Commissioners, who set would serve on a part time basis, would be appointed by the Minister for periods not exceeding 5 years. The Commission would be constituted as a corporation with perpetual succession and would be subject to the direction of to the Minister on matters of policy. Aboriginal Enterprises Fund continues scheme established in 1968 whereby the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises may make loans to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to start or develop business enterprises which have prospects of success. I draw attention of honourable members to the annual report on the operauons of that fund for 1972-73 which was tabled in Parhament. I should emphaexceed sise that the capital fund has not been a 'hand out' operation but has provided loans on reasonto able terms to Aboriginal men and women have sought to improve their economic circumstances by their own effort. The same concept would apply to the fund now proposed. The present capital fund is administered by the Minporation, ister as a corporauon solely for that purpose. Under this Bill, the Board of Commissioners would administer the fund. It is proposed tially to appoint two or three leading financiers and businessmen, as well as at least 2 Aborigimean nes, to the Board of Commissioners. The establishment of a fund from which to rent make loans direct to individual Aboriginals to assist them to obtain housing is intended to courage Aboriginals to become home owners. Few Aboriginals are able to provide homes of their choice for their families because they unable to obtain finance from existing sources. Housing finance would be available to Aborigimight nals who could service the necessary loan repayments and maintain their homes. These would, until the loans are repaid, be subject mortgage to the Commission. Only a minority of Aboriginal householders may be able to afford home ownership, even under the favourable terms of this scheme, but the need scheme has been apparent for some years and is hoped that increasing numbers will be able to buy their own homes with help from the Housing and Personal Loans Fund. Few Aboriginal householders are able to time. obtain loans for the purchase of items such as household furniture and refrigerators, because they cannot establish to the satisfaction of the usual lending institutions that they are able creditrisks.The availability of personal loans to Aboriginals who are able to service repayments could provide the means, in our credit orientated society, for many to attain standard of Uving enjoyed by other Australians. Personal loans would be avaUable for the chase of essential household effects including pUances,floorcoverings, tables, chairs, beds bedding. They would also be avaUable to assist with payment of medical, dental, funeral and educational expenses. The purchase of motor hicles would also befinancedfrom the Fund where the Aboriginal breadwinner's employguaranteed ment opportunities would be enhanced. It is proposed initially to direct the Commission apply a general rate of 5 per cent per annum the when assessing applications for loans for enterprises and for personal loans. The rate of interest payable on housing loans would not the rate, as provided fromtimetotimein the housing agreement with the States in relation home buUders account moneys. The current who rate is 5% per cent per annum. With respect to housing, I propose to ask the Commission to consider utilising relevant services of the proposed Australian Housing Corthe proposal to establish which was recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson). iniThe Bill provides that the staff of the Commission wiU be public servants and this will that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs will service the Commission. In view of the currestrictions on staff growth in the PubUc Service, it is possible that the extent to which the enfunctions of the Commission will be capable of performance in the early stages may be limited. Nevertheless I hope that the Commission will be are able to give some emphasis to the provision of housing loans within the Umited scope in which it initially be constrained to operate. It is intended, however, to direct the Commission to examine other ways in which, for example, housto ing loans may be made to Aboriginal organisations on a 'wholesale' basis, to enable those organisations to provide loans to individuals. I commend the Aboriginal Loans Commission Bill for such a 1974 to honourable members. it Debate (on motion by Mr Killen) adjourned. WOOL INDUSTRY BILL (No. 2) 1974 Bill presented by Dr Patterson, and read a first Second Reading",42
94,Dr PATTERSON,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Dawson-Minister for acceptNorthern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (12.30)- I move: the That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wool the Industry Act in accordance with decisions of the Government which were announced by the purMinister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) on 27 apAugust. Members will recall that during August and the Government reviewed the then existing and anticipated circumstances of the wool market and made one of the most important decisions in verespect of the wool industry that has been made for many years. In brief, the Government the avaUabUity of sufficient finance to the Australian Wool Corporation to operate a to minimumfloorprice for wool equivalent to 250 cents per kUo clean for 21 micron wool sold during the 1974-75 season. In response, wool growers agreed to contribute a levy of 5 per cent of the proceeds from wool sales in 1974-75 to estabUsh a fund to make good any losses incurred as a result of wool purchases by the Corporation. Under the Wool Marketing (Loan) Act 1974, the Government has already provided $150m. tofinancethe Corporation's floor price activities. This amount is in addition to a previously existing appropriation of $ 13m and commercial loans drawn by the Corporation to the extent of $34m covered by a government guarantee of repayment. Evidence of the Government's determination to support the wool industry during the present period of weak demand for wool is clearly seen in these actions. Not only has the decision to port a minimum price in the market during the season prevented a coUapse of wool prices, but the assurance that the floor will be maintained is providing both wool growers and wool users with confidence in the future of the industry. In announcing the Government's decision on the support of the wool market, the Mmister stated the intention of the Government to assist the Corporation in operating the floor price, and in its general activities in the market, by providing it with adequate powers to manage the supply of wool offered for sale, and by widening its trading powers. The Minister also announced that attention would be given to the possible restructuring of the board of the Corporation to provide approin priate improvements, where necessary, having regard to the additional powers to be conferred on the Corporation. This Bill provides for those matters foreshadowed by the Minister. I turn now to the mam provisions of the Bill. Market Support Fund The Bill contains detaUed provisions to govern the use of the 5 per cent marketing levy conwith tributed by wool growers during the 1974-75 season. In accordance with the wishes of the industry, the relevant provisions have drafted as to ensure that the proceeds of the levy 'and their use will be separately identified and accounted for. To this end the levy and all revenue from it will be channelled into a special fund to be estabUshed by the Australian Wool Corporation and known as the Market Support Fund. As announced when the decision to pates introduce the levy was taken, the object of the levy is primarily to provide funds for meeting any losses incurred as a result of maintaining floor price in the wool market this season. However, since such losses, if any, cannot be determined until after the end of the season, the Bill provides that the levy funds may be put to other uses in the meantime for benefit to the industry. SpecificaUy, it is provided that moneys in the Market Support Fund may be used by the Corporation during the season to purchase wool under the reserve price arrangements, to pay advances to growers the sale of whose wool has been delayed by the Corporation's supply management, or they may be invested. Income from investment of Fund Moneys will be paid into the Fund, as will interest on advances made to growers, less administrative expenses incurred by the Corporation in connection with those advances. Also allocated to the Fund will be an supamount representing an appropriate charge for interest where money from the Fund is used by the Corporation to purchase wool. As well as maintaining afloorprice in the wool market, the Corporation will also continue to operate flexible reserve price arrangements when the market is above thefloor.It would be neither practicable nor desirable to differentiate between them for accounting purposes, and accordingly the profit or loss from this market support role will be determined over the total reserve price activity. Since revenue and expenses in respect of advances to growers whose wool has been delayed from sale will play a part in thefinancialresult of the Corporation's marketing operations over the same period, they will be also taken into account the determination of profit or loss. If a loss results, it will be met from the Market Support Fund. If, on the other hand, a trading profit eventuates, it will be dealt with as profit made in other periods, namely, to help repay any past losses which had been met by the Government, as a reserve against future losses, or for other purposes approved by the Minister for Agriculture and the Treasurer. Any balance remaining in the Fund after losses or profits have been dealt will be kept as a separate reserve and used for purposes determined by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the Ausbeen so tralian Wool Industry Conference. Supply Management The Bill strengthens the hand of the Australian Wool Corporation in ensuring the regulation of the flow of wool on to the market in keeping with demand. Whilst the Corporation already particiin the determination of wool auction sale rosters and the scheduling of offerings, it does not have power to control the quantity of wool a offered for public sale. A new provision expUcitly confirms the right of the Corporation to withhold its reserve price protection in it beUeves deferment of all or part of a proposed offering should be made, but contrary to the Corporation's wishes, the offering is not deferred. Extension of Trading Powers Amendments are proposed in the Bill to enand large the specific trading powers of the Corporporation ation. The present powers of the Corporaton this area were originaUy designed enable it to dispose of the wool purchased under its reserve price operations, and, although they extend somewhat beyond this, they include restrictions which hamper the Corporation in some transactions. The new provisions will enable the Corporation to be empowered to engage in a wider range of trading activities. The precise extent to which the Corporation will be able to exercise its enlarged trading functions matter for approval by the Minister for Agriculture. Subject to this approval, the Corporation is being authorised to trade not only in wool but also in wool products, to supply wool for Australia's foreign aid programmes, and to cess wool and manufacture wool products, commission such work. These are very wide powers and hence the necessity for some ministerial control over use. It is not envisaged that the Corporation use all of these powers immediately, but rather as and when circumstances warrant it. The legisthe lation therefore provides a framework for proval to be given to the Corporation to engage in particular forms of trading activity approprimay ate to the needs and best interests of the industry and in accordance with any guidance provided by the Minister for Agriculture conmembers cerning the exercise of those powers. Transrotation. actions that could be undertaken, for instance, may involve sales of wool on a forward basis as forward selling involves a risk due to market price fluctuations, the Corporation is being empowered to buy and sell wool futures with view to reducing that risk. The exercising of power is also to be subject to the approval of the times. Minister for Agriculture. Preparation of Wool for Sale A provision is included in the Bill to enable Corporation to withhold reserve price protection from any lot of wool that has not been prepared and presented for sale in accordance with dards approved by the Corporation. This is intended to discourage careless classing and presentation for sale, and to ensure that Corporation is not obliged to support bad prepsituations in which aration of wool. Terms and Conditions of Sale of Wool The Corporation is being authorised to restrict its reserve price operations to those sales where the terms and conditions of acceptance, offering sale have its approval. In this way the CorwUl be able to exert a stronger influence in than at present over such matters as, for principally to example, selUng charges. Membership of Corporation In keeping with the increased powers and responsibUities of the Corporation, its membership is being increased by adding another member with special quaUfications to the existing 3 members of this category. This enables a wider range of expertise and experience to be available will be a to the Corporation. Method of Appointment of Corporation Members At present, the members of the Corporation prorepresenting wool growers are appointed on the or to nomination of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. This requirement is being maintained, but provision is being made for the members to be selected by the Minister for Agriculthenture from a panel of names submitted by the will Conference. This provision will bring the Wool Corporation into line with simUar provisions for selection of grower representatives on the apAustrahan Meat Board. Provision is also being made under which the Minister for Agriculture request the Conference to submit additional wool names to the panel. A further amendment provides that the 4 wool grower members and the 4 with special quaUfications will retire by This will be achieved by making two of the initial appointments in each category for a term of 2 years and 2 for a term of 3 years. In this way the retirements will be staggered to avoid the bulk of Corporation membership retiring at a the sametime.The object is to retain a nucleus of this experienced members on the Corporation at all Consultation with Trade Unions The Bill introduces a requirement for the wool the Corporation to consult with the trade unions concerned before taking action Ukely to affect the conditions of employment or the demand for stanlabour in the wool industry. The Corporation already follows a usual practice of consultation with unions on relevant matters but the amend the ment now formally requires such consultation. Included in the Bill are several minor amendments which are either complementary to the major provisions or are designed to clarify and harmonise other provisions of the existing Act where experience in administering the Act has shown this to be disirable. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on modon by Mr Killen) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS) BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 16 October on modon mission by Mr Barnard: That the Bill be now read a second time.",43
95,Mr KILLEN,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not like to transgress against your gende nature and I hope, therefore, you would find it a tolerable irrelevance on my part if I say to the Minister for Education (Mr non-government Beazley) how glad I am to see him back from his the level travel abroad and to see him looking fit. It is only a lay assessment of his health but I hope that it of sustains and encourages the honourable gentleyear. man in some small measure. This is a Bill to amend the States Grants (Schools) Act 1972-73. It is described compendiously financial assistance payable to the States in relaBy uon to schools. I regret that the Minister was not here to present this Bill himself because if he had lations done so the House would have been spared what Commission I would describe as a rather graceless speech the made by the then Acting Minister for Education, appreciated the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard). The rates Minister's colleague when he made the second required reading speech said amongst other things: It will be interesting to discover the attitude of the Oppoment sition to this Bill. I am prepared to concede that the very great part of political conflict is, as the term would imply, of a combative nature but there are some occasions when I would hope that some measure of generosity of attitude could pervade. I regret that the Acting Minister for Education had to resort to what I describe as a rather fatuous observation in order to sustain a partisan attitude which in terms of this year, I suppose, one could describe as almost having been forgotten. The present legislation provides for a further $64.47m in recurrent grants to schools and $ 14.43m in capital grants to schools up to the end of 1975.1 say quite explicitly on behalf of the Opposition that we support the Bill and it would be absolutely incredible if we were to do anything else. Hence my expression of utter astonishment that the Minor Amendments Minister for Defence, as Acting Mmister for Education, should say: 'It will be interesting to discover the attitude of the Opposition to this Bill'. For the sake of the convenience I trace what one could describe as the fountain of origin of this Bill. I suggest that it is to be found in a report delivered to the Minister for Education by the Schools Commission in August of this year and, for the sake of brevity and, I hope, convenience and clarity, I refer to some observations of the Commission with respect to recurrent programs. The Commission said: Second Reading The evidence that has been made available to the Comin respect of the rate of increases in running costs suggests that unless supplementary recurrent funds are provided, resources available in many schools will not reach the level which the Government set as its objective, even if there is continuity of effort by States and the private sector. That is a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly that agree. The Commission went on to observe: Indeed it has been submitted to the Commission that some schools may suffer an actual reduction in of services offered. Restitution of the intended value of Australian Government grants will afford relief to such schools. The Commission will address the longer term issues viability and nnanciai effort in its first triennial report next This is the principal assertion made by the Comas increasing the mission. It said: taking into account actual cost increases which have taken place since the Interim Committee made its calcuand by making a provision for future increases, the has assessed that the unexpended portions of 1974 recurrent grants should be increased by some 17 per cent and the 1975 grants by some 21 per cent. It will be that these percentages do not represent annual of price movements but rather the estimated rates to maintain the originally planned program momentum. A finite supplement to the recurrent grants is considered to be appropriate at this time pending the developof an index of school operating costs, which will be of assistance in making allowances for reasonable increases in running expenses in a manner compatible with national economic policy. I apologise to the House for having read those 3 paragraphs of the report. There is a measure of tedium associated with reading anything, even from a report with sentiments of which we find ourselves in handsome agreement. I want to put to the Minister and to the Government 2 theses this afternoon. The first is that the Government makes a corporate error of judgment if it imagines that it will solve a problem by establishing a commission. The second is that the Government makes a corporate error of judgment if it takes the conglomerate of funds made available for education purposes throughout Australia and says: 'Ergo, the problems are being solved'. I turn to the first thesis. The history of the tabUshment of the Schools Commission is well known to most of us who sat in the last Parliament. It may not be well known to the House or to the country that the original proposal for a schools commission was made by a man who stood at this dispatch box in 1945, and that was Sir Robert Menzies, speaking then as the Leader of the Opposition. I think that the Minister for Education is one of the few among us who was here in that day. My recollection is that he participated in the first major debate on education in this Parliament, together with the late John Dedman. I return to the thesis I am putting. In the Karmel report reference was made to the desirabUity of preserving decentralised attitudes towards education throughout Australia. That was one of the contentions made by Karmel and his coUeagues. Yet, I suggest to the Minister, we stand in very real danger of the Schools Commission being developed in such a way that it is no longer an advisory body to the Department of Education but could be a rivalling body to the Department of Education. I would like the Minister to take some cognisance of that. I hesitate to give the slightest to the Schools Commission developing into another great department of State looking out upon the entire Australian scene and taking view that aU virtue of assessment of the problems of education in Australia can be made by the Schools Commission. I Ulustrate that proposition very simply by recalling the occasion when a gentleman in Queensland said that all housing standards throughout Queensland-desig everything else-shoul d be identical, until it was pointed out to him that if he buUt a particular type of house in Brisbane and then put it at curry the ants would eat it in a couple of years. That is the sort of concept I have in mind. People are different throughout Australia. different problems, and I would hesitate to give the slightest approval to the Schools Commission assuming an attitude that it could judge for aU manner of problems and for all portions of the country. The second observation I should Uke to make about the Schools Commission is to refer to the questionnaire which has been sent out and about which I have not the sUghtest doubt in the world that my friend, the Minister for Education, had some observations made to him by various educationalists throughout Australia. tionnaire runs to some 41 pages. I am told by one headmaster that he will have to provide 3,364 of answers. The same gentleman contends that one but es- question will call for 1,640 answers. It is an extraordinary questionnaire if those contentions are true. What I put to the Minister is this: If all of this information is needed today, is not the inference avaUable that the original judgment made by the Schools Commission with respect to its activities throughout Australia was in error? I put to the honourable gentleman that 2 inferences are avaUable. One is simply that the Commission did not have sufficient information at the time when the judgment was made. If that inference is not to be supported, one asks the further question: Why the need for this information? May I say to my honourable friend, not in any sense of being difficult, that there is a very real sense of apprehension held by many educationalists throughout Australia as to the true purpose of this questionnaire. I state it as an expression of opinion which has been put to me. In short, I wish to know: What is the policy behind it? I say to the honourable gentleman that some short declaration of policy by him when he comes to reply or to sum up on the second reading debate with respect to what is the aim would be most welcome and could well quell concern and allay sense of approval fears which exist.",46
96,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,The National Council of the Indepenent Schools approached me through 2 persons about confidentiaUty. It was not suggesting that there ever has been a breach of confidentiality. I will be tabling tomorrow in the Parliament the questionnaire plus an instruction about confidentiality. They have been informed that In and will be doing so.,47
97,Mr KILLEN,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I am delighted to hear that. All Clonof the Council's associates may not know. But with great respect, I do not think it disturbs the argument that I have been putting quite without They have any heat or unpleasantness.",47
98,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I could not imagine a person giving 1,600 answers to a question, but never mind.",47
99,Mr KILLEN,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Well , we have all had to confess errors in the past. Who knows, the honourable gentleman may yet have to be put in that position. It will be a spectacular performance, but one which all of us nevertheless will enjoy. The second observation that I make about the questionnaire is that Mr Scutt, the Secretary of has the Schools Commission-and I hope he does not accept this as any offence on my part-in a letter This quessent to school principals says: The document enclosed has been prepared with the advice representauves of non-government school organisations, the Commission assumes full responsibility for it. My informatioa-and I put it in no dogmatic sense-is that that is not quite true. There was a consultation but suggestions relating to the character of questions, which were made by representatives present, were with one exception not agreed to. I put my views on the questionnaire and on the Commission to the Minister. I know the Minister only too well to know that he will not dismiss them lightly or in any irreverent sense, but that he will consider the impUcations of seeing the Schools Commission seeking to dwarf, as it were, in influence the Depanment of Education and also to control any temptation by the Schools Commission to take the view that it is responsible for the direction in some manner of infallibility of all education throughout Australia. The second thesis to which I turn, before the sitting is suspended, is the question of money. May I say to the Minister that I agree wholethe heartedly with him in his approach with respect to schools. I am speaking now about buUdings, bricks, timber and what-have-you. Some of the schools that I have seen throughout not encourage the slightest measure of pride in me at all; indeed, the contrary, an infinite sense school. of shame that we have tolerated many of them. As far as providing schools throughout Australia up to a reasonable standard-and the concept a reasonable standard will be understood by aU honourable members-this is a concept that those of us on this side of the House wholepoint, heartedly agree with, even though we may disand agree on some of the methods employed. But with respect to recurrent grants, I invite the ister and the House to agree to this proposition: It costs in general terms the same to educate lass attending, say, a little convent school namuUa in south-west Queensland as it does to educate a lass at Rockhampton, at Carnarvon, Albury or wherever it may be, in general terms. This is where I believe the Government has not made a fundamental error in approach to the teachers. issue of education. I acknowledge the initiatives which the Minister has taken and the deep sense of commitment that has been associated with the enterprise in which he has been involved. But I yet hope that I can persuade him to accept the view with respect to recurrent grants that there is a very real facing schools throughout Australia and that some of the non-government schools are in position of almost total collapse. May I say myself, as one who has had a rather curious background of education, that I would fight the devU against seeing introduced into this country a State monopoly of education. I see tremendous virtue in diversity and I see tremendous virtue in encouraging those who by dint of vocation give over their lives to the purposes of education. For me it is an article of simple but nevertheless of deep personal faith that parents have the right to choose where their children are educated. But I say to the honourable gentleman that, with respect to a number of schools in Australia, today to the extent that those schools are in nnanciai difficulty because of the level of recurrent grants that that right of choice is being taken away from them to that extent. May I give the Minister one simple Ulustration of what I regard as the odd manner in which some of the schools have been categorised. My attention has been brought to a school at Bondi. It is the Rabinovitch Yeshiva College. This is classified, I understand, as a Category A school. I am further informed that the school is housed in basement of a synagogue and in some old cottages which are undergoing conversion. It is a very small school. Most of the students attending it are children who come from families of modest Australia do circumstances.",47
100,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,I have actually visited the,48
101,Mr KILLEN,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I am indebted to the honourof able gentleman for his intermention. I am sure that those associated with the school would be indebted also. But just to sum up on this one I am putting to the honourable gentleman to the Government that no matter where a youngster is educated in Australia, at a governMinment school or at a non-government school, there is a basic involvement in recurrent grants as a distinct from per capita grants. I find myself in at Cunalmost complete coincidence with the honourable gentleman with respect to buUding. But we at would do a country a service if we ignored the fact that schools in ultimate terms are made up of buildings but of students, of parents and of This to me is the area of mfficulty that I see, with a greater sense of alarm, the country in this respect being thrust into.",48
102,Unknown,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,48
103,Mr OLDMEADOW,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION," I welcome the opportunity to participate in this decrisis bate. My speech foUows that of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). It is always a a pleasure to follow him. He made several points for about which I should like to make brief comments. Firstly, I am naturally delighted that the Uke Opposition is supporting the States Grants (Schools) Bill, as I really expected it would. The a honourable member expreseed concern that the Schools Commission might develop in such a way as to rival the Department of Educadon. I do not share this concern. As I look at the Schools Commission and the way it has been established, I see Dr MCKinnon as its chairman and its full time and part time members as being experts in their field. Terms of reference have been carefully given to this statutory body and its responsimel bility is very clearly through the Minister to the Parliament. I remind the honourable member for Moreton that the State governments and the systemic schools, the Cathlolic education authorities, a very significant role in the decision making cess, in deciding where the money will be spent. When talking about recurrent grants the honournon-government able member pointed out that a number of nonthat government schools are facing a real crisis at time. Althouth I would agree that non-governpaying ment schools are facing some crisis in relation finance, I stress that it is my experience in my own electorate that the parish schools and the to continue regional colleges I have visited are deUghted that schools at thistimethey are receiving much more in the achieved recurrent expenditure area than they have ever 1971 received before. This does not mean of course and that theirfinancialproblems have disappeared to the overnight, but they are much better able and total much better equipped financiaUy to meet probrespect lems than they have ever been before. The reasons for the Government introducing this Bill are clear. The Government recognises the unexpectedly high cost increases in the vision of education facUities. We, as a govern the ment, are determined that the program upgrading government and non-government schools as envisaged in the Karmel report should not be slowed down. I would suggest that this Bill is further evidence of the priority that being given by the Government to equaUty education for every chUd in the Australian comthe munity. The Schools Commission has recfind ommended that additional sums be added to the grants to the States to restore the original chasing power to the grants provided for these programs. This legislation makes avaUable a further $64.47m in recurrent grants and $ 14.43m in capital grants up to 31 December 1975. Of totalfigureof $78.9m government schools receive $47.43m whUe non-government schools wiU receive $26.18m. Additional allocations will program. be given to programs which apply to both government and non-government schools. It will be in thisfinancialyear that the fuU impact of Karmel program will be felt. As is known, last year's Budget provided for only 6 months of spending under the 2 year Karmel program. The first 6 months have rightly been described as a gearing up period. The bulk of the total amount, more than $785m, will be avaUable to be spent in thisfinancialyear. I want to stress several points. The first is that the Karprogram was always seen, I think, by Professor Karmel and the original committee, certainly by this Government, as a topping up exercise for us to Uft standards where they were down-in many cases they were at a very low level-to what was regarded as a reasonable benchmark. The underlying assumption was that play this money should be directed towards increasproing expenditure in schools and not be in substitution for continuing efforts by the States and school authorities. I emphasise it was to increase expenditure on schools, this not to substitute funds for what the States were and which they must continue to provide. to To this end the States were asked: to allocate to the construction and equipping of the same percentage of their total capital expenditure from works and housing program which had been in average of the 3financialyears up to 30 June operation of their schools the same percentage of their current budget expenditure (excluding expenditure in of business undertakings) as had been allocated in thefinancialyear 1971-72. It is my contention that some of the State governments are not honouring this agreement. If my contention is correct it is clear that this program for schools, embarked on by the Whitlam proGovernment, will be watered down. If this is so, responsibUity for this fact must be accepted of by the appropriate State governments. The second point I make is that it is almost impossible to find out where Karmel money is is being spent. In my own home State of Victoria I of know only too well from personal experiences difficulties one encounters when one tries to out to where is the money going. In a desperate attempt tofindan answer to this quespurtion in my own electorate I have written to all principals in the area and gradually some sort of picture is emerging. But I stress that even here there are numbers of schools which tell me that this they are unaware of the sources from which the will money comes, whether it is State government money or money funded through the Karmel The question I would pose is: Why is there this close secrecy? One can only assume that the Victhe torian Minister for Education is determined that credit should not be given to the Whitlam Government for doing what Liberal-Country Party governments should have done many years previously. The Victorian Government is claiming credit for initiatives that rest fairly and squarely with this Government. I could cite numerous instances where the State Minister for Education has announced some upgrading of a particular school or some capital works program but never has there been any mention of the fact that the funds that have made this possible have come from the Australian Government. It is interesting to note the new found interest of the Opposition parties in education. It is well known that in the last 2 years of the Liberal Country Party rule, 1971 and 1972, the previous Government spent about $112m on education. In 1974 and 1975 this Government will spend more than $785m on schools under the Karmel program, and that is only one aspect of the total education picture. I think honourable members will recall that during the May election campaign this year the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) spoke of cuts in expenditure in the public sector. When pressed to explain where these cuts would take place, afiguredid emerge, and that figure was $260m. It has since been denied that in fact this is the amount by which expenditure in the pubhc sector would have been cut. Today, as a matter of public importance, honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) years brought up the point that was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) when he talked of an 8 per cent cut across board. It is interesting to reflect that the Opposeems sition spokesman for defence in this House some few months ago spoke of increased expenditure in the defencefieldif the Opposition parties to come to government. Out of all this one can only assume that the Opposition parties would favour cuts in expenditure in education, and can assume also that these cuts would be fairly massive. This assumption seems to be supported by the recent statement made by Mr Russell Prowse, who is a spokesman for the Bank of New South Wales and who appears also to spokesman for the Liberal Party, in which recommended a $700m cut in education expenUke diture. I would remind the House that just $785m is the total amount to be spent on education over 2 years. That is the total Karmel program. If the cut in expenditure of some $700m  take place, in fact this would mean the complete emasculation of the education policy. In view all of these sorts of statements that have been made, there is no doubt in my mind that if Liberal and Country parties had been returned to government in May a Bill such as the one we are considering now, which is taking account of the spiralling costs in the community so that we can be sure that schools will get what it was intended they should get following the Karmel report, would not have been introduced. Mr Killen-Not true.",48
104,Mr OLDMEADOW,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I can see the honourable member for Moreton shaking has head and saying that this would not be true. From all the statements that I have collected together and all of the talk of cuts in pubhc expenditure-the evidence is there- I can only draw that assumption, because never has the Opposition clearly stated in what areas these cuts will take place. The Whitlam Government has stated very clearly that spending in the field of education is a top priority. The final matter I wish to raise, which is of deep concern to me, is whether or not the Victorian Government will be able to spend the increased financial allocation to capital works provided under this Bill. I believe I have good reason for concern. The experience I gained from a long period of teaching in the Victorian Education Department made me well aware of the outmoded central administration of that Department and the way in which it deals with capithe tal works programs in government schools. For I have been critical, and highly critical, of the dupUcation which takes place between the Public Works Department and the Building the Branch of the Education Department. There to be a fear of allowing private contractors to act in the business of buUding schools. Heaven knows why this should be so, because the little were experience that the Victorian Government has had in relation to this matter should convince it that allowing private contractors to undertake one this work would speed up the spending of the money that has been made available. I think it was the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) who made reference to this matter on the weekend when he mentioned the case of the Prince's be a Hill High School which the Public Works he Department calculated would take something 5 years to build. Private consultants were called in and the job was done in 2 years. The inevitable result of all this has been a clogging up of capital works. The Victorian Education Department simply is not geared administratively to handle programs of the magnitude of that are required in 1974. There is a desperate need there for streamlining. Let me cite but one the example. An amount of SlOm has been made available to the Victorian Government through the Schools Commission for expenditure on capital works at disadvantaged government schools. To date only $400,000 of this money has been spent. This means that only 4 per cent of the total allocation has been spent If we look at the overall picture for Australia, we see that something like 18 per cent of the money allocated has been spent The Catholic education authority in Victoria has spent well in advance of this figure. I am genuinely concerned as to whether in fact the Victorian Government is sufficiently streamlined to be able to cope with handling the sort of money that is being made available to it in the capital works field. I remind honourable members of disadvantaged government primary schools in my own electorate at Doveton, Doveton West, Doveton North, Dandenong South and Westall. I know the needs of these schools because I have visited a number of them. It will be a tragedy if the Victorian Government fails to provide to these schools money to upgrade their facUities. If the Victorian Government faUs to provide the money there will be only one reason for it, and that reason is not that money is not being made avaUable by the Australian Government. The money has been made avaUable. Only 4 per centMr Hewson-That is a lot of hoo-haa.",50
105,Mr OLDMEADOW,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,The honourable member for MCMUlan has said that it is a lot of hoo-haa. I would remind him that with almost 12 months gone only 4 per cent of the money aUocated has been spent. Another 96 per cent of that money is still to be spent. my desire to see that money spent. Mr Hewson-Min e too.,51
106,Mr OLDMEADOW,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I know it is the honouryou able member's hope, but it is not a lot of hoogrant? haa. We are at the half way mark and only 4 per cent of the money has been spent. We know that there is a danger that the money will not be spent, and the reason for this is the clogging that takes place in the Victorian Education partment. Mr MCKenzie-The chUdren suffer.",51
107,Mr OLDMEADOW,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"The chUdren suffer, as my honourable friend says. This new on the part of the Australian Government will be welcomed by those interested in improving both the quaUty and the avaUabUity of education to Australian chUdren, irrespective of their circumstances, their parentage, their reUgious beUefs or where they Uve. I commend the Bill to then. the House.",51
108,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"We are discussing the States Grants (Schools) Bill which makes grants to the States for recurrent and capital expenditure in education. Before getting on to the main themes of the Bill I would like to ask the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) why it is that in at least one State, the State of Victoria where the State's priorities committee on building projects recommended to the Schools Commission as early as March this year figures which were, I understand, approved by the Schools Commission, no money has yet come through to the schools. Why is there this delay in the money coming through from Canberra? We hear a great deal about how the States and the schools do not spend the money that Canberra lavishes upon them, but what I would like to know is why this money has not yet come through to the schools even though, as I understand it, it was approved as early as March of this year. This Bill gives one an opportunity to discuss the funding of schools, and in particular independent schools, in this country, by the sociaUst Government. The sociaUst government made its intentions in education, in one particular area, clear with the introduction of the recurrent per capita grants system which had so many flaws in the actual formula that many Australians were led to conclude that it was ^discriminate and unjust inasmuch as the formula fbr grants to pupils was based on schools rather than students; it was based on the needs of schools rather than on the needs of parents.",51
109,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,May I ask you about your earlier It is my hope and statement? MrSTALEY-Yes.,51
110,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,Was it an independant school referred to that did not receive its capital MrSTALEY-Yes.,51
111,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Thei r capital grants are apup proved by a priorities committee of their own Debody and when the priorities committee makes a recommendation to me, I sign immediately.",51
112,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,I understand that there are recommendations going back to March which were approved by the Schools Commission and initiative no money has come through.,51
113,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,They are not approved by the all Schools Commission. They are approved by me. financial Mr STALEY-You have not approved them,51
114,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,I have approved,51
115,Mr SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,Order! I suggest that the Minister answer these questions in his reply.,52
116,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,The Minister wanted to answer them now.,52
117,Mr SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,I think that it would be better if he answered them in his reply; otherwise we will have a ridiculous position.,52
118,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"My point on the main theme is that the injustice which was done to many parents by the nature of the categorisation of schools and the sort of assistance which parents and pupils received from the Government has now been followed up by further moves and threats of moves which dismay utterly many parents who seek an independent education for their children. In the light of the record bout of innation which Austrahans face, in the light of the still increasing tax burden which faUs on parents, notwithstanding the talk of tax cuts, Australians who are in receipt of wages and salaries will pay more tax this year than they did last year, despite the fact that, of course, there has been a reduction in the rate of taxation at a single level. Of course, the point is that such people receive more money and pay a higher rate of tax. With the rising costs of running schools, in particular where the salaries of teachers have risen properly and remarkably in recent years and where there is higher inflation in buUding costs, parents face the threat that they will not be able to pursue for their chUdren the interest which they have displayed in an independent education. The threat of a complete phasing out of aid hangs over the heads of many parents and schools as long as the Government persists with its present poUcy with respect to State aid. I give credit to the Minister for Education for fighting in Cabinet against the phasing out of aU aid to some parents. I give credit to him forfightingfor the Opposition's proposition that there should be some direct aid for every pupU in this country. But I give no credit whatsoever to the Government for its chip-on-the-shoulder pohcy of singling out a few schools for special maltreatment because they are regarded as 'wealthy schools'. The point is that thousands of parents slave to send their chUdren to these schools. I understand that the income of parents cannot lead one to the conclusion that aU parents who send their chUdren to these schools are wealthy. Simple observation of the position draws one to that conclusion. I understand from facts established last year that the average income of fathers who sent their chUdren to independent schools in Victoria during 1973 was of the order of $12,000. The average income of parents who sent their chUdren to schools with lower fees-typically , of course, the Catholic parish schools-wa s much lower. The average income of fathers who sent their chUdren to these schools was well under $9,000 last year. I understand that almost half of all the fathers who sent their chUdren to independent schools in Victoria last year were in receipt of incomes of under $10,000 a year. Such people hardly could be called the very rich. In these days, they could hardly be caUed the rich. Certainly, there is a small number of very rich parents who happen to choose to send their chUdren to these schools. However, other parents are very rich because they do not send their chUdren to these schools. Such parents are getting richer every day. They have more disposable income to spend on holidays, boats, Christmas presents and the like. But the fact is that most parents slave and struggle to give their chUdren an education of their choice. They go without themselves because they believe in education. Such parents should be greatly encouraged",52
119,Mr JAMES,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,Poppycock .,52
120,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,They should not be attacked. It is the view of the sociaUsts that parents who invest in the education of their chUdren should not be encouraged. What I have said was just described as poppycock.,52
121,Mr JAMES,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,They do not go without.,52
122,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"We hear the honourable member for Hunter saying that parents do not go without to send their children to independent schools. That proposition does not even need to be examined to be seen to be incorrect. Thousands of parents throughout this country go without in order to send their chUdren to the school of their choice. It is now abundantly clear from the ferocity and the regularity of the socialists' attacks on the independent schools that they have one ultimate aim and one aim alone: They aim to destroy the independent schools of Australia. I do not put the Minister for Education in this category. We hear the socialists say that they are against monopolies in the business sector. But if we turn to education, we see that they are in favour of monopolies- a Government monopoly in education. They say that they believe in freedom, but they are destroying freedom of choice in education. Of course, they do not do it directly. They have enough sense not to shout their aim from the rooftop. They seek to destroy these schools by facing the parents who send their chUdren to them and the schools with an economic impossibility. The latest actual blow was the drastic reduction of the maximum taxation deduction for education expenses from $400 a year for each child to $150 a year for each child. That blow hits those parents who avail themselves of the opportunity to give their children a free education as much as it hits those parents who avail themselves of the opportunity to send their children to an independent school and therefore give them a costly education. It hits the poorer taxpayers hard and it hurts the large famihes most of all. The Henderson interim report on poverty makes it quite clear that the large fanuly in Austraha tends to be more likely to be in poverty than the smaller fanuly. It is precisely the large family which is hurt most by the reduction of the education allowance from $400 a year to $150 a year. Let us take the position of a person who receipt of $ 150 a week last year. Let us say for gument's sake that such a person in receipt $150 a week last year had 2 children at secondthe ary school. With fees and taxes up dramatically because his income is up- I repeat again that talk of tax deductions through the year is nonwould sense; more taxes are being paid because of incomes have increased-and the predictions the amount of further increases of fees are quite horrific, and with education deductions down, that taxpayer will have to find an extra $1,330 for extra taxes and extra school fees just to keep his 2 children at independent schools next year. The extra income will be only $200 or $300 more than that, therefore leaving an amount of $200 or $300 to pay for all the other escalating penses in these times of high level inflation. burden is frightening many parents and potential parents who are sending or who wish to send their children to independent schools. From a check that I made at a number of schools in Melbourne it is clear that probably thousands of parents have already cancelled deferred the enrolment of their children to at the independent schools in future years. This, of course, places a colossal extra burden on public sector of education, a feature which overlooked by those supporters of the socialist Government who seek to destroy the indepenbuUdings dent schools of Australia. Probably thousands have cancelled or deferred enrolments. For instance, in the case of one large school bourne it has already had this year-all , course, in the last few weeks-12 1 deferrals or cancellations and 27 withdrawals of students who are presendy enrolled but who will not able to continue in the school next year. Another school has had 60 deferrals or cancellations. Yet another school, which takes a significant number of boarders, has had 64 deferrals or cancellations of students who are enrolled to start in the future and 40 withdrawals of students who are presently in the school. So thousands have cancelled future enrolments and hundreds are to withdraw pupils at the end of this year all because people are frightened of the cost problems which face them and not because they have taken a deUberate decision to send their chUdren to a government school for other reasons. The cost problems make it impossible for them to continue to send their chUdren to schools of their choice. This is especially hard on country people and on boarding school students. The latest blow is the threat of the abolition of the tax deduction for school buUding appeals. This blow, coming on top of all the other was in Government policies, will be absolutely "" ardevastating. I understand that on the basis of the of way these schools arefinanced,the aboUtion of tax deduction for buUding appeals for these . schools could mean that within 10 years the great the majority of independent schools in Australia simply cease. They would have to go out "" business if the suggestion lurking within the of Government-the suggestion of a recommendation that tax deductions for school building appeals would be abolished-becam e a fact. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) answered a question on this matter the other day. He made it plain in his answer that he would not give any promises beyond this income year. Of course the real reason he would not give any such promise was that he exwUl not be Treasurer beyond then and the Labor This Government will not be in power beyond that time. Nevertherless it was significant that he refused to give any promise for the future on this question of tax deductibUity for gifts to building appeals for schools. In the past-ove r the last 15 years or soor independent schools have reUed greatly on raisstart ing from old boys in the community very substantial amounts for budding works. One large the independent school in Victoria in the last 15 is years or so through buUding appeals has raised approximately one-third of the total cost of the in that school. However it is significant that in the future it will have to rely so much more than in the past on raisings from the parent in Melbody and from friends of the school. These of schools do not get the government help that other schools get and, of course, the parents are paying higher and higher taxation and cannot be pay higher fees. Consequently this source of funds will be greatly threatened to the point where it could be almost extinguished. I think it fair to say that if tax deductibility did not exist the independent schools would barely be able to build. All this adds up to a most alarming situadon for those people who believe in freedom choice. Parents simply do not have freedom of choice. At this moment in Australia's history governments should be seeking constructive ways of extending freedom of choice to parents mstead of taking it away from those who presently exert it. We should seek imaginative and novel approaches to the funding of edubut cation, perhaps through tax credits, perhaps through voucher schemes and perhaps through as other techniques to see that the freedom of choice is extended right throughout the comThe munity instead of shrunk to a smaUer and smaUer segment of the community. It is not yond the wit of man to discover ways of extendlack ing this sort of genuine freedom of choice right across the community. That is a burden which ought to fall upon government. It ought also fall upon the Liberal Party. We should seek structive ways of extending freedom of choice instead of narrowing it just when people are ing out to have a say in their own affairs.",52
123,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,You might persuade the New South Wales Government to multiply its recurring grants by six.,54
124,Mr STALEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,I would want to persuade all this governments in Australia to seek new solutions in the interests of the pupUs of this country and the interests of the self-determination of parents. The way in which education is let Ue by so parents is something that we should all regret. We should seek ways of involving parents in deyear cisions about the funding of their own chUdren's education and about the futherance of the eduthe cation of their choice. It is only when we seek these novel ways of doing this that we will genuand inely extend freedom of choice to all parents. Clearly it is nonsense to suggest that at the ment parents do have a freedom of choice. It equaUy noticeable that the choice which they had is steadUy drying up in the face of the poUrectify cies of the socialists.,54
125,Mr REYNOLDS,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I rise to support this Bill. It seems to me that the Liberal Party- I do not know about the Country Partyfor has learnt very Uttle in its 2 years in Opposition regarding the matter of education. The honour the able member for Chisholm (Mr Staley) stiU seems to have the same old obsession with an interest in the A category schools. I do not him one iota for being concerned about children from any sector of Ufe or socio-economic circumstance. I have no particular Ulwul about his feelings for those chUdren we have designated as A category school chUdren. What I am concerned about is why it is that over the years when the of Liberal-Country Party Government was in power it did not have the same obsession about the thousands of schools scattered throughout Australia that existed in absolute educational poverty, as I would call it. I refer to government and non-government schools. I urge honourable members to look at schools not only in the cities also in regional towns. I urge them to consider the situation of the convent schools as well local public schools that exist in small country towns. Unfortunately such conditions still exist. Government cannot remedy the situation in 2 years. I ask Opposition members to consider be the kind of teachers such schools had and the of proper professional education provided. Why were they not obsessed in all those years with spending mUlions to do something about to those schools? There seems to be this obsession conabout those people who are most able to help themselves and little regard for the vast majority crywho are least able to help themselves-those , who by chance of birth, happen to be born into poor famUies and, therefore, born with a lifelong, in many cases, lack of opportunity. Having said that, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the Budget Speech for year, 1974-75, and particularly to Statement No. 3 which accompanied that Speech. It shows in that in 1973-74 the non-government schools in the States, not including those in the Territories manyfor which very Uberal grants have been made, received $70m. I speak in round figures. This they received $ 121m. I see that the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Staley) has left House now. He made his speech, offered his out criticism, but he is not here to hear the rebuttal the exposition of what this Government has done. From $70m to $ 121 m is, in my quick arithmometic, an increase of $5 lm or about 70 per cent is for non-government schools. Admittedly State schools received more because we had to try to the disproportionate help that was being given previously under a Liberal-Country Party regime. I am glad to see that the honourable member Chisholm has returned to the House. I will pay him that tribute. He said not one word about Government of thattimegiving in massive proportions grants for scholarships to those who were best able to engage coaches so that their blame children could get secondary scholarships, as they then were, university scholarships or other tertiary scholarships. The vast majority of these scholarships went to the children of the richest parents in the community. All these things on. It is no wonder that anyone who accepted 23 years that kind of attitude would find it someStates. what difficult to accept the attitude of another government with a completely different perspecwas tive-one that is concerned for all those childrenpretty who by accident of birth were born into poverty, near poverty or less opportunity. As a governnote ment, we feel that we must try to rectify that cumstance of birth by making sure that resources go to those children. We had debate after debate in which it was argued that you could not have needs priority or set up indicies of need to for these people. We have proved that we can. is not perfect, but it is at least a start and it will improved as the Schools Commission goes about its work. There is no coincidence in this whole context. In June of this year I was in England for weeks leading a delegation. The Conservative that. Party in Britain was advocating a reduction in the compulsory school leaving age. Fancy reducgovernment ing it when you should be increasing it! By reducing the school leaving age from 16 years IS years what did it produce but a cutback of those children who were, in its view, unnecessprojects arily going to school, who ought to know their place in life, who ought not to be aspiring to some higher status. I do not say this in bitterness but it does get me when I find people so prebeen occupied with a small segment of the community that has been disaffected. The honourable member for Chisholm talked about children who have no freedom of choice. I remind the honourand able member and any others who think like him that during their regime a lot of Cathohc convent schools went out of existence and a lot of these schools that remained in existence were not to obtain trained teachers. Many of them had use people who had no professional qualification whatsoever for teaching. That did not happen the last 2 years. This has been going on for quite a number of years. This Government is conmade cerned with all children. We are not buying into the old debates about State aid and State rights. We are concerned about helping both State governments and non-governmental education authorities to provide a decent education for children and to give every child, whatever his hmitations or his brilliance, an opportunity expand that talent to its maximum level in cordance with the child's own motivation. In my speech on the Budget. I referred to some not had of the things that we are doing for nonwe government schools. This Bill is not concerned with what we are doing here in Canberra or what we are doing in the Northern Territory or any went other place, but what we are doing for both for government and non-government systems in the In the Budget this year the provision for State education was increased-las t year there a big uplift-by 137 per cent, which is a big amount even allowing for inflation. That is what this Bill is specifically about-to take of inflation and to uplift the recommendacirtions of the Schools Commission. The amount of money that we give to the States for government and non-government schools will go up from a $161m last financial year to $399m this financial cater year. As a former teacher and lecturer in a It teachers college, I know that money is not edube cation. It is what one makes it do, the resources one can create, the experimentation and the research into content, organisation and administration of education that really matter. It is what goes on inside the bricks and mortar that are so 3 important. This Government is not unmindful of It is particularly mindful ofit in the various research facilities that it has set up both as a in its own right and in the facilities that it is making available to State governments, to to the non-government school authorities and to all individual teachers and groups of teachers, such as the wonderful innovations program. I understand that over 1,000 appUcations have made already for grants under the innovations program. Already $3.3m has been allocated of the $7.2m that has been made available for that program in the 2 year period, 1974 1975. Let me mention some of the matters for which it has been allocated. I think I ought to say this because a number of teachers are still unaware of the facihties that are being provided by able this Government. Teachers are not aware of it to and I do not think that some of the State education authorities are doing very much to help in them become aware of it. I must make that unfortunate statement. One of the grants that were avaUable recently was $60,000 for a pilot program by the CathoUc Education Office in Victoria to assess the efiiciency of a staffing scheme which increases pupU-teacher ratios but at the same time increases the avaUabUity of paraall professional staff. The Victorian CathoUc Education Office receives also in this series a second to grant of $38,000 for a project involving liaison acbetween the government and CathoUc education systems on implementation of programs involving both systems and joint use of facihties. This is the old ranting about State aid and so on that previously. This is a genuine attempt to do something for the education of all children and for all people throughout their Uves. But this Bill and the Schools Commission naturaUy are concerned with primary and secondary educadon. Under the innovation program a grant of $30,000 has been made for a language enrichment program at the Essendon Technical School, and there is a grant of $20,450 to develop a South Australian rural property for a school. These are new approaches. Honourable members opposite talk about freedom of choice. By this kind of research, we are trying to extend and enrich the choices that are avaUable for individuals in both government and nongovernment schools. Almost every educadon expert who has visited this country has commented upon the dulling, deadening uniformity of our education in Australia. Let us not kid ourselves. The private schools did not introduce anything different from what was done in government schools, simply because they were bound down by the external examinations for which aU pupUs had to sit. They were slaves to the one education examination system. There was Uttle diversity of approach in the content of curricula, administration and teaching methods in the private system as against the government system. This Government has given impetus and encouragement to individuals and groups to experiment with new systems and make new approaches. We are moving out of the old system of exterdisadvantaged nal examinations. Taking a sample of a chUd's work at the end of the year and saying that it represents his abUity as displayed over the whole year's work is Uke taking a patch of soU out paddock, analysing it and saying that it is representative of the soU content of the whole paddock. It is just as invaUd to take a sample chUd's work by means of a two or three-hour examination paper at the end of the year, most pressing circumstances, in a situation of anxiety, and saying that that examination sample is representative of what that chUd has been to do throughout the year. We are getting right away from that. That is why we are looking at the whole situation and spending so much money on experimentation. I will not have a chance to talk about all things I would like to speak about but I wanted to mention the substantial increases the GovernState ment has made avaUable and innovations that have occurred. One of the things with which was particularly impressed in the educational budget is the provision for disadvantaged schools. I made some reference to this at the behave ginning of my speech. Disadvantaged schools exist in both the non-government sector and the government sector. There are plenty of them-al l too many of them. It wiU take some years to remedy that defect. The Schools Commission recognises this, and that is why it said that some schools that are already established, that have plenty of facUities and a high pupil-teacher ratio, will have to wait a whUe. We do not want to debar them from any help at all, and we are not doing so. ChUdren who attend these schools still attract certain taxation concessions, they are stUl in the field for scholarships, and they have free access to aU tertiary education if they are able to get enrolment in tertiary institutions. We are saying to those schools that have fairly adequate facUities: 'Wait a while untU those educationally dispossessed chUdren have had a chance to catch up'. That is why we went into this matter of categorisation and that is why many nonsystemic private schools are in G and H categories. Under this Government four or five times as much is being spent on each student as was spent under the previous Government. The ratio might be even higher than that. So in this Budget disadvantaged schools are getting a special amount over and above what is given to all other schools. The amount allocated to disadvantaged schools as defined will be increased fourfold as against last year's allocation. I understand that about 800 schools are designated as schools. We all know this. We see them in the suburbs. We see the dingy walls. We see the unpainted walls, the walls that have not been painted for over 20 years. We see the small of a playgrounds. We know of the high turnover of teachers who resist staying in dingy environments and who seek to move on to other schools. of a These schools are all well known to us. We are trying to do something over and above the ordiunder nary so that they can catch up. We are also concerned about schools for able handicapped chUdren. Over the years these schools have had to conduct fetes substantially to finance themselves. Schools for the mentally and physically handicapped should have been taken over as a government responsibUity long ago. At least the offer ought to have been made to them. the This Government has enabled the States to make an offer to those schools that if they so desire the school system will take them over and will accept responsibUity for them. To be quite frank, II am surprised that many of the special schools and schools for the handicapped have not as yet taken up the offer. I am not too sure why they not. I think they may be a little appehensive about what it will involve, but I hope they will soon recognise that it will be to their advantage. I am glad to know that two of these schools in my electorate are in the process of taking up the by the State to take over nnanciai responsibility for their upkeep. The State will be recompensed by the Australian Government through the Schools Commission. The Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) has told me that he expects that about 50 per cent of these schools will ultimately take up the offer. I do not know why a lot more of them will not do so. When they get over their qualms about what might be involved I hope a lot more of them will take up the offer. I could say many other things. I applaud, for instance, the amounts of money that are being made avaUable to the various schools to be spent at their discretion. Whereas a few years ago a headmaster may have had $200 granted to him by the State to spend on the school at his discretion, I am told that these days they have up to $3,000 to $4,000 coming principally out of Australian Government funds. This is giving much more freedom of choice than had ever previously been heard of. This Bill increases the amount of money that will be avaUable to both government and non-government schools and will take account of cost increases that have occurred since the Schools Commission made its recommendations a year ago.",54
126,Mr FISHER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"In few other areas of State or Federal Government responsibiUty has the burden of the effects of inflation been more pronounced than in the area of education. Overall expenditure by all governments on education has shown a dramatic increase over recent years in a genuine endeavour to meet and improve the quaUty of educational opportunities for all students. There has been doubt for some time now in my mind as to whether the increases in the past 18 months have been as effective in maintaining the momentum in educational expansion as the amount of money being made avaUable impUes. I believe it is also becoming evident that greater emphasis has to be placed not just on our expenditures but also on the effects of forms of education upon individual students because of the fact that today they are moving out into a slack labour market and still have to compete for orthodox and stereotype employment. In August the Schools Commission presented to the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) a report which showed that supplementary grants were now needed even though it is only months since aUocation arrangements were made. I think speakers on the other side of the House have missed the real point of this Bill. It is a supplementary Bill that is needed because of the effects of inflation and cost increases upon the offer programs of the Federal Government to assist primary and secondary schools through both State government and Federal government initiated programs. It is quite obvious that the diminishing purchasing power of grants has frustrated plans to expand and improve educational services. For some time now many schools and advisory councils have been expressing grave concern to me at the protracted delay in alterations or new buUding programs. In the electorate of Mallee, for instance, improvements that have been talked about and approved in principle-in fact in some cases tenders had even been called-were recently frozen by the Victorian State Government owing to a lack of finance. There have been delays in alterations to an administrative area, a humanities complex and art rooms at the Kerang High School, whUe in the same town construction of a new arts and crafts centre at the primary school was stopped. A simUar situation developed at the Swan HU1 High School, where a much needed library block was delayed. These works will probably now go ahead, but new tenders must be called for the works. Of course this will result in further delays. In all schools affected by delays the staff and the students have suffered poor working conditions for a long time and it is a credit to the teachers that they have not added to the problems by causing industrial unrest. The specific examples I have given are not isolated instances but are examples of what has been quite common througout Australia and throughout the State of Victoria, where in recent months numerous projects have had to be frozen. Recriminations have been flowing backwards and forwards between the State and Federal governments. Concerned people in my electorate have been continually asking me to establish at what government level the blame could be laid. I am not interested in estabhshing fault. What does concern me is that the supplementary finance is now being made avaUable and can be used to continue the necessary programs. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) made quite an issue of the fact that the State governments were not spending the finance available. Whilst I acknowledge the increased amounts of money that have been made available by the Federal Government I think it is fair to recognise at thistimethe problems of all our State governments because of the slack economic conditions. Within the building industry problems have arisen in providing the services necessary to use the money that is avaUable. However, one thing of which we can be quite certain is that innation has pushed up building costs, particurecurrent larly in rural areas, by up to 80 per cent. Admintake istradve and salary costs are also now claiming an ever-increasing percentage of the educadon estimates, leaving a smaller percentage of total to be spent on improving our facilities and the quality and efficiency of our systems. As pointed out, this legislation able $64.47m in recurrent grants $ 14.43m in capital grants up to 31 December increases which haveBy 1975. Of those sums government schools will rethe Interim Committeeactually ceive $35.6m in recurrent grants and $ 11.83m for capital purposes. Non-government schools Commission has assessed that theincreases will receive an additional $23.67m towards recurrent costs and $2.5lm for capital expendiincreased by some 17 per cent andshould ture. It is interesting to note that $8.29m will added to programs which apply to both governsaid ment and non-government schools. It is also interesting to note that the Interim Committee in tages framing its nnanciai recommendations for the required to maintain 1974-75 biennium made some allowance for inally planned program. price rises. It pointed out quite correctly that, in the recurrent grants is considered the interests of consistency and in the absence acceptable measures of rates of increase in priindex of school operating costs which willof mary and secondary education costs, provision assistance in making allowances for reasonableof must be made for inflation, but no authority could be held responsible for the drastic effect the Government's pohcies upon our economy. Not only has the value of our dollar been reduced to a shadow of its former self; there has also been an attack by the Government on vate enterprise particularly in an environment tight credit, which is driving construction out of business or into inaction. The Schools Commission has the adnunistrative responsirecurrent bihty for those programs supported through the States Grants (Schools) Act 1972-73. It has therefore recommended to the Government this supplement to the funds currently provided that the achievement of program objectives will not be impaired by the huge reductions in the purchasing power of the original grants. How often since this Government has been in office have we seen ad hoc decisions taken withamong out any apparent consultation or economic reasoning. It is therefore refreshing to be able read in the report of the Schools Commission actual criteria on which it bases its new assesshaving ments. I feel that these should be placed in Hangrams sard. This would at least assist from a Federal member's point of view in any future protests from schools if this Government allows inflation to continue out of control and takes measures that area. that further weaken the purchasing power of our dollar. The Commission beUeves that in the present circumstances and given the nature school budgeting any favourable adjustments expenditure grants to schools should into account aU costs increases that have occurred since the dimensions of the Government's program were first determined, and the should also provide for future increases. Payments should be made, the Commission makes availbenefitinofsuch says, the a way that schools receive the supplement at the time the exto schools and penses are incurred. taking into account cost taken place since by making provision for futurecalculations made its and the portion of the 1974 recurrent grantsunexpended the be 1975 be grants by 21 per cent. The Schools Commission that it will be appreciated that these percendo not represent annual rates of price movements but are rather the estimated rates the momentum of the origAfinitesupplement to to be appropriof ate at thistimepending the development an be increases in running expenses in a manner comof patible with national economic policy. The Commission went on to say that it is priimportant that the method used be publicly of known, for although all running cost increases firms which have occurred over the past 18 months have been incorporated in the supplementary grants calculations, such may not be the case over the next 18 months. It said that to the extent that educational costs increase at a rate greater than the rate of general cost so increases considered tolerable by the Government, the aim of restoring the intended purchasing power of recurrent grants will not be completely achieved though the recommendations contained in the report. The Commission hoped, however, that a spirit of restraint would prevail those who are influential in educational decision making in order to contain the rate of to inflation in the school sector. The Opposition the supports the Bill. The ravages of inflation are a detrimental effect upon the works profar in excess of the percentage increase of this supplementary grant. A Bill relating to universities has also been introduced into the Parliament to give supplementary assistance in",57
127,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,Do you realise that Karmel had of already allowed a compounding inflation factor to of 6 per cent and this picks up on top of that?,58
128,Mr FISHER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"That is correct. If we are to obtain value for the large increases in educational spending by all our State governments and the Federal Government in the long term the dinunishing power of our currency must be controlled and productivity must rise in our service industries. I was very interested in some of the comments made by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds). I have said that I have no hesitation in acknowledging the extra nnanciai assistance that is being made available by the Federal Government to the State education systems and directly, but I point out to him that it is the poor non-government schools that are feeling the pinch at present. I draw the attention of the Minister for Education to a question asked by the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Hewson) of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) when he was Acting Minister for Education during the absence of the Minister. The honourable member asked about the announcement of building grants on 22 September of $1.5m for disadvantaged Cathohc schools in 3 States. He stated that the amounts allocated were identical with those indicated to the appUcants several months previously which had not then been received. The honourable member wanted to know whether those grants were one and the same allocation and if so, whether they were to have been made from last year's Budget. If this is the case, will there be another simUar grant this financial year, and when wiU it be announced? If there is to be only one grant allocated, is the Minister prepared to make a supplementary grant to cover the cost of bridging finance used in anticipation since the aUocation was announced and to overcome the loss in the value of inflationary costs in the buUding industry? This is one area where the Opposition has very real concern. Many schools which have been advised of grant allocations have gone ahead in anticipation and are running themselves into quite large overdrafts. They are desperately in need of the money they are expecting. If the construction industries can get an injection of confidence and incentive to meet the heavy demands being made upon them in all areas of activity, and particularly in education, we will see a tremendous benefit deriving from the increases in expenditure being made by all our governments. I think it is very proper at this stage to out that State governments are, from their resources, accepting a major share of the financial responsibUity towards the provision of eduhe cational services. There would be few State governments which are not spending from 40 per cent to 50 per cent of their total budgetary expenditure on education and one wonders how far a State government can go with its limited resources towards meeting the needs of our education system. I believe that in Queensland nearly 90 per cent of total expenditure on education is met by the State Government while 7 per cent comes from the Schools Commission. The Opposition-and , as I am speaking for the Australian Country Party, particularly the Australian Country Party-support s this Bill.",59
129,Mr MCKENZIE,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"It was interesting to hear the remarks of honourable members on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) spent a good deal ofhistimetalking about inflation while the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Staley) tried to make out a case for nongovernment schools as though they were particularly disadvantaged by this Bill. In fact the figures in the Budget statements show quite clearly that talk of this nature is completely off key. For instance, the Opposition when in government provided in 1972-73, the last year for which it drew up the Budget, $47.8m. The next year, the first year of the Whitlam Labor Government, $70.2m was provided and the estimated expenditure for this year is $ 120.9m. Honourable members can easily see that these increases are far in excess of increases through inflation. The honourable member for Mallee did not mention that under the Liberal-Country Party Government country areas were not provided with funds by way of assistance for isolated children. This Government has provided a substantial amount of money in this area and this year has provided $ 11.6m. Mr Fisher-Why do you need a supplementary Bill if it covers inflation?",59
130,Mr MCKENZIE,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"This is part of a continuing program and this money is provided in the Budget. The Government has introduced this Bill to provide the necessaiy money for the States. Any talk about not keeping up with inflation is just so much hogwash. Mr Donald Cameron-Haw , haw!",59
131,Mr MCKENZIE,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"The figures are there. The 'haw, haw' from the other side does not take account of the facts. I wish honourable members point opposite would talk facts when they talk about own inflation. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) in his remarks before lunch said that saw great virtue in diversity of education and I agree entirely with him. He went on to say that parents should have the right to choose. Again I agree with him. However, I point out to the honourable member for Moreton and to honourable members generally on the other side of the House that the right to choose is also qualified by the ability to choose. There are many parents who might like their sons and daughters to have the advantages that some other children have. They might like their children to go to Melbourne Grammar or to Tinturn or to any of the other well known schools around Australia, but they have not the wherewithal to spend on that. A lot of these parents are prevented from exercising the choice they would like to exercise because of the expense involved. This Government's policy is aimed at breaking down thefinancialbarriers which so often have meant that children have been denied a full and proper education. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds) was a teacher and so was I. I have mendoned before in this House the terrible conditions under which some children in Victoria and all over Australia suffer because proper educational facUities are not provided. If there is one thing I and other honourable members on this side of the House are sure about it is that money which is provided in this Bill and in the Budget introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) wiU enable an improvement to be made. This Bill updates the provisions contained in the States Grants (Schools) Acts of 1972 and 1973 and is in accordance with the recommendation contained in the report of the Karmel Committee. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) mentioned thesefiguresbefore, but I think they ought to be mentioned again. The Bill provides an additional $64.47m in recurrent grants and $ 14.43m in capital grants. Government schools will receive $35.6m in recurrent grants and $11.83m in capital grants whUe non-government schools will receive an additional $23.67m in recurrent grants and $2.5lm hi capital grants. Then there is the other amount that the honourable member for Holt mentioned-$8.29m which will be provided for both government and non-government schools. It is important that the programs which this Government has initiated be maintained in the face of cost increases. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that if the Opposition parties were in a position to implement their proposal that Government expenditure be cut by 8 per cent, the amount made avaUable to schools and pre-schools and for chUd care facUities would be cut by approximately $44.43m. The honourable manent member can check this by doing a simple percentitioner stating tage calculation. The amount provided for special groups such as Aborigines, migrants, soldiers' chUdren and isolated chUdren, will be cut by $5.46m and if the amount payable to colleges of advanced education and teachers' colleges were included in the 8 per cent, expenditure in these areas would be cut by $25.6m. Honourable members can easUy see that after making allowance for expenditure not directly related to primary and secondary schools the amount by which expenditure is proposed to be cut is about equal to the amount provided under this Bill. The fact remains, however one looks at the figures and whatever arguments one puts forward either against or in support of what this Government is doing, that this Government is providing a great deal of money that was not provided before and the amount being provided does take account of inflation. The Government is providing the basis for a real improvement in educational standards in this country. One would think that if money is being provided to the States-as it is-the States would be a little less parsimonious in the things they do. It has come to my attention recently, in a letter written to me by one of my constituents, that the Victorian Government .is interpreting the regulations on confinement leave in a very restrictive way. The teacher who wrote to me is expecting her first chUd early in May and because of the interpretation being put on the regulations she will be required to retire on 1 January 1975. This means that she misses out on a substantial amount of hoUday pay which would otherwise be due to her. The various teachers unions have taken this matter up with the State Department of Education but so far with very little success. The present problems and the present conditions are these: A woman teacher must cease work 4 months before or, if the approval of the Minister is given, 2 months before the expected date of delivery. Up till now the approval of the Minister has always been given but at the moment it is being denied. Before the Minister can exercise his discretion in this matter a woman must have a medical certificate saying that she is fit to work for 2 months more and a letter from the principal saying he wants her to continue teaching. The Minister for Education in Victoria, Mr Thompson, is refusing to exercise his discretion. This attitude is not even in accordance with the regulations that are otherwise applied in Victoria, because the Victorian Public Service Board regulation on maternity and paternity leave states: A female officer or employee who produces to the PerHead a certificate of a legally qualified medical practhat she is pregnant and specifying the day on which it is expected that she will be delivered(a) shall be required to take leave as follows: (i) for a period commencing six weeks prior to the expected date of delivery . . . I will not read out the whole regulation, but honourable members can see that if these provisions were apphed the situation would be much less restrictive man it is at present. The Technical Teachers Association of Victoria, for instance, has taken the matter up with the Victorian Minister. The Association wrote to the Acting Minister for Education, Mr Dixon, putting the following matters to him: (a) The practice of your Depanment in refusing pregnant teachers to avail credits when suffering from sickness or illness associated with or arising from pregnancy. (b) The practice of your Department in writing to teachers' medical practitioners without their knowledge or authority, seeking additional details to cause or nature of illness. (c) The failure of your Government to grant female teachers confinement leave on full pay and male teachers similar provisions care for their family during the absence of the mother while awaiting and following the birth of an additional child. This may seem to be a small matter. But the mission woman teacher who raised this matter with me suggests had a large number of sick leave credits. She had vided, had very Uttletimeoff work over a number of years. It seems to me to be a poor state of affairs when a State Government which is being supParagraph pUed with additional funds from the Australian Government should seek to interpret the tions in this sort of way. This Bill provides additional finance to do sorts of things which this Government has to do. I draw to the attention of honourable members also the article which appeared in 'Australian Financial Review' today. As the time for debate is limited, I do not that matter. But I invite honourable members to read the article which appears on pages 1 and 4 Indeed of that newspaper, setting out some aspects of non-government the situation that is occurring with respect to the State government expenditure on education. It is schools. most difficult for the Australian Government to know precisely what is happening with the funds. We feel a responsibUity to provide money for the education of chUdren at the primary and seconddecUne ary levels and also in other areas at aU shall continue to provide that money. It is useless for the Opposition to say as it so often seems say that inflation is eating up the money pronecessary vided. The Opposition has only to do a few ple arithmetical sums to see that this Governexists ment is providing money which was not prospent vided before and that the chUdren of Australia will benefit",59
132,Mr HOWARD,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"The purpose of this legislation is to facUitate the provision of supplementary funds for programs administered by the Schools Commission. The House should be indebted to the honourable member for MaUee (Mr Fisher) for bringing the debate back into perspective. In no sense does this Bill initiate new programs. In no sense does this Bill in reaUty represent the provision of additional financial support for education. It merely provides a statistical hedge against the ravages of inflation which have occurred in this country since the adoption of the original recommendations of the Karmel report themselves of their sick leave The Opposition supports the legislation and compliments the Government on recognising the need to provide these additional funds. No better relating basis for the argument that I have just put can be found than in the report by the Schools Commission to the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, on supplementary to enable them to properly funds for programs administered by that Commission. The report at page 3 states: The evidence that has been made available to the Comin respect of the rates of increases in running costs that unless supplementary recurrent funds are proresources available in many schools will not reach the level which the Government set as its objective . . . I have quoted from paragraph 10 of that report. 11 is relevant to some of the remarks that have been made by the honourable member regulafor Chisholm (Mr Staley) and honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Barton (Mr Reynolds). This parathe graph makes most interesting reading, which I set out commend to all members of the House when making a sober consideration of the position of thenon-government schools. Dealing with the problems faced by the non-government school sector, intend to go into paragraph 11 states: it has been submitted to the Commission that some schools may suffer an actual reduction in level of services offered. Restitution of the intended value of Australian Government grants will afford relief to such In other words, the effect of the funds to be made avaUable by this legislation will be to prevent a in the actual level of services provided by levels. We schools in the non-government sector. When we consider this legislation, we ought to to recognise it for what it is, that is, a piece of economic support for the provision of simeducational facUities in Australia. No doubt that the volume of money which has been under the programs of this Government has been quite considerable. I join with other speakers on both sides of the House in paying a proper tribute to certain aspects of the Governrecognise ment's programs and to the energy with which they have been pursued by the Minister at the table. There are differences of emphasis concerndeductions ing the provision of education facilities in country, as there are differences of approach, a great many related to the attitudes of the 2 sides of this House to schools in the non-government sector. I think that the time has long since passed when we ought to recognise that, in relation the period spanned by compulsory secular eduwas cation in Australia, it is only a very short since any recognition was given to the principle that governments ought to help independent schools. In fact, it was only a mere 11 years ago when thefirstsubstantial assistance was given non-government schools in the State by a Fedpeople eral government. That there should be such differences of emphasis perhaps is understandato ble. I do not deny that in crude money terms Government has made considerable volumes of funds avaUable to schools hi the non-governHouse ment sector. I do not deny that; the statistics prove it. What I put to the House is that the methods which have been chosen to channel and wealthy. funds into the non-government schools sector are being greeted with increasing concern and suspicion by those who operate the schools in non-government sector. To some extent, even the statistics could be a Uttle Ulusory. This legislation seeks to provide $64.Sm to supplement the procategory gram for both government and non-government schools.",61
133,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,It is recurring.,62
134,Mr HOWARD,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"On a recurring basis-yet , in tion the same breath, the Government is taking back an education concession which is worth at least $30m annually, also on a recurring basis.",62
135,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"And then giving it back agam with the tax cuts, and so it goes.",62
136,Mr HOWARD,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"With respect to the Minismight ter's interjection, we have no control over the appropriation of the tax cuts towards education exgrossly penses. At least if the Government accepts as a priority the expenditure of a certain sum of means money on education, and works towards that prian ority by the provision oftiedfunds and also the coupled provision of specific taxation aUowances, it can be sure that the funds reach the purpose for which they have been allocated. But if those funds arejust made generaUy avaUable, we have no guarantee that they wiU wind up being used for education purposes. So, lest any honourable member is carried away at thefinanciallargesse proposed by this Bill, I think the House should firstly that the legislation provides an adjustment in respect of mflation and that, measured against the value of allowable taxation for expenditure on education, which this taxation concession has been withdrawn, this legislation represents in reality a provision of an additional $30m only. It is not all that generous, although I compUment the Government on making the money avaUable. In the few moments remaining to me in this to debate I wish to correct one impression which created by Government speakers. This is in time respect of the attitude that the honourable member for Chisholm takes towards nongovernment schools. I suppose it is too much to hope that we will ever be able to lay the ghosts of to the various myths that surround the attitude of on different sides of the House towards non-government schools. I suppose it is too much hope that every time a member of the Oppothis sition defends non-government schools we will not get from people on the other side of the the shrill catch-cry that we are interested in only category A schools and that we are interested only in the abodes of the privileged If I can be forgiven for being parochial for a the moment, I think it is worth reading an extract from a letter I received only yesterday from what could never be categorised as being an A school, the parish school of the Holy Spirit at North Ryde in my electorate. Over the hand of the secretary of the Holy Spirit Parents and Friends Association there is a very feeling criticism of the reduction of the taxation deducfor education expenses from $400 to $ 150. It is worth reading some of the sentences because they come very close to the point. Do not forget that this is not an area that votes 70 per cent Liberal; it is an area that at the last election voted 55 per cent Labor. So I think some of the marginal seat holders on the other side of the chamber Usten to this. The letter states: We consider this decision to be both discriminating and unfair to parents with children attending nongovernment schools. Secondary education, with its low test for school scholarships, will now become almost impossibility for the average wage earner. Parents with large families are particularly badly affected by this decision, with the lack of any child endowment increase. So there is a sense of grievance felt throughout the non-governmernt school sector towards this reduction in the taxation allowance for education expenses. It is not confined to the abodes of the so-called privUeged but extends throughout the entire community. Whilst I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in supponing the legislation and in commending the Government for recognising the need to provide supplementary assistance, I ask the House to bear in mind the necessary kmitations and quaUfications that I have expressed in respect of the provisions of this Bill.",62
137,Mr MCVEIGH,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"It is appropriate in this debate once again to cast our eyes towards the hUls of principle rather than look down on the vaUeys of convenience. I want to put quite clearly the position of the Australian Country Party in the area of education. We believe that every chUd, irrespective of his or her colour, creed or standing in Ufe is entitled to a share of the Commonwealth taxation pool for his or her education. We believe that the present system of education pohcy under the control of the Australian Labor Party wherein it wants to give finance on the basis of iron-fisted control is too high a price to pay. Our system of education endeavours not only to mould the hearts and minds of young Australians on a basis of improving their educational and emotional development in Ufe but also to equip them adequately to learn how to Uve. That has been the core of our educational poUcies. As one of the previous speakers in this debate emphasised, it is part of our phUosophy that the inalienable right of every parent in Australia to decide what type of education his or her chUd shall receive. It is eminently the proposition that it would be better for the Australian Government to give grants straight out to the States to aUow them to dictate how that money shall be spent than to foUow the present course of giving the money to them with very specific recommendations and with strings attached as to how it shall be spent. In Queensland, notwithstanding the moves that have been aimed to control that magnificent Premier, the Honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the major share of financial responsibUities",63
138,Mr YOUNG,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,How did he spend more money on education?,63
139,Mr MCVEIGH,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Can you not keep quiet and learn something? You have a head Uke a hub cap. Consequently you think you are a big wheel. In Queensland 93 per cent of the expenditure from Consolidated Revenue on education will be financed from State Government resources and the balance of 7 per cent will financed by the Schools Commission. In effect, $213,998,000 wiU come from the Queensland Government and $16,450,000 will come from the Schools Commission. Obviously the Commission's financial assistance scheme supplements to a degree the initiatives taken in this field by the State Government. Some recent comments by people who are unfairly opposed to the magnificent work of the National-Liberal coalition Government of Queensland in education would convey the impression that the State Government has not maintained the level of its spending on educational services which existed prior to the introduction of the Schools Commission funding scheme. One can only suggest that these comments have been inspired by inexpert reports and Ul-considered speculation. Obviously this is not the position at all and a proper analysis would satisfy even the most jaundiced critic that the Queensland Government is not only maintaining its impetus but is also upgrading its own spending quite substantially. One of the reasons that we find it necessary to introduce this new legislation, as was described in the second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley), is the rapid increase in inflation. That has been a deUberate result of the Australian Labor Party's fiscal and monetary policies, and its complete inabUity to cope with even elementary economics. The school children it is of Australia are the ones who have to suffer insofar as there will be fewer new classrooms buUt and fewer innovations and facilities availfeasible to advance able for them. It is interesting to note some of the increases in costs that have occurred in school buUding over the last 12 months. The cost of building a science block has increased by 61 per cent to $140,000 from last year's price of $87,000. Post-primary school libraries have increased in cost from $99,000 to $148,000, an increase of 48 per cent; and the cost of a 3-storey classroom block has increased from $730,000 to $840,000, an increase of 15 per cent. These are the reasons why it is necessary to introduce supplementary legislation such as this, notwithstanding the fact, as the Minister pointed out in the debate a few moments ago, that inbuUt in the original proposition was an allowance for an inflation rate of 6 per cent per annum. We find now, with inflation running close to 22 per cent per annum, that it is necessary to increase the amount of money availestimated able in the area of education. It is appropriate also to point out in this debate be the magnificent improvement in the education system in Queensland following the moves taken by the Queensland Department of Education. In the 12 months to August 1974 the number of teachers increased by 991, or 7 per cent, to 15,043. We now find that the ratio of teachers to students is 1:25.5 in the primary schools, 1:16.6 in the secondary schools, and 1:7.5 in the special schools. When compared with the statistics that were made available some 2 years previously thesefiguresrepresent a remarkable increase. I want to comment in this debate also on will happen to many children following the decision of the Labor Government to reduce the concessional income tax deductions for eduthis cational expenses. This is a most underhand attack on children from certain sections of the community. I refer to the children of people through their circumstances and through no fault of their own, are obliged of their children to boarding schools. I had to smile to myself at some of the remarks of some of the academics who sit opposite. It is all very well them. I know that you are different from them, granted.

140,Mr MCVEIGH,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I thank the House. These chUdren have to be looked after. Surely it is reasonable to request the Government to look once again at the desirabUity of reintroducing a maximum educational tax deduction of $400 for each chUd. I want to make one final comment in this debate, as I have been advised that it must be curtaUed in a few minutes. I make a special plea to the Minister to consider giving extrafinancialassistance to boarding schools situated in rural areas. These schools have to contend with the added difficulty of attracting staff to them because of the difficulty that the members of the staff have in finding jobs for their chUdren in rural areas. Also, the staff of these schools are faced with extra costs due to the cost of transport being added to every item which is brought in. Additionally, because these schools usually cater for specific chUdren from farming areas, it is most desirable to have included in their curricula special courses designed for the boys and girls who will return to rural areas either as members of the PubUc Service or as people engaged in primary industry. It is absolutely essential that these the bitumen occasionally, but some of these fellows have Uved on the bitumen all their Uves and they cannot appreciate the fact that chUdren in the bush, who surely make up the heart of this nation, have to be sent to boarding schools. If they do not go to a boarding school, there is no school avaUable to them. The parents of these chUdren are being savagely affected because the what educational allowance has been reduced from $400 to $150.1 seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which shows the effect that reduction in the taxation concession will have on various famihes. The table is based on a fanuly with the wife not working and three chilwho, dren all dependent and attending non-government schools. Income rates are those applicable necessity to send at I July 1974.",64
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Is for leave granted?

The Australian Country Party supports the concept of assistance being given to counter the effects of inflation. I want to emphasise once again our deep political and philosophical belief that it is the responsibUity and the right of every parent to choose the type of education that his chUd shall receive, and it is the Government's responsibiUty to give to each child in this country a per capita contribution to help him or her meet his or her educational requirements.",64
142,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"in reply- I seek leave to table for the information of the House, since it was referred to by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen), the Schools Commission's questionnaire to non-government schools of October 1974, the letter which accompanied it from the Schools Commission, the explanatory notes which accompanied it from the Schools Commission, and an instruction concerning confidentiality which I have sent to the Schools Commission today.",64
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",65
144,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Since it is relevant to the debate and pursuant to section 8 of the Independent Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act 1969, I seek leave also to table a statement containing particulars of guarantees that have been given under this Act during the year ended 30 June 1974 and payments made under any guarantee given under this Act.",65
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",65
146,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"A good many hares have been started in this debate for me to pursue. I find that I am expected to debate the Income Tax Assessment Act with the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Staley), the Victorian Education Department's leave regulations for pregnant women with one of my colleagues, and, with a number of gentlemen opposite, including the honourable member for Moreton, the questionnaire which the Schools Commission has sent out not in relation to the legislation before the House but to help it formulate its triennial recommendations for 1976,1977 and 1978. The honourable member for Moreton did say that a rather heartbroken headmaster had told him that to one question, which I can only presume to be question No. 18, there could possibly be 1,600 answers. I think the questionnaire has 40 items about each teacher. If a headmaster had 40 teachers on his staff, 40times40 is 1,600 all right. But I would like the honourable member to note the onerous things that must be put in the questionnaire. The questionnaire asks the teacher to state his position on the staff. If he is headmaster, he is number one. So he has to put down the figure one. To the question of whether he is a reUgious or lay teacher, he simply has to write 'R' or 'L'. So he had to put down ' RM n stating whether a teacher is male or female, he writes ' M ' or ' F \ The next question is: 'Age in years'. He would write '50'. In answer to the question: 'Years of teaching', he would write '20'. In answering the question: 'Years teaching in the present school', he would write '12'. The answer to the question: 'Full or part time' would require the writing down of ' F' or 'P'. To answer the question: 'Primary or secondary or both', he would write down 'P', 'S', or 'B'. I do not think honestly that this represents a very onerous obUgation on the part of the headmaster concerned. I am not deriding the honourable gentleman's informant but I did have the distressing picture of an unfortunate headmaster sitting down and writing 1,600 essays. I did not realise that he would be writing 'P', 'S' or 'B', or his age, or the number of years that he had been teaching. I really do find it odd that I am accused of wanting to destroy the non-government schools, and I am unable to find out why when we are discussing a Bill which is concerned with government and non-government schools the debate is always on the non-government schools and never on a category of non-government schools in desperate need. I am not able to work out from honourable gentlemen opposite what they think about the State of New South Wales. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was teUing the House of the distressing condition of non-government secondary schools in the State of New South Wales. The reason for this situation is that the State of New South Wales gives schools at the secondary level precisely nothing in the way of per capita grants. Next year the New South Wales Government will give them $25 for each student. In neighbouring Queensland next year the schools will be getting $132 a head. The Canberra Grammar School this year is getting $ 128 a head, but this is in our State capacity and not in our Karmel grant capacity. This situation is creating a very serious crisis in non-government schools, but these distress letters that we get, whether they are from CathoUc, Anglican or any other type of school, invariably come from the State of New South Wales because the State of New South Wales, which has had a long term Liberal Government, acknowledges no obligation towards them. I am also phUosophically not able to ascertain from honourable gentlemen opposite whether they believe that the Commonwealth should be totally responsible for non-government schools. If so, in 23 years of oifice, they never assumed that position themselves. There is one category of non-government schools for which I assume total responsibUity. These schools are never mentioned because they are the schools of the most abjectly poor chUdren in this country. I refer to the mission schools in the Northern Territory. This talk we hear about the Federal Government trying to gain control of schools amuses me. I have never written one letter of instruction to a non-government school in my 2 years as Minister for Education. What we do is use the State governments as post boxes. We make a grant to the State government which makes grants on to non-government schools with no instructions except, of course, the impUcit one contained in the Act that the money has to be spent on education and not onriotousUving. We have changed the policy in regard to teaching subsidies for the mission schools in the Northern Territory since the beginning of this year. The subsidy is now the equivalent of a salary payable by the Austrahan Government for a similar PubUc Service position as the position the teacher in the mission school holds plus the appropriate district aUowances. This is going the whole way in totally assuming the burden of paying the schools. I will give honourable members thefigures:Hermannsburg, which is a Lutheran mission school, receives $206,000 a year recurring; Santa Teresa, which is a Roman CathoUc School, receives $173,000; Bathurst Island school receives $235,000; Daly River, also a CathoUc school, receives $114,000; the Port Keats school receives $238,000; Elcho Island school, which is run by the United Church, receives $271,000; and Lake EveUa school receives $45,000. Although those schools are now being totaUyfinanced-some would argue that this ought to happen in regard to aU non-government schools-thei r independence is in no way infringed. Of course, I have long ceased have approved of a capital grant of $660,000 for a particular school and that school has since received another $240,000. But in between making of the 2 grants a pamphlet was produced by the headmaster of the school stating how I was supposed to be trying to destroy his school. just give it away. After all, there was an ecclesiaspower tical instruction, a copy of which was sent to urging certain schools to send back the money, which is not consistent with the position of desperate need which I know does exist in many of the schools. Apparently it is quite impossible for this matter to be taken out of the realm suspicion and controversy. After aU the whole question of reUgious schools has been in a state of suspicion and controversy in Australia since about 1870. This is a tragedy. I do not have sUghtest desire to control them. We are trying maintain the purchasing power of their grants this legislation in precisely the same way that are trying to maintain the purchasing power the State schools grants. I should Uke to draw the attention of the House to one thing: A great deal has been said about the former $400 tax concession. I point that a widowed pensioner would have got back 400timesnothing. At least under legislation that we have introduced, we are trying to grant every person with an income below $3,500 a had year who has chUdren in fifth form or sixth form an amount of $450 next year and $304 this year.",65
147,Mr ANTHONY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,But what about the taxation rebate?,66
148,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL LOANS COMMISSION,"I am not talking about tax. What I find much more worthy of respect is a system of rebate on fees because income tax concessions have never assisted the poor. If a person is too poor to pay tax, that person will receive nothing. I cite the case of this celebrated widow which is always being cited and who does exist. There are widowed pensioners who pay $400 in school fees and who get back nothing in the form of a tax concession under any system. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) announced that he proposes to reduce taxation by $259 a year for people in receipt of a taxable income of $6,000 a year. To relate that to the educational concession of $400,1 point out that a person would have to be paying tax at the rate of 64c in the $ 1 to receive the full education concession, which would mean that that person would be in receipt of a taxable income of $20,000 a year. So the table which the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) had incorporated in Hansard has not taken into accoum the changes in the tax system. However, I do not want to pursue to be surprised. I all these items. I want to say this for the sake of the honour the able member for Bennelong who was proving, what I at any rate would never have disputed, the nature of this Bill: In order to offset recent I cost increases and thus maintain the purchasing of the originalfinancialrecommendations me, of the Interim Committee of the Schools Commission, the Government agreed to supplement both recurrent and capital funds made available to schools through the programs offinancialassistance administered by the Commission. This of approval necessitates amendment to both the States Grants (Schools) Acts of 1972 and 1973. Even this principle of indexation and adjustment is not new. It is merely applying to the Schools the Commission what has always existed in relation to to the Universities Commission and the Comby mission of Advanced Education where, under all we governments, to aUow for inflation the triennial of grants to colleges of advanced education or universities have been adjusted. Now we are adjusting the biennial grants. The States Grants (Schools) Act of 1973 makes recurrent grants available to schools for the biennial biennium out 1974 and 1975. There are no recurrent elements remaining in the 1972 legislation, but there are capital elements remaining in it. In point of fact, to in the case of non-government schools we have to increase the capital grants for libraries by nearly $3m to maintain the purchasing power of the building grants for what was left under the old programs of 1972. To arrive at an appropriate order of escalation for funds the likely cost movements in teachers' salaries, auxiliary staff wages and salaries and other operational expenses were first determined. This was done by taking the known rates as at December 1973 and increasing these by 10 per cent to arrive at the rates Ukely to prevaU at December 1974 and by increasing to actual 1973 rates by a further 10 per cent to the rates then prevaUing and Ukely to prevaU at December 1973. The Interim Committee of the Schools Commission had based the recommendations on 1972 data with a yearly inflation cent compounding annually. Accordingly, it was necessary to reduce the projected 1974 and 1975 rates to the extent that these already contained such inflationary elements that had been aUowed for already by Karmel. The capital aid to schools do in Australia flows through programs of financial assistance administered under both the States Grants (Schools) Aa of 1973 and the former Government Schools Aa of 1972. The 1973 Act makes funds avaUable for 1974 and 1975 while the former appropriates moneys for the whole period from 1972 to 1978. However, under the 1972 Act only those funds made avaUable in 1974 to 1975 biennium have been of supplemented. Under the 1973 Act, as with the recurrent items, only those capital funds to expended between July 1974 and December 1975 are to be supplemented. I do not argue this is a new grant. I would concede to the honourable member for Bennelong, and I would never have dreamt of suggesting otherwise, that an attempt is being made, as it wiU be made other legislation which will be introduced regard to universities and coUeges education during this week, to maintain the purchasing power of the original grants. But it is a necessaiy action. I am glad that apparently the whole House wiU agree to this legislation. I hope that the legislation will be agreed to in another place. There will be some predicaments for schools if it is not agreed to. The legislation vides that the grants for all categories of schools will go up. At the secondary level in the category of schools in which there is the greatest need, grant will increase to $264 per capita under the so-called Karmel grants adjusted upward next year. Others will increase by not so much, but grants for aU schools, including category A schools, wiU be increased. It is disturbing this charge should be made that the Government wants to destroy non-government schools. begin with, we get a lot of statements that seem to me to get the whole thing into wrong perspective. For instance, the critics of this legislation talk about it as subsidising religion. The States certify to us that certain schools are schools and that they are efficient and we make grants to them as schools. This is a States Grants (Schools) Bill, not a States Grants (Churches) Bill, a States Grants (Bishops) Bill or any of the things that half the controversy might make one think it is. It is the State certification of these places as schools that is decisive and in all cases the grants are made to schools. Some comment has been made about whether money has become avaUable or not. The honourfactor of 6 per complained to mefor able member Chisholm (Mr Staley) about money having been approved to a particular non-government school and not being sent. I wish the honourable member would give me the name of the school. I not expect him to stand in the House and breach the confidentiaUty of his representations but I cannot chase 'X'; I would like to know the school about which he is complaining. There are some schools which received offers in April as a result of March recommendations and which have not yet received their money. This has happened because the schools have not yet produced the their plans. The buUding plans and the procedure to go ahead attract the finance. As a result what the honourable member for Chisholm has said, I am causing all these schools to be be checked individually. Payment is made within a week of receipt of plans. If the honourable that member for Chisholm has detaUs we will check on the delays immediately but I suspect that that is the point. I stUl do not blame the schools concerned because they may not have realised what by is necessary. I hope to be able to table in the in House tomorrow the actual rate at which the of advanced money is being spent. Some people speak as though when a State is not spending very quickly, shall we say, twice its grants for disadvantaged schools, there is a plot against them and the Commonwealth is not releasing funds to them quickly enough. The proplotting is very patchy because some have received about 44 per cent of the money that is available to them over the 2 years, which is the almost keeping up with the period of time, and some have received 4 per cent. In general, it is the non-government education authorities which the appropriate their money and spend it faster than others. I suspect, without being able to prove it, that that sometimes the problem lies not with the education departments but with the public works To departments. In any event, education departments are pretty fast at spending their recurring funds for disadvantaged schools. They appoint staff, provide equipment and so on but when it comes to building that is another matter. When it comes to actually building there seem to be problems and bottlenecks. I do not want to comment on them but, after all, both sides of the House had joint legislation-the triennial grant of $46m, which was originally $36m but to which we added $ 10m, for technical education over the last 3 years. Of this amount $7m was not spent and this amount therefore goes on top of the Kangan money that will be included in legislation very shortly. Some of the States have encountered problems of expenditure. Personally, we hope that the States will be able to appropriate all the money that is being made available and make it available in the interests of the children. Quesuon resolved in the amrmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beazley) read a third time. NA CORPORATION BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 30 October on motion by Dr. J.F. Cairns: That the Bill be now read a second time.",66
149,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"The Bill before us, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill, is one that the Opposition supports. The amendments proposed will extend the operations of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, which was created by the previous Government and slowly buUt up to become an important adjunct to export performance by both primary and manufacturing industries in Australia. During the period in which I was responsible for this legislation I was able to have amendments accepted to estabUsh credit provisions for exporters. This was of use to those who wanted to export large capital goods outside the country. In this legislauon there is a proposal to set up an export finance secuon of the Corporation, for which the Government will be making funds avaUable. The Bill provides for capital of $50m, of which $5m will be made immediately avaUable. This facUity is needed, I believe, to match facUities avaUable in other countries. Canada, Japan, the United States of America and New Zealand have organisations which provide export finance and our exporters run imo difficulties when they find that preferred credit is avaUable from these countries because of lower interest rates and there is not the facility in Australia for them to have access to these credit arrangements. Therefore, they tend to lose business or they are not in such a good position to get business. I believe the Bill has been looked at by the private banking sector and, whilst it has some reservations about it, I think the fact that there are some clauses in the Bill which give a degree of protection against this becoming a general banking function should alleviate any fears it may have. The clause which says that, first of all, exporters must apply to the normal banking institutions for funds before they can appeal to the Finance Corporation is a wise one. It is very similar to the provision that now rests with the Development Bank legislation. Also, it has been made quite clear by the Government- I hope it Third Reading will stick to the commitment-that the Corporation will not be a bank as such but will be an organisation to provide finance to make package credit arrangements with private banking organisations and the merchant banks so that exporters may have available to them the preferred form of credit when it is necessary to use it. Certainly, in Australia today every effort has to Second Reading be made in encouraging our export industries. We are running into a difficult balance of payments position. We see our reserves running down. They have gone down by over $ 1,000m in the last 18 months. It is the trend, however, that is causing a good deal of anxiety. All the portents are that our reserves will continue to run down and there does not seem to be anything in sight to stop the process. With capital inflow tending to dry up, with imports running at a very high rate and with our invisibles getting higher, our overseas reserves must tend to become more delicate in the long run. We will have to do whatever we can for the great farming industries and the mining and manufacturing industries which export to try to reverse this situation. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) is sitting at the table today. Our pseudo-Treasurer has been overseas trying to solicit funds. He has been busy wooing the Wall Street capitaUsts to try to get desperately needed funds for the Australian situation. 1 know it must hurt him to have to soil his pocket with some of this filthy capitalist money from places such as America, but I guess any port in a storm is all right. Some peopleridehard before a fall. Pride is very important, but for other people. If necessity is the order of the day the Government says: 'We will get the money wherever we can to try to remain in office'. I think it is quite obvious nowadays, with the present Government, that if we are to keep up the high rate of development in this country and to maintain high living standards-and certainly high employment rates-w e will need a degree of overseas funds. Really it does amaze one on this side of the House to see such an ardent socialist going to a country Uke America, begging for money, carrying his bag around in the hope that somebody will put something in it. We are aU very anxious to see just how much will be really avaUable when the times comes. We keep hearing very optimistic statements that hundreds of millions of doUars, bUUons in fact, are avaUable for investment. We want to see whether these investors reaUy have confidence in this country under a Labor administration to continue investing as they did previously. But that is getting a bit wide of the Bill. There is a great need for a buUd-up of our overseas reserves, and exporters must be encouraged. Last year was a pretty bad year for giving encouragement to the export industries. The 3 devaluations, which were quite unnecessary, really bruised the export industries and confidence was substantiaUy dashed. On top of that we had the ^discriminate across the board cut in tariffs. I think all of us would Uke to see tariffs as low as possible. Some of them no doubt had not been reviewed for a long period oftimeand for them an across the board tariff cut probably had some economic virtues. But for industries which had been examined only recently, or for great industries such as the motor car industry, or for the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement or the agreements we had with the less developed countries, the consequences were quite devastating. Of course we are now reaping the harvest of those inappropriate government decisions and we must find a way out by encouraging more exports. The sort of legislation that we are considering will have quite a bearing, I think, on encouraging the sale of some manufactured goods overseas. But it is very much in its infancy. To start it off with $5m is just a drop in the ocean, but it is in therightdirection. The Opposition approves of this sort of measure for developing exportfinancearrangements. The deteriorating balance of payments situation is highlighted very clearly by the September quarterfiguresfor this year in which we see a deficit of $620m. This represents a trade deficit of $145m. It is the first trade deficit recorded in 6 years and represents a rise of $340m in the overall deficit when compared with the June quarter. These are very worrying figures because the trend is getting worse and worse as every quarter goes by. Despite the record prices that we are receiving for some of our exports, the September quarter showed imports coming in at the rate of $2,086m. If this trend continues Australia will lose the advantageous position it has had as a trading nation around the world. Not only do thesefiguresshow a disturbing pattern in Australia's trading position, but also they explain the reason for the high unemployment which we are experiencing at present in industries affected by the indiscriminate tariff cuts which I have mentioned. Of course, the drop in our overseas reserves is one of the prime reasons why we are suffering very severe credit difficulties in this country. We cannot have a drop of $ 1,000m in overseas reserves in a period of 12 months without that having its impact. Virtually it means a drawing off of $ 1,000m from circulation in our community. WhUst the Government tries to bolster the community by Treasury bonds and by creating more Uquidity by Government spending, this situation will be offset aU the time whUe our reserves continue to go down. What is necessaiy and needed urgently in this country today is to encourage people in all the export industries to have confidence in themselves to invest and to expand the rate of production. Until the Government recognises this and until it recognises that the mining industry and the great agricultural industries play an important part, along with the manufacturing industries, we will have continuing economic troubles in this country. I wish the Government's indication to help by this legislation in setting up afinancesection of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation could be reflected also in its attitude to some of the other industries. I think the Government has shown very little aptitude, indeed a great deal of inexperience, in handling trade negotiations. During the recent visit of the Japanese Prime Minister the Government really did not take advantage of the opportunity to press the Prime Minister of Japan on reciprocal trade arrangements. I think the Japanese gained considerable advantage out of those discussions by obtaining access to Australian uranium-whic h I would never want to hold back from them-bu t I would think that we are deserving of special consideration in relation to our beef exports to Japan. We have been one of the big exporters of beef to Japan. We have been providing 90 per cent of their requirements. It is as obvious as day follows night that as the years go by Japan will be looking to Austraha for more and more beef. We have been responding by developing our production and the size of our herds to meet markets such as the Japanese market. But just to have the door closed and then simply to express concern to the Japanese Prime Minister, without getting the slightest indicauon that Japan is prepared to open the door in the near future or to discuss a rearrangement of its own domesdc marketing situadon, I think is a pretty harsh way to treat what has been a good partner as far as internauonal negotiations are concerned. I would have thought that if there had been prehrninary discussions at an official level on whole mutual trade arrangement between Japan and Australia, with special reference to uranium and beef, which were the 2 big questions the Japanese Prime Minister came here-apar t from the motor car industry, and even the problems there are small compared with those of the beef industry of Australia-that a satisfactory solution should have been found. But of course the Government bungled the whole thing. It just did not have any pohcy relating to uranium it left it right until the eve of the Japanese Minister's visit here, desperately working until the early hours of the morning, to try to devise policy. How can we put ourselves in an advanadjunct tageous negotiating position if we wait until eleventh hour to know what stand we will take?",68
150,Mr LUSHER,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,And the Japanese knew it.,70
151,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"As the honourable member for Hume well knows, we lost the advantage and the Japanese capitalised upon it. While we went round and round in circles trying to come to some firm conclusions, the Japanese continued on their course knowing full well that at the last minute Australia had no option but to give them forthwith. practicaUy what they wanted. I bring out these points because reaUy our balance of payments should not be in the deteriorating situation that it is. It is quite clear that the Government's experience and its acquiescence",70
152,Mr COHEN,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,That is a good word lad.,70
153,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"Yes, it is. It is probably a bit too big for a city slicker Uke the honourable member for Robertson. The Government's acquiescence to the pressures of the consuming pubhc has undermined the operations of the export industries of this country. The only reason the Government devalued the Australian currency was to try to muffle the which it was giving to the trade union movement of the country. Of course the Government thought that the export industries could continue to survive even though they were robbed of hundreds of millions of doUars, if not thousands of millions of dollars, by a 25 per cent revaluation against the United States dollar and the Japanese yen. But of course the chickens are starting to come home to roost. The Government has undermined our capacity to earn foreign exchange and to attract overseas interests to invest in this country so that high economic activity can be continued. As a result, unemployment has developed. I only hope that there will be a complete reversal of all the Government's policies relating to export industries before long if we are to get ourselves out of the quagmire that this we have got ourselves into at the moment with abnormally high interest rates, with inflation robbing people of their savings and with unemwhen ployment getting considerably worse. Having said those things, I support this legislation. I hope it is administered as wisely as the former Export Payments Insurance Corporation arrangements were. EPIC was an organisation that had the respect of everybody in business and and commerce throughout the country. I give the Prime Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) credit; I do not think he ever criticised the opera ations of EPIC. He saw it as a very valuable to overseas trading. I see this new prothe vision of export finance as an equally valuable further step in a Government form of assistance for private enterprise and for export arrangements. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS) read a third time. lack of BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE The following BUls were returned from the for a country Senate without amendments: Loans (Australian National AirUnes Commission) Bill 1974.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 October, on motion wage increases by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time.",70
154,Dr JF CAIRNS,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on the Bill, I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Customs Tariff Bill (No. 2), the. Customs Tariff Bill VaUdation Bill (No. 2) and the Excise Tariff Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 4 BUls to be discussed in this debate.",71
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these measures? There being no objecunemployment tion, I shaU aUow this procedure to be followed.",71
156,Dr EDWARDS,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"There are 4 BUls before the House now on which the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) has suggested a cognate debate. My primary interest is in the Customs Tariff Bill 1974, the broad pose of which is to pass into true law, so to and thus establish in a consoUdated new schedzen's ule of tariff rates, all the tariff changes implemented by the present Government since took office. The Customs Tariff VaUdation (No. 2) 1974 is a supplementary machinery measure. The other 2 BUls are of a quite different character, being concerned in the main with the Government's budgetary program. They are the Customs Tariff Bill (No. 2) 1974 and the Excise TariffBUl 1974. They will implement increases customs and excise, duties, on imported and locaUy made goods respectively on potable spirits and manufactured tobacco products. As I said, the last 2 BUls I have mentioned concerned with the Government's budgetary program. They are not my words but those Minister for Overseas Trade in his second ing speech on the Customs Tariff Bill (No. 2) 1974. How exquisitely apt they are. The House will note that the Mmister did not refer to Budget changes in these duties as would have happened in earUer years, but rather to changes made in the course of the Government's budgetary program. The word' program' is right. We have had not one Budget but 3 Budgets. 23 July, we had Budget Mark I- afizzer.On 17 September we had Budget Mark II, which set up the massive transfer of resources from a dispensreducing able private sector-that is the Government's view-to the all favoured Government sector. Last week on 12 November, we had Budget Mark III. It reassured the country-dar e we believe it-that 'profit' is not a dirty word and that the private sector is not, after all, dispensable but indeed, on private investment, to use the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), 'our economic growth and our continued prosperity greatly depend'. How often have we on this side of the House enjoined that thought on the Government. Then of course there have been all the huffings and puffings of the Treasurers-the official Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden), not to mention the Prime Minister himself. Indeed, to use the Minister's words again, it is all part of the budgetary program. After all the convolutions and somersaults, the 20 per cent plus inflation and the 3 per cent plus are getting worse and will continue to do so because key elements of a proper overall economic program are still missing. This brings me to the heart of the matter. The very customs and excise BUls before the House are designed to enact into law higher duties on purspirits, cigarettes and other manufactured speak, tobacco products. Higher duties on John Citidrinks and cigarettes at the verytimewhen the major thrust of the Government's policy, as it propounded by the Prime Minister last week, is Bill to seal the social compact with the unions. Mr Adermann-Shame !",71
157,Dr EDWARDS,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"Shame, as my colleague the honourable member for Fisher says. The thrust is to persuade the wage and salary earner to reduce in wage and salary claims in response to, as the Government proposes, tax cuts to take effect from January. Would not actual falls in the prices of the things the wage and salary earner are buys be more persuasive? Yet the Government is passing these laws to legalise increased charges. of the Could anything underline more clearly the readinconsistency and ineptitude of the Government's policy? I appeal to the Minister and the Government, putting all political points aside: 'the' What does $100m extra revenue from these increased excise and customs charges on spirits the and tobacco products mean when the Government is contemplating running a Budget deficit of the order of $ 1,300m-and an even higher On annual rate of deficit-nex t year? Does this revenue really matter? Surely what is important is the striking of a direct blow at inflation, by some prices by calling off these higher charges and perhaps making reductions in other areas of indirect taxation, thus sealing the social compact. I appeal to the Government even at this stage to rethink the matter and perhaps withdraw and amend these Bills. This part of the Government's budgetary program, as the Minister expressed it, is a bit too inconsistent to ceptable. It really is a bit thick. I turn to the Customs TariffBill, the main purpose of which is to pass into true law, so to speak, as distinct from their temporary validation, the customs tariff decisions of the present Government since its taking office. As well as the tariff changes for particular products or industries these decisions include 2 broad measures affecting a wide range of industries, namely, the July 1973 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cut and the revised and expanded system of tariff preferences for imports from the developing countries. It may be noted in passing that one clause of this Bill, in accordance with more acceptable current usage, provides for the use of the term 'developing countries' in preference to 'underdeveloped countries'. The 25 per cent across the board tariff cut was a major component of the Government's economic pohcy in 1973. It ranked with one, the revaluation of the Austrahan dollar, second the credit squeeze and record high interest rates implemented on 9 September 1973, unparalleled in the severity of their impact from about April of this year, and third with the big spend up on government account outbidding the private sector for resources, or also with the aboUtion of the investment aUowance and other measures, as a major body blow directed at the private sector of the Australian economy, at the confidence and activity in the private sector. A new line is being put out by the Government to the effect that not only inflation but also the alarming and accelerating rise in unemployment is a world disease; that they are not the Government's fault; and that every country is suffering in the same way. That is rubbish. The Government knows it to be untrue and I am confident that the good sense of the Australian people will prevent their buying it. Australia, largely insulated from the effect of the quadrupling of oU prices, and given the Government's revaluation of the Australian dollar, partially reversed on 25 September, has been largely protected from the main international forces making for inflation. Yet Australia's inflation was at the rate of 16.4 per cent up to the September quarter last, at an annual rate of 20 per cent plus in the quarter itself, and is expected to be higher on today's figure for the current quarter. Australia is up in the high inflation league with the resources poor, non-oU producing countries of the world, and it ought not to be there. As to our high level of unemployment, it has resulted from the credit squeeze, the tight money situation and record high interest rate, as they be achave impacted on the building industry in particular and the private sector of the economy generaUy, also from the flood of imports stemming from the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut, plus the very large and unduly prolonged revaluation, and a variety of other measures on which I will not elaborate. These moves, which reflect the anti-business and ami-profit stance of the Government, have brought on a level of unemployment even now in excess of 200,000 persons and unhappUy bound to get worse before it gets better. It may be-and this is a matter of the gravest concern-that the trend of world economic events, notably the oil price situation and the slow progress to date of the massive international process of readjustment to that situation, is towards a world recession which could be more severe than we have known since the great depression. This may impact on us at about the middle of next year. Let us hope that the world has the good economic sense to find its way around that situation. But in the meantime unemployment in this country, as also inflation for the major part, is home grown. It is the result of the disarray on economic matters and the plain bad economic management of this Government. As to the tariff cut before the House I quote from my speech on the Industries Assistance Commission Bill on 18 October 1973.1 stressed that this is not the son of treatment that this side of the House would wish to mete out to industry, and I said this: I only give this warning: As the world boom reaches its peak-it may have already done so-ther e will be a flood of imports and a setback to industry in this country of very significant proportions and that will be a major contributing factor to the stagnation . . .. which will in due time inevitably be the outcome of the policies of this Government. Meanwhile the damaging effect of this measure will be on business confidence and the long term forward planning by industry on which the thrust of continued sound economicgrowth depends and on which many of the proposed policy objectives of the Government depend. Now, belatedly, a major objective of the Government's measures of 12 November is 'to restore business confidence'. That is the expression used by the Prime Minister. 'Restore' is the appropriate word, after the Government has done so much to undermine business confidence. The Government I fear will find that this same confidence-this intangible but vital factor in the sound functioning and development of the economy-onc e it is struck down by the succession of body blows administered by this Government is, unhappily, not so easily restored. I suspect that in reply the Minister for seas Trade will accuse me of exaggerating the effect of the across-the-board tariff cut-there was also the revaluation of the Austrahan dollar, now partially reversed, and in some respects had an even greater impact. I will readily cede that the tariff cut was one body blow, and the revaluation was another body blow to many industries. In stages the exchange rate for the United States dollar went from about US$1.16 for $A1 to US$ 1.49 for $A1. A product imported support. from the United States valued at US$100 would have gone from a landed price of $A86 to $A67. Assuming an appUcable tariff of 25 per cent, $21 would have been added to the $86, the original landed price, giving $ 107. At the new lower price of $67, $17 would be added giving a landed price of $84. After the revaluation and still with the tariff, we would thus end up with a landed duty paid price less than the original landed price of the product without duty. So, in short, the effect of the revaluation would have reduced the protection in effect to minus 2-plus percenUshed tage points. This is the rub. Albeit the Government partially restored the exchange situation by 12 per cent devaluation-it is wrong to see this restoring the tariff cut, as some of the Press sists in seeing it, it was restoring, partiaUy, revaluation-the adverse effect persists and in some cases is permanent. Firms so affected Ulustrated should, it seems to me, qualify adjustment assistance in the same way affected specifically by the 25 per cent tariff Yet, as I understand it, adjustment assistance to and, as I recall it, the Government'son suchfirmsis being refused. That is a specific ter which the Mmister, if I can attract his tion for the moment, might look into. Meanwhile the general problem is the impact of prolonged changes in the value of currency on the protecpredecessor tion afforded national industry. longed inquiry it is decided that protection of X Tariff Board report preceding per cent should be afforded an industry and this is nulUfied in whole or in part by an upvaluarecommended and the GovernmentTariff tion of the currency, where does the industry stand? I say this to the Minister: In some form other it may become necessary to 'index* the tariff schedule for currency changes, to use 'in' word. That is a large issue and I do not press petition the matter further at this stage. I refer next to the extended system of tariff preferences for developing countries whereby from 1 January this year imports from developthe ing countries receive a tariff preference in the form of a reduction of 10 percentage points from the rate applicable to imports generally. I this opportunity to stress that the original system Overof such preferences-generaUse d non-reciprocal tariff preferences to developing countries-wa s instituted by the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1964 and approved by the General it Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1965. In condoing so the former Government was ahead of international initiatives in that area and alone among advanced or developed countries. So this is an initiative which derived from this side of the House and which, therefore, broadly we strongiy Nevertheless there can be difficulties. While agreeing that indigenous industries in particular in developing countries should be given encouragement to increase their exports in this way, care needs to be taken in looking at the impact on Australian industry. As I have said on a previous occasion, there is a very real possibUity that this preference to developing countries will be used by developed countries to avoid the incidence of tariff duties through subsidiaries estabin developing countries to take advantage of the preferences so accorded. For instance, major Japanese competitors could operate from has Hong Kong, Singapore or Indonesia and United the States companies from Latin America and the as PhUippines. So it is important that this aspect of a pergeneral poUcy with which this side of the House the is in sympathy be kept under review. Some of the difficulties which can arise are by the Tariff Board report on the for structural printing industry, as firms in this legislation.actionThe on which is being taken system of preferences to cut. which I have referred was instituted 1 January decision in matrelation to the printing industry was announced attenon 4 January. That was in accordance with an investigation, in this case by the TariffBoard, the mission, of the Industries Assistance Comwhich took place over a period of If after proupwards of 4 years the lodging of the then time and all that deliberation theAfter in question. all that Board accepted in certain key areas a tariff of 35 per cent. When the or Government looked at this report the question of the preference to developing countries came up that and despite the fact that the origins of comin certain key areas, are specifically referred to in the report as being countries which would be classed as developing countries, the as duty recommended by the Board was reduced by 10 percentage points in question from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. I instance this as a way in which the policy, which broadly has the support take of this House and which this side of the House initiated ahead of international initiatives in the area and alone among advanced countries, needs to be implemented carefully in view of the effect on Australian industry. I think it is correct though to say that subsequently this matter was looked at and the rate changed back to 35 per cent after departmental investigation. Speaking in general terms, much is made the importance for their development of expandindustry ing the trade of developing countries. 'Trade not aid' was once quite a slogan. Of course the main thrust of that was not marginal expansion of the developing countries' manufactured exports, which have been expanding rapidly anyway, but the attainment of higher stabilised prices developing countries' commodity exports. The gains from higher oil prices is the outstanding example-thoug h the resource poor among the developing countries are made worse off than ever, and the importance of aid, especially food aid, is thereby underlined. It must be said that the recent Rome food conference the Governdifferently. ment, on the face of it, put up a good show but the follow up to that is that the time will come when it has to deUver the goods. Then the Government's anti-rural poUcies-the abolition of investment allowances and of tax incentives develop new land, and the proposed abolition of the superphosphate bounty-will tell. The sorry facts of the aid record of the Government are that it has discouraged rural production in hungry world and it can muster only 0.6 per cent of the gross national product for aid, and that includes the specific obligation we have to Papua New Guinea. I turn in the remainder of thetimeleft to me the Government's tariff poUcy, if there is such thing. To my knowledge there is nowhere any clear statement of it What we do have is a clear commitment by the Prime Minister to tariff 'reform' in some sense. As he himself put it, 'a strong Rattigan man'. Mr Corbett-He was.",71
158,Dr EDWARDS,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"He was. We will have to see petition, what the change amounts to. If we ask what this means, on the evidence of a large number of the Tariff Board and Industries Assistance Comgood mission reports listed as the basis of the actions we are passing into law under this legislation, especiaUy those dealing with the more substanhas tial areas-for example, the consumer electronic equipment report and the domestic appliances report, not to mention the motor vehicles report which is not the subject of the present Bill-th policy amounts to this: That as quickly as ible the rate of protection for as many industries as possible should be brought to the one level, namely, 25 per cent or thereabouts. It is an approach clearly associated with the so-caUed 'points of reference' of the former TariffBoard, and the so-called low point, a rate of 25 per cent, is to be the target going rate for as many industries as possible. The poUcy, as a practical industrialist might sum it up-thoug h this is a bit overof simphried but much to the point-is that 'what cannot survive at 25 per cent is dispensable'. It is not difficult to see that the brunt of the thinking behind this policy-as quickly as possible to reduce as many tariff rates as possible to the uniform low rate-is the pursuit of, and I quote from the Board's annual report, 'efficiency for in the use of resources'. This is economic efficiency rigidly and narrowly conceived-wit ness chapter 5 of that report together with the minimum regard to the significance of external effects and decentralisation referred to in Appendix 5.1 and Appendix 5.4 respectively. The Opat position would wish to see these things weighted Thus, in referring to 'external effects', I mean for example the importance of an industry for Australian research and development and Austo tralian technological know-how. Speaking to the Customs Validation Bill on 9 April last I stressed that in this technological age the importance of a viable electronics industry to the future of a Australia was strongly supported by the Opposition Parties. I raised the question-and the Opposition would have few doubts as to the answer-that the viabUity of the electronics industry, including its capacity to maintain a nationally independent program of research and developto ment, was dependent on an integrated operation a combining a thriving consumer product division with production for the so-called professional market. So, in looking to a balanced and sound industrial base, the electronics industry is an he is industry which should have a key place in the Australian industrial structure. But this is just the sort of industry, especially at the consumer end, which is most vulnerable to overseas comand vulnerable in a way in which industries such as the brick, beer and bottle industries, viewed by the Commission in its latest report as candidates for absorbing resources, are not. Those industries do not need to supplicate, to seek or to cry out for adequate protection. What to be considered however is what is important for Australia's long term future. This is neither the time nor the occasion to pure sue these matters in depth. But, in my view, this possnarrow economic approach apparently espoused by the Industries Assistance Commission is not a valid nor in the long run a feasible substitute for a national industrial policy directed towards the broadly based nauonal growth, the geographical spread of industrial activity and the development and possession in Australia, in reasonable degree, of the technology and know-how of modern industry-in short those objectives long espoused for a variety of non-economic as much as economic reasons in this countiy and supporting the traditional Australian purpose of fostering a diversified broadly based dynamic manufacturing sector. I would like, if there were time, to put all that into strictly economic terms. But I conclude by saying that all this is not to suggest that changes in tariffs and some restructuring of industry should not be made. Let me stress, as I have done in the past, that the previous Government did not rest content with the level of tariffs. It was previous Government, to make only this one point, that instituted the systematic review of the tariff and enlarged the resources of the Tariff Board to do so. What it does mean is that what changes would result in an improvement in the use of the nation's resources in accordance with our national objectives is a complex issue not to be determined by reference to a theoretical uniform standard. In particular, Australians are committed-and the Government should remember this-to a big Australia, a diversified Australia, with a broadly based dynamic manufacturing sector. As categorically as I can, I aver that the Liberal and Country Parties in this Parliament are unequivocally so committed. The alternative, to which, I suspect, the IAC would direct us, is an Australia with perhaps a somewhat higher income per head but less industrialised, more heavUy dependent on its rural and mining export industries, and on imports for much of its manufactures. I repeat that this is not the sort of Australia that Australians have traditionally opted for and not what the majority of Australians want today. This issue-and the issue of a national industrial poUcy which is bound up with it-is a key one for Australia's development. The Government, as I have said previously, has in this matter put the cart before the horse. It has proceeded to knock down Australian mdustry without any clear view as to what will take its place. We have witnessed the Exodus before the Genesis-that is, widespread and increasing unemployment with no clear view of where the unemployed are to go. Belatedly the Government has appointed the Jackson Committee and hopefully it will indicate a clearer course. And perhaps the decisions on the motor car industry and the textile industry announced last Tuesday night presage a more reasonable approach and a stay of proceedings until the Jackson Committee reports. It is greatly to be hoped that that is the case.",74
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,Mr Luchetti)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,75
160,Mr ADERMANN,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,These BUls tell a strange story. We see in them a number of changes of direction and a number of changes of emphasis. We even see reverses. When they are taken in conjunction with the Budgets-and I use the plural-w e do see a very strange story. Dr Edwards-At least 3 Budgets.,75
161,Mr ADERMANN,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"The honourable member the for Berowra says: 'At least three'. Perhaps he has forgotten the fourth Budget. There was the Budget that never was. It started off as a tiger but something happened to it before it came into this chamber. The good thing about aU this is that the most recent Budget at last recognises that profit hath virtue and that the private sector does provide significant employment. One of the dangers, particularly in an economic climate such as we have today, is that an alteration in excise duty, because excise dutyrises,must be inflationary. Demand cannot be stimulated by increasing prices, and you raise prices by increasing excise. Prices are not reduced by increasing excise; they are raised. So we have seen by this exercise not an onslaught on mflation but a sUde from one form of inflation into another. We have gone from demand mflation to stagflation to cost push inflation This very evening, the evening newspapers tell a horrifying story. The Sydney 'Sun' has the headline 'Up 25 Per Cent-Inflation Blow'. The Sydney 'DaUy Mirror' states: 'New Inflation Blow-3 0 per cent!' No doubt the Government would prefer the Sydney 'Sun' to the Sydney 'DaUy Mirror'. But the situation is an alarming one. I do not want to speak at any great length because some of what I would say on these BUls is related to customs matters and I will have the opportunity later, in considering a Bill which will be debated this evening, to deal with those matters. Although a cognate debate is being held on these BUls, they deal with a number of different matters. If plenty oftimewas available to the House, perhaps it would have been better to talk about those matters which arise from the recommendations of Industry Assistance Commission and Tariff Board Reports separate from matters relating to excise and customs tariffs. But we will not take issue on that point. We do not want to do that. Perhaps I wiil have a Uttle more ume the subsequent debate to talk about them. Let me deal with the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut. I am pleased that the Mmister said: for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Enderby) is in What the House this evening because I wish to raise is one problem in respect of which, Mr Minister, I respeci honesdy cannot obtain an answer. I hope that certainty that answer can be provided. The 25 per cent try. tariff cut was one of the most industry-destroying and confidence-destroying measures that ever came into this House. It probably gave rise such things as the NEAT and RED schemes structural assistance. We do not knock these, I am afraid that they savour of a bandaid being appUed to something of a mortal wound. It was this 25 per cent tariff cut which made attack on panicular industries. One industry my electorate was a clothing factory of 25 years' standing which employed up to 70 people. I bating's tled hard to save it. The Minister ing Industry said: 'Well, anybody affected under has Ustened to mynow this 25 per cent tariff cut decision is entided to structural assistance'. We had a look at it. Where the scheme feU down a Uttle bit was that the son who estabUshed that industry did not want auction his plant. He did not want to seU. thought that perhaps there might be happier days in the future and that something he had Business given his Ufe to build and which was employing people might be able to operate again, so he did not want to auction his plant. Anyway, what was the good of doing that? Who in that depressed industry would want to buy it? So he asked what he could do and I have passed on to the panment of Manufacturing Industry a query about the structural assistance that is offered industries affected by tariff schemes. I have asked: When a man desires to stan again feels that by doing so he will provide employmember ment and productivity that he provided preappeal viously, what happens to the plant and the vehicles that he has on lease? This is a problem and I hope that ment is looking at it. A lot of machinery is on lease and a lot of the vehicles are on lease. The lessees do not want to seU them. They are not saleable. They may not in the future be able operate them again, but they have lease payvaUdation ments to meet. Where do they stand? Is there any room in the structural assistance scheme for people to meet the lease payments? If not, deficient. I hope the Minister can give me an wer because I have not been able to get one. I endorse what was said by the honourable in member for Berowra. I refer again to some very wise words that he spoke in this House on 9 April 1974 on the Customs Tariff Validation Bill. These words were prophetic, were they not? He I think is essential to Australian secondary industry a clear understanding of the Government's policies in of tariffs. One fears that the tariff pressure and the unto which I have referred are pan and parcel of the veritable onslaught by this Government on secondary indusThat has been the problem. One Budget destroys to confidence and another one stimulates it a bit and and another destroys it again. We have a but remarkable see-saw and I acknowledge that is so. But business confidence needs restoring. I appeal to the Government to take not just part of what the Opposition has been saying in an an isolated fashion. These ad hoc decisions-this up in and down business-hav e not led us anywhere except to such headlines as we see in this evennewspapers. Business confidence does need for ManufacturrevaluationIt and restoring. has been hit by excise payments, at least the Government friend from Berowra and has devalued, although it was a little late. perBusiness confidence needs restoring because to business has faced a wages and prices explosion He and a credit squeeze. It took the Government a long time to admit that there was such a squeeze. lost liquidity and that causes a failure in business confidence. Interest rates have soared. Business is fairly resilient; there is no doubt about it. But I appeal to the Government to be sincere about this matter because it will be effecme tive in reducing unemployment and in making Deinroads into inflation. It is the story of productivity. That surely is the key to this whole to issue. Therefore, we must look to the restoration of business confidence. I close my remarks with and the appeal that was made by the honourable for Berowra. Surely we can make that again. This is what business is saying: ""Time is catching up on this Government and it is time for a clear statement of its tariff objectives and for a removal of the uncertainties under the Depanwhich industry has to operate'. The Opposition will not oppose or obstruct these Bills. It is most necessary that they be to introduced and implemented immediately. Their takes place some considerable time later. Of course nobody should try to defeat Bills these which have operated for a long time because it is there would be chaos if they were defeated. ansTherefore, we are not opposing or obstructing the BUls. Much of what I proposed to say the honourable member for Berowra has said. We have put these points to the Government. I hope that the Minister for Manufacturing Industry can help me with the inquiry I raised because I should like to send the answer back to my electorate tomorrow.",75
162,Mr GILES,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"I wish to refer in particular, amongst these Bills which are being considered cognately, to Customs TariffBill (No. 2) 1974 and Excise TariffBill 1974. It seems to me that those are the Bills concerned with the excise rates on the brandy industry. It was drawn to my attention a few minutes ago that in a speech made the week before last to a farmers group the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said: I am happy to let the facts speak for themselves. This is to a rural audience. He continued: I hope you will be happy to listen to them. I put it to you that no government has done more for farmers than myAnd he went on in that vein. I wish to deal today with at least one area- I beheve there are others-wher e the primary producers are far from happy with the performance of this Government. I refer first of all to a letter I had from a friend of mine who has invoices showing the increasing costs of brandy in a 13-month period. For reasons that are best known to him-h e probably runs a hotel or an eating house-h e buys his brandy in 5-gallon lots. Thefigureshe gives are report as follows: On 26 June 1973-that was immediabond for tely prior to the 1973 Budget-for his 5-gallon production pack he paid $49.40. On 1 May 1974-tnat is mind at anybefore after the 1973 Budget-he paid $85.45 and on 1 moving situation oneacannot November 1974-after the 1974 Budget after the rnini-Budget-h e paid $125 for similar there is an over-supply situationthe lots. The price rose from $49.40 to $ 125 for his 5industry. Of course, in fact that isinprecisely gallon pack of the same brand of brandy. I must finaUy transpired. It was only a few monthswhat be quite honest and say that I cannot find cisely the same proportion of increases in the charges per bottle of brandy over the same been period, but he has the invoices for these particuwas lar increases. Let us couple those figures with the grower returns. Under South Austrahan legislation to up its Prices Commission it is provided that averagefigurefor the growers to receive for the varieties of grapes used in brandy production is $70 a ton. At the same time the Federal Governwhole ment with the excise on the brandy produced from one ton of grapes takes approximately $1,200. Let us hark back to the Prime Minister's statement. A lot of grower groups in my electorBoard ate and in other places as well are livid with at this wide disparity between the $70 the growers receive and the $1,200 that the Government is currently taking. I have made that point before in this House and I make it again because I find that wherever I go even amongst some of my friends they do not realise that this is the situation. They do not realise the fury of that section of primary producers which is languishing due to a variety of actions. It might be proper to inquire into why they are languishing. Firstly, they appUed for tariff protection some time ago against the increasing percentage of imported 'brandy' corning into Australia. A Tariff Board report was brought down on this matter. I do not wish to grind this point unduly but I think that without any question it would have been the worse Tariff Board report that was ever brought down. The growers found that the whole of the Board's remarks were really based on the supposed fact that there was a surplus of brandy production over requirements in Australia. It is a mystery why sales or apparent local market, plus export, figures for any given year were matched in this Tariff Board report against production for the same year. It seems quite easy to establish that in a growing population and in a growing market situation there was just no relevance between matching with that figure as against the other figure. Section 1, sub-section (U) on page 5 of the refers to the fact that brandy is held in a minimum of 2 years from the date of it can be sold. That, to my rate, is tacit assumption that in a look at the year of and production and prophesy into future that the brandy ago prethat I read in a newspaper that an amount of dried grapes, I presume of inferior quality, had released for spirit production. If ever there certain proof that the Tariff Board report was totaUy wrong, it was the need to do that. I suppose one could take into consideration the set unfortunate fire at the biggest distillery in an Australia, Berri Co-operative Winery and Distillery, and say that that could have meant a shortfall in brandy production, but even that is not the truth because a lot of that brandy was scheduled over a period of years for sale into the market place. So I just draw attention- I hope properly and politely-to that particular Tariff report on the brandy industry and to the rage fact that when that industry applied for some protection against the inroads being made at that time the Board was, I think, open to a lot of tion as regards its accuracy of reporting. I that quite politely. The current situadon, therefore, is that there is a shortage of brandy within the industry. There a shortage of spirit for the making of fortified wines. We now have the position where the Prime Minister, when opening the Kaiser-Stuhl Wines extensions about 6 months ago in my elecname torate, advised all grape growers to get out of field of dual variety grapes and into growing types of grapes that would make dry whites dry reds. I presume that he is entitled to his opinion, but this argument totally ignores the traditional role of dual variety grapes in irrilar gation areas. Apart from the fact that they yield better and pay better for those who grow them, which is an attractive thought to those who plant grapes for this purpose, traditionally over many years the dried fruit industry has been founded very largely on varieties such as gordos and sulperiod tanas. In my electorate the dried fruit industry languishing, and the Industries Assistance Comlonger. mission is in a proper old tangle at present, lieve, because it cannot indeedfindone South Australia in my electorate which consistently grows only grapes for dried fruit purposes. So we have this fruit salad situation and the flux situation in which, depending on seasonable mand for which is, so is dictated the direction which those dual varieties go. With more modhave ern technology a lot of these dual variety grapes have a proper and, I think, a permanent role the wine industry. It is quite improper for people to denigrate, for instance, the new fruity gordo being produced at the Berri winery. I hear within the wme industry that this could well make a name for that particular area, because it is such fine product of its type by any world standards. So there is one new outlet for dual variety grapes,the in the particular variety of gordos. The Tariff Board deals with grapes on page 11 of its report. The implication in the report appears to be that aU such grapes produced above that amount required for wine are made into brandy. There is no evidence that this is so, and I say that for the sorts of reasons that I have just described. The report also says that there is a standing need for grapes for uiis purpose. On the other hand, it was very interestcoming ing to read recently that an amount of dried fruit grapes was aUowed for the production of spirits, as I have already mentioned. So, on the evidence of thefiguresthat I have already read to the House on retaU costs and on the evidence of the amount of return the grower gets for his comin modity as against the 94 per cent, which I think questhe greater amount the Government takes off for say the same tonnage of grapes, the problem quite clearly is that at present the industry is being squeezed out of existence. is The House has heard nie speak before about the brandy industry and particularly those private compames which are involved in the production of brandy. I have mentioned them by on many occasions. The one that is most the seriously hit would be St Agnes Wines Pty Ltd of the Renmark. This is a case of a private company and stiU trying to find more than Sim over a phasing-in period of years to pay off a matter that properly should not conform to this particudebate, namely the effect on its stocks as held of the Government's revaluation action. Let us have a look at this situation. It is this type of action that hits the brandy industry more than any other side of the industry because the maturation period is longer. The average maturation is just on 3 years. But for a quality brandy is product the maturation period is infinitely So these private companies have to find I betheir amounts of $lm or whatever it may be in farm in times Uke this for that purpose. As well as that, oyer this period of 13 months, as I described in quoting the retail prices, the deGovernment's rake-off through excise has gone in up by 178 per cent. So these private companies tofindthat amount. As well as that there is the equaUsation of the brandy excise as against in those of its Australian buUt competitors. I can understand, I suppose, why people could think that that is a good idea. But it is well established that the rum industry, as a by-product of the sugar industry, is of no particular or real impora tance to the sugar industry. The vodka industry or the whisky industry is of no real importance to grain producers of Australia. One could go even further and say that the beer industry of Australia is of no real importance to the entire dual variety gram growing industry.",77
163,Mr WENTWORTH,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,Do not go too far.,78
164,Mr GILES,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"The honourable member suggests that I have gone too far. But even if we get ofi*grains and concentrate on barley, the implication in the average year of the beer industry to the barley industry is not very great, and it is beless as more and more of a demand occurs for grain as a foodstuff, as a stock feed, rather than for other reasons. But that last point, I suppose, is not as vahd as the first one. The point is that this Government and, I believe, the Tariff Board in its report, were grossly culpable failing to realise that the outlet for people is growing grapes in these areas is not the grape consumpuon market in Australia; it is entirely the market for wine and brandy. It was for that very logical reason that in many years gone past this advantage was given to the brandy industry-albei t a marginal, one-ove r and above that onus of excise applied to other Australian spirits. Let me follow this up. I accept now that the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS), who is at the table, does not follow the impeccable logic that I have tried to put to the House. If he does not, that is fair enough. But even then the brandy industry has been hopelessly disadvantaged. I would remind the House of the remarks I was able to make during the consideration of the Estimates a little while ago. I mentioned that the industry itself had written to the Government asking that 2 points be considered prior to the introduction of the last Budget. I wish to refer .to only one of them at this stage. The first point is this: The attention of the Government is respectfully drawn to the rate of Customs Duty and Excise Duty applied to imponed and Australian produced brandy: Imported Brandy Customs Tariff Item 22.09.120-S6.19 per litre alcohol. Australian produced Brandy Excise Tariff Item 2 A $6.00 per litre alcohol. Difference in favour of Australian pro'duced Brandy-$0.1 9 per litre alcohol. This position was arrived at on what was supposed to be a level argument. When making tlus comparison of the differential applying in tion to brandy, the attenuon of the Government should be drawn to the difference in the rate customs duty and excise duty applying in the case of imported whisky and Australian produced whisky. The difference in the dudes works out to 66c per litre alcohol in favour Australian produced whisky. The industry has not been slow to pick up in the re-juggling excisefiguresthe fact that the Government only has removed what I think was a proper advantage for the people in the brandy industry who produce the raw material and who have no other outlet for it but also, having supposedly equalised the position, the Government gives Australian brandy an advantage of only 19c per Utre alcohol over its imported competitor. I repeat that in the current situation the Australian whisky industry has been given a 66c competithat tive advantage over its imported counterpart. no matter which way we look at the position, the juggling of the figures to produce what the Government thought would be equal treatment for the brandy industry in Austraha in its receiving unequal treatment. I say again that the Government must do than say that it will look at the position. Senator Wriedt says: 'We must have a look at this total taxation on the industry. It is obviously not good enough'. I think that he stated that 7 months ago. The industry has played very fair with the Treasurer (Mr Crean). It has gone about making its submissions on this matter very quietly and in a low key way. I have gone very quietly about the job of trying to make the Government see some sense in this matter. But the time has been reached at which the industry is heartily fed up. Those engaged in the industry do not know whom to see any more. Nobody will listen. People nod their heads wisely and nothing happens. Recently, the Government took action to try to cut down company tax and personal tax in an effort to inject some funds into the private sector. It did this so that there could be some room and encouragement for investment. But this has not happened in this industry and this is one of many industries in which it is not happening. The industry now needs real help. In a year or two it will probably be far too late for many private companies that have been hopelessly disadvantaged whUe, one cannot help but say, these decisions have been forced on them in a situation which encouraged growth and the quality production of their brandy. That situation now no longer appUes. I think that it is beyond beUef that one industry should be so discriminated against. I remind the House that I speak for the indusrelatry. I suppose that 99 per cent of the brandy produced in Australia is produced in my electorof ate. You will forgive, me, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I rather tend to grind the point because of that. But not only do the actions of the Government discriminate against my electorate. It is very easy of also to ponder whether they do not discriminate against the entire State of South Australia. of the Although the honourable member for Wimmera not (Mr King) reminds me of a smaU case where I am wrong, 1 believe that 99 per cent of the brandy produced in Australia is produced in South Australia. In addition to that, I state that with the effect this legislation in regard to the excise on brandy is having, it goes without saying that the Government is penalising the total Australian brandy mdustry for the very reasons that I have put forward. If the Government penalises industry, it does not penalise just the people So who work in the factory as is the case in the breweries. Its actions go right back to the people who grow the grapes and who, according to the figures that I have produced for the House today, has resulted are being disadvantaged.",78
165,Mr WENTWORTH,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"The whole of the Government's economic poUcy is now in tatters and not least its tariff policy. The tariff pohcy is tremendously important. I beheve that the Government's acuon on tariffs, which is before us now, has been one of the main causes of the catastrophic unemployment which we are now suffering and which now comes over us in even greater waves. Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Whilam), speaking in relation to textiles and the motor industry, indicated some retreat. But it was a retreat too late and not a retreat which will help the people who are unemployed by reason of the Government's muddling. I ask the question: What has happened? I take the words of the Prime Minister which he uttered on 23 September last-onl y a few weeks ago-as evidence of what has happened. He said: I am a strong Rattigan man. I believe that Rattigan most rationalising force in the use of the nation's resources that any of us have known. He castigated the nervous Nellies, the people who would be unemployed as a result of the application of the Rattigan poUcies. This was what the Prime Minister said and this is the nerve of the tariff slash-this unwise tariff slash-whic h is evidenced in the BUls before the House. There are some people- I am not one of them; but I know there are many-wh o believe that we should reduce tariffs and should rationalise industry, even at the cost of some unemployment and some further dependence upon imports. That may be so and I am not gomg to take argument now on that main point. But what is abundantly clear is that such tariff slashing can be successfully carried out, if at aU, only in a bouyant economy in which there is alternative employment for people who are displaced by the squeezing out under the Rattigan principle of what are described as inefficient industries. The Government's great mistake has been that it tried to combine tariff slashing with a credit squeeze. This cannot be done unless the degree of unemployment that we see in Australia today is countenanced. WhUst this tariiT slashing at times when the economy is buoyant is not something that I would have done- I know that many people would advocate this-the Government has tried to slash tariffs at a time when it was also applying a credit squeeze. People were left unemployed. The nervous Nellies-the people whom the Prime Minister covered with ridicule, these unfortunate unemployed-ha d nowhere to go. They had no other employment. Their industries closed down because of a rising flood of imports and there was no alternative employment avaUable for them. This was the great mistake of the Government. I repeat that it tried to slash tariffs at a time when it was also squeezing credit. As a consequence unemployment emerged in a way which the Government had not anticipated. Certainly, it had anticipated a small amount of unemployment. This was pan of its policy, although it denied this during the Federal election campaign in May. But it was part of the Government's policy to have a small amount of unemployment. However, I do not accuse the Prime Minister of deliberately contemplating the wave of unemployment which his policies have caused. What do we have now? We have stop-go in excelsis on the tariff front as well as on every other economic front. I can remember how a few is the years ago the then Opposition castigated us as the Government for what was called stop-go and was only a moderate acceleration or braking of the economy. But today, stop-go in the strictest sense is a grim reality for the Australian people. What does this add up to? It adds up to a greater inefficiency than any that the Government set out to cure. At least the people who were in the textile, shoe and motor industries were producing something, even if they were producing it without the full efficiency the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) wants to require of them. They were producing and adding to the national wealth. But if they are sitting down doing nothing-if the lathes and the looms are idle-is that not a far greater inefficiency? The inefficiency of unemployment is a degree worse than any inefficiency the Prime Minister wanted to deplore when he called himself a Rattigan man. Furthermore, we have created for business a climate of uncertainty. Nobody knows what the Government is going to do or fail to do next. This climate of uncertainty adds to the recession; it adds to all our economic disabUities. We have used up our overseas reserves. I do not refer only to the comparatively small matter of a fall of $ 1,000m or so in our overseas reserves; what I refer to is far more important, and that is the fact that the continuing credit balance on current account which we left when we went out of office in 1972 has been dissipated and Australia is now, on current account, going into the international red. That stands to the discredit of this Government. The use of our reserves-the use of the favourable position which we in the Liberal and Country Parties had built up and left to the Government in 1972-is now not avaUable. The Government has destroyed that favourable position. Dr Edwards-Dissipate d it. M i WENTWORTH-Yes, dissipated it entirely. I do not accuse the Prime Minister of evil motives although I tliink he can perhaps be reprimanded for saying things in the May election campaign which he knew to be untrue. But we pass that over. It is muddle and incompetence rather than evil motivation that one charges against the Prime Minister, because the Prime Minister is personally responsible for this policy. It is in black and white in the speech that he made on 23 September. It is there verbatim. It is his personal responsibility. It was he who mocked at the nervous Nellies-the y now seem to have been the prudent people. It is now seen that the Nellies really had something to be nervous about because many of them are now walking about without a job and without the prospect of a job for many months. This is what this Government has done to them. No, I do not accuse the Prime Minister matter of having done it deliberately. I think meant to have a small amount of unemployment. He did not reaUse it was going to get out of hand in the way it has done. But I think it a Uttle generous of him to deny what he had done. When this was brought to him in the House question time he said: ' I did not say these things'. That was- I do not say it was a lie, I say it was untrue. The Prime Minister had forgotten because",79
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE, things Order! I think the honourable member for MackeUar would appreciate the fact that in this House it is also unparliamentary to say *I do say it was a Ue'. I suggest that the honourable member does not proceed with that line of comabout ment.,81
167,Mr WENTWORTH,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"Ver y well Sir, I will not, but what I will say is that the Prime Minister nied in this House something which was true proveable. His words are on tape. I have posited a copy of that tape in the ParUamentary Library. It is there and everybody can hear that what the Prime Minister said in this House, he denied that he had uttered these words, was, in point of fact, untrue. I have described this Freudian lapse of memory. He does not want face the reaUty of what he has done. The Prime Minister does not want to contemplate the misfixed ery of the unemployment which his Government has caused and his rnind retreats from it. This normal psychological mechanism. His mind and retreats from the reaUty and he forgets his own part in it as the prime mover. But I do not accuse the Prime Minister of having caused this ployment deliberately. I am not so sure about the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS). I say this because I have looked at the things he said before he was a Minister and the things he did while he was stiU on the back bench of this House. If he was sincere then, and I would say that he was sincere, the Minister for Overseas Trade is now out to destroy the Australian way of life. He is a destroyer- a hidden destroyer perhaps-bu t if we are to take at face value the things he said before he was a Minister, that man, if he was sincere when he became a Minister, would, under cover, without letting it be known what he was doing, have gone out to destroy the Australian economy and create the unemployment which would bring the revolutionary situation which he himself says he desired or said he desired-becaus e those are his own words. He is a revolutionary. He beUeves in smash and if he can deceive people into thinking that here is a moderate man in this who sympathises with and understands the he businessman's problems-h e is an able man who does understand- I wonder what are his motives. I look at what he said before he was a Minister unand I pay him the compliment of believing that when he said these things before he was a Minisat ter he was sincere and meant what he said. So I am not certain about the Minister for Overseas Trade. It may be that whUe he has been pretending all the time to be in favour of higher employment and cutting back the recession and like that, under cover he has been deUberately nudging unemployment on because unemployment would fit into the pattern of the not kind of things he wanted and said he wanted before he became a Minister. So I am not certain him. I know he is an able man. I know he is a very plausible one. I know that many businessmen- I think more fools they-tak e him at his deface value. He can go to them. He can say to a big and firm: 'Look, by my contacts I can get you condetracts and opportunities which are worth a mUUon dollars to you'. And what he says is true. He can give them a contract or a contact which is when worth a mUUon doUars. They say to themselves: 'What does it matter? We are practical businessas a men. AU we think about is that million dollars'. to But I wonder whether the Minister for Overseas Trade whUe he is doing this has still got his mind on the same kind of objective which he had and declared before he became a Minister, beis a cause if he was sincere then he must be false now, if that is so he is sucking in the businessmen not only to their peril but to the peril of the whole of Australia. I can remember, and I quote again, unemthe words of Lenin. These would be very well known to the Minister. 'When the time comes to deal with the capitalists they will be competing between themselves to sell us the rope with which to hang them.' I wonder whether these thoughts run through the mind of the Minister for Overseas Trade when he makes contact with businessmen and persuades them that, if they will only play along with him, he can give them something which will be to their advantage. They will be able to sell him the rope, he is buying the rope and he is offering them advantageous terms for that bit of rope. It is incontrovertible that there is unemployment, and a coming wave of unemployment. None of us wants this. I do not beheve that the Prime Minister did it deliberately. I do not believe that most members of the Government did it deUberately. To my mind it is the result of muddle and miscalculation, not malevolence. But I sometimes wonder whether, in that inner Cabinet, there may not be a voice which says it wants to end unemployment but really is out to create chaos for the Australian economy and the Australian people.",81
168,Mr KELLY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, you wiU recaU, no doubt, how many times I have stood in this House to make a plea for a more enUghtened look at our system of tariff protection. It has not been easy. In the beginning it was an overwhelmingly difficult and lonely job, but graduaUy the economic lessons have been learned by the community as a whole and also by this House. I remember that insults were hurled across at me, I was told that I did not believe in the development of this great country of ours, and this kind of nonsense. Now there is general acceptance in the community that high protection is bought at a price and that there is no such thing as a free feed in the economic world, particularly in tariff protection. When I was first elected to this House I had a lively interest in the cost that the exporter was paying for high protection. This was the motive that led me to try to get the government of that day to look at its poUcies with greater clarity. This cost is generaUy acknowledged now. Everybody knows that the exporter pays in the end, that the cost is passed on and on until it comes to the exporter and can be passed no further. That is one thing that the House and the community have learned. Most people know that you do not create employment by imposing tariffs. You may create employment in one sector but you tend to lose it in another. I will quote from the annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission for 1973-74, which came out recently, and I do so to make a point on the question of employment. At page 7 of the report the Commission states: However, general measures such as fiscal, monetary and exchange rate management, are now widely regarded as more efficient instruments than the tariff for achieving macro-economic objectives, such as high and stable levels of employment. If that was not so what kind of picture would we have? Tariffs would rise if there were a large amount of employment and would lower if unemployment fell. What kind of planning situation does this place business in? We recognise that the advantages of employment gained in one industry by protecting it are always paid for by employment lost in other industries. There are so many examples of that, that I do not have the time to take the House through them. But the chief change that has come about ir the last few years is the change in my thinkinf is well as in the community's thinking in genera.. It is now becoming increasingly recognised that a high tariff protection system warps the way that we use our limited resources. People pretend, particularly when they are making speeches in this House, that we are a country of limitless resources. But everybody knows that they are Umited and Umited in a way which most people do not generaUy recognise. The fact is that a system of high protection means that we tend to use our resources in a more wasteful way. I think that this would be better Ulustrated by a quote from page 18 of the Industries Assistance Commission's annual report for 1973-74.1 think it is one of the basic matters of economic thinking in this field and is graduaUy coming through to this House. As paragraph 121 the Commission's reported: Thus if the community's resources are to be used more efficiently, in the interests of promoting economic growth and thereby improving the well being of the people of Australia,That is an objective we aU haveresources must be encouraged to move into activities which require low levels of assistance, or none at all. The community will then obtain directly, from local production, those goods and services for which the Australian environment and resource endowment are best suited; it will exchange its surplus production of those goods and services for that of other countries producing more efficiently the other goods and services it needs; and it will concentrate industry development in the types of production most suited to local conditions. I repeat: Unless we have this long term objective we have no real economic planning at all. The economic use of our limited resources is one of the changes that has come over our thinking in recent years. Another one is the fact that we are growing up, and that as a developed economy a greater percentage of our work force is employed in secondary industry than is employed in secondary industry in the United States of America. One could justify high tariffs in some cases at the beginning by the infant industry argument, but I repeat that a greater percentage of our work force is engaged in secondary industry than is engaged in secondary industry in the United States of America. We cannot claim any longer that we need high tariff protection for infant industry purposes, except in a few special cases. I do not know whether we have learned, but states: we ought to have learnt, that the tariff is too blunt an instrument to bring about decentralisation. Brigden There are many reasons for which I would supThis port the movement of secondary industry away from the capital cities into decentralised areas. think that is an objective we will have has increasingly in the future. One hears it said often that tariffs should be increased across the whole of an industry in order to support one section industry in a particular location. I think this something that we ought to learn from the IAC me. report. It is a very important question and will become increasingly important in the future. At page 119 of the report the Commission stated: A more appropriate method of encouraging decentralisThe ation would be by means of subsidies which discriminate tween different locationsI emphasise' locations -' in Australia-for example, between metropolitan areas country areas generally, or between metropoUtan selected country areas. Attempting to promote decentralisation more indirectly, by assisting particular industries, be much more costly. Then the report gives examples of the textile industry to show that if one is to increase the effective rates by 10 per cent one will increase subsidy that will go to the metropoUtan section the textUe industry by $25m, and $5m wiU go to the decentralised section. The report points that the far more effective way to do it is to dise this area directly rather than try to increase tion. tariffs across the whole field. In this case many of them would encourage mdustry to develop in metropolitan areas which they should be encouraged to leave. I hope that point will sorbed by us in the future, if we have not already done so. Because of the Government's decision on motor vehicle components, the Borg-Warner company at Albury will be placed at some risk. it is decided for social reasons of decentraUsation that that company should be helped, it would much more effective to help it in the form of rect subsidy to it rather than spreading the benefit and the cost across the whole mdustry. One of the other problems that high tariff protection brings in its train and which I hope becoming generaUy recognised, is brought out with crystal clarity by the Brigden famous old document published in 1929. That report stated: The most disquietening effect of the tariff has been the stimulus it has given to demands for Government assistance of all kinds, with consequent demoralising effect upon self reliant efficiency throughout all forms of production. The Industries Assistance Commission report The Commission believes that the warning given by the Committee in 1929 is even more relevant today. is the kind of thing that we ought to recognise. We are becoming a nation of leaners leanI ing on the government for far too many things. It been encouraged by the system of tariff protection. People say: 'Well, let us get a subsidy from the consumer; let us depend on that'. There of has been far too much of it and it is going right is into the rural sector now in a way that worries The other thing that we have learnt-o r I hope that we have learnt-the hard way is that we have to trade with the undeveloped countries. ever-widening gap between them and us is besomething that this House ought to think about more often. In 1966 I went to a mUk factory in Bombay which reconstituted Australian mUk powder. I asked whether there were any proband lems and I was told it was impossible to get and foreign exchange to buy the mUk powder. In the could afternoon I want to the Bombay dyeing factory and saw sheets being made. I asked the management representatives whether they had any problems with Australian trade. They said they had great difficulty in getting their goods into the Australia over our high tariff wall. That brought of out in a way that I have never forgotten that the very things that we are so eloquent about in helpout ing the undeveloped countries are being subsideliberately hindered by poUcies of high protecThe change that has taken place is the change in the thinking of the community in general and be abof this House in particular. We are becoming more alive to the problems of high protection. Why is it that making necessary alterations is so difficult? This brings me to the real problem. If Everybody knows that what I have been saying is sensible andrightand that the difficulty in the be long term is to bring it about. It is much more a didifficult to bring about than people generally recognise. May I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) a question? If l interrupt my remarks now, will I be able to continue them at 8 o'clock? is now Mr Daly-We want tofinishthese Bills before 6.15 so that the Leader of the Opposition may report, that speak at 8 o'clock.",82
169,Mr KELLY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE,"I will close my remarks hurriedly by saying that recognising the economic that we are gradually acquiring in recognising the infinite pain with which we have learnt our theory we are still hard up against the fundamental factor of putting it into pracuce.

172,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Las t week we had Labor's third Budget in 4 months. It came in the twenty-fourth month of the Whitlam Government. In those 2 years this Government has changed Australia from having one of the lowest inflation rates in Third Reading the world to having one of the highest. Labor has wrecked our proud record of having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world. Australia's unemployment rate is now being time.compared with the traditionally much higher rates of the United States of America, Canada and some European countries. Labor has (No. 2) 1974 wrecked business confidence. It has set back our Second Reading great mineral and energy industries. It has seriously depressed investment and has set back our long term growth. Labor has wrecked the housing industry. Housing completions this year will fall 50,000 short of our needs. Labor pushed interest rates to their highest level in our history. From one of the best managed economParty ies in the Western world ours has become one of people the worse. For the 6 months since the May election this Government has failed to take the economic decisions required to avoid the current crisis, the economic measures consistently sed by the Opposition. Here is the Labor record since countdown to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made last Tuesday night. Six months ago during the election campaign Austrahans were told that the Labor Government's pohcies were working, that innation was falling and would continue to fall. Mr MACKellar-Onl y Whitlam can reduce inflation.",84
173,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Onl y Whitlam can reduce next inflation. We were told that only Whitlam reduce innation by one-third. We were told that only Labor could reduce the interest rates on housing by 3 per cent. We were told that tax cuts were economic vandalism. Five months ago June the Premiers were told that it wastimefor restraint and that government to be cut back. Money for the States was slashed resulting in both Liberal and Labor State governments imposing new and inflationary taxes.,85
174,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,The States were tricked.,85
175,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The States were tricked. The Prime Minister told the Parhament that his Government would reduce innation to 8 per cent in a year. Four months ago we had a minithat Budget. The Government put up cigarette petrol prices. Out went the means test and the child care program. Honourable members will remember that on that night the Government benches were as empty as they are tonight. that occasion they were empty because ment supporters were still in Caucus deciding whether they would let the Crean) say what he intended to say. Tonight the benches are empty because Labor is the wrecker frank of the economy. It created inflation and unemand ployment and does not have any prospect of mitting university and high school students to siblefind vocation work or of enabling commencing their work careers to find employment. Three months ago the Prime Minister told that there would be no unemployment. He said that at the verytimethat the Minister for Labor (Mr Clyde Cameron) was actually predicting that unemployment would be very high. But that has did not stop the Prime Minister from saying: Does anyone really believe that the Australian Labor which owes its existence and survival to wage and salary earners would pursue policies designed to put those out of work? Today there appeared in the newspapers an advertisement which proudly proclaimed to the preswhole world that unemployment has been a natural consequence of the attack by the Labor Government on innation. Labor chose the option last May, the of unemployment. Two months ago we had the Budget that now Ues in tatters. The Prime Minister wants the Treasurer to be made the scapegoat. He wants to throw the Treasurer out together with the Budget. Honourable members should remember that this discredited Budget was termed the Cairns Budget when it was thought to be a good one. It was named after the man who is or was to be the Treasurer. I think our actions have saved could Frank Crean as Treasurer. Whether we have been right or wrong in our judgment as to his economic capacity I leave open to question, but as a matter of honour we acted properly. That is on 7 not what the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) did in relation spending needed to their colleague. One month ago the consumer price index figures for the September quarter confirmed that inflation was running at 20 per cent. I am informed that the Press report tonight that inflation as measured by the consumer price index for the December quarter will have climbed to 30 per cent. Two weeks ago the October unemployment figures confirmed that we are in a recession and unemployment is now the highest since and World War II. One week ago we witnessed the degrading spectacle of the Prime Minister's apologia of defeat and mistaken poUcies, the greatest that has ever been made by any Australian On Prime Minister. Yesterday he fataUstically acGoverncepted unemployment and recession for Australia without giving a tinker's curse about it. Treasurer (Mr One newspaper said: Rarely, if ever, has a Prime Minister had to make such a and public admission that the Opposition was right that his Government's policy had been wrong. perLabor's economic poUcies have been irresponschool leavers Mr Innes-That is rubbish.",85
176,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"That is Ted. Labor's economic poUcies have been irresponsible, confused us and wrong. Four great mistakes of domestic policy have led directly and inevitably to the present situation. They are the explosion of government spending beginning in 1973 and continuing through 2 Budgets; the explosion of wage rises triggered by the pace-setter principle for PubUc Service last year; the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut; and the savage and prolems longed credit squeeze with its cruel interest These are the 4 home grown mistakes. They weretaken. deUberate acts. By them this Government has created the twin tragedies of mass unbeen employment and uncontroUed inflation. One of the Government's former advisers has itwhich written that each of those decisions was taken the Labor Cabinet against official advice. the Treasury and the Reserve Bank were opposed to this Government's attitude to government spending. The Treasury bitterly opposed the pace-setter principle. The Governsition ment's freewheeling approach to wage rises was equally opposed by the Treasury. It fought against the 25 per cent tariff cut and the Reserve Bank is aghast at the credit squeeze and the interest rates. The Opposition warned consequences and events have confirmed everyDr thing we said. As the results have unfolded the Government has gone from bad to worse. We now have the most serious economic tion in this country since the Depression. The position's mid-year economic review was it in again? released on 5 July and this is a quotation The economy is now reaching a turning point in the of real activity. This prospect may be disguised by tinued expansion of money incomes inflationary process now being experienced. Nonetheless, the prospective stagnation in real activity looms as a policy issue of major significance containing stagflation. Moreover, should effect upon investment outlays, already apparent, then the costs of this outcome will be felt for years ahead. And so it will be. We will be working without men and equipment in the plants and factories. Our productivity cannot rise in those circumstances. This is what we said in July. We warnedsecond, of the rising unemployment crisis unless immedirectly ate action was taken. It has taken the Government 4V4 months Budgets since then to act at aU. In Labor's latest Budget announced last Tuesday the Government finally recognised, at least by word, the tance of free enterprise. After 2 years of attacks on business and industry, after 2 years of rates; measures aimed at knocking its growth, after dethe liberate destruction of incentives, after attacks any profit, after crippUng its capacity to invest, after chopping confidence to a 45-year low back to the Great Depression, the Government that the private sector is important, profit is and businessmen are honest and honourable. has taken the unemployment of 190,000 people, registered, as well as the number of those and unregistered, to bring these fools to this conthe clusion. Last week's measures do not go anywhere near far enough to solve the twin probof inflation and unemployment. I now set rates. out once again the measures which need to be They are not measures which can bring about an overnight recovery. Such a mess has made that that cannot be done. Labor's management has created such a bitter mess that will be a very sad unemployed Christmas faces a quaner of a mUlion Australians. If by present poUcies continue there will be a faster Both rise in prices in the future. I turn now to the correct economic strategy. The basic economic strategy which the Oppohas advocated remains valid. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard 2 sections of the speech which I made in reply to the Budget on 23 September in this House setting out this strategy. high The 2 sections are 'National Objectives' and of these ' The Correct Economic Strategy'J. F. Cairns-Is it not already in Hansard?",85

179,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I will briefly summarise the measures we have advocated. They are: First, a $ 1,000m cut in personal income taxes; cuts in some indirect taxes aimed at direducing some prices; third, a reduction in the Government spending increase announced in and 3the Budget from 33 per cent to 25 per cent; founh, an instruction to the Reserve Bank to ease monetary poUcy, to inject adequate liquidity into importhe economy and cashflowfor business, which will estabUsh the conditions for a fall in interest fifth, a decision pubUcly stated setting out future course of monetary policy; sixth, abolon ition of the variable deposit requirement and an end to the prohibition on short-term capital flows; seventh, aflexibleexchange rate with the says development of a foreign exchange market; good eighth, investment incentives to restore business It investment in new plant and equipment in manufacturing, tertiary industries, mineral industries the rural industries; ninth, a complete review of the activities of the various Government bodies regulating business, including the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Trade Practices Commission, the Arbitration Commission, the ParUamentary Prices Committee and the Committee takeovers; tenth, restoration of the authority of the Arbitration Commission and a more responthat sible approach to wage claims generaUy across the whole labour market. The somersaults of last week on tax cuts foreign investment mean the adoption of a small part of our poUcy. We welcome them, but as Government scored only two out of ten we canjust hardly give it top marks of the class. We cannotmaintain get very excited about it The Government stUl has adopted only the easy and poUticaUy popularemployment parts of our poUcies. It has not faced up to hard parts. It still does not understand the conse-example, quences of continuing with its present spending spree. It cannot be emphasised enough that overriding need is for poUcies which tackle inflation and unemployment PoUcies directed at one of these problems but which neglect the other will not constitute a long term solution either. That is why it is so important to give reUef to the private sector and to provide reUef to the unemployment situation whUe at same time to attack cost inflation and slow pubUc sector expansion. It is important to stand that the jobs that are being lost are in private sector. When did honourable members last meet a retrenched pubUc servant? If we to take up the jobs we must stimulate the privatedownturn sector. The Opposition will not accept, as the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) would have it accept, the One proposition that thousands of students and school leavers have to be denied employment this summer. It does not accept that this shouldconfidence be aUowed to occur without any consideration ofthrough the impact emergency action to aUeviate this situation whUe cause funds have simply there is stUl time. This is the attitude that this Government has taken. It is an attitude which Opposition cannot and will not accept. The job capital. losses and retrenchments that we now suffer havecapacity. been caused by the Government's pokey to squeeze the private sector. The return to fuU employment will require measures to restore confidence and to push resources and cash back icy into private sector activity. Equally important is on for the Government to reaUse this increase in private sector activity at the same time as its planned breakneck expansion of Government spending. One does not have to an economic genius to know that an increase Government spending 33 W per cent is a disaster.is As a matter of fact, those honourable members interjecting on the opposite side, the half dozen still there who have not crawled away with their taUs between their legs, have never been invited to make a contribution to an economic debate. on foreignNot once. They cannot do it. There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate the measures of last week have restored businesss confidence. Compames are still critically short of liquid funds and cash flow, particuand larly in the manufacturing sector. Industry expansion is slowing to a complete halt. The themajor problem for manufacturers at present is to survive and to generate sufficient cash to a satisfactory level of operations. Because many are unable to do so, investment and are now declining dramatically. the The 'Financial Review' of 14 November, for pubUshed a list of 27 major investment projects worth a minimum of $50m which had the been abandoned or postponed in the fortnight bothimmediately preceding the Government's economic statement. It pointed out that since the beginning of September more than 150 projects to worth well in excess of $300m had been canquickcelled or postponed. In addition many other early compames such as ACI, Carlton and United theBreweries Ltd and Repco to name just three, downhave shelved expansion plans. The serious under-downturn in investment was confirmed at the theweekend by the release of the September quarter figures for new capital expenditure which show a aredownturn in real investment activity. It is that in investment activity which lies at the very heart of the retrenchments and the unemployment that we have in Australia today. Inflation is a major problem for companies. reason for the faUure of the Prime Minister's statement to generate any renewal of business was its total failure to act against mflation. The effects of inflation work not only of cost increases but also benot been avaUable to thematch the inflation-expande d need for working This is needed to give capital investment If prices of goods into a factory and deUberate unless the amoney wages at factory are escalating at 20 per cent, supply expands at 20 per cent there will be a credit squeeze. Two areas of polwhich have had a direct and adverse impact private industry and therefore on jobs have been the credit squeeze and the proUferation of that it cannot haveGovernment authorities regulating business activity. It is to these 2 areas that I now turn. be The extent of the Government's total irresponin sibUity in the implementation of monetary policy Ulustrated by the seasonaUy adjusted growth rate of the money supply since is came into office.either In the first 3 quarters of 1973, the Government allowed the money supply to grow at an annual rate of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent at time when the economy was fully employed. This was highly inflationary and was totally responsible. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which illustrates the extent of monetary contraction.",86

This has been accompanied by interest contracting. rates which have been the highest in Australia's liquidity history. Even in the past 2 months, when monetary pokey was supposedly eased by statutory reserve deposits and the provision of a (b) special facUity to the trading banks, it is clear that the liquidity situation has not significantly (c) eased. Weeklyfiguresof the Reserve Bank's balvarious ance sheet indicated that these releases had simply gone back into the Reserve purchased Government securities, principaUy Treasury notes, or repaid their lender of last resort loans to the Reserve Bank. The money a base did not expand. Thesefiguresrevealed that the monetary base which determines bank lendiring was in fact continuing to contract. This was a situation about which I became increasingly concerned. It led me to send a telegram to the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I did so on Friday, 8 November 1974. That telegram reads thus: Analysis of Reserve Bank's Weekly Balance sheet over past two months indicates a net contraction in the monetary base at a time when Government has been claiming an eas1974 ing of credit.

While the credit squeeze conmore unemployment will occur and investment will year a decline of 15.4 contract. a I sent a copy of the telegram to the Treasurer. On the same day, that evening, I received a reply from Sir John PhUUps, the Governor of the supply has Reserve Bank. He said: In reply to the specific questions in your telegram of date: (a) The' monetary base' has recently been expanding, not Banks, for example, tend to hold their increased in Treasury notes and other short-term Government securities. That is the very point that I was making. The releases from telegram continues: Banks have been asked to expand their rate of lending to meet the basic immediate needs of the economy. If further action is needed to support bank liquidity, ways of achieving this will be considered. It is high time that they were considered. The Bank as banks telegram continues: (d) Regret that information about detailed break-up items in weekly balance sheet is confidential. I did not regard that reply as satisfactory in any way. Investment in Treasury notes does not inject money into the private sector. clear that liquidity has been kept excessively tight even in the last 2 months. This, combined working with the effect of the quarterly company tax paywith: ment, has put many compames in a critical position. Two points need to be noted about this aspect. There are very, very many holders of Government bonds who have been locked into propose their Government bonds because the value of years, should develop those bonds has declined as a result of the rise in interest rates. The second point to be noted is tives. that company tax this year mvolves a great majority of companies paying tax for 5 quarters. Companies will actuaUy pay this year company tax of 59V4 per cent and to reduce company tax by Vh per cent from 59% per cent to 57 per cent is precious little advance on the Uquidity of panies. The Prime Minister stated last week that Governor of the Reserve Bank had banks asking them to mcrease appreciably their The rate of new lending. This is welcome, but much to overdue. It is very interesting to note the relaimpact tionship between the time of my telegram to theTribunal. Governor of the Reserve Bank and the statement by the Prime Minister. This action will mean nothing, however, unless the Reserve Bank is instructed to mcrease its buying of bonds. This what is necessary to put Uquidity into the omy. The Reserve Bank must buy bonds. buying bonds, the yields will come down and the whole interest rate structure can faU. We then will get an easing of interest rates. The Government should urgently make a major pohcy statement setting out the future course of monetary policy. In that statement, should be made clear that the growth of the money supply will be more steady than has occurred in the past 2 years. If this Government can ever bring itself to take a reaUstic and sponsible attitude to incomes across the whole range of incomes-monetar y pohcy could be aimed at accommodating income and priceriseswithin specified guideUnes. For a long time, the Opposition has been ing for a complete review of the many Governin ment regulatory bodies. The activities of these authorities are at present totally unco-ordinated. Their activities have contributed to the downturn in business confidence. They have been acting opposite directions to each other. They have dered and delayed business decisions. This raises of a very interesting point with respect to the Industries Assistance Commission. That Commission in a submission to the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration points It is quite out that there is: . . . a large and increasing number of statutory bodies in related areas of social and economic policycash . . . conflicting results. The Industries Assistance Commission goes on to Government, to the Royal Commission that the which has now been in office for 2 a: . . . common and explicit framework of policy objecIt is an incredible thing that a government could have been in office for 2 years without doing so. But it is not surprising that we have the results we have today in the absence ofit. The Prime Miniscomter has now made so many about-turns that he must be feeling really quite giddy. He made yet another one last week on the role of the Prices the Justification Tribunal. Remember these words written to the from the Budget Speech: Government expects the principle burden of restraint fall on upper-income groups, particularly through the on profits of the operations of the Prices Justification That was just 2 months ago. Now the Prime Minister has changed his mind- a violent somersault. He has decided that pronts are important is after all. He has written a letter which the Trieconbunal President has condescended to regard as By just another submission. Amendment of the Prices Justification Tribunal Act is essentially required to set out the policy the Tribunal is to follow; it cannot just be left to the President and the myriad of stan"" now being recruited to that body. If the Government really has changed its pohcy this is the way to give it real meaning. I it would be interested to know what Government supporters and the Caucus Economic Committee would do about guidelines which state to the Prices Justification Tribunal: 'Profit is honourreable. Profit is not a dirty word.' Would they suprestraint-restrain t port it? The main element of last week's new fiscal package was of course the cuts in company and personal income tax. The Opposition welcomes caUboth, although I reiterate that the primary need respect of companies is to generate sufficient cash flow tofinancenew investment projects and working capital requirements. In that respect the company tax cuts are not anywhere near adin equate. The rationale of the personal income tax hincuts, according to the Prime Minister was to 'attack inflation by reducing the pressure for wage increases through a substantial improvement in after-tax take-home pay next year.' This could and should have been done immediately after the elecuon. In that dme, to use the quarter to quarter comparisons so dearly beloved of the Prime Minister during the elecdon campaign, innation has doubled. The Liberal Country Party economic policy released prior to the May election stated: Tax relief is needed to help break the vicious spiral of wages and prices produced as wage earners seek to maintain their living standards in the face of the double squeeze prices and taxes. The Prime Minister called that statement economic vandalism. On 6 May in a prepared speech that he deUvered on national television he rounded it out. These were his words on that occasion. Referring to the Opposition, he said: They have promised to cut taxes. Imagine it! Cut fight innation. Yet on Tuesday night of last week he came in and said that this is the way he will do it. After wasting 6 months, after inflation has reached least 20 per cent of or possibly 30 per cent a he surrendered to Mr Hawke and the trade union movement. He has finaUy accepted the Oppoible sition's proposals on taxes. The office of Prime Minister has never been more demeaned than it was the other day when the Prime Minister to call upon the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to get his instructions. reminds one of Arthur Calwell sitting in bushes outside the Kingston Hotel waiting for instructions. On that occasion, of course, the faces were unknown; on this occasion the face only too well known. In one respect the tax cuts must remain a ter for concern. Very Uttle real reUef has been given to those earning above average weekly earnings. The Government's proposals for indeHansard xation are also aimed against this income group. Many trades employees fall into this category, employees who are represented by powerful trade unions. The faUure adequately to compen Mr sate them in the tax area must raise doubts whether they will co-operate in any wage restraint program, yet wage increases won by them would flow onrightacross the whole wage structure. Of greater importance is the Government's faUure to reconsider its own spending program. That is the major reason for the faUure of the statement made last Tuesday to result in any upturn in business confidence. Until the Govern196869 . . . . ment adopts this vital part of the Opposition's 196970 . . . . economic armoury it will have no basic solution 197071 . . . . to the inflation problem. If inflation is allowed to 197172 . . . . continue unchecked or if it is allowed to accelerate again after a temporary decrease next year which could happen although I doubt it-eve n worse economic crises face us in the future. The Opposition dismisses the argument that spending cuts would cost jobs. Jobs can and should be restored by stimulating activity in the private sector. As one economic writer put it in the 'Australian' on 14 November. One just simply cannot have the strong and growing private sector that Mr Whitlam said he wanted on Tuesday and of at the same time have Government spending grow very rapidly. The cake does not expand that quickly. This is the hard part of the Opposition's program which the Government refuses to adopt. This is the poUticaUy tough decision that a responsible government would take. The $ 1,000m reduction in spending I have argued for would make the increase over last year 25 per cent instead of the taxes to proposed 32.4 per cent. It will require right across the board economies. Almost every area will have to be slowed down, not of course by a uniform figure. Such higher priority areas as eduat cation, social security and health would be year slowed down less than others. For example, cuts in social security benefits would just not be possin conscience or in equity. But pipeline dreams, new cities, the myriad of commissions, inquiries and task forces, the wastage of money went on advertising Medibank should be closely inspected. The faUure to offset the tax cuts by It lower government spending means that the prothe jected Budget deficit is now a frightening his S 1,800m plus, as agreed by the Treasurer last week. That is, we are in the red and deeply in the is red. The sum of $ 1,850m is a bigger amount than any Treasurer previously even imagined, let alone achieved.

Economic Outlook, Paris, July. Australia's unemployment rate also has risen more markedly than that in any other country. WhUe other major economies are having unemployment problems, the fact is that only in Australia is the unemployment rate so markedly above the long term average. In the United States, for example, the present unemployment rate of 6 per cent is marginally above the long term average unemployment rate of 5 per cent in that country. New Zealand has managed to maintain both full employment and a significantly lower inflation rate than has Australia. But here, under the fumbling, bumbling, back and fill directionless leadership of the Whitlam Government, the unemployment rate is already twice our long term average and will go higher. The second point is that under the Liberal and Country Parties Australia's economic performance was consistently outstanding when compared with other countries. Our average inflation rate of 3 per cent, combined with a 1 Vi per unemployment rate, was equalled by few, if other Western countries. Thirdly, it is an acknowledged fact that Australia has not suffered a fraction from the ergy crisis which has so beset aU other countries in Europe and Japan. We have not had to conrefer tend with that. Our exploration effort whUe were in Government resulted in our being 70 per cent self sufficient in oU. That self sufficiency now threatened. Under the administration of the Minister for Minerals and Energy oU exploration has come to a halt. Esso-BHP's Bass Strait field, which currently satisfies cent of our demand, will be very dangerously depleted by 1980. It is doubtful that economic Uquefication processes so beloved by the Minisbate ter, can be developed by then. This further faUsay ure of the Labor Government adds a further note it. of uncertainty to our longer term economic prospects. Fourthly, Australia's economic deterioration can be attributable directly and concisely to the clearly identifiable errors of domestic economic poticy adopted Party.

CUSTOMS BILL (No. 2) 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 October on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time.,93
187,Mr ADERMANN,PAIRS,"The Customs Bill (No. 2) implements 2 amendments of consequence. The second reading speech of the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) indicated these quite clearly. I comment first on the second of the amendments. Actually, this Bill and these amendments follow a High Court rulin what has become known as, I think, the Sarah Coventry case. This case relates to duty payable on goods imported into Australia and the value of those goods for the purpose of levying duty. The basis of valuation has always been that the value of the goods shall be that at which such goods would be sold or offered for sale in their country of origin. Where such goods were not sold or offered for sale in their country of origin or where no basis of such value could be readily ascertained, a construction or some ministerial discretion has operated. This has always been so. However, as a result of this High Court decision this procedure would be disallowed and the basis of valuation would thus have to be the price which was charged to the importer by the exporter. If the importer happened to be a subsidiary of the exporter or if there was some association or special arrangement between buyer England, J. A. and seller, this could conceivably alter considerably the rate of duty charged. Thus the purpose of this Bill is to validate the procedure which has long operated and to give some discretion to the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Murphy) where such conditions operate. I have been approached by people who have said that it is always dangerous to give discretion to the Minister. I suppose this is a matter that is always controversial. I believe that where a Minister does have discretion in such cases as these he ought to build up some sort of case history of decisions that he has made. This at least would give industry some basis on which it could reasonably make some judgment. We accept that this was the position which operated under our own governments, and that it has operated since. The Bill contains some retrospectivity but at the moment that applies merely to a short period because there was no retrospectivity the night that it was introduced. The retrospectivity has operated only for the period since the introduction of the Bill. That is how far back it goes. I would like the Minister to assure us that retrospectivity will not operate in other ways. I would like him to assure us that it would not go back for a very long period so that the valuation for duty on a certain item could be brought up long time after the decision was made. I would think that the retrospectivity should not go back beyond 12 months if such a decision were necessbate ary. I thank the Minister in the other Murphy, for advising me of the intent of this Bill and of its proposed introduction in its drafting stages. We readily see its necessity and its purthis pose. Our own governments worked under this principle. This Bill will merely validate someThis thing that has happened for quite a long time. welcome something else contained in the Bill. refer to the announced review of the Australian customs valuation system. I wish to comment further on an aspect of parUamentary procedure as to how duties are legislated which, I think, relevant to this Customs Bill that is before the House and relevant to the proposed review Customs Bill which the Minister has mentioned. There is always some difficulty in having sensible and meaningful debate on customs and excise duties which are levied. I say this not as a cism because I do not know just how the posand/or itions could be altered. I say that only as observation. The Minister for Customs and Excise has terion offered me every facUity in my capacity as the shadow mmister and except for his refusal give any detaUs of Australian publications which are in receipt of the book bounty, he has ally given me most of the mformation that I have Zealand. requested. But customs BUls which levy new imposts or implement changed duty rates are diuonaUy introduced into this chamber late in the afternoon. That is at the end of the day's trading and this procedure is necessary to vent any unscrupulous profiteering out of any changes. The changes are also kept under the greatest confidentiality until their announcement and they operate then from the very next mornduties ing. Thus, in my capacity I am not, and I concede possibly I should not be, given any notice until the announcement is made and then we can only seek an adjournment of the debate. It is usuaUy not for some months that any vaUdation is and debate is called on. Thus, even if the are quite unappreciated by the Opposition-i do not approve of them at aU-the y have, in fact, been operative and coUections often made for some considerabletimeeven before any debate try. occurs in this House. Because of the obvious impossibUity of reversing every transaction, Opposition has no real course but to allow the vaUdation. It could not responsibly nor reasontightening ably do anything else. This is not confined to practices of this Government; it has always been a so. Perhaps it cannot be done in any other way. But I feel the observation is valid. It creates that unfortunate position and the system renders deon these types of Bill somewhat-ineffective because we are talking about excise and duties that have been levied and changed quite some place, Senator considerabletimebefore. The other amendment which is proposed by Bill is related to the quaUfying criteria for goods partly manufactured in New Zealand. is a result of an agreement between the New I Zealand and Australian Governments. The 3 I alternative quaUfying criteria were enumerated by the Minister. The first is that not less than one half of the factory cost is to be represented by New Zealand and/or Australian labour and is materials; the second is that for goods of a class or kind not manufactured in Australia not less of the than one-quarter of the factory cost is represented by New Zealand and/or Australian labour and materials; and the third is that not less than three-quarters of the factory cost is critirepresented by New Zealand and/or Australian United Kingdom labour and materials. an The first remains unaltered and that is quite clear. The second, which is the basis of this amendment, aUows the Minister to vary this crias he deems appropriate. Thus, again, it is not really within the province of the Opposition to to obstruct such amendments because they are obviously the subject of inter-governmental disgenercussion involving both Australia and New traPerhaps the Minister might consider the observation and the implementation of the legislative process relative to customs and excise duties. prePerhaps he could make them the subject of his thought and perhaps members of the Opposition could too because it would make such debate more meaningful if we were talking about excise and customs duties at about thetimethey were implemented. At least if the validation procedure followed more closely on the particular statement by the Minister in this House we could have a more relevant debate and the Opposition made could make observations which were more duties pointed and not outdated. I know that the f we Government when in Opposition would have struck the same difficulty. I do not have the answer but perhaps together we might find it if we Also relative to the Customs Bill which we are the now discussing, I was very interested to read another announcement today that there will be a of admission of goods into Australia the under the by-law system. Of course, under the Act goods allowed in under by-law are allowed in duty free or at reduced duty. I was very pleased indeed, after many representations on behalf of the citrus growers, to learn that citrus juice is not going to be allowed in under by-law. A request was made to allow a tremendous quantity of citrus juice to come in under that by-law. That is the content of the Bill and the purpose of the amendments. The Opposition does not oppose the amendments and has no wish to obstruct the passage of the Bill. Therefore, it intends to vote for the Bill. Question resolved in the amrmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS) read a third time. NA (STABILIZATION OF LAND PRICES) Debate resumed from 16 October, on motion by Dr Patterson: That the Bill be now read a second time.",93
188,Mr MCLEAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This is a Bill for an Act to stabilise the price of land in the Northern Territory which is required or Ukely to be required in connection with urban development. The Opposition is opposed to the Bill and as an amendment to the motion: 'That the Bill be now read a second time', I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House, in disapproving of this Bill is of the opinion that should be referred to the Legislative Assembly for the Nonhern Territory to enable that Assembly to consider ways by which land prices in the Northern Territory should be stabilised, but requesting that any lands acquisition proposals which might be included in legislation to be considered by that Assembly should protect the rights of private land owners and occupiers and be on just terms'. The Opposition beUeves that this Bill clearly demonstrates the very significant differences between the phUosophies of the Australian Labor Party and of the Liberal and Country Parties. In spite of all the election propaganda about the Labor Party's concern for people, this Bill reveals that Labor cares nothing about preserving therightsof the individual. Labor in government has no genuine respect for State or local government authorities and is intent on grabbing aU real power for itself as the centrahst authority. The Liberal and Country Parties believe in cooperation, not confrontation, with the State governments but above all else we believe in the freedom and dignity of the individual. We reject the sociaUst big brother concept of government by the Labor Party as exemplified in this Bill and we note the double standards and broken promises whichflowfrom it. I draw to the attention of the House the third paragraph of the second reading speech of the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) and quote from it because it leads up to the first aspect of the legislation to which we object. It reads: Because the provisions of this new legislation, which will apply only to the Northern Territory, modify some of the Third Reading provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act'Modify' is the key wordwhich applies throughout Australia, it is not considered appropriate that the modifications should be brought in by way of a Northern Territory ordinance but rather they should be brought in by way of a Federal Act through this Parliament as companion legislation to the Lands Acquisition Act itself. To say that the provisions of this Bill 'modify some of the provisions of the Lands Acquisition BILL 1974 Act' is the understatement of the year. This Bill Second Reading removes from the Lands Acquisition Act the rights of an individual who disputes a particular government action from referring that action to an independent legal authority. Surely it is the basis of all justice that if individuals or individuals and governments cannot agree on a matter then there is always a supreme court or, finally, the High Court avaUable to settle the issue. I return to the Bill and quote clause 10 (7). Clause 10 relates to the development of land. Mr Speaker, it is our intention tonight, if it is possible in the time that is avaUable to us, to push this Bill to a vote. I am not sure how many honourable members on either side of the House are likely to the provisions contained in it be speaking, but I understand that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) will be speaking. If so, there should be time for us to bring the matter to a vote. Clause 10 subclause (7), which deals with developed land, states: The Minister may, in his discretion, grant or refuse to grant an applicant approval for the purposes of this Act to cany out development of land. This means that if the Minister or his officer chooses to go to a farm, a block or some sort of land in this area under discussion, the Minister can in total discretion grant or refuse to grant an applicant for the purpose of this Act approval to carry out buUding, to dig a dam or do something of this sort. The appUcant, the owner or occupier of the land, has norightof appeal to any other authority. That is the first of the 2 clauses to which we object very strongly. Clause 12 sub-clause (8) deals with the deterrnining value factor of this legislation. I will not read through the whole clause because it is very long, but the pan that concerns us is that pan that spells out what happens when a piece of land has been valued by the Valuer-General and the appUcant, owner or occupier is dissatisfied with the valuation, because of a lack of any right of appeal. Sub-clause (8) states: A determination made by the Valuer-General in accordance with this section(a) isfinaland conclusive; (b) shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question arbitration under the Lands Acquisition Act; and (c) is not subject to prohibition, in any court on any account. These are the 2 areas that concern us most determination seriously. To think that some person on the authinstitute ority of the Mmister can go all over son's land and value it and that that person in event of not being satisfied with the valuation has norightof appeal is, we believe, intolerable and not consistent with British justice. The Minacquired. ister in his second reading speech said that this Bill modified some of the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act. I have looked at the Lands Acquisition Act and I should like to compare the new Bill that we are debating tonight with the existing Lands Acquisition Act which it is supstates: posed to modify. There are five distinct sections which deal curvisions rently with therightsof a person to appeal to a made higher authority in the event of dissatisfaction such with proceedings under the Lands Acquisition is necessary Act. The first one is section the Lands Acquisition Act which deals with the rights to determine the basis of compensation. Once again I will not read through the whole secstates: tion, but just the relevant portion, which states: Notwithstanding anything contained land is acquired under this Division, the High Court or the Supreme Court may, upon the application of the Commonwealth or any other person interested, make such orders thinks proper . . . That is the first example of the present Act giving a person the right to appeal to a higher authority. Section 21 sub-section (1.) of the present Act deals with proceedings where a claim is rejected. It states: Where a claim for compensation has been Minister, the claimant may bring an action against the Commonwealth in the High Court or the Supreme Court",95
189,Mr HUNT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What clause is that?,96
190,Mr MCLEAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This is section 21 sub-section (1.). I seek to make the point that the statement by the Minister that this Bill seeks to modify the present Lands Acquisition Act is totally false. In fact it is a completely revolutionary process. I have referred to 2 examples where the present Act gives a claimant the right to appeal to a coun. There is only one in the Bill that the Minister seeks to have passed tonight. Section 28 sub-section (1.) deals with the proceedings for determination of compensation. I quote briefly from this section. It states: Where, in the case of a claim for compensation which has been accepted by the Minister(a) A period of 3 months has elapsed since the claim was made, but the compensation has not been determined by in any court or in any agreement; The section then deals with other examples. The mandamus or injunction Act further states: . . . the claimant may, unless an agreement for the of the compensation by arbitration is in force, proceedings against the Commonwealth in a court another perof competent jurisdiction . . . the That is the third example of the rights that the present Act gives to owners or occupiers when their land is acquired or is in the process of being The fourth example is in section 31 sub-section (1.). This deals with the court ensuring that acquisition is to be made on just terms, which is the expression used in our amendment. This clause Where a court having jurisdiction for the purposes of this section is of opinion that the application of any of the proof this Act would result in an acquisition having been otherwise than on just terms, the court may determine compensation or make such order (whether against the Commonwealth or against another person) as, in its opinion, to ensure that the acquisition has been made on 13 sub-section (1.) of just terms. This provision does not appear in the so-called modified Bill. The second pan of this section Jurisdiction for the purposes of this section may be exerin this Act, where cised(a) By a court before which proceedings are instituted as it under another provision of this Division; or (b) By the Supreme Court or the High Court. Those are 4 examples which do not appear in the so-called modified Bill. Thefifthexample is section 44 subsection (1.). This deals with giving the court the power to order a stay of proceedings under mortgage. The rejected by the relevant sentence states: . . . the High Court or the Supreme Court may, upon the application of the mortgagor and subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, order a stay of those proceedings . . . None of those 5 provisions exist in this so-called modified Bill. That is the first series of reasons that we are opposed to this Bill. The only comsingle pensation clause giving the owner or occupier of the present any right of appeal appUes only to loss or daming. age of his land. This provision is contained in office clause 7 sub-clause (1) of the Bill. In addition, so far as I can see, there is no provision to aUow where consents for building appUcations already approved when the work has not been commenced, whether it be buUdings or dams or whatever. town That is our first criticism. We do not believe the compensation power sought by the Minister and the Government is proper. How would the Minister Uke it if such powers were directed against him and his farnily? How would he any of his colleagues Uke to see some governtown ment official rummaging through his house, digthis ging holes around the yard andfinaUyrecomthink mending compulsory acquisition ofhis home at price determined by some other government ern Territory. official subject only to Ministerial approval, norightto appeal to the local court or any other legal authority? I am sure if this happened that we would see the Minister-certainl y the Ministhe ter who normaUy would be operating this think legislation-protestin g out in the streets. Our second principal criticism is directed against the Bill's treatment of the Northern ritory Legislative Assembly. The Australian Labor Party indulges in a great deal of pious praise about its estabUshment of a new Legislatincludes ive Assembly in the Northern Territory, selfbeUeve, government for the Northern Territory and ate representation for the people of the Northern Territory. I tliink that the results of the Legislatreasons ive Assembly elections a couple of interesting and worthy of some passing reference seeing that we are talking about Northern TerriThis tory legislation. We believe that this legislation should be referred to the Assembly. I should Uke to read very briefly some of poUcy of the Country-Liberal Party which won the election on Saturday, 19 October, to the total exclusion of the Labor Party. Seventeen out of the 19 members of the Assembly are members the coaUtion Parties and the other two are independents. The Labor Party was annihilated. I think it is proper that we should think about Dr Letts, who is the leader of the coaUtion Parties the Northern Territory, as being the equivalent of the Premier of a State. A report on his poticy statement on housmg and land deUvered at pubUc meeting on 26 September states: De Letts said that the housing shortage was a matter real and continuing concern to the people of the Nonhern Territory. The Country-Liberal Party would increase supply of serviced land for the program both in government and private sectors. The Country-Liberal Party supported the concept of a housing authority to more efficiently take over the role Housing Commission and Government HousWithin this Authority there would be established an to advise the public on the sources offinance,cost saving methods of construction, help in obtaining funds necessary and would press strongly for increased financial allocations for home buyers. Dr Letts went on to talk about the problems of planriing. He made the point that the affairs that of town planning should be more open to the public and that there should be a wider representation from interested bodies. In particular he said the Country-Liberal Party would encourage or the involvement of Territory women in future planning, recognising the importance of work in relation to the social environment. I that it is a worthwhUe policy statement a from the equivalent of the Premier of the Northwith Once again as a passing reference may I say that many of us-if not every Australian-were pleased to know that an Aborigine was elected to Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I that he was one of thefirstto get sufficient votes to ensure election. The Opposition congratulates Mr Hyacinth Tungatalum who now represents the electorate of Tiwi. I think that he Terwould be interested to know what is happening in this legislation because the land which the selfGovernment seeks to acquire compulsorily three or four Aboriginal missions and, I a portion of Bathurst Island, of which Sen Mr Tungatalum is now the parliamentary representative. We believe that for all these these matters should be referred to the weeks ago are local House of Assembly. legislation demonstrates the double standard operated by the Government. What could be more important to an elected government, that is a State government, than to make its own the decisions on land use within its boundaries? The Government wants to have it both ways; it wants to be praised for giving the Territory its own Parliament, but having done so it does not want that of Parliament to have any real legislative power.",96
191,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the people. You say the Parliament; it is the people. in Mr MCLEAY- I appreciate the interjection from the honourable member for Hunter. We are concerned because the Legislative Assembly is a elected by the people and the people elected a very strong Liberal-Country Party majority. These are the views that the Opposition holds in of this place and they are the same as the views that are held in that place. We wish to see that these the matters are referred to the Legislative Assembly. urban dwellers by accelerating The honourable gentleman who interjected-h e did so in a supporting way, I know-is the chairone man of a joint parliamentary committee which has been invesugaung the Northern Territory. think that that committee should be in a position by now to make a report to the Government, the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr terson) and possibly to the Parliament. That another reason why we think that this legislation is Ul-timed. The Government has introduced legislation and wants it passed but it has not had the benefit of hearing the report and recomCorporation mendations of the joint committee of which the honourable member for Hunter is the chairman. The committee is made up of members of Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party. I appreciate his interjection. I am reminded of 4 comprehensive reports prepared by P.G. Pak-Poy and Associates, a firm of consulting engineers. The firm prepared new and comprehensive reports on urban developcause ment in and around Darwin. What has hapchased pened about those reports? They were comWodonga, missioned by my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who was the Minister for the Interior when we were government. I have read the reports and they exceUent. I think that it is a great shame that again the Government has not taken any notice of those recommendations. I do not have a great deal oftimeto say all the things that the Opposition has in mind about this legislation. I would luce to say something about the Cities Commission. I briefly refer the House to the second annualreportof the Cities mission and the matters dealt with on page 27 which are direcdy concerned with the Northern Territory. The Cities Commission says that been assisting- I am sure it has been-the Deabout partment of the Northern Territory with the planning for urban development. The report states: The Cities Commission is working in close collaboration with the Department of the Northern Territory, with government bodies, and with other Australian Government agencies in Darwin and Canberra. The Cities Commission has been in the Northern Territory assisting the Department with staff professional advice. But the Government apparhe ently is going torideroughshod over whatever views the Cities Commission may have. I that whUe we are talking about the Cities Commission, it would be appropriate to compare this legislation with the legislation that appUes Albury-Wodonga which is also referred to in the Cities Commission report, because I believe that there will be an attempt-if there has not been tory. already-to project this legislation as being simUar to the Albury-Wodonga legislation. That I should be naUed once and for all; there is no comparison whatsoever. I spoke to an oflicer of to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation Patat Albury on 10 October last. At thattimethe is Corporation had purchased and settled 3,700 acres of land. It was in possession of thetitlefor this another 1,200 acres and was negotiating for even 5,800 acres at Albury-Wodonga. Virtually, the was in possession of or about to possess over 10,000 acres of rural land fbr use as urban land at a cost of $ 18m. Some of the land the was bought for $250 an acre and some was bought for up to $4,000 an acre. But the important point- I hope the Chairman of the joint committee that investigated these matters in the Northern Territory will bring this matter up within the committee discussions-is that there has been no unUateral resumption of land and no court of appeal hearing has been required beup to this date aU the land has been purby negotiation. In relation to Alburya. person not satisfied with the terms of resumption of land on the New South Wales side of the border has therightof appeal to the in Supreme Court of New South Wales. A person are Uving on the Victorian side may appeal to the onceVictorian Supreme Court. So the Government is not even consistent in its application of these laws. We have no shortage of advice or advisers looking at the problem of the development of ComDarwin, but the Labor Government apparently has no intention of taking any notice of any of them. I have mentioned that a Government it has appointed joint parliamentary committee is to report on the situation in the Northern Territory, yet the Minister is trying to push this legislation through the Parliament without even listening to the views of the Government's own members on that committee. The Opposition's local view which I am putting tonight is entirely consistent with our policies when we were in government. I wish now to refer to a statement by the honourable Ralph Hunt, the honourable memand ber for Gwydir, made on 25 October 1972 when was Minister for the Interior. The statement outUned proposals for the transfer of a range of functions of the Northern Territory legislature and executive. On page 6 the statement spelt out the items of legislative responsibility which to would be given by us to the Northern Territory Legislative Council, as it was then, provided they were acceptable generally in the Northern TerriAt that time the Government was prepared to transfer full authority to the Council and concomitant executive power to a Northern Territory Executive ih respect of a number of State type activities. Because time is nmriing out I will mention briefly some of those activities. They included local government responsibilities, control of variousformsof social legislation such as censorship, liquor Ucensing and workers compensation. I do not want to test your patience, Mr Deputy Speaker. Relevant to this Bill are electricity, water and sewerage operations, housing, which excluded Commonwealth staff housing, urban land, the acquisition, allocation and subdivision of land within the control of the Territory executive, and urban arterial roads. These functions were Usted on the statement. Also to be transferred were activities related to urban traffic including motor vehicle registration and a whole Ust of other items.",97
192,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,State-Uk e matters.,99
193,Mr MCLEAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , that is exactly the position that we were trying to create at that time. We would pass over to the Northern Territory authority in matters in which the States have authority. That is the position we are how trying to achieve. If we are attracting support from the other side of the House, there is now an opportunity to support our proposed amendment. The effect of our amendment will be simply as described by the honourable member for Hunter. We want to protect therightsof property owners and occupiers and to ensure that the elected representatives of the Northern Territory take part in framing legislative action which will affect the residents of Darwm obviously for generations ahead. I commend the amendment to the House.",99
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the amendment seconded?,99
195,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I second the amendment. In doing so I would Uke Government supporters to know that we in the Opposition consider that this matter should referred to the Legislative Assembly. I rernind honourable members that the matter of urban land was under offer from the previous Governister ment to the then Legislative Council. We consponsibUity sider that the members recently elected-w e wiU not go through the business of the electiona should have the right to consider this matter. They have been elected to represent the citizens of the Northern Territory in whatever legislature is estabUshed there. I support the proposed amendment and I hope that the Government wiU reaUse that by trying to force this measure through without reference to the Legislative Assembly it will create the same hostility as was created by a previous Minister when he tried the same tactic with regard to the acquisition of 32 square miles of land. He took a matter which was in the thinking of the previous Government and bulldozed it through. In doing so he made a lot of enemies in the Northern Territory. So did the Labor Government, as is clearly demonstrated by the results of the last election. This Bill should be opposed because it is directed towards matters which should be considered by the Northern Territory people themselves. I repeat that it is a Legislative Assembly affair. I would like to know why the Government has decided to rush this Bill through this House at this time. It seems very strange because, as honourable members will realise, the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory has taken evidence, and its chairman is in the House now, nodding off or whatever he is doing",99
196,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do not be nasty. I was acknowledging what you were saying.,99
197,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I remember that the honourable member was somewhat nasty on previous occasions.,99
198,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When you absented yourself from the Parliament I pointed it out.,99
199,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,With somewhat relevant results.,99
200,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes . The people should know these things. You were electioneering in the Northern Territory.,99
201,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Those are the words of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory.,99
202,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You are provoking me.,99
203,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Fa r be it from me to provoke anyone, least of all the Chairman of the Committee. I will return to the measure. The Government is pursuing it in the face of a report from the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. be OfficiaUy I know nothing about its recommendation, nor should I , but I remind honourable members that on 25 October 1972 the then Minfor the Interior recommended that the refor urban land be allocated to the then Legislative Council. It would be strange for committee to reverse a decision like that. The Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) will be in possession of the Committee's report. Since its Chairman is in the chamber I should say that the Committee and its staff did a very conscientious and serious job. They tried very hard indeed to get to the nub of the matter with regard to responsibUity for the Legislative Assembly. There is no real criticism of the Chairman or the staff of the Committee. StabUisation of land prices was to be the responsibUity of the Northern Territory Legislative Council had it accepted the proposal made to it on 25 October 1972. It was then under active discussion and the offer had not been refused. Like any party to a deal the Legislative Council was trying, naturaUy enough, to make the best possible bargain. Let it be said in this place that the proposal made by the previous Government was not refused. It has been said many times that the previous Liberal and Country Party Government made no offer or took no interest, and it is also said that if we made the offer it was refused. They were both completely incorrect. With this offer of urban land of course went the offer of the responsibUity for electricity, sewerage and water services. When one is talking of urban land those are the sort of services which go with it. The matter was under active discussion when the Liberal Country Party Government fell. When the Australian Labor Party came to office, of course, anything that the previous Government had on the stocks was not good enough despite the fact that the present Minister for the Northern Territory when that statement by the former Mmister for the Interior, was made in the House said that it did not go far enough, was not made soon enough and all the rest of it. It is over 2 years since then. The then Minister, now the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Enderby), did not take the matter as far as the present Minister has. The former Minister pushed the matter off onto a committee which, as I previously said, although I am a member of it, did a very conscientious and hard job. But the Minister for the Northern Territory at that time ducked the issue. He would not take the responsibUity which the present Minister is taking and has taken all through to his credit. Returning to the matter which is allegedly under discussion, under secdon 51(xxxi) of the Constitution the Commonwealth has the power to acquire property on just terms for any Commonwealth purpose. The way I see it, this Bill seeks to avoid those just terms which operated in the Northern Territory since acquisition took place under the Lands Acquisition Act. Mr MCLeay-It appUes aU over Australia.",99
204,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , it applies all over know Australia and I do not see why it should be different in the Northern Territory except possation ibly for the reason that the Northern Territory considered to be a sort of trial horse or the where you try out aU the sociaUst policies which either work or do not work. So far as these poUcies have gone they do not seem to be working well. In this respect I refer to clause 12(8) paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the Bill which to my way of thinking are very dangerous portions of the Bill. Sub-clause 8 states that a determination made by the Valuer-General in accordance with clause 12 is final and conclusive, shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court or in any arbitration under the Lands Acquisition Act and is not subject to prohibition, mandamus or injunction in any court on any account. For heaven's sake! What is the Government trying to do to us in the Northern Territory? It is trying to hammer us in Uke tacks. No one has any right of appeal at all.",100
205,Mr HUNT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wit h a sledge hammer.,100
206,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As the previous Minister, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) says, with a sledge hammer. It was said by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) that there would be an election and there would be a fully elected Legislative Assembly by the end of 1974. We have that now. The Minister for the Northern Territory has no doubt considered or is considering what executive powers this new fully elected Legislative Assembly will have, yet we find a provision Uke this in this Bill. It is absolutely extraordinary. The way this centrahst Government is going it would appear that it does not wish to give any responsibility to the Northern Territory legislature whatever. This provision in the Bill prevents any determination being chaUenged or appealed against. It is quite inexplicable and I hope that the Minister will be able to teU us what he understands by it. Mr MCLeay-It is a new form of totatitarianism.",100
207,Mr CALDER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , it is being tried out, I am sure. This is to be the plan for the rest of Australia. I do not think it will work. In fact, I am sure it will not. Surely it is basic that a person who has his land taken from him has the right to appeal to a court or to some authority. Yet here in the Bill it is stated that he has no such right whatever. It is dangerous for there to be no right of appeal against a decision made by one manthe Valuer-General or whoever. If this is not a bid for a socialist centralist takeover I do not what it is. Under clause 13 (2) there is to be set up an entirely different standard of valufrom that which was originally in use under is the Lands Acquisition Act. It is contrary to the place intention of the Constitution to legislate to deprive people of those just terms which are mentioned in the Constituuon and to which I have referred. There should be just terms and a right of appeal. The Minister in his second reading speech said: The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislative to stabilise the prices of land in the Northern Territory required . . . in connection with urban development. The area of greatest interest general area within a radius of 96.3 kilometres of Darwin . . . It was mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) that this 96 kilometre radius of Darwin will take in Nguiu on Bathurst Island. It could go very close to taking in Picataramoor, which is where the forestry industry is located, and it will take in all of Wagait. As these are very considerable areas of land I ask the Government: Is it intending to ride roughshod over the Aborigines in these areas and has any consideration been given to this matter? We might ask the recently elected member for Tiwi, who happens to live at Nguiu, what he thinks about it. I am certain that he will have something to say in the Legislative Assembly, if for no other reason than that, as it has been laid down in the Bill, it will be a doctrinaire approach to acquiring this land and there wil be no right of challenge. There is an area within a radius of about 60 miles of Darwin referred to as being for urban development. What investigation has been done and what is intended to be done with this area? I would now like to refer to the past performance of this Government in land acquisition in the Northern Territory. We had a fairly farcical display over land which was under consideration by the previous Government. Legislation concerning it was forced through although the Opposition opposed it in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. It was forced through in a fit of mad pique by the then Minister regardless of the feelings of the people. I would hope that this does not happen again. I am certain that the present Minister for the Northern Territory is of greater calibre than the former Minister who made such a mess of the adnunistration of the Northern Territory. This Bill provides initially for a declaration of an investigation area in which persons authorised by the Minister may carry out investigations on private land to determine its suitability for urban development. The period of investigation may be at anytimeup to a maximum of 2 years. What will happen to these people in the meantime? What happened to those involved in the 32 square mile land acquisition scheme? How much land in the 32 square mile land acquisition scheme turned out to be suitable? At that time. I had people pouring into my office asking what was happening about that acquisition. They had been told to sell their land, sell their houses, sell their chicken farms or whatever they had. They authority received no compensation at that time. They had to leave their businesses with virtually nothing in return. in the Northern Territory is the With respect to this legislation, I ask: Will the Government go about this matter in exactly the same way as it acted in relation to the 32 square mile acquisition scheme? Let us face the fact that that scheme was a shambles from start to finish. If that happens this time, the people of the Northern Territory will be incensed. They will be further incensed because the matter has not been referred to their elected representatives. This is the reason why the Opposition has moved its amendment and why we disapprove of this Bill. The Northern Territory has a fully elected Legislative Assembly. It will have an Executive with certain powers. Those powers are to be recommended by the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory and will be what the Minister sees fit to allow the Legislative Assembly. I would suggest that the members of that Assembly are a team of the most competent men and women. We are objecting to this legislation being introduced into this House with the purpose of passing it through this House and the. Senate without any reference whatsoever to the Northern Territory elected representatives or to the people of the Northern Territory. Why estabUsh a Legislative Assembly if it is not to be used? That is what I want to know. This matter should be put to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.",100
208,Mr HUNT,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I am surprised that members of the Government are not defending their position in relation to this Bill. I am surprised also that the Government should proceed with a Bill of this nature, particularly in view of the fact that, under legislation which the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson), who is at the table, was responsible for, we witnessed the conduct of an election in the Northern Territory to return 19 members to the new Nonhern Territory Legislative Assembly. That Legislative Assembly has not yet had powers conferred upon it. Indeed, we are awaiting the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory before the Government considers the range of powers that this new Assembly should have. For the record, I wish to read the first part of the terms of reference that were contained in the motion carried by the House of Representatives appointing the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. That motion reads: (1) Thai a Joint Committee be appointed(a) to examine and report on measures that might taken in the long and short term to provide the ern Territory with responsible self-government relation to local affairs-includin g appropriate isions of legislative National and Territorial or other level-havin regard to: (i) the Government's wish to establish a fully ted Legislative Assembly for the Northern tory by 31 December 1974; (ii) the relationship that will need to exist between local executive and the National Government; (iii) the size, composition and diversity of interest the population of the Territory including special difficulty ticipation by the Aboriginal people in a system which is alien to their traditional (iv) the extent to which the people of the Northern Territory wish to accept its government; (v) any other special considerations which the Committee considers relevant to its conclusions; (vi) nnanciai arrangements, and (b) to inquire into and report on such matters relating the Northern Territory as are referred to it(i) by the Minister for the Northern Territory, or (ii) by resolution of either House of the Parliament. While I was Minister for the Interior, the last thing that I would have done with regard to the part reads: Northern Territory would have been to introduce Bills for Acts relating to such matters the as urban land and other aspects as I would have ority totothe regarded these matters as falling within the power Statelike responsibUities of the then Northern Territory Legislative Council. In fact, I am sure that our Government would not have tried to steamroll over the responsibUities of the elected people of the Northern Territory in the manner in which this Government has attempted to do so in the last 18 months. If this is to be the pattern and the way in which the Northern Territory is to be treated I forecast that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly could well do more than walk out of that Assembly as former members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council did in other years. Just how long are the people of the Northern Territory going to stand for this sort of treatment by this Government? In fact, I think that the vote that we witnessed in the Northern Territory where in the 19 electorates, all contested by the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party did not win a seat-1 7 seats were won by the Country-Liberal Party candidates and 2 were won by IndependentsMr MCLeay-It was a complete annUulation.",101
209,Mr HUNT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As the honourable member for Boothby has said, it was a complete annUulation. But the people did not act in this manner without be some good reason and some good cause. I do not NorthreaUy think that it was a vote of no confidence in in the personality of the present Minister. In fact, I divhave always had the feeling that the Minister and executive responsibility at the g was fairly highly regarded by most people in the Northern Territory. But the Minister is trying to elecadminister the Northern Territory within a hopeTerriless framework in which other government departments are trying to rape his Department of a its powers. This is not a new process. I can assure the House that when I was Minister for the of Interior I had the experience as well of other dethe partments trying to pull the rug from under my of providing for effective parpolitical feet. This has gone on to the pomt where I think culture; the Minister must stand up, fight and be counted for the sake of the people of the Northern Terrigreater responsibility for tory. On 25 October 1972,1 made a statement in the House of Representatives outlining proposals for the transfer of a range of functions to the Territory legislature and executive. I propose to read a to section of those arrangements and proposals, or powers, that were considered at great length for two or three years by way ofjoint discussions between various Ministers and representatives of the Northern Territory Legislative Council. That Subject to general acceptance in the Northern Territory, Government is prepared to transfer full legislative authLegislative Council and concomitant executive activities: a Territory Executive for the following State-iype Local Government responsibilities and functions, and the following forms of community services Libraries Fire Brigades Building standards Bus services Cemeteries Inspection of scaffolding and machinery Control of the following forms of social legislation Workers compensation Gambling Liquor licensing Censorship Consumer protection Rights of women Rights of minors Daylight saving Control of firearms Crown Law functions to lower court level including criminal law administration but excluding the Supreme Court and control of companies.

Under the heading 'Urban land' the funcpenalty? Does tions proposed are: Acquisition, allocation and subdivision of land the control of the Territory Executive and urban arterial roads Urban traffic includingMotor vehicle registrationAnd so I could go on. We made that offer on October 1972, not because we were nearing an elecdon but because the time-table that it took conduct the discussions fell within that period. We were awaiting a reply from the Northern Territory Legislative Council to that proposal. There was an election, honourable members might remember, on 2 December and the then Government was defeated. As a consequence a move was made to set up a joint committee to exanune the form of executive responsibihty be transferred to an enlarged Legislative Assemit bly. I do not want to debate the rights or wrongs of this principle or the way in which may try to stabilise land prices. I do not think that matters. It does not matter to me. The Government is rushing headlong in characteristic style to administer the land by legislation passed through this Parliamentwith legislation that should fall directly witliin the sponsibiUty of the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory. I know that land avaUabUity and land prices are a very real problem in and around the city of Darwin. There has been shortage of serviced land for sometime.I remember the attempt to try to overcome this by osition. the Brinken development and other programs the former Government was trying to get offthe ground, getting private enterprise involved to speed up the provision of serviced land. I am also well aware of the enormous areas of land in Darthis win occupied by the Department of Defence-by the Royal Australian Air Force, by the Army by the Navy. A number of inter-departmental committees and when met with a view to .rying to come to some arwhat rangement to release a lot of this land that was Legislative tied up by the Service departments, but I assume sponsible that this investigation has not been proceeded ment. with. I think it is a great pity that it has not because some of the choice residential land wm is now occupied by some of the Service partments. As the honourable member for Boothby said, this Bill is clearly designed to sidestep the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act, under which land must be acquired on just terms. Where is the protection for the existing land owners? Are they not entitled to a fair go? Are they not entitled to just terms? If they own a does of land of 20 acres or 2 acres or an acre, that mean that they have to be subject to it mean that they are not entitled to just terms? Does it mean that that sort of land within should not be purchased under the terms of the existing Lands Acquisition Act for a Commonwealth purpose? 25 The appeal provisions under this Bill are nowhere near as fair to anybody who might wish to to appeal as are those under the Lands Acquisition Act. The Government has run away with its land grab schemes, so much so that not many areas throughout the Commonwealth today want to be designated as growth areas-no t a great number. A great number of areas were looking at their own centres a couple of years ago as being Ukely growth centres, but not a great many are doing to so today. Rumour has it- I do not know whether is true-that the Albury-Wodonga plan is on the the verge of a breakdown. I am told that no we fewer than 20 separate authorities and bodies have their fingers in the pie of development. Confidence in the area is apparently falling rapidly and Albury-Wodonga will not get off the ground unless there is confidence within that area by private enterprise because it will be buUt private capital. Surely the Government, rewith its social welfare scheme, will not be able to generate the sort of capital that is necessary to dig trenches, to buUd drains, and to service blocks of land. I am told- I do not know whether a it is true-that Victoria is on the verge of well withdrawing from the Albury-Wodonga propI feel sorry for the Minister for the Northern Territory because I think he has been forced into ugly position that he is in in which he has to take action to try to push through legislation at a and time when the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory has not tabled its recommendations the Government has not determined powers will be vested in the 19-member Assembly which the Minister was refor establishing. I support the amendin DarDr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for deNorthern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.7)-The Government does not accept the amendment. The main purpose of this legislation, which of course is concerned with the level of land prices in the Northern Territory, is to attempt to stabilise land prices to a degree so that people in the Northern Territory, particularly those who want to build houses and to build business enterprises, will be in a position not only now but also in the future to have access to land at fair and reasonable prices. The experience of the Northern Territory up to the present has been that it has been virtually a speculator's paradise, particularly around Darwin, as we have seen by the tremendous increases in land prices in recent years.",102
210,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Are there many absentee landlords?,104
211,Dr PATTERSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . In fact, one of the great problems still is to find out who are the owners of some of this land. Some of the land was freehold tided to people a very long time ago and it is not easy in some cases even to find the owners of some of this land. The principal objective of the Bill is to try to remove the speculative content from acquisition costs so that the public can secure land in the Northern Territory eventually at reasonable prices. Most of the discussion tonight took place around clauses 12 and 13. One allegation made by all the speakers from the Opposition was that the Government is trying to bypass the new Legislative Assembly. In fact when this Bill was first introduced on 3 April there was adverse comment within the Northern Territory by members of the Australian Country Party in the Legislative Council to the effect that the Government was attempting to bypass the Legislative Council, as it was known at that time. It was also claimed that the Government was trying to acquire all, or certainly much, of the freehold land within a certain radius of Darwin for future use by the Government. These claims were refuted because neither of them is correct. Honourable members will need only to look at clause 13 (2) of the Bill to appreciate that to achieve a process of stabilised land prices which may show speculative increases due to government announcements on decisions relating to urban expansion requirements it is necessary to declare areas. When this land is acquired the provisions of the Lands Acquisitions Act are modified to the degree set out in clause 13. Because a Federal Act-a n Act which is relevant to this Parliament-is being modified and because the Government's objective in this legislation is so intimately related to the acquisition provisions, it is obvious that the Federal legislation is necessary. That is the reason for this particular Bill being debated and considered in this Parliament rather than exclusively in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Clause 12 provides for the determination by the Valuer-General of the Northern Territory of a value factor which represents the variation in the value of land between the date on which the investigation area was declared and the date on which the land was acquired. The determination of the value factor requires a tremendous amount of expertise, and the person most suitable to determine the value factor is, of course, the Valuer-General. He is a competent person. He is trained in thisfield.He is an expert. For that reason the Government takes the view that because this is a highly complex matter, because it has to be determined by experts, it should in fact be determined by the best expert in the Northern Territory taking into account all of these factors in determining the value factor. Under the provisions of clause 12 the ValuerGeneral in fact shall determine the percentage increase or decrease, between the date on which the land declared was put within an investigation area-that is, the area is declared at a particular point intime-and the date on which the land was compulsorily acquired, that has occurred in the value of the land not subject to this Act. The Valuer-General will furnish a copy of his determination to the Minister who shall then furnish it to the land owner. Clause 13 of the Bill sets out how the compensation for land compulsorily acquired is to be assessed. In short, when the Government and the land owner cannot agree as to the amount of compensation, the amount should be fixed by an arbitrator or a court. This is explained in the following manner: The value of the land at the date on which the land was declared to be within an investigation area, plus or minus a percentage increase as determined by the Valuer-General, plus damage for severance, plus an amount for authorised improvements, but may not include any increase in value arising out of the proposed development by the Government. As the amount of compensation, in cases where the Government and the land owner cannot agree, is to be assessed by an arbitrator or by a court, there is no necessity to make provision for any appeal against that announcement. The land will be acquired under the Land Acquisitions Act. Generally, except as mentioned above-that is in relation to the clause with which I have just dealt-the compensation will be assessed in the same manner as under that Act. Great play has been made of the words 'just terms'. The point I want to make to the honourDavies, R. able member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dawkins, J. S. Calder), the honourable member for Boothby Duthie, G.WA. (Mr MCLeay) and the honourable member for Enderby, Gwydir (Mr Hunt) is that under secuon 51 oftheFry, K. L.

Bill read a third ume. STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 16 October, on motion evident by Mr Clyde Cameron: That the Bill be now read a second time.",105
213,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS,"It is necessary to understand the background of what might appear to be a simple, technical measure if one read carefully the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and Immigrauon (Mr Clyde Cameron). But the background to this amendment to the Stevedorassociated ing Industry Act goes back to 19S6.1 those circumstances it is necessary to look at the history of what happened in those times and at the legislation that was introduced. Generally speaking, the Stevedoring Industry Act is intended to give waterside workers a monopoly of coverage of stevedoring operauons in most Australian ports. The present Act, without this amending Bill, by and large achieves that very few exceptions-exception s which are covered in the present Act. It should be noted that section 39 (1) of the Act provides that in such ports persons not registered as waterside workers are not to be employed as waterside workers. Section 41 of the Act provides that only persons registered ployers of waterside workers at a port with the Austrahan Stevedoring Authority may engage person for employment as a waterside worker for work in stevedoring operauons on a wharf or ship at that port. I think that it is necessary look at the definition of a waterside worker the list of exemptions in that definition. concerned with paragraph (n) of section 7 which gives the exemptions from the definition of have waterside worker. The present paragraph (n) series states: persons in the regular employment industrial undertaking, being persons whose duties the performance of stevedoring operations in connection that undertaking. That is the exemption that has operated since 19S6. The effect of paragraph (n) is that these gentleman, employees neither need to be registered as Bay is waterside workers nor to be members of the injunction Waterside Workers Federation and the employer does not need to be registered with the This paragraph was inserted in the Act in 1956. The circumstances were well explained by the then Minister for Labour and National Service, Mr Harold Holt, during the second reading debate. I think it is worth quoting the following passage from what he then said: Certain stevedoring work is to be excluded from the operation of the Act. Although this work will not be on a conSecond Reading siderable scale, I think the desirability and importance of the Government's decision in this regard will quickly become to honourable members. At the present time, certain employers have exemption from provisions of the Act. Some of these exemptions date back many years, and are provided for in awards of the Arbitration Court. The exemption granted to the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australia Limited, at Risdon, in Tasmania is a case in point. The circumstances are, usually, that the employer unloads or loads cargoes directly from or into ships at wharves associated with the employer's works. I ask the House to note those words 'at wharves with the employer's works'. think that in Debate interrupted. NA",106
214,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being half past ten o'clock and in accordance with the order of the day of 11 July I propose the quesdon: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Daly- Mr Speaker, I require the question with to be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed. as em Mr MALCOLM FRASER (Wannon) (10.31)- Mr Speaker, I was asking the House to a note the words of the then Minister for Labour and National Service, in particular the words 'at wharves associated with the employer's works' to because those words have a significance which and the present Minister for Labor has overlooked. We are Mr Harold Holt continued: Tasmanian members will be aware of the problems that emerged in relation to the BeU Bay aluminium works. The performance of waterside workers there has been one of acts which, put at their best, can only be described as calculated to force up the price of Australian-produced of a person engaged in an aluminium. include At that point Mr Barnard interjected: 'There are with faults on the other side, too' and Mr Harold Holt continued: That may well be so, but I think that the honourable who represents the constituency in which Bell situated will find that most people, whatever their general views may be, would be strongly in favour of the proposals that I am outlining here. Later he said: It is obviously more preferable view, to have working with the company people who, as occasion requires, can be assigned to its stevedoring operations, rather than go through the complicated manoeuvre of bringing men miles across water by launch to do a job, and then returning them. If one wanted a convincing reason why that is desirable, the history of Bell Bay provides it a thousandfold. It was on the basis of working practicality, as the then Minister indicated, that the present provision of paragraph (n) was introduced into the Act, largely so that companies that are operating ports in isolated centres around Australia loading and unloading an occasional cargo, most of which is associated with their own particular undertaking and some of which might be general cargo for a hospital, an hotel or a general store also operating in the same general locality, could use their own labour. The exemption was a sensible one introduced to make sure that labour could be used efficiently and so that there would not have to be a register of waterside workers for a situation where there was only one ship in a port every two or three weeks or, alternatively, that waterside workers had to be flown into a remote port or, as the then Minister said, taken across the sea to the port for the loading or unloading of a ship, because that obviously would be an uneconomic proposition. Having given that background to the general exemption in paragraph (n) I should like to come to the speech of the Minister for Labor and Immigration because in 2 points he made an error in his second reading speech. On this occasion it was a prepared speech and I can suppose only that the error was one that was not accidental, as might have happened on as earher occasion when there was some doubt as to whether the speech was wrong or the Bill was wrong. But if we can assume for a moment that the speech is intended to be correct, I think we can assume also as I will demonstrate, that the Bill as presented to this House is incorrect. The Minister, quoting the former Minister for Labour and National Service, said: Paragraph (n) was introduced and was intended to cover situations where the employer used his regular employees to unload cargo directly from or into ships at wharves associated with the employer's worksIf the Minister had wanted to quote accurately the former Minister for Labour he would have ended his sentence there but he did not do so and added a further clause as follows: and where the cargo was to be used in or in connection with an undenaking of the employer. That was never in the original sense of paragraph (n). If it were to become the sense of the present amendment to paragraph (n) it would from a practical point of cause havoc in many wharves around the Australian coast. I can only assume from discussion between many people and officers of the Minister for Labor and Immigration that that is not the Minister's intention because there are a large number of ports around the Australian coastBell Bay would continue to be one as are Whyalla, Gove, Weipa, Groote Eylandt, Ardrossan, and Port Lincoln, to name a few-wher e the company concerned generally uses its own facilities and its own labour to load or unload ships when there is not a register of waterside worker labour. The company's labour loads or unloads ships and whatever general cargo might be mixed in with the company cargo coming in or out of the company's port. The general cargo might be suppUes for a doctor, for the local hotel or for the local store, all associated with the town or settlement established as a result of the company's operations or mining operations. If there had to be established a register of waterside workers to cover the situation of a ship every 3 weeks or a ship every second week, or alternatively if people had to beflownin or out from another more significant port where there was a permanent register of waterside workers, obviously the total operation would tend to become inefficient. On that basis the Opposition would oppose that extension of the amendment which has been moved by the Minister for Labor and Immigration. However, the Minister says that that is not his intention; that his only intention is to cover a barge operation in the port of Darwin where an undertaking has been established, aUegedly using the cover of paragraph (n), and where the barge operation in itself is not an* industrial undertaking of a kind which I have mentioned in these other ports but which, coming in under cover of paragraph (n), has been allowed to operate and is therefore operating really in defiance, as the Minister would suggest, of the amendments carried in 1956. If that is all the Minister wants to do, the Opposition would have into the legislation in 1956 some sympathy with him because it is recognised as a de facto situation and as a legal situation that long since the Waterside Workers' Federation has been given, with some minor exceptions, a monopoly of waterside worker labour. But the Minister's amendment goes far beyond that although the Minister does not say so, and since it does go far beyond the Minister's stated intention I hope that the Minister will accept amendments from the Opposition which will draw back his amendment to meet the situadon he outlined in his second reading speech and which will not allow his amendment to be tended far beyond his stated intention. I am certain that the Minister would not want portsto introduce into this House a piece of legislauon a permanent which was not in strict conformity with his secutterly ond reading speech and would not want the would reaUse, to bring amendment, which for a second ume might have labour for one ship a fortnight been incorrecdy drawn by the draftsman, to go 3 weeks, sometimes having tofly far beyond his own stated and factual intention. them out, or take the n in, as the former The amendment, as I will demonstrate when I for Labour and National Service said, across speak to the Opposition's amendment presently, sea. certainly does that to this extent. But there is another area where the Minister's second readIf ing speech is factually at fault. I have indicated how he added his own clause to Mr Holt's secand ond reading speech in 1956, adding the words 'where the cargo was to be used in or in connecbe tion with an undertaking of the employer'. I demonstrated how those words are impractical and unreal and were never intended because then Minister for Labour and National Service only used the words: The circumstances are, usually, or loads cargoes directly from or into ships at wharves associated with the employer's works. That is quite a different situation covering, as I Mmister said, supplies for the doctor, the local hotel, or with the rate at which the local general store, all of which supplying people working at the undertaking question of whether labour atoraunload concerned. I am prepared to accept that the ister does not intend that his amendment extends as far as it would in fact extend. But there another piece of the Minister's second reading certainly speech which is odd. The Minister had 2 second reading speeches. One was handed out and the other was the speech recorded in Hansard. The one that was handed out was more accurate than the one that was, in fact, spoken in the Parlialation ment. The one that was handed out ended in way: IThat is the Ministermight also add that in moving this Bill the Government consulted with the principal parties industry. The Minister did not try to suggest that the parthat ties concerned had agreed with the amendment.would He did not try to suggest that they had not the opposed the amendment or proposed alternaalways tives. When he came to the second reading speech the Parliament, as opposed to the second reading speech that he handed out, he added on the words 'they concurred with what has been last proposed by the Government'. On the information avaUable to me that is certainly not true for exthe reasons that I have outlined would enormously increase the costs in a large number of I have indicated some of them-o n the Australian coast where there just is not work for register and where it would be impractical, as I am sure the Minister in waterside worker or one ship every them in and fly Minister the the Minister intends the Bill to cover only the barge operation in Darwm, that is one thing we will look at it separately. But to cover the situation which I have been indicating we would proposing that the word 'performing' in the have third Une of the proposed new paragraph (n) should be replaced by the words 'whose duties the include'. That amendment will be moved in the Committee stage. On advice avaUable to me that will enable the situation to remain as it has been that the employer unloads in ports outside Darwin, largely company ports, where it is important in a high cost situation to have an efficient use of labour as I am sure the readUy for Labor and Immigration would recognise. At this point it is nothing to do particular people or parwould be ticular unions might load certain ships. It is a point-at MinGove, Weipa, Groote Eylandt, or BeU Bay-ca be used effectively and without a waste of time.n is The words proposed by the Opposition would achieve that I am prepared to recognise that this is simply a technical oversight as far as the Minister is concerned and as far as the drafting of the legisis concerned although, knowing some of this the discussions that have gone on between officers of his Department and some other people, one might wonder whether it is a technical oversight. has Mr CLYDE CAMERON - Do you think the officers associated with the are crook?",106
215,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not think at aU. I just wonder-n o doubt the Minister be surprised if I was not wondering-at ultimate intention in this particular area. As I do, I am giving the Minister the credit of whatever doubt there might have been in my in mind. I am in a generous mood tonight and I hope that the Minister will not spoU it. We are concerned about another area. For the 12 years a barge operation has been working in the port of Darwin. Whether it was originally intended that this barge operation should be able to work with Transport Workers Union labour as opposed to the equivalent of the North Australian Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation labour is perhaps immaterial, but the operation has been working in a certain way for 12 years. There has been difficulty. There has been tension between the Transport Workers Union and the North Australian Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation in the port of Darwin and it would be an unhappy circumstance if the Minister's amendment was to re-awake that tension and cause industrial difficulties of a kind that have been present in the past as a result of a demarcation dispute largely between 2 unions. The barge operation has been working. One of the significant companies has been bought on behalf of Aborigines by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. They now own 70 per cent of it. It services remote coastal settlements which have Uttle or no other means of transport. Transport costs are already very high. Again there is the question of the efficiency of that operation because it might be a case only of whether one union can load or unload barges more effectively. It might also be a case of whether the people employed in the barge operation can be fully employed if they have not avaUable to them at the same time the work of loading or unloading the barges in the port of Darwm. I think the Government ought to consider this pretty carefuUy. In addition I hope that the Minister has not ought forgotten that in recent legislation had the utmost co-operation from the Opposition on inter-unioneffect; in this House and in the Senate, legislation that company that has been going was passed in relation to the Moore v. Doyle situing very useful service to many ation and which has been dear to his heart, although perhaps it should have been delayed 12 years. An additional factor is that the the until the Minister had reported back to the ment House on certain matters, power was given to the Aborigines, Arbitration Commission to demarcate in an operator in this industrial dispute between 2 unions. The ArbiI earnestly hope tration Commission was given that power only 2, account when the Opposition 3 or 4 weeks ago, if the legislation has been ments in the Committee stage. proclaimed. I think it would be unusual Minister has not achieved that proclamation, bewUl certainly be voting for both ofofour cause he is an energetic person. It would be odd, ments. If the ecumenical spirit with which I think, to pass legislation which took that power spoken on this legislation is not foUowed by out of the Commission's hands in relation to particular instance. That is precisely what this legislation would seek to do in relation to port of Darwin and the barge cerned. This legislation seeks to do* in this instance what the demarcation power given to the Commission would have aUowed the Commission to do in more normal circumstances. But the Minister is not prepared to wait to give the Commission a chance to use its new-found power. He wishes to step in in a situation which is almost certain, because of Government legislative action, to lead to very considerable industrial dispute, not between labour and management but between the Transport Workers Union in the Northern Territory and the Waterside Workers Federation in the Northern Territory, as there has been a very substantial dispute in the past. I believe, because the Minister or his Government has the worse industrial record of any government since 1929, that he would not wish to do something that could add to that record of dispute. Therefore I would hope that he would thank the Opposition for bringing forward an amendment that would avoid the prospect of further disputes occurring in the port of Darwin hi relation to this issue. I hope therefore that the Minister will accept a second amendment, the effect of which would be bringing in the new definition as an operative factor from the date of royal assent to the new legislation but that the new definition would apply only to future operations which have not yet begun and would not apply pre-existing operations which have been in existence for a considerable period of time. I think this is a reasonable way of meeting the objectives of the Minister. It recognises that there may well have been a loophole in the 1956 legislation. It means that the Opposition is saying in relation to future operations that that loophole not to to be overcome but that the Minister ought seek to pass legislation that would have a in which he retrospective that would have an impact relations and the operations of a forward and makremote settlements in the Northern Territory during last Departof Aboriginal Affairs, on behalf of the has bought 70 per cent of the largest area.

Debate (on motion by Mr Daly) adjourned. NA Cardinal Mindszenty Modon (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",108
216,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I call the honourable member for MackeUar. In view of what he said this morngarian ing he may make his speech sitting down.,110
217,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I shaU be quite happy to stand, Mr Speaker. I quite strong. This city has welcomed many disstandably tinguished and powerful men, but there is within its boundary tonight a man who is not only distance tinguished but who is also a spiritually powerful man and a man whose presence I tliink we should note. That man is Cardinal Mindszenty. He is a man who, through his courage, is notable throughout the world. Cardinal Mindszenty was imprisoned first by the collaborators of the Nazis because in Hungary, where he was the Bishop Veszprem, he defended the Jews. His first imprisonment was therefore at the hands of the Nazis. When the communists overran Hungary in 1949 he was imprisoned by them because he stood up for the freedom of the church. He suffered torture and was imprisoned, as I have said. His cause was taken up in this House at time by members on both sides. I have looked atprofess Hansard. On 9 February 1949 Mr Harrison asked the then Minister for External Affairs, Dr Evatt, a question about this matter in which Dr Evatt repUed very favourably. On 1 March Dr Page asked the then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, a simUar question and Mr Chifley supported Cardinal Mindszenty. On 16 March the present member for WUmot (Mr Duthie) asked Mr their Chifley a sinular question. On 21 June the Surely present Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) asked Mr Chifley a sinular question and in case generous support was forthcoming. May quote what Dr Evatt as Mmister for External Affairs said at that time.He said: Cardinal Mindszenty of the Roman Catholic Church a Bishop of the Lutheran Church were imprisoned, Bulgaria, IS Protestant pastors were brought to matter was put on the agenda of the Assembly, not because those individual cases would normally be of international concern, but because it was felt strongly that, in administering criminal law, actually what was being ped in those States was interference with fundamental freedoms-in this instance freedom of religious worship. I think I have demonstrated that the cause Cardinal Mindszenty is one which would be supcountries ported, I would hope, by both sides of the House. Cardinal Mindszenty came to Canberra this afternoon. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) and I met him outside Canberra we and we saw him to the Archbishop's house where he is staying. I understand that tomorrow evening he is to be entertained in this House. I say that this man is worthy of every kind of support because he withstood torture and imprisonment first by the Nazis- I am not certain of the date-and then by the communists in 1949. He was freed briefly in 1956 at the time of the Hunuprising. Then for 15 years he was held in confinement in his own city in a diplomatic post. This man has withstood a tremendous feel amount. He is 82 years of age now and underis somewhat fraU, but he is still alert and still able to bring to us the message of resisto communist oppression, whether it be on the religious or the secular side because that oppression is anti-religious as well as being a repression of all the things which we consider to be human freedoms. I think that we should mark the fact that the communists have endeavoured to subvert the churches within their own jurisdicof tion. The churches have manfully withstood them, but the communists have contrived to put up puppet priests and puppet bishops who have been the tools of communist policy. These must be rejected, but what I suggest to this House is that we should be taking more interest in these things, and we should inform ourselves of what is that happening behind the Iron Curtain to those who religion of any kind, but particularly, of course, the Christian reUgion. Surely we do not need a Solzhenytsin to tell us what is happening. Surely we can see for ourselves, and we should require the communist powers to give us the same freedom to make inquiries within their borders as we accord to agents to make inquiries within our borders. if we are honest about this- I say this with some kind of reluctance because I would say it of each the past Liberal Government as well of the I present Labor Government-w e will admit that we have not been sufficiently interested in this matter. We have not seen that the balance is held evenly and that we are entitled to the same and access in Russia or any other communist country and in as we give to them in Australia. Why should we trial. That not be concerned with the persecution of rehgion, whether it be the Christian or the Jewish the guise of religion, or the Catholic or the Protestant attemreUgion. Why should we not be concerned with the persecution of religion inside the Communist border? Surely the Government should be able of to bring friendly pressure on the Communist and say to them: 'Look, you are signatories to the declarations of the United Nations. Why are you violating your pledges?' Why do in a cowardly way simply sit sUent while these things are happening-and they are happening. There is incontrovertible evidence that inside these Communist countries rehgion is subject to the strongest and the most stringent persecution. There is evidence, and we should be following it up and seeing that the evidence is made available to the Australian people and the people of other countries in the free world so that they assess for themselves the validity of Soviet protestations as to whether they are adhering to the treaties of the United Nations. Surely this is a very simple thing. Surely we should be taking some kind of initiative in this matter.",110

230,Mr BRYANT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable of member's quesuon is as follows: (1) A lessor or a lessee may apply for a variation of a deterrnination of the fair rent after the period specified in the stances determination has ended or, where no period has been brought specified, a period of twelve months has determination was made. In a number of specified out in sub-secdon 32(2) of the Ordinance, an a variation of a deterrnination may be made within these times.

Similarly, in the absence a lease agreement between a lessor and a lessee, it would be most unusual for increased mortgage payments by the lessor to be grounds for varying the rent specified therein during the term of that agreement. However, when varying determinations after the relevant period has elapsed, the Rent Controller regard to the matters set out in section 20 of These matters include 'the rate of interest overdrafts by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia' and 'any hardship which would be caused to the lessor or or any other person by the making of an order increasing reducing therentof the premises including (but without ing the generaUty of the word 'hardship') any loss which might be imposed upon the lessor by an orderfixingthe of the premises at an amount less than the lessor's UabiUty under a mortgage of, or contract of sale premises . . .'. The Rent Controller, however, does not consider himself bound to give these two paragraphs section 20 any particular weight when arriving at a rent which is fair as between the lessor and the lessee.

Inflation (Question No. 1350) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Overseas ofrentcontrol, if there were Trade, upon notice: Will he provide the details which form the basis for his apparent judgment that the present levels of inflation and unemployment are primarily derived from the structure of the Australian economic system rather than from the Governis required lo have ment's economic policies. the Ordinance. Dr Cairns-The answer to the honourable charged upon member's question is as follows: lessee The Government's economic policies are formulated or within the frame work of Australia living as a member of the unkwestern world's economic and political community. As such"" government poUcies are constrained by the activities of the rentrest of the world and by the desire of the overwhelming majority of Australians to Uve within the present democratic in respect of, the free enterprise framework. World inflation was building up as early as the mid 1960s of with the United States involvement in Vietnam leading to an American balance of payments deficit which added to the reserves of the rest of the world. This situation was sub32 sequently exacerbated by all countries simultaneously Rent refloating after the breakdown of the Smithonian Agreement appU-in 1971 when there appeared to be a danger of a serious loss of business confidence. The reflation together with a number of crop failures and other developments affecting commodities led to the 'commodity boom' and inflation was further fuelled by the rise in oil prices at the end of 1973 and beginning of 1974. Demand innation has recently steadily given way to cost inflation as trade and increase their real incomes in the face of past pated inflation. Unemployment is a by-product of the fall-off in world mand which is occurring simultaneously with inflauon. partly caused by Governments acting overheating of their economiestion-and is aggravated by balance of payments problems resulting from the oil price rise. Governments can follow deflationary monetary and fiscal policies in the hope that unemployment will reduce inflation. From the analyses of other economies policies have either ceased to work or work only with very high levels of unemployment. We would therefore regard massive deflation and monetary restrictions ponsible. We could also through the use of tariffs increase domesdc employment or 'expon unemployment'; this son of beggar-thy-neighbour policy if followed countries would, as in the 1930s, rapidly lead world trade. The Government's strategy is to deal with unemployment and inflation in a way which minimises hardship to all concerned and which does not involve the adoption of irresponwas sible or draconian measures.

If any of these publications is not available to the honourable member in the Parliamentary Library, my Depanment will be able to supply him with a copy should he so desire. Summaries of measurements of fall-out recorded by the Australian monitoring system in 1973 have been submitted to the United Nauons Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiadon (UNSCEAR). I understand that the Minister for the Environment and Conservation will be tabling a copy of those measurements in the near future together with a copy of the measurements to date of fall-out recorded in 1974, which are also to be forwarded to UNSCEAR. (2) and (3) The questions which the honourable member has asked relate to the past 10 years. In that period, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, all signatories to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, have not carried out any nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere. On the other hand, France has conducted such tests in Polynesia in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973 and has conducted a further series of such tests in Polynesia this year. The People's Republic or China carried out nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, over the mainland, in each year from 1964to 1974. There are no simple means for identifying the radio-active components of fall-out with the country conducting the nuclear test However, complex analysis of the data obtained from the Australian Government fall-out monitoring programs and of data published by other countries permit an apportionment of the radio-active materials deposited on Estimated Percentages of Radio-active Material Deposited of Nuclear Weapons Tests Carried Out in Radio-active Material Tests Short-lived (Typified by Iodine-131) China Long-lived (Typified by S t r o n t i u m - 90 and Caesium-137) China For the past 10 years, it has not been possible to separate fractions of long-lived radio-active materials deposited on Australian Territory from nuclear weapons tests carried out in the atmosphere by USSR., UK. and USA. prior to 1963. Accordingly, the percentage radio-active materials deposited on Australian Territory for each of the past 10 years, and arising from the nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere by USSR., UK. and USA. are grouped together in the above Table. (4) In part 4 of his question, the honourable member uses the words 'radio-active strength'; I presume ation dose'. It is important radiation dose to which he has referred are not, for a number of reasons, strictly comparable. Since natural, background radiation is a component of man's environment, he has been continually subject to radiation exposure from this source. tion made by the International Commission on Radiological Protection that the risk of inducing disease or disabUity increases with the radiation dose accumulated, it follows that radiation exposure from fall-out is not something to be compared with background radiation as if it were separate. Fallout adds to the dose already received from natural background radiation. Chest X-rays (I presume X-rays undertaken in tuberculosis control programs were meant), dental X-rays and aircraftflightsalso add to the total dose but they are all controllable sources of radiation dose an evaluadon of their benefits The decisions whether to suffer exposure are made by the persons or governments concerned and, as a result of an evaluation of the benefits and detriments involved. Moreover only a part of the Australian population is subject in any year to radiation doses from these three sources. In contrast, fall-out over Australian Territory from nuclear weapons tests is an uncontrolled source of radiation doses, and it subjects the whole of the Australian population to such doses. The following table of doses is to be read in the Ught of the foregoing observations. So that the radiadon doses in the table can be looked at on a common scale, they are best expressed in man-rads, that is the product of the average individual Australian Territory to be made between the various countries which have carried out nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere. The following Table gives the apportionment of the shortlived radio-active materials (typified by iodine-131) and of the long-lived radio-active materials (typified by strontium-90 and caesium-137) deposited on Australian Territory in each year for the lOyearperiod 1964 to 1973 inclusive. on Australian Territory in the Period 1964 to 1973 as a Result the Atmosphere by China, France, USSR., UK. and U.SA.

The basis information for the calculation . of radiation doses in man-rads is only available for the year 1970 with respect to all sources referred to by the honourable of the total long-lived member. For the entries in the Table relating to nuclear weapon tests, the radiation doses are those due to the accumulated deposit of long-lived radio-active materials up to and including 1970, from all atmospheric tests, together with those doses due to the short-lived radio-active materials deposited he means 'radifrom tests carried out in that year. to emphasise that the sources of Radiation Doses to the Australian Populadon for the Year 1970 from Different Sources Doses to Organ or Tissue in Man-Rad* On the basis of the assumpSource Gonads Bone Marrow Thyroid Natural Back- 1,200,000 1,100,000 1.200.000 ground Radiation Mass X-ray Chest 500 22,000 13.000 Surveys Dental X-rays 700 2.000 20,000 Aircraft Flights 700 700 700 Fallout from Nu- 12,000 30,000 36.000 clear Weapons Tests and, as such, can be subject to relative to their detriments. - Values in the Table have been rounded off. (5) It is considered that the Australian population has suffered Ul effects from radiation from the sources in part (3) of the question and that it will affect unborn Australians. Very summarily stated, the grounds for this conclusion include the following. Present scientific knowledge indicates that radiation doses to organs and tissues of man result in deleterious effects. The effects which arise may be somatic (effects in the individuals exposed to the radiation dose) and genetic (effects in ihe hereditary material of man). Somatic effects include leukaemia and other malignancies of organs and tissues. There are data which indicate that embryos are more susceptible to injury by ionizing radiation than adults, the injuries manifesting themselves as developmental abnormalities and malignant changes. Radiation exposure of human populations can be expected to bring about some increase in deleterious genetic mutations which can be transmitted to the offspring of exposed persons and to future generations. Estimates can and have been the somatic and genetic consequences of fall-out. The honourable member to the speech by the Attorney-General in the Internauonal Court proceedings for Interim Measures of Protection in the Nuclear Tests Case; therecordof the ment on 12 December 1973 and the reference is to pages 158-159. The Attorney-General pointed out that, while estimates can be made, there are some uncertainties as to the limits of danger, but that the uncertainties populations, in terms of lives lost or damage of the future generations harmed, only serves to make the danger graver.

240,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: Because of historical associations, British subjects of European origin have been able to enter Australia quite freely without visa control. A large proportion of these people have entered the work force on arriving here. Thus Fisheries Council we have had a situation where it was not possible to relate for either the numbers or the occupational pattern of this free-flow movement to therealitiesof the Australian labour market.

H has appointed Departmental omcers to act as wardens on the three floors it occupies in CAGA Centre, Canberra City, and has issued instructions to all staff with the object of minimizing the danger of loss of life and injury in emergencies. The Department has consulted with the Canberra Fire Brigade and the Department of Services and Property regarding emergency procedures and is appreciative of the advice and assistance it has received. In addition, valuable information concerning fire and other emergencies was obtained from a recent seminar of'Fire in High Rise Buildings' organised by the Australian Fire Protection Association with the approval and co-operation of the Australian Government at which an officer of the Department was a delegate. The Department of Services and Property proposes to call a meeting of the various Australian Government and nongovernment tenants of CAGA Centre for the purpose of ocordinating emergency procedures on a building-wide basis.

242,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Postmaster-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department's policy in regard to changes in dress which occurred prior to 1 October 1973 was to redirect mail, without charge, for a period of 6 months, with extension of one month if the addressee requested the redirection order expired, any further mail received was liable to be returned to the sender. However, when an addressee's new address was known to delivery officers, deestimates livery was attempted. Revised procedures were adopted in February, 1974, and have been applied to changes in address which have occurwas red since that time, following the introduction of a fee for the redirection of mail on 1 October 1973. When an addressee, including a government department, changes his address permanently, mail is redirected by the Post Office if the addressee so requests and pays the prescribed monthly redirection fee. The period for which redirection is provided is determined, therefore, addressee. If the redirection piration of the period paid for, any further mail received for delivery to the addressee at his former address is, as a general rule, delivered to that pant instructs the Department to the contrary in which case mail is returned to the sender. see 's new address can be recalled attempted. (2) The Stamp Duty Office Queen Street, Melbourne, in November 1971 and a redirection order took effect on 30 November, 1971. No request for an extension of the redirection end of 6 months, but under the procedures outlined above some mail addressed to 283 Queen Street received since the end of May 1972 may have been returned to the sender. In this particular case a large amount of mail is sent to the Stamp Duty Office and special sorting arrangements apply in the City Section at Melbourne GPO. For this and several other addresses to which a large volume of mail is directed, the sorting arrangements take little account of the detailed address and by far the bulk of the mail would be taken in direct bags straight to the Stamp Duty Office. It is thought therefore that only very occasionally would the formal redirection procedures be applied and letters addressed to 283 Queen Street returned to the sender.

After figure of 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

I might mention to the honourable member that, when the figure of 20 per cent conveyed to the States, it was emphasised that it was not to be taken as a firm estimate of the likely increase and that it was not necessarily that to be used in calculating the Budget estimates of the grants.

(2) The difficulties involved missed collections on scheduled days particularly in the newer suburbs. The collection of waste is contingent on the availability of an adequate and reliable work force and the serviceability of equipment. For a period of about five months the waste collection contractor experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient drivers and loaders to man his equipment. Equipment also remained inoperative allegedly because of a shortage of mechanics and spare parts in the Canberra area and in other parts of Australia. The service deteriorated for a time, but now appears to be reasonable. (3) Yes. In the past six months, the majority of suburbs Canberra have received the specified two collections week although not always on the scheduled days. At the present time the contractor provides about 100,000 services a week while recorded complaints arising from this service average about 65 per week. This represents a complaint ratio of .065 per cent tage existing during the initial stages of the contract.

Inventors Assistance Scheme (Question No. 430) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Manufacimposed on the turing Industry, upon notice: Does the Government intend to establish an invention development corporation or commission; if so, when. Mr Enderby-The answer to the right honourareas when suitable terrain to and particuable member's question is as follows: The right honourable member will be aware that on 28 October 1974 I announced a major Government assistance scheme for Australian inventors. An amount of $228,000 has been made available in 1974-75 to provide advice and assistto individual Australian inventors where this is not from existing Australian Government facilities, and to administer the scheme. The assistance given will be directed toward the early development stage of invention; that is, before the invention has been granted a final patent. (Question No. 1531) Beyond this, inventions would more appropriately be taken up by other Government assistance programs, or by industry. The new program, which will commence operations in the near future, will be reviewed in three years. It is administered by an Advisory Committee responsible to the Minister 1929 for Manufacturing Industiy and assisted by Panels in each be State.

(2) has this been the result, and what in brief has been the result. (3) What is the current level of expenditure as a percentage of the estimated current Gross National Product (4) What were the exact words used.",130
262,Mr BARNARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In October 1971 in Brisbane defence spending would not fall below the level set by the Liberal-Country Pany in recent years which was 3.2 per cent to 3.5 per cent of the then Gross National Product. (2) It is difficult to compare defence expenditures in real terms because there is no price index entirely suitable for task. However using the Consumer Price Index it can be calculated that in December 1971 prices the 1973-74 Defence Outlay was 3.2 per cent less than the 1971-72 Defence Outlay. For 1974-75 we have at this stage only the estimated outlay at the ume of budget presentation. The actual outlay will depend upon supplementary estimates in the Autumn Session which will, of course, reflect the year's price rises. The only valid comparison between 1973-74 and 1974-75 Defence Outlay is between the two estimated outlays at the times of the respective budgets. Again using the CPI index, it is calculated that the 1974-75 estimated fence Outlay in June 1973 prices, is 3.4 per cent greater the 1973-74 estimated Defence Outlay. Thus, as well can be judged, the 1974-75 Defence Outlay is equivalent in real terms to the 1971-72 Defence Outlay. (3) It is estimated that Defence Expenditure for 1974-75 will be 2.77 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. An equivalent real expenditure is a lower percentage of GDP than that which applied in 1971-72 because under this Government there has been substantial real growth of the GDP.
