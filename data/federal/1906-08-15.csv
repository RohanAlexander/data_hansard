1,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if it is correct, stated in the press, that the Imperial Defence Committee has no objection to the publication of its report? If iSOj will the Government make the report available to honourable members before the Defence Estimates come up for discussion.",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The statement is correct.,13
3,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed to act this session on the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee - recommendations which they themselves sought at considerable expense to the Commonwealth ?,13
4,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Some of the recommendations are now in course of being acted upon. Wdth regard to other recommendations, reports are being prepared by the officers of the Department as to the extent to which it will be desirable to introduce them during the current year. PAPER. Mr DEAKIN laid upon the table the following paperReport of the Imperial Defence Committee upon a general scheme of defence for Australia. ADMINISTRATION OF PAPUA.",13
5,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Will the Prime Minister, before the appointment of the Royal Commission to which he referred yesterday, give the House an opportunity to discuss the policy of the Government' in reference to Fapua?",13
6,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I shall be glad to do so,- if possible. It will be necessary to act promptly, because the service to New Guinea is a monthly one, the next steamer, by which I am desirous that the Commissioners shall travel, so that they may report this year, leaving before the end of this month. OBSOLETE WAR VESSELS.",13
7,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if any of the obsolete war vessels formerly on the Australian station, which have recently been sold in England for a mere song, were offered to the Commonwealth Government?",13
8,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Not that I am aware. it PREROGATIVE OF PARDON.,13
9,Mr CROUCH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"In reference to the statement appearing in today's newspapers, that application 'has been made to the Imperial Government for the pardon of ceras tain convicts in Western Australia, I wish, to know from the Prime Minister if such application is necessary. Has not the Governor General authority to pardon any Australian resident?",13
10,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The cases in question were brought under notice by the honourable member for Coolgardie, who pointed out that in Western Australia a number of prisoners who were transported long years ago to that State for offences,- most of which were not serious, are now serving sentences. He asked that they be pardoned. The assent of H is Majesty was required for their release. DUTY ON HARVESTERS.",13
11,Mr BRUCESMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether it was with his knowledge and consent that, in action against the Commonwealth, concerning the duty on harvesters, application the Court for a Commission to inquire in Canada into the actual cost of harvesters there was opposed on behalf of the GovernCommonwealth, ment.",14
12,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,This is apparently personal question. Mr Bruce SMITH - I addressed it to the honourable and learned member as Prime Minister.,14
13,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It would not be neceshis sary to refer such a matter to me, and so as I recollect, no such reference was made.",14
14,Mr BRUCESMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Then I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether he was aware of, and approved, the opposition to the application for a Commission to inquire honourable and learned member. in Canada as to the real value of the vesters.",14
15,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The question some extent an action now pending in the Courts. Speaking from recollectionmay have to correct mv statements after ference to the papers in the case-the ter was brought under my notice only prior to the appeal being heard by the F u l Court of Victoria. I think that that is their harvesters? the case to which the honourable and learned member is referring.,14
16,Mr BRUCESMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am speaking of new action, in which a Commission was asked to inquire into the cost of harvesters - in Canada.",14
17,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It is an old action.,14
18,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If ^the honourable and learned member is ,not"" referring to someinto thing which has been done in an action in the trial of the action hereafter. the Supreme Court of Victoria, I know nothing about the matter.",14
19,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable and learned member is referring to the action the Sunreme Court of Victoria,14
20,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"An appeal was proceeded with, with my sanction, and I can give honourable and learned member the reason for the action which has been taken. think that it would be an unnecessary great waste of money to have the Commission, because the defence raised upon pleadings is that, exercising his [100] under the Customs Act, the Minister of Trade and Customs has fixed the value on. which duty is to be paid at ,£65. My desire was to have the point of law thus raised decided before the enormous expense of the Commission is entered upon. If the point of law were determined in favour of the Commonwealth-as , accordan ing to my reading of the Act it should be - it would be unnecessary for either party to to go to the expense of having a Commission appointed. On the other hand, if thepoint of law were determined against the- „ the Commission could proceed. It was with the desire to save una necessary expense, not to shut out facts, that the appeal was proceeded with.",14
21,Mr BRUCESMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Is the honourable and learned gentleman aware that the Minister of Trade and Customs gave it as reason for raising the valuation of the far harvesters that their cost in Canada had been misrepresented to him?,14
22,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am afraid,that that question travels beyond the pleadings, and is irrelevant to the point first raised by the The reaharson that actuated me in assenting to the appeal advised by learned counsel was that affects to which I have just given. Mr l OSEPHCOOK - Is the AttorneyI General aware that the Minister of Trade reand Customs told the House and the counmattry that he would facilitate in every way the action of the Massey-Harris Company l in seeking to prove the Canadian price of If the Government regard the appointment of a Commission to take evidence in Canada on the subject as a a waste of money, because the Minister has the absolute right to impose what duty he pleases, and take action accordingly,' they will do so in total contradiction to the Minister's statement.",14
23,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I do not desire to enter anv question of fact whdch may affect I was asked a question, to reply to which I thought would not affect it, and I have given the answer that, on the pleadings as in they stand, a very important constitutional and legal point is raised, namely, as to whether the Minister of Trade and Custhe toms has power, under section 160 of the Customs Act, to determine in cases of doubt I what shall be the valuation for duty of and any particular import.",14
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Minister dethe clared that he would not take advantage powers of that technical defence.,14
25,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is very important that the point shall be determined. I am not aware that the Minister made the statement attributed to him by the honourable member, though that is not relevant to my position as Attorney-General in assenting to the appeal advised by counsel on the pleadings. I think that I have sufficiently swered the questions which have been asked, and honourable members will forgive me if I do not enter upon a matter which, if entered upon as a question of fact, might interfere with the trial of the action hereafter.",15
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Are we to understand that, if it is decided that the Minister has power.to increase the valuation, the Government will oppose the application for a Commission to take evidence in Canada?",15
27,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The question as to whether there shall or shall not be >a Commission is entirely in the hands of the Court. I have had no notice of these questions, and the papers dealing with the case are complicated; but, speaking from recollection, I understand that the learned Judge who granted the , Commission to some extent expressed the opinion that it might prove unnecessary, making a special order as to costs; but, inasmuch as the plaintiff insisted on the appointment of the Commission, he did not find it within his province to refuse it. I understand, moreover, that the Full Court has refused to interfere with his exercise of his discretion, though one of ithe Judges would have been disposed to make a different order. That is' how the matter stands. It is of the highest importance to have the point 'of law decided whether the Minister under the circumstances of difficultv alreadv indicated by Parliament, can, by virtue of section 160 of the Customs Act, fix a valuation for duty which cannot be impeached or set aside as a nullitv. . Mr Bruce SMITH - Has the High Court ordered the Commission?",15
28,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The Victorian Supreme Court. The matter has not come before the High Court. As things stand, the Commission will go, but in the meantime the ouestion of law mav or may not be determined in another action now pending in South Australia. We desire to have that question of law determined. If the Commission goes, it will be an unnecessary expense.",15
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Minister Trade and Customs said that he would not take such action as appears to have been taken by the Government.,15
30,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am not aware that my honourable colleague has' done .so. If he has made, any such statement, the fact can be easily demonstrated. We simply rely on the pleadings as they stand. That is an- how the matter rests.",15
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Is the Attorney-General aware that yesterday, in the Supreme Court of South Australia, an application was made to the Full Court to compel a defendant-the Minister of Trade and Customs-to give particulars in a similar action touching the duty on harvesters, that the Minister refused, and - that the Court ordered the particulars to be given ?",15
32,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I saw'some statement in regard to the matter in today's newspapers, but I deprecate the course of conduct which is now being pursued. Nothing could be more calculated to prejudice the fair trial of actions which are pending, and I must therefore decline to answer further questions on the subject. ROBE-MOUN T GAMBIER TELEPHONE. Sir LANGDON BONYTHO N asked the Postmaster-General, upon noticeWhen will telephonic communication be piovi'ded between Robe and Mount Gambier?'",15
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, advises that telephonic communication between Robe and Mount Gambier will be completed during this week. WHITEWORKER S: SUGAR' INDUSTRY .",15
34,Mr MAH ON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"the Minister of External Affairs, uponjnoticei . Has his attention been drawn to the uncontradicted evidence on oath of Mr F . Courtice, a sugar planter's employee^ before the Sugar Industry Commission (Queensland) on 4th April, 1906, to the following effect :That white workers employed by Buss Bros., at Bo'in a, work 64 hours weekly for 18s. per week and food; that employees of Young Bros., of Fairy mead and Avondale, receive for 58 hours' work 20s. weekly and rations; that the rule on these plantations is that if , owing to wet weather, the employees work less than a quarter of a day they receive no payment at all for their labour on that day; that "" instead of the worker of getting the benefit of the bounty the grower is putting a big percentage into his own pocket "" ; that "" the conditions existing on the plantations are such that no self-respecjing man would stop there"" ; and that the planters in the Bundaberg district "" take advantage of the glut in the market in the off season, and they give us just sufficient to live on in the crushing season. We cannot get married, because we know we cannot live with any reasonable amount of comfort on wages like they give now. The planters are running the sugar industry as a single man industry, as no married man can work under such conditions "" ? Also to the following telegrams from Childers, which appears in the Age on 13th instant :"" A serious strike has occurred among Young Bros..' cane-cutters. A considerable number of men were not cutting 2 tons a day, and the manager said they were not earning 30s. a week. The Lynwood men struck work and went to Hapsburg, where they called all the men out. All work is at a standstill, and the cane trains have stopped running.""? 2. Have the complaints made on oath to the Commission respecting the treatment of white labourers, of which the following are samples, been brought under his notice :. . "" The sanitary conditions were abominable, closets being placed in the vicinity of sleeping rooms.""-G . P. Barber, M.L.A. . . The workers "" are not treated as white men. The farmers do not give them proper tucker. I have seen plenty of them provided with food cooked by an aboriginal gin, and that is not fair to white men.""-A . Auzolin, cane farmer, Ingham. . .

Are Buss Bros, and Young Bros, owners of "" white plantations,"" within the meaning of the Sugar Bounty Act of 1905; and, if so, does he propose to withhold from them the bounty payable to growers of sugar by white labour, which the Minister is empowered to do by section 9 of the Act referred to? 4. What was the average rate of wages paid to white workers in the sugar industry in Queensland and New South Wales before the legalization of the sugar bounty, in 1901. Have the average wages of such workers been increased since; and, if so, when and by how much per week? . Mir - DEAKIN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : X and 2. The Commission's report has been received, but the portions of evidence mentioned by the honourable member had not specially been brought under notice. 3 and 4. Inquiries are now being made.

46,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Perth) [2.49] - I regret that I am compelled to return to the discussion of the matter now before the Committee, after having taken up some little time last night. But it is the duty of the members of the Tariff Commission to meet the criticisms that have been levelled against their recommendations, more especially when certain members are under a total misapprehension as to their effect. I listened yesterday to some very elaborate, if not instructive, disquisitions upon the constituents and qualities of alcoholic liquors, and I feel called upon to reply to some of the remarks made by honourable members, because, in my opinion, they are very misleading. The trouble has arisen through a misunderstanding of the terms used by chemists in dealing with questions of this kind. We hear the word ""impurities"" used in a sense that is entirely misleading as applied to alcoholic spirits. There is no doubt that alcohol, by a very exhaustive process, can be made absolutely pure, and this purity is what chemists aim at securing when they wish to obtain alcohol for laboratory purposes. The alcoholic liquors of commerce, however, are distilled in such a way that they retain certain impuritiesas chemists would call them-whic h give them their distinctive qualities, and, to a large extent, their wholesome properties. In this connection, I may also remark that the best chemists admit that chemistry is, to a large extent, at fault in dealing with the analysis of alcoholic liquors. The ... 13s. science of chemistry has not yet reached such a stage that chemists can definitely tell us the effects of the various constituents of alcohol. They can discover these constituents, but they have ultimately to fall back ... 13s. upon the older experience of those who have adopted practically a rule of thumb to decide what is good and bad in alco- \ ... 14s. holic liquors. Fortunately, we are able to conclude, with a fair amount of certainty, ... 14 s that experience forms a safe guide in con40s. nexion with these matters. There is no doubt as to what brandy 'and whisky were ... Free originally. Whiskv was a preparation of malt spirit, distilled by pot stills, and ... Free brandy was a preparation of spirit distilled from wine by the same process. But the introduction of the patent still has brought about a considerable mystification, both in alcoholic liquors and in the minds of the public. I wish to refer specifically to the statements made by certain honourable members with regard to the manufacture of brandy. I said fast night, and I repeat, that I question whether a single gallon of brandv is made in Australia by the methods employed in the production of the finer qualities of French brandies. I hold in mv hand a pamphlet issued as the result of an inquiryinto the distillation of brandv. and the constituents of that spirit by a Commission brought into existence in England a few years ago, at the instance of that well-known medical journal, the Lancet. This pamphlet represents the most advanced and complete views on the question. It contains distinct information as to the methods necessary to be adopted to produce the higher qualities of brandy. To begin with, it is statedThe peculiar pleasing characteristics of genuine old Cognac brandy must be referred, not to alcohol at all, but what the French call the ""itnfuretes"" of brandy, that is to say, to the secondary products of distillation. In another part of the pamphlet we are told how this process of distillation is conducted. The wine is, of course, heated in the usual way. The first portion that goes through the still is put aside. The central portion is also put aside, and then the third portion is similarlv dealt with. The central portion is again distilled, and the central portion of that distillation is what' is known as brandy of the highest quality. I very much doubt whether that method of distillation has ever been practised in Australia to any considerable extent. With regard to the ageing of spirits, we have heard it stated in this House that ageing has practically no effect-that really nothing in it. The Lancet Commission, however, express themselves very definitely upon this point. They sayThe differences as regards chemical composition which will be seen to exist between old and new brandy are not so much in kind as degree. One effect of age upon the composition of brandy which can easily be traced is that of oxidation, a small depreciation, of alcohol occurring in favour of aldehydes and acetic acid This loss is chiefly alcohol; there is a corresponding increase in ethers, in higher alcohols, and what may be called "" vinosity "" develops, coupled with "" finesse and style. There is an indication of the distinct .difference between the new and the old alcoholic spirit. The remarks that I have quoted with regard to brandy apply also to whisky. It is a'matter of common experience with every one in the trade, and even with those who indulge in alcoholic stimulants, that the older spirit is undoubtedly finer and more palatable than that which is new.",18
47,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,H as the honourable member read the opinion expressed by the Lancet with regard to Australian brandy?,19
48,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Yes .,19
49,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,H as the honourable member read any better opinion?,19
50,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No , I have not. I agree that the Australian brandy, as at present exported, is honest in character, that it is pure, and not blended brandy. My point, however, is that the very best methods are not yet adopted in Australia.",19
51,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,And yet we produce the best brandy.,19
52,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"O u r brandy is, per- , haps, equal in quality to a good deal of the standard French brandy, but I am not sure that the finer qualities of French brandy are not superior, perhaps only from the epicure's stand-point.",19
53,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Lancet p.'aces Australian brandv first.,19
54,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I have not seen any statement to the effect that Australian brandy is equal to the finer qualities French brandy.,19
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,What would be the Lancet's standard of judgment-the meditermines cal standard?,19
56,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I am quite in the dark with regard to the statement to which the honourable member for Laanecoorie refers. I am not aware that the Lancet has said in as many words that the Australian brandy is superior to the very finest prothere is ducts of the Charente district in France.,19
57,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They call - Australian brandy the finest in the world.,19
58,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I shall be very glad if the honourable member can show me that that judgment has been pronounced. I wish now to refer to the point made by the honourable member for Bland yesterday, when he contended that the differentiation made by the Tariff Commission between the duties on pure and blended brandies was nonsensical - that it was ridiculously insufficient. I take it that members of this Par-' liament, who have devoted a considerable amount of time to the investigation of the question-wh o have gone into it thoroughly iand earnestly, and with as much ability as they possess-ar e scarcely likely to put forward a proposition which amounts to nonsense. I am prepared upon general ^grounds to defend our recommendation in that respect, as representing a very fairaverage as between the two qualities of liquor. Anybody who has. read the evidence tendered to the Commission wil l realise that I am entirely in sympathy with the development of a trade in pure brandy. I do not at all like the idea of fostering a trade in the blended article. At the same time, the Commission could not ignore a considerable volume of evi-, dence which was submitted to it, to the effect that blended briandy is an article of commerce, and that, as a matter of fact, it is preferred by some persons to the pure article. When honourable members point out that the difference between the cost of. the production 'of the two articles is very great, they are looking at the wrong end of the question altogether. There is no doubt that the difference between the cost, of producing the two classes of brandy is as one to four.",19
59,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member is speaking of spirit now.,19
60,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am speaking of the difference between the cost of producing' of pure brandv and that of producing the blended article. But when we come to the selling price, which, after all, is what de-' the trade in these articles, we find that there is nothing like the differ«ence which I have indicated. For example, - let us take the price of a bottle of pure .brandy, as against that of a bottle of - blended brandy. At the very most, upon - my calculations, the difference between their - price would be about 4d. or 6d. iit is recollected that each bottle of pure Australian brandy will--if the recommendation of the Commission be adopted-carry with it a Government certificate of quality, I think honourable members will realise that that fact in itself offers a considerable preference to the superior article.  - samples with labels upon them, and I ' - should like to know what is the good of - such labels?",19
61,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member is speaking of labels which are attached to bottles under existing conditions..  --as the Commission have recommended.,20

63,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I would point out to ithe honourable member that if he were selling brandv it is not likely that he would take off the genuine article a label guaranteeing its quality, in order t'o depreciate its value. The Commission recommend that that guarantee should attach only to the superior article, and I think it' is obvious that nobodv engaged in. handling such an article would be likelv to deprive it of the value which the label imparted to it Take the position of any customer who de-sires to purchase a bottle of brandy. Let - us assume that he enters an hotel or a shop - and states his requirement. He wishes to purchase a bottle of good brandy. Let us further suppose that he is shown the pure brandy with the Government stamp of - quality attached to the bottle, and also the blended article with its distinctive mark unon it.  - sion allow such a small margin in the case of the genuine article as compared with the blended article?",20
64,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I will deal with that matter presently. Let us suppose that the customer asks what is the price of the two articles which have been shown to him. He would probably be told that thedifference between the cost of the better article and that of the blended brandy was not more than 4d. or 6d. per bottle. How many persons desiring to obtain the When better article would hesitate to pay that extra price when the guarantee of qualitv was attached to it?  not be produced for 6d. per bottle extra,20
65,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Yes it can. It can be sold at no greater increase upon the price of the blended article than 66. per bottle.  the material from which it is distilled represents considerably more than that sum.,20
66,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have already pointed out that when honourable members talk of the cost of producing a pure brandy they are looking at the wrong end of the question. I admit that the cost of the production of the two articles is as one to four. But when that amount is . added to the duty, and to one or two profits, and a gallon of pure brandy is divided into six parts-si x bottles contain a gallonhonorable members will see that the difference between the price of the genuine as against the blended article is not more than 4d. or, at the most, 6d. per bottle. Here arises the difficulty of stimulating the production of Australian brandy with which the Tariff Commission was met. As honourable members are aware, my sympathies are all in one direction. But the evidence was conclusive that blended brandy was an article which was regularly put upon the market, and which was even sought after by some persons in preference to pure brandy. When we came to consider the situation, most of us realized that it would be a very improper proposal to levy upon the cheaper article a duty which was altogether out of proportion to that imposed upon the superior article. In other words, it would be wrong to compel the purchaser of blended brandy to pay into the revenue of the country a contribution which was decidedly out of proportion to that paid by the purchaser of pure brandy.  the Commission recommends the extension of an advantage to the purchaser of the inferior article.",20
67,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If honourable members will take the trouble to look into the matter they will see that the recommendation of the Commission would impart a contentively siderable stimulus to the production pure Australian brandiy. If the trade that article has developed under the conposed ditions which have hitherto existed, it only reasonable to assume that it will proing gress much more rapidly under the were stimulus which would be imparted to it warning. by the adoption of the recommendation of the Commission. Some honourable memexperience bers apparently have not studied our commendations, and do not realise that tection to the genuine article is part parcel of our scheme. I think that I ought to remind those who talk so much about genuine Australian brandy that there certain classes of wines used in the producthat tion of that article which, to put it mildly, do not make the highest classes of brandy. For instance, there is a good deal of "" off wine used; that is to say, wine which gone wrong in the process of manufacture, and which is distilled at a very high degree of rectification in order to make less objectionable. My opinion is that public should be protected from that of thing.",20

69,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is so. Those who talk so loudly about genuine brandy to put. will have to carry their contention to its logical conclusion. Undoubtedly the Tariff Commission has not done so.

71,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I am complaining of the lack of consideration which has been given to those recommendations.,21
72,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,What shall we do when we have to consider recommendations upon which the members of the Commission are divided ?,21
73,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No doubt the honourable member, with his keen intellect, will assess those recommendations at their proper value. Last evening I listened atwith age? to the complaint of the honourable of a member for North Sydney in regard to in the alleged hardships which would be imupon importers if the recommendais tion of the Commission in regard to keepimported spirits in bond for two years given effect to in the absence of fair Undoubtedly, the honourable member speaks as one with considerable in commercial matters, but I remust confess that I am not able to agree prowith him as to the hardship that would and be inflicted. There is no doubt that a very considerable quantity of immature spirit finds its way into Australia and are passes into consumption. The bonding of spirit, until it has attained an age of two years, would not in any way damage the interests of the persons who own it. "" It is a well known fact that spirit acquires has an added value in accordance with the length of time which it is kept in bond.",21
74,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable it member will see that satisfactory proof of the age could scarcely be forthcoming in resort gard to spirit which has already been shipped, or which is now in bond, and if prohibited all that from passing into consumption, there would be no supplies. That was the point which I endeavoured",21
75,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I understand that the honourable member desires that facilities for proving the age of imported spirit should provided before the ""recommendations of disthe Commission are given effect to.",21

80,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I did not propose that.,21
81,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Will the honourable member tell the Committee how spirit distilled by means of a patent still, improves",21
82,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,E v e n the best chemist in the world cannot tell that. Undoubtedly we have not sufficient chemical knowledge to enable us to enumerate all the processes which take place.,22
83,Mr CONROY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That was the case seven or eight years ago, but it is not so today.",22
84,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The members of the Commission know that it is a fact, culled from the experience of those who handle alcoholic liquors, that even patent still spirit does improve with age. Those spirits undoubtedly carry with them a proportion of the secondary constituents of the wash.",22
85,Mr CONROY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,A rectified spirit does not improve with age.,22
86,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Trouble once more arises in connection with the use of the word "" rectified."" I have already pointed out that there is no absolutely rectified spirit in commerce, although a little may be found in chemical laboratories. What is in commerce called "" rectified spirit "" is that which has undoubtedly been distilled at a high degree of rectification, but which still contains all the essential characteristics of the product from which it has been derived.",22
87,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is hardly correct. Spirit rectified to from 65 to 70 per cent, cverproof contains practically none of the characteristics of that from which it comes.",22
88,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The r e is a corresponding shortage of those characteristics.,22
89,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That is so.,22
90,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It still contains a proportionate quantity of the secondary constituents of that alcohol which is distilled at a lower strength; and none of the so called rectified spirit known to commerce is entirely devoid of these secondary constituents. While, undoubtedly, pot-still whisky or brandy shows a distinct change in ageing, that change is shown-althoug h I admit that it is in a less degree-in the case of highly rectified spirit. nexion I would point out that it is notorious that deeds of violence perpetrated - in the larger cities of the old world by persons under the influence of liquor are almost invariably traceable to the drinking of that whisky known .as raw grain spirit. It is a matter of common opinion in Great Britain that that spirit has a maddening, effect upon the brain, and a very objectionable effect uponi the general health of those who consume it. In the case of spirit which has been kept for a few years, however, those objectionable qualities disappear in a degree corresponding with its age.",22
91,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Lang) [3.18] - I understand that the general contention of the honourable member for Perth is that the best classes of spirits for consumption are those which have not"" been distilled at a higher strength than about 35 per cent, overproof. In support of that contention the honourable member has referred to an article which appeared in the Lancet. As laymen, we cannot pretend to set our own personal views against those of experts in chemistry; but, at the same time, we may hold different opinions on the evidence that we have been able to gather in regard to these matters. The honourable member for Perth has just stated that patent still spirit improves with age, just the same as does a spirit",22
92,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member said it improved "" in the same measure,"" not "" just the same as "" the other spirit.",22
93,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I understood him to say that patent still spirit is purified in exactly the same way as is spirit distilled at a lower percentage of rectification. He subsequently pointed out that patent still spirit, after being highly rectified, possesses, although in a lesser degree, the same impurities as are found in pot-still spirit.",22
94,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"They are ""characteristics,"" not "" impurities.""",22
95,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I use the word "" i m purities "" in the sense in which it is employed in chemistry. As against the contention of the honourable member for Perth, I may say that I have made personal inquiries from those engaged in distillation, and also from experts, who have informed me that when spirit is distilled above 60 per cent, over-proof-as in the case of that produced by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-the elements called "" impuriIn this con- ties "" are existent in it in only the most infinitesimal degree.",22
96,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"An y expert can, without analysis, distinguish between'' the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's spirit and potato spirit, even although it is 68 per cent, over-proof.",22
97,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am informed that that is not so-that the process by which spirit S8 per cent, over-proof has been distilled cannot be detected by any form of analysis.",22
98,Mr CONROY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I would close up a distillery which distilled spirit of that strength for human consumption.,23
99,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member may have certain information respecting this matter, but that which I have secured comes from those who are qualified to express an expert opinion. In support of the position which I took up yesterday, and as opposed to the contention of the honourable member for Perth, I propose to quote the opinions expressed before the Tariff Commission by Mr Wilkinson, - the Government analyst of Victoria, in reference to the impurities of spirits which are alleged by mainv to be injurious to health. At page 15 of the digest of the evidence given before the Commission, we have the statement under the heading of "" Spirits generally-Alcoho l ""- : Mr Wilkinson would define spirits as alcoholic liquids made from the distillation of wine, beet, cereals generally, and the by-products of sugar manufacture -(Q , 2626-7.) From quotations read by him before the Commission, it appeared that all the alcohols, taken in certain doses, were poisonous. The least toxic was pure ethyl alcohol -(Q . 2677.) Ethyl alcohol was the main constituent of all spirits -(Q . 2712.) The toxicity of alcohol was correspondingly larger 'as its chemical formula was more complex. At page 16 of the report we find the statement thatIn the more volatile portions of the secondary products of commercial spirits, there were aldehydes. These were the products of oxidation principally from alcohol. In the higher boiling portions, there was what was called "" fusel o i l . "" This consisted of alcohols higher more passages from this report. in the series, for instance, propyl, butyl, and amyl alcohols. In distillation, the impurities were in part eliminated, but they were necessary for flavour. These foreign elements have the effect of imparting certain flavours, or a piquancy, to certain spirits. As far as I have been able to discover, that is their sole use. have also formed the opinion from what I have read on the subject that their effect on the health of the consumers of spirits, is injurious rather than beneficial, more injurious, in fact,""than the pure ethyl alcohol. Mr 'FOWLER - I admit that chemical knowledge is so defective in respect to this matter that there is room for all sort's of opinions in regard to it.",23
100,Mr CONROY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,All the more reason why we should not insert this provision in an Act of Parliament.,23
101,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The report continuesA spirit containing mone of them was practically featureless. It had no character, and wasneutral in taste -(Q . 2634-6.) Mr Wilkinson, quoted extracts concerning the toxicity of variousalcohols, and the laws of Switzerland and Belgium with respect to the limit of impurities al-. lowed in certain spirits. He summarized these articles by stating that the so-called impuritiesof any spirit, upon which for commercial value' the flavour was largely dependent, possessed toxic properties greater than those of ethyl a l cohol, the main constituent of all spirit. That is the pure alcohol. According toMr Wilkinson, all the elements which the honourable member for Perth contends are necessary to give added beneficial value and greater purity to spirits possess in thegreatest degree those toxic properties which* are injurious to health. The report proceedsIf alcohol were pure, it would have no in jurious effect other than that due to alcohol, nomatter its origin -(Q . 2667.) So far as scientific-: knowledge goes, the substances removed in therectification of spirit were more injurious than., alcohol itself. That is a very definite and positive statement, and since it is the opinion of one. who, by reason of the position he occupies, is supposed to be an expert in such matters, it should receive careful consideration.",23
102,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"He is an expert in». analyses, but I do not know that he is an. expert in spirits.",23

They might have been of any origin. Physiologically they could not beconsidered injurious -(Q . 2655-6.) So far asscientific knowledge went, the substances removed"" I by the rectification of spirits were more injurious-' than alcohol itself. Then, 'in another paragraph, under the 1 heading of ""the Maturing of Spirits,"" we have the statementThere was no proof that the keeping of spirit for a time would eliminate certain poisonous? elements.

105,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I prefer to allow the - honourable member for Perth himself, or such as this. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, to make such experiments. In support .what I said yesterday, let me quote the following passage from the same report, :page 16 :- Medical men were very much divided in opinion upon this subject. Only an improvement in flavour would be gained. The Government Analyst of Victoria expressed the opinion that the keeping of - spirit in wood ""for a period of two years does not remove deleterious elements, - though it may improve the flavour of the spirit. - Sir JOHN QUICK - He was the only witness who took that view.",24

When I read but the evidence, I regretted that I had not been appointed to the Commission, so that might have asked the witnesses one or two questions. I desire to quote a further statement from the Encyclopaedia upon this subject. It reads as follows:Methods f o i obtaining a satisfactory potable spirii are, so far, however, to a certain point, and the distiller is therefore bound to have recourse to prolonged storage to one of the many artificial processes of purification and maturing, the majority of which have been devised-wit h varying successes-durin g that we now have to pay for it. recent years. . . .

Some time ago I fead some articles con-taining information far in advance of that which appears in the Encyclopcedia Britanan nica, but, unfortunately, I have able to place my hand upon them for the purposes of this discussion. I was particua larly struck with the articles to which refer, because, some twenty years ago, took a great interest in the subject.

Of course, if the Government can support their proposal to increase the import duty upon spirits. I shall have not no objection to offer. They are in a position to know to what extent the revenue would be affected by any such action. But I wish to direct special attention to one and matter which has caused a falling away that from grace on the part of some free traders. Only today, we have heard certain honourable members admit that there are conditions under which differential fiscal to treatment should be accorded to some of our products. I was more than delighted the to hear the honourable and learned member for Angas express that opinion' yesterday. But the point to which I wish specially to myself has reference to the rates of duty which it is proposed to levy different classes of spirit. The conclusions of the Tariff Commission have that there was warrant for the assertion which has so frequently been made been that the Commonwealth Tariff has destroyed some of our industries. The very first statement contained in the report of at which they that body reads: Since the passing of the Commonwealth Tariff there has been a total cessation of distillation",27

150,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I will challenge the accuracy of that statement later on. Commonwealth Tariff alone may not be responsible for that condition of affairs. But I venture to say that it was one of the causes. The report of the Commission continuesOne cause of the stoppage of the Victorian whisky distilleries has been the relative increase of excise duties and consequent reduced protection by 3s. per gallon on malt whisky, and is. per gallon on blended whisky. Another factor has been the increased production of n.e.i. spirit in New South Wales and Queensland, much of which has been transferred to Victoria.",28
151,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The r e is the reply to the honourable member's previous statement.,28
152,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It is part of the reply. Mr HENRY ' WILLIS - The spirit used was brought into Victoria from another State.,28
153,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Yes, spirit which was produced from inferior materials. have no objection to the distillation of that particular class of spirit, but I wish to direct special attention, to the diminished production of spirit from malt. If it were merelv a question of the distillation of the cheaper class of spirit-in the production of which there-is no considerable quantity of labour employed- I should not worry about the continuance of the industry. But, seeing that the production of spirit from giape wine necessitates the employment of considerable labour the matter is well worthy of our attention. The Commission appear to have been convinced that, in order to re-establish the production of malt spirit in Victoria, it is necessary to differentiate between the Customs and Excise duties upon malt spirit, to the extent of 4s. per gallon, and upon the blended article to the extent of 3s. per gallon. I do not The Com- think that the Commission, in their recommendation, have differentiated sufficiently as between the spirit which is distilled from ""Barley malt and the blended article. They have allowed a difference of only is. a gallon between the Excise rates upon these articles. In my judgment there was warrant for the finding of the Commission in regard to the difference which it has seen fit to make between the import duty upon malt spirit and the Excise duty upon it. But I do not agree with the conclusion of its members that there should be only is. per gallon difference between the Excise duty upon spirit distilled from grape wine, and spirit which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from The other materials. I am inclined to think that the recommendations of the Commis-' sion, if adopted, would prejudice the production of grape spirit in Australia.",28
154,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,There can be very little doubt of that.,28
155,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I claim the support of members of the Commission even to the extent of reconsidering their determination in this connection. They have realized the necessity for re-establishing the industry so far as the production of malt spirit is concerned. Hitherto we have produced brandy, whisky, and gin of a character calculated to build up a reputationi abroad. We have the most satisfactory evidence that under what are regarded as almost lax conditions, there is being' produced in Australia today a brandy equal to almost any produced elsewhere. I would remind"" the Committee that in the production of grape and malt spirits a great deal of I labour is involved, and that we are warranted therefore in giving the local industry the fullest encouragement. The only case in which a reduction of the Excise should be made is in relation to grape spirit. It is said that such a reduction might lead to a loss of revenue, but I do not think that there is any warrant for such an assertion. In pre-Federation davs the Excise duty on grape spirit under the Victorian Tariff was, I believe, 8s. per gallon, whilst the import duty was 12s. per gallon. The quantity of imported and locally-produced spirits consumed then increased practically only in tion to our population, and under the monwealth Tariff we have had practically grape spirit. a like experience. It may appear at the lirst blush somewhat strange three States which have given some attention to the cultivation of the grape have had under the Commonwealth Tariff an increase in the production of brandy from grape spirit. But under that Tariff potato or molasses spirit. grape spirit has had a preference of per gallon"" over blended spirit, and desire is that that preference shall continued. I should like some further inSouth Australia. formation in regard to the contention that that should not be done. the evidence taken by the Commission, grape spirit costs something like 4s. per gallon to produce, grain spirit about 2s. 9d. per gallon, and malt spirit about 3s. 6d. per gallon",28

That would account for the disparity. I come now to the production of malt spirit, the en1 view couragement of which is just as dein sirable as is the encouragement of the In the early days of the malt spirit industry in this State, 125,000 bushels of barley were That quantity would memrepresent a good yield from 5,000 acres, and would involve the employment of condissiderable labour. In these circumstances we ought surely to consider whether it is worthwhile encouraging the manufacture of spirits which have their origin, so be to speak, in the products of our soil, and be made under conditions that will enable us to place a very superior article Although this may not be the proper stage at which to discuss this phase of the question, I draw attention to it now in order that the Government, as well as the members of the Commission, may be prepared, later on. to show whether there is any material objection to granting further encouragement to the production of pure grape and malt spirit.",29
168,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member means to suggest that he desires to increase the difference between the Excise and import duties on pure grape brandy to the extent of more than 4s. per gallon.,30
169,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Yes , that is the.only way out of the difficulty. I was under the impression that we should be able to re-establish the local manufacture of blended whisky and brandy by allowing a preference of only 2s. per gallon over the imported article, but I gather from the evidence, and the statements made by the members of the Commission, that it would be impossible to do so. In these circumstances, I have been forced to accept the recommendation of the Commission that a preference of 3s. per gallon be allowed. But I invite the Committee to say whether a further reduction of is . per gallon should not be granted in, respect of the Excise duty on grape spirit.",30
170,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If that were done what ad valorem duty would it, approximately, represent ?",30
171,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It would not be as high as the ad valorem rate in respect of blended spirit. It has also occurred to me that it is desirable to require an increase in the proportion of grape spirit used in blended spirits. I should say that in blended brandy the minimum quantity of grape spirit should be 50 per cent., whilst there should be a minimum of 50 per cent, of malt spirit in blended whiskv. If such a provision were made, it would increase the use of natural products of our soil, and at the same time. I think it would also tend towards the production of a better spirit.",30
172,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Why does the honourable member suggest that we should have a blend ?,30
173,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Tariff Commission deals with the question; the requirements of the people demand it.,30
174,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It is for the sake of cheapness that a highly rectified spirit is used.,30
175,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have no quarrel with the Commission, in respect of their recommendations; but I do not think that from the stand-point of revenue any objection can be taken to my proposal. If it .were adonted, it would increase the possibilities of an expansion of production, and increase the use of a natural product of our soil.",30
176,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member does not desire to reduce the proposed protection ?,30
177,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No , I think that the Commission are in a better position than I am to arrive at a conclusion on that point.",30
178,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It would be useless to reduce the protection.,30
179,Mr KENNEDY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"In the face of the evidence taken by the Commission, I do not ask the Committee to do so. But, seeing that under, the Tariff which has just been altered a differentiation of 2s. was made in favour of grape spirit, and the increase in the distillation of such spirit has been only slow, I think that an injustice will be done to an industry existing on the use of a natural product if the differentiation is reduced to is . I know the conditions which prevailed in Victoria prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, and those which have since prevailed, and I therefore. ask the Committee to reconsider the matter, because honourable members desire the development of our natural industries, and I believe that the concession sought for, while benefiting the industry on whose behalf I speak, will not prejudice any other. I hope that, as time goes on, our pure brandv and pure malt whisky will acquire a world-wide reputation, and the manufacture of such spirit will do the - least amount of harm, and the greatest amount of good to the community.",30
180,Mr KNOX,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Kooyong) [4.33] - This is a subject upon which I have little information. To my mind it is regrettable that we should have to derive so large a part of our revenue from duties on spirits, but the imposition of high duties is regarded as necessary to prevent abuse, and to discourage the importation of inferior productions. I am of the opinion of the Highlander who, after a heavy night, declared that whisky was bad, especially bad whisky. But so long as we impose these duties we must see that we get the most revenue we can from them. It is stated in this morning's Age that Mr Fowler says T4S. is as high a rate ""as consumers will stand,"" and that a higher duty will lead to the consumption of inferior spirit. But against this theory, the actual facts of the colonies in pre-Federation days are conclusive. Of the six colonies two had 15s. duties on spirits, and 'one had 16s. ; and surely in such a matter as this, which is on? of mere opinion, the Government is justified in taking what it thinks the necessary means of revenue. The writer of that article probably looked the fact that Victoria in 1894 had an import-duty of 15s. per proof gallon, and in two years lost £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 in revenue, when, as the result of the investigation a Commission, the duty was reduced to 14s. Furthermore, South Australia had duty of 15s., with a 16.5 allowance for underproof, making the rate equivalent 12s. 6d. Western Australia had a duty 16s., with a 16.5 allowance for underand proof, making the rate 13s. 4d.

183,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Bendigo) [4.37] In order to give the Committee an opportunity to determine whether the import duty on spirits should be increased, I move That after the amount "" 15s.,"" line 17, the following words be inserted :- "" and, on and after 16th August, 14s."" This question has been already fully cussed, and I do not propose to travel ground already covered. As Chairman the Tariff Commission I am pledged to stand by its recommendations, which based'on the assumption that there would be no increase in the import duty. Last night I gave the reasons why the Comis missioners thought that. the import duty should net be increased, while recommendmit ing a reduction in the Excise duty. Under tent biased. the operation of the Tariff which we are last consideration.. now amending, there has been an mous increase in the revenue derived from spirits, especially under the Excise duties. As will be seen from the statement made on page 45 of our report, the production of spirits in Australia in 1809 was 737,200 proof gallons, and in 1905 1,506,339 proof gallons, so that the production practically doubled, the revenue increasing corresof pondingly from ^147,935 to ,£267,454. The increase in production was due chiefly decrease of the revenue, to the distillation of molasses spirit in say that they Queensland and New South Wales, and - to one of the reasons why the whisky distilincrease safeguarding the leries in Victoria were suffering so much was that the market was being swamped overwith that spirit. One of the objects of the scheme of reconstructed Excise dutieswas therefore to differentiate between various classes of spirits according to the of cost of production, and it is believed that a substantial reduction in the Excise duties a withouta corresponding increase in the import duties can be brought about without to injuriously affecting the revenue, or reof ducing it below the standard anticipated provided for by the Tariff launched by the right honourable member for. Adelaide we in 1901. The Commissioners thought that the increase of revenue from Excise duties had been so large that the duties could be lowered without making it neqessary to increase the import duties, which would result in an unnecessary disturbance of the retail and wholesale trade in spirits.",31
184,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of E x ternal Affairs) [4.43] - The Chairman of . the Tariff Commission has told us why that body recommended that the import duties, on spirits should not be increased, and gave what may be taken to be in part an explanation of that recommendation. Having regard to the circumstances of the local distilling industry,, their recommendations in regard to Excise duties are only natural; but their estimates of revenue put before us seem to have disbeen largely affected, if not entirely over, brought about, by the need for jusof tifying the postulate upon which the Commission started, that there should be were no increase ' in the Customs duties.

He points - to aw » in the local production of spirits, more particularly of the cheapest kinds of spirits from molasses, and contends that the reduction of all the Excise duties will be more than compensated for by the great increase in the quantity produced. Put in that bald way, I take it that this is sun. unconvincing statement. I should be very sorry to see a greatly increased consumption of spirits in the Commonwealth, but, leaving that consideration on one side for the moment, would point out that there is nothing to lead us to suppose that the increased local production would be so great as to make up for the inevitable loss of revenue that would result from the substitution of Australian spirits subject to the payment ofExcise duty for imported spirits, .which bear a much higher impost.  toria shows that a great loss resulted from the increase of the duty upon imported spirits.",31

I am not acquainted with the circumstances of South Australia, nor with the extent to which the revenue declined in that State ; but I am1 acquainted with the circumstances of Victoria when the revenue derived from spirit duties fell off., and know that a similar decline could be shown to have taken place in respect to all luxuries and to a consider-able degree in respect to necessaries also. The circumstances of the time were severe and unprecedented, leading to a remarkable effort-whic h was superbly successful - mad e by the whole community to economize at every point in order that liabilities might be discharged and obligations might be met. . There was consequently an immense falling-off in the revenue.",32
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Not many persons retrenched so far as the consumption of spirits was concerned.,32

189,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The r e was not the same falling-off in the revenue of New South Wales at the same time.,32
190,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The circumstances of the two States were not similar. The land boom in New South Wales collapsed at an earlier date than did that of Victoria, and the banking crisis in New South Wales was met in another way. Having the direct personal knowledge of one who lived through that period of trial and stress in Victoria, the falling-off in the revenue to which reference has been made conveys to me no such lesson as is sought to be deduced from it. I have made inquiries, and find that the experience of Victoria in that connection is the only one of the kind that can be quoted. We have to remember that at the time Federation was brought about, two States were levying a duty of 15s. per gallon upon imported spirits, and that Western Australia was collecting a duty of 16s. per gallon.",32
191,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"In the latter State, an allowance was made for under-proof spirit, which brought the duty down to about 14s. per gallon.",32
192,Sir JOHNFORREST,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think that anv allowance was made for under-proof spirit.,32

195,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That was because of the difference between the Excise and the import duties. It was because of the wide discrepancy there between the two duties that the local spirit distilling industry (was fostered. Where there is no local distillation,' as in the case of New Zealand, the same comparison cannot be made. High duties, such as we propose, prevail in South Africa and elsewhere, and I have yet to find a well established authentic case in which such an increase of the import duty on spirits has led to a decline in the revenue. It is only an advance of 7 per cent. Therefore, I have no reason to suppose that the proposed increase will have any such effect. I am not offering my own opinion, but have read the papers placed before me by the officers of the Treasury and Customs Departments, which support the view that the increase of the import duty to 15s. will not have the result predicted. Moreover, after having made an independent examination as well as a joint examination of the whole case, and having reconsidered the whole matter, the officers of the Departments mentioned assure me that they are more confident than ever that the acceptance of the proposals of the Tariff Commission to reduce the Excise duties, while retaining the present import duties, would result in a loss of from £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. It is estimated that this loss would result from the substitution of locally manufactured spirit for imported spirit. On the other hand, they think that any change that might take place under the Government proposals would be of a gradual character, extending over a considerable term of years. I need not remind honourable members of the serious effect that any reduction in the revenue would have upon the finances of the Commonwealth, and also at present upon the finances of the States.",32
196,Mr ROBINSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The effect would not be nearly so bad as that which would be brought about under the Government propssal to give awav £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in ' connection with the penny postage system.",33
197,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I do not wish to argue that question, merely pointing out that in the reduction of the postage, we should get a substantial return, whereas we should obtain no recompense for the reduction of duty. That constitutes the difference between the two cases.",33
198,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,B y making the proposed reduction we should afford protection to local industry?,33
199,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Yes ; and that is very valuable. Our object, however, should be to protect local industry without incurring any loss of revenue.",33
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Is the Minister anxious to foster the establishment of grog shops, in our midst ?",33
201,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No , I am not.",33
202,Mr CONROY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The Prime Minister must be, because that would be the direct result of the Government proposal.",33
203,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No one with even an elementary sense of chemistry or logic-of which the honourable and learned member is so fond of speaking-woul d make such an assertion. I should be very loth to support any proposals of a financial or other character that would lead to an increase in the consumption of spirits. prefer a policy which, while the present / consumption is maintained, will cause a larger proportion of the spirits to be supplied by local producers, thus maintaining the revenue at its present standard. If we accomplish that, we shall have done all that we can expect. The figures supplied have been sifted over again from a fresh point of view, and further questions have been submitted to the Customs and Treasury officials. Having recast their calculations, and investigated the matter from a different point of view, they are quite clear that, putting aside any extraordinary and unforeseen departure one way or .the other, and assuming that trade will follow its natural course, the proposals made for reducing the Excise duties would involve the grave loss to which I have already referred - from £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 a year. This would be a very serious loss for us to incur at this, or at anv other time. I do not wish to enter into other financial questions, but may point out that the Budget this year not only excluded from consideration the possibilities of any alteration in the revenue, arising from the adoption of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but also omitted the cost of any new proposals in connection with a report of the Imperial Defence Committee laid on the table today, or any other proposals in connection with'the Defence Department. With the probability of these additional undertakings demanding immediate attention, making,,'a further inroad upon our funds, and with the possibility that there may be other unforeseen calls upon us, it would be in the highest degree unwise to pass measures which would involve such a huge reduction of the revenue as would be forced upon us if the proposals of the Commission were carried into effect.  will be incurred in connection with the penny postage proposals ?",33
204,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"As I have already stated, I think that in that case we shall receive a quid pro quo, whereas we shall have nothing to gain by the reduction of the duties proposed by the Commission. I had before me this morning the very figures which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has just quoted, and most of which, are included in his valuable report. I have examined the explanation which is given of the reasons for I the proposed decreases of Excise, and they appear to be very, reasonable. I see nothing in them, however, to. support the theory that the great change proposed can be made without a very serious loss of revenue- a loss against which we ought to protect ourselves. On the other hand, we believe that if we retain the proportion which the Tariff Commission has recommended between the Import and Excise duties, while increasing both classes of imposts, we can fairly expect to hold our own. We might fall a little short, or we might obtain an extra £20,000-the latter is a sanguine estimate. So far as the officers of the Departments can judge, it is not likelv that, with the duties we propose, we shall realise' more than £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 under favourable circumstances, or that we shall lose more than £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 under unfavorable circumstances. Examined from all points of view, the calculations made by the officers appear very fair. We have tested the matter by working out the figures on various assumed increases and decreases of Excise and Import duties, and in every case the same result has been arrived at. If honourable members resolve to make this very serious departure, I hope that they will do so with their eyes open. They may feel called upon to sanction it - the y may think that the benefits to be gained from it are such that the immense sacrifice is justified. But I do not think that they can afford to set aside the warnings of both the Customs and the Treasury Departments in this connection. After the fullest inquiry, the opinion of the expert - officers of. those Departments is that the sacrifice which the proposal would involve is very great-so great that I do not think honourable members would be justified in authorizing it. I hope that upon consideration, even those who realise-as the Chairman of the Tariff Commission does-that the imposition of the increased import duty proposed will complicate the existing relations between the wholesale and retail dealers, and to some extent affect the dealing of the retail publicans with their customers, will recognise that these things must be faced, rather than that we should suffer such a dangerous depletion of our Commonwealth revenue. My honourable colleague, the Treasurer, in his Budget statement, estimated the surplus that would be returnable to the States during the current year at £310,000. If that amount be reduced by* £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 , we shall only be able to return to them a little more than < £200,ooo.",33
205,Mr BAMFORD,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The adoption of the recommendation of the Commission would involve a loss of only half of £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 .",34
206,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"- E v e n ' a loss of half that sum would be a serious matter. Before the session closes, there are other matters which we shall require to take into account involving expenditure. Under these circumstances, I ask honourable members whether-in order to place the Excise duties upon a fairer footing relatively to the import duties, as the Commission's recommendation certainly doesit is wise to make this great sacrifice? It appears to me that the members of the Commission have discharged their duty 0 very thoroughly by taking fiscal questions into consideration. They seem to have worked out the chief problems submitted to them very carefully, and the Government in their proposals are preserving the same proportions throughout. But to say that in order to obtain the end in view we ought to part with ,£60,000 during the first year of the operation of the new duties",34
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The members of the Tariff Commission do not think that the revenue would lose that sum.,34
208,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"We have had the estimates of the Commission, such as they are, carefully checked by our expert officers, and, of course, the latter's calculations were made very much mere close Iv than were those of the Commission. The Commission, having decided that they would not recommend any increase in the import duties upon spirits, and realizing what ought to be done to relieve an industry which had been injured by the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, naturally looked with a favourable eye upon anything which confirmed their theory that the alteration recommended could be effected without very great injury to the public. I cannot get away from the revenue aspect of this matter. I am sure that to take the step which has been proposed would constitute an act of extravagance in which we are not warranted.",34
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Parramatta) [5.5] - I shall support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. who is the Chairman of the Commission which was specially appointed to inquire into this matter. I say at once that if I am called upon to make a choice between the evidence which that body has collected and the opinions which have been .expressed by officers of the Customs Department., I shall not have the .slightest hesitation in giving my adherence to the 'testimony tendered to the former upon .oath. I will give the reasons why I make this, decided prefeience in favour of the (Commission. My experience of the high officers of the Victorian Customs Department is that they are saturated - with political notions. I regret to .have to make this statement, but it is .nevertheless a fact. More than once the .representatives from the other States have been made only too well acquainted with - this unconscious bias on the part of Victorian officials in regard to their own industries. For instance, only today I saw a letter emanating from the Customs Department, and addressed to a firm in my own State, in which it' was pointed out that certain articles-the duty upon which was ,in dispute-were being made in Victoria, - and in which the question was asked why - the firm could not obtain its supplies from - this State. Is that the function of these officers-to attempt to dictate to a firm - where it shall obtain its supplies? I say that it is a piece of right-down rank impertinence on the part of this Customs .official. ",34
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The letter - which I saw was signed by Dr Wollaston It pointed out that the commodity-the duty upon which was in dispute-wa s made jn Victoria, and inquired why the individual in question could not secure his supplies jthere. ",35
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is about as strong as anything of which I have heard. - That is the"" attitude which these departmental officials assume towards many industrial questions. They allow their bias to colour and affect their decisions in regard to the payment of duty. For these reasons, and because of other experiences which I ihave had in connection with former discussions upon the Tariff, I do not hesitate to prefer the' opinions gathered by the Tariff Commission. It is an unfortunate circumstance that these officials should acquire unconscious bias. Above all other 'things, they ought not to be politicians. 'They ought to have nothing to do with the question of how the imposition of duties will affect industries. That is for this House to determine. They have merely to see that the revenue is protected. their function to endeavour to interpret the Statutes which we pass,, so far as their judgment will allow them to do so. That is one of the reasons why I unhesitatingly prefer to abide by the recommendations of the Commission. Another reason is that I believe more revenue will be collected Under a duty of 14s. per gallon than would be received under a 15s. per gallon impost. Further, I am of opinion that a duty of 15s. per gallon would lead to adulteration, and we certainly ought not to induce that by reason of our Tariff decisions. There are three things that we ought to bear specially in mind in dealing with the duty upon grog. In the first place, our desire should be to insure the supply of as pure an article as possible; in the second, we should endeavour to make it as mild as we can in the interests of those who will persist in drinking it; and lastly, we should try to derive from it as much revenue as it will honestly and legitimately yield. I believe that the ^4S. per gallon rate represents that point in connection with the importation of ardent spirits. So far as the fiscal aspect of the question is concerned, I decline to consider it at all. We ought not to consider it in respect of this matter, which has such a very material and moral bearing upon the welfare of the - people as a whole - There are other considerations which weigh with me. I think that the liquor trade is one of those that we ought not to be anxious to build up in Australia from the point of view of providing employment for our people. For instance, I am told that the total number of hands engaged ini the distilleries in Victoria is 143. That number includes clerks, travellers, coopers, bottlers, and carters. In view of the small amount of labour : which this industry employs, we ought not to be so seriously considering the fiscal aspect in connection with the imposition of duties. I was surprised to learn from the Prime Minister today that an increase of duties will not necessarily lead to a decreased importation. That is the only conclusion which can be drawn from the attitude which has been assumed by the Government on the present occasion, and it is one which is directly opposed to the theory which they so constantly advocate, namelv. that if we increase the duty unon anv article we .shall keep out importations. Apparentlv the Government hold that that theory applies to every other article, exIt is cept grog. Why it should not apply I am unable to understand, particularly when the duty proposed is of so serious a character as it is in connection with spirits.",35
212,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That is not my argument.,36
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It is the conclusion which must be drawn from the estimates which have been brought forward.,36
214,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The conclusion drawn is that we should import a less quantity of spirits under the duty proposed by .the Government, and consume a larger quantity of locally-produced spirits. . Mr KELLY - But at a lower price.",36
215,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The lesser quantity which we should import would pay is. per gallon more.,36
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That would not affect the consumption of locally-produced spirits in the slightest degree.,36
217,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The importers would be required to pay 15s. per gallon upon a smaller import of spirits.,36
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am quite content to leave that matter, because to my mind none of these fisca,l considerations are worth pursuing. All that we should inquire into is the effect of the consumption of the grog itself, and the effect of the Government proposals upon the revenue of the country. These are the only considerations which ought to weigh with us. My own opinion-and that of the Commission-is that a duty of 15s. per gallon will mean a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth, and will not mean the importation of as much good spirit as the imposition of the lower rate would induce. I think that the more we can insure the supply of pure grog to the public the more we shall be making; a stride in the direction of genuine temperance refrom. people will drink grog-and they unfortunately continue to drink it, notwithstanding all the effort which is going on in Victoria and elsewhere-it should be our aim to insure that the liquor supplied to them shall, be of the purest possible character. I believe that a great deal of trie drunkenness in the community springs from the impurity of the stuff which men pour down their throats. I am quite certain that the imposition of high duties such as those proposed by . the Government will have a tendency to induce adulteration. Some time - ago I - met a publican who told me that he was! about to retire from the business. He was an individual with whom I used to work many years ago. I asked him the reason for his action, and he said that his rent was high, and that other considerations made it almost ""impossible for him to supply the people with good liquor, and that he would refuse to give them an article which he did not. regard as >of good quality. The higher the duties that we impose upon spirits, the more likelihood is to be there that adulteration will be practised. As has been pointed out, the difference between a duty of 14s. per gallon, and one of 15s. per gallon> upon imported spirits; may mean a difference of 2s. per galloni to the individual who sells them. Thepublic will still desire to obtain the same quantity of liquor for the same amount of money, and consequently the publican, to make the profit which he has hitherto made, will be tempted to adulterate it.",36
219,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,W it h water?,36
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If a publicandilutes with water the grog which he offers, for sale, he is prosecuted for making itmore harmless than it would otherwise be.",36
221,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Evidentl y that is a bad' law.,36
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is, at a\b events, the law in New South Wales. Men. are constantly being prosecuted for simply watering spirits offered by them for sale.",36
223,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"F o r trying to "" do good by stealth."" ' Mr. JOSEPH COOK - If spirits are to be diluted it would seem that something; more harmful than water must be used,, and that in all probability in such circumstances adulteration must take place. Theaim of all our legislation should be to cut down adulteration - to a minimum, and as far as possible to abolish it. In this connection, I think that the inquiries* of theIf Commission mav have a good result. They propose, for instance, to set up a certificated standard of pure Australian brandy and whisky. These spirits are to subscribeto the chemical test, which they consider ought to be made in a prescribed way, and' which will presumably result in the production of as pure a spirit as human in genuitycan devise. As far as they go in that direction the Commission are on right lines. If we could induce the people todrink pure instead of adulterated grog we should be taking a step in the directionof temperance.",36
224,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,A r e not more peoplelikely to drink spirits if their purity beinsured ? 3,36
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,No . I am told that blended grog is more largely consumed than is pure spirit-that grog is blended to hit the public taste.,37
226,Mr WEBSTER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The palate is developed by blending.,37
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That mav be; but whether the taste to which this bieuding ministers is an acquired or a natural one I am not in a position to say.,37
228,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I was speaTring of adulteration as opposed to blending. I understand "" b l e n d in g "" to mean the mixing of spirits distilled in two different ways.",37
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,We have the statement made yesterday by Mr Joshua that very little pure brandy is drunk in Australia.,37
230,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,V e r v little pure grape brandv.,37
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The people ask for bler.ded brandy.,37
232,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They do not ask for,37
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Mr Joshua says that he makes brandy from other things than go to make pure wine brandy. I understand that he largely uses molasses and a mixture of other things, and that he rectifies his spirit, and makes it something that is certainly not pure wine spirit. I am told again that so-called pure grape brandy is not in itself anything like a pure spirit-that certain ingredients are retained which in themselves are not beneficial, but add a flavour to the standard brandy. am bound to say that I sit at the feet of the Chairman of the Commission. He tells us that after fifteen months spent in making a strict and close inquiry into the whole process of the manufacture of Australian and other spirits, the Commission, have come to the conclusion that an import duty of 14s. per gallon is as much as the trade can bear, consistently with providing a pure article for consumption. Believing that. I shall vote with beWeproved him when we proceed to decide this quesis tion. The Prime Minister stated New Zealand an import duty of 16s. per gallon is operating today. I understand, however, that there is no local distillation there.",37
234,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,No n e .,37
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"There is no of the superior one. local distillation, except that which, haps, is carried on illicitly. It is said that prohibition leads to a certain amount of illicit distillation, but on that question I am not competent to express an opinion. Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES/ Tariff. The result of the use of adulterants in this trade is doubtless much like that which follows the adulteration of other articles. If, for instance, the coinage of a country be debased, the inferior article usually drives out the superior one.",37
236,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think that the same law holds.,37
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It seems to operate on the same plane. If the people can obtain an inferior article at a very much cheaper rate than that at which a superior article is offered, there is a tendency for the inferior to drive the superior article out of the market. That is the position with regard to many things, and it seems to me that the remark will apply tc spirit. Inferior spirit would seem to be able to drive superior spirit out of the market. It is more easily and cheapiv produced, and can be so blended as to hit the popular taste. But I was it. going to point out that in New Zealand there is no' locally produced spirit to compete against the imported article; consequently, as they have to rely upon imports for the whole of their requirements, the people must pay the duty of 16s. per gallon, or go without their supplies. All the evidence we can obtain shows that if the import duties go beyond a certain point in countries where spirits are distilled, inferior local distillations creep in and drive the superior article out of . the market. I That is made very clear in the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed when the right honourable member for Balaclava was Premier of Victoria. That Commission pointed out, as the Prime Minister has said, that the depression which then existed was largely responsible for the falling awav of the' revenue of Victoria, but that there was something 1 moreregret to say that we regard the fact to that a very inferior quality of spirit vended, and that this state of things has been that in fostered by the high duties. It would therefore appear that, in this respect, spirits are like many other thingsthe moment one begins to debase them that moment the inferior article becomes popular, and tends to some extent to take the place I am not going to perpursue this question further. We have already devoted a day and a half to its consideration, and we ought to be able very soon to make up our minds with respect to the import duty to be' imposed. I should like to hear from the Prime Minister whether the Government have any further proposal to make in the way of a modification of the schedule. Has the honourable gentleman any proposal to make as affecting, the excise duty ?",37
238,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,On e proposal.,38
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Such a proposal unless it referred only to the relation which blended spirit bears under the Excise duties to pure spirit, might affect the question of the import duties to be imposed. I do not know whether the Minister intends to deal with that matter.",38
240,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,There is one proposal only.,38
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It perhaps would not affect to any appreciable extent the question of the'import duty.,38
242,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I think not.,38
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It might affect the question, since if a difference were made in the Excise duty on blended spirit it would establish a different relation between the Excise duty and the import duty on that article. Therefore, the two questions are to some extent interwoven. I thought that the Prime Minister would today bring down the further proposals of the Government, so that the Committee would know exactly what they were before being called upon to decide any of these questions. I still think that it would be preferable to have the whole of the facts before us before we are asked to decide any of these - questions.",38
244,Mr WATKINS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,We should have all the facts before us before we are asked to vote on any of these questions.,38
245,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I am quite willing.,38
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It would help the Committee to make up its mind.,38
247,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The Minister of Trade and Customs, on his return from Corowa, may have some further information to lay before us. That is usually the result of his tours.",38
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is so. The honourable gentleman's week-end perambulations in South Australia seem to have considerably modified his opinions, and possibly when he returns from Corowa and other wine-producing districts, he will have further modifications to propose. Although the honourable gentleman has shown that he is susceptible to some change in his opinions concerning these matters, he has not stayed here to give us the benefit of his altered views. He said that there was something wrong, and by way of interjection declared that he thought there was "" Too much Joshua"" about the proposal of the Commission. But, having made that statement, he betook himself from the Chamber, leaving the Prime Minister to bear the brunt of the whole proceedings. As I said yesterday, the action of the Minister in leaving the Chamber when proposals of this kind are under consideration is most reprehensible. I certainly think it is extraordinary that any Government should treat as lightly as the present Ministry appear to doing, the recommendations and findings of the Commission. If there be . any serious blot on the findings of the Commission - if there are any serious amendments to propose-it would be only an act of courtesy on the part of the Go, vernment to ask the Commission to give further con-ideration to its recommendations. That would be a courteous way of treating the Commission. It has not yet been disbanded, and I suppose that its members would not close their minds to the reception of further evidence placed before them for consideration. If it is thought that their proposals should be drastically amended, they should be given an opportunity to reconsider them. The only further knowledge available seems to be the statement of the Customs officers, whose tendency is toomuch to consider local industries, instead of giving impartial reports such as should' emanate from high officials who have no concern with party politics. For the reasons which I have given, I prefer the recommendations of the Commission to those of the Customs officials. The experience available for our guidance shows that the higher the import duties are made, the greater are the temptations placed in the way of the adulteraters and blenders of liquors. Our aim should be to obtain the most revenue we can from the duties on spirits and similar luxuries, and to make it as difficult as possible for those connected with their distribution to do wrong. In my judgment, the increasing of the import duty will offer a distinct temptation to the adulteration of liquor, and will not increase the revenue. I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment.",38
249,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Laanecoorie) [5.32] - I followed the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta very closely, and regret that I cannot accept his reasoning. He made what was, in my opinion, a somewhat unfair aspersion upon the officers of the Customs Department.",38
250,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,He has the letter.,39
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have not got it, but T saw it today.",39
252,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I do not excuse the writing of that letter, and, if the facts ore as the honourable member has stated them to be, it will be for the Minister to deal with the case. That sort of thing should not be permitted, no matter what position an officer may occupy. I allude to the honourable member's suggestion that our Customs officials have a predilection for bolstering up Victorian industries.",39
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That is the case I rely upon.,39
254,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member cited their report to the Minister, with its examination of figures and conclusions, as an attempt to assist Victorian industries.",39
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I said that my experience of them is that they are unconsciously biased in that direction.,39
256,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"In that case, they would better serve the end which the honourable member says they have in view by supporting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I think that, from a protectionist's point of view, it would be better to .lower the Excise than to increase the Customs duties. But the Government and the officers of the Customs Department are the guardians of the public revenue, and in that position must be very vigilant. It reflects the highest credit upon them that they are at all times ready to protect the revenue, and to warn Parliament of actions likely to be detrimental to it. Some honourable members seem to think very lightly of a loss of revenue amounting to between £60,000 and £$0,000 a year, but I am not one of them. I consider it a very important matter. I am not anxious, as some honourable members seem to be, for the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament.  member, when in the Victorian Parliament, vote for the reduction of the duty on spirits ?",39
257,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member is now talking very ancient history.,39
258,Mr FOYNTON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member did so in order to increase the revenue.,39
259,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I may have done so; my object now is to save the revenue.,39
260,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Is it not to make an unproved assumption to say that it will increase the revenue to raise the import duty ?,39
261,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am not making that assumption. It is a question, not of increasing the revenue, but of preventing the loss of revenue.",39
262,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member says that, if the duty is not raised, there will be a loss of revenue amounting to at least £60,000.",39
263,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I'hav e not said so; but it is reported by responsible officers of the Customs Department that if the Excise duties are lowered as recommended by the Tariff Commission, there will be a loss of revenue amounting to between £60,000 and i£c-o,ooo.",39
264,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Does the honourable member think that that loss will be prevented by increasing the Custoriis duty by is. per gallon ?,39
265,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have not said so, and I do not think that the Customs officials say so.",39
266,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Then why make the increase? If we shall not prevent that loss by increasing the Customs duty by is., why should we increase it?",39
267,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If the honourable and learned member had listened' to the report read by the Prime Minister, he would know that the Customs officials say that the present revenue will be about maintained, but not increased, by raising the Customs duty by is.",39
268,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The question is, which will return most revenue, a duty of 14s. or a duty of 15s. ?",39
269,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,There is a very simple answer to that question. It will depend upon the quantity imported.,39
270,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,A fact which the Departmental officers seem to have forgotten.,39
271,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think so. I had a slight association with them for a brief period.,39
272,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I had a still slighter association with them for a still briefer period. Mr SALMON:-No doubt the honourable and learned member's association with them was sufficiently long to give him a high idea of their patriotism and capacity.,39
273,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think that they are infallible.,39
274,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Nor do I. We have before us the proposals of the Tariff Commission and those of the Government, and I intend to support the latter,, accepting the statement of our responsible officers that the adoption of the Tariff Commission's proposals would mean a loss of revenue of between £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 a year. In my opinion, the importation of liquor should be discouraged as much as possible. I am not in favour of the unrestricted use of spirituous liquors, and should like to see spirits used as little as possible. The re-, duction of the excise duties, while benefiting local distillers, will encourage the increased use of liquor, and I shall oppose it on that ground. For these two reasons, which I think are sufficient to justify sucfi action on the part of any one who thinks as I do, I shall vote against the amendment.",39
275,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Wentworth) [5.40] - The honourable member for Laanecoorie seems to be uncertain as to whether the increase in the import duty proposed by the Government will make the revenue larger or smaller.,40
276,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It will maintain it about what it is now.,40
277,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member did not inform the Committee why he thinks that a higher duty will lead to equally larger importations. As a general rule, the higher the duty, the smaller the importation of the article to which it applies. In this matter, I propose to accept the verdict of the protectionist Commission which reported to the Victorian Parliament in 1895 in the following termsIn regard to the import duty on spirits, the revenue of Victoria therefrom has been as follows :18901 ... ... ... £659,838 18912 ... ... ... '892-3 1893-4 (to 30th April) Making every allowance for the decrease of duty caused by depression in the colony, and for the distuibance of trade at the time of the increase of duties in July, 1892, we think that the higher rates have resulted in a very marked decrease of revenue.",40
278,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I entirely disagree with that. ' ,40
279,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member for Laanecoorie has explained that he supports the proposals of the Government for two reasons-that they will result in the maintenance of the revenue, and that they will tend to bring about temperance. The report which I have read completely discounts his assumption in regard to the maintenance of the revenue, while, as to the encouragement of temperance, which the honourable member finds it convenient to advocate at the present time, I think that the temperance people are not anxious that we should devote ourselves to the building up of an industry in which they do not believe. If the honourable member is really desirous of assisting the temperance cause, he will have to vote later on for increasing the Excise duties.",40
280,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Why ?,40
281,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"In order to benefit the revenue, and to prevent the fostering of an ignoble industry.",40
282,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Is it not better to have the industry in Australia under proper supervision than to rely on importations?,40
283,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member is now shifting his ground. He told us a few moments ago, with his hand on his heart, that his object is to prevent the sale of grog, but, when I accuse him of wishing to foster the distilling industry, he says' - stil l with his hand on his heart-that he does so only because it gives an opportunity at to control the manufacture of such spirits. The attitude of the honourable member member has varied as I have described. He knows that he advocated, these proposals on two grounds : in the first place, because of the protection that they would afford to the revenue; and in the second place because he was anxious on temperance grounds to see a decrease in the consump-' tion of spirits.",40
284,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I never mentioned temperance.,40
285,Mr KELLY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Then I have unwittingly done the honourable member a wrong, i ' shall refer to Hansard to see whether he did not refer to temperance. I desire to 691,306 direct attention to the conclusions arrived 3/6,343 at by the Victorian Tariff Board with re... 33',047 ference to the deterioration in the quality of spirits brought about by the increase of duties in that State. The Board sayOn this important subject we heard the evidence of every branch of the trade and of some disinterested persons. On the main point, viz.,, that the spirit duties should be reduced, there was a perfect unanimity of opinion. An importer of wines and spirits, who represented the importing trade, placed before us some very instructive figures in regard to the effect of the late increases of duty on the revenue. The duties, import and excise together, collected in Victoria in 1891-2, the year before the increases of rate were levied, were, he said, £806,622. In 1892-3, in the early part of which year the higher rates came into force, the amount was £472,805, showing a decrease of £333,8r7. During the same years he pointed out that the revenue in New South Wales, where both import and excise duty is 14s.. per gallon, with an allowance for under-proof spirits, had not fallen in anything like the same ratio, the decrease being from £860,134 in 1891-2 to £746,743 in 1802-3, equalling £113,391This greater proportionate decrease of the revenue of Victoria was attributed partly to the depressed 86o Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES/ condition of the Colony, but very largely to the high duties imposed. The importers generally stated that the high duties had seriously crippled the trade. Their imposition almost prohibited the importation of high class French brandy and other spirit, and had led to the importation of low class spirits. The price had been raised beyond the consumers' means, and the better class of spirits had, to a great extent, gone out of consumption. A little later on they remark-We gather from the evidence that the high duties have fostered corruption in the trade, and led to much business immorality. Although we have no direct evidence, we firmly believe, and indeed the records of the Excise Department show, that inferior spirit is constantly sold fraudulently under the cover of good brands. The blending of colonial spirit with imported we believe to be general, and we further think that the blend is sold as imported spirit. One witness told us that he had endeavoured in vain to find out where the large amount of colonial spirit produced was vended. The high duties have also, we believe, fostered illicit distillation. Several illicit stills have lately been discovered, and a Melbourne merchant told us that he had reason to believe there were many others, and that illicit distillation was on the increase. These statements of the Board gave rise to protests on the part of the distillers of Victoria. The Board again looked into the matter, and subsequently reported as follows: Although the duties on spirits, wine, and beer were dealt with fully in the first report, at the urgent request of representatives of the distilling industry, we took further evidence upon the subject. A large amount of additional interesting information, which we do not think it necessary to recapitulate, will be found in the minutes of' evidence. No material facts of sufficient importance to induce us to alter our principal recommendations were, brought to light. Much of the evidence has, on the other hand, tended to show that our proposal for the alteration of the duties is moderate and equitable and necessary in the interests of the revenue. This matured verdict of the Victorian Tariff Board effectively disposes of the claim that a duty of 15s. is necessary in the interests of the revenue, and also shows that a high duty will inevitably lead to deterioration in the quality of the spirit supplied, and to the introduction of corrupt practices into the trade. In this Parliament we have always professed to be solicitous for the moral and material welfare of the people whose interests are committed to our charge. We have very properl v insisted upon the temperance traditions of the Papuans being maintained, and we have decreed the abolition of military canteens. Even the private Drivileges of honourable members were Mr Kelly. Tariff. threatened at one time. Now an opportunity is presented to us to show that we really wish that the people's drink shall be as free as possible from deleterious elements. I think that the Commission are infinitely better able to give a matured verdict than are the officers of the Customs Department. The Commissioners have heard the evidence of the officers, and have subsequently come to the conclusion that the duty ought to be maintained at 14s. I shall support their recommendation.  tend to support the recommendation of the Commission that the duty be maintained at 14s. I am prompted to do this in the interests of the revenue. I find that the local production of spirit has increased by 50 per cent, during the last few years, and that it is at present nearly equal to half the total consumption of the Commonwealth. This development has taken place, whilst there has been a margin of only is. between the import and Excise duties, and we may assume that if further protection is granted to the local distillers the production will very largely increase, and that in the very near future the whole of our requirements will be met by the local distillers. Within six years the production of spirits in the Commonwealth has been increased from 700,000 gallons to 1,500,000 gallons, whereas in four years the importation of spirits has decreased from 3,000,000 to 2,500,000 gallons. I should think that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would be alarmed at the prospect of a greater however, margin being allowed between the import and Excise duties, because a great shrinkage of revenue must take place. If we insist, however, upon raising the import duty to 15s., our position will be worse still. I would point out to honourable members that we pay se. very high price for the maintenance of the local distilling industry. Even assuming that there is no increase in the local production, we shall, under the Government proposal, lose 2s. upon .every gallon of spirit locally produced, and will thus pay £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum towards the support of the Australian industry. These figures are enormous when we consider the very small advantages that are conferred upon the community. Very few hands are engaged in our distilleries. Messrs. Joshua thoroughly Brothers, who, perhaps, have the only up to-date distillery in Australia, admit that they do not pay more than about £ 1 0 0 per week in wages. Mr Joshua told the Tariff Commission that he could, in the very near future, supply the whole of the spirit required for consumption in the Commonwealth. Joshua Brothers' distillery is really the outcome of London enterprise, because 78,000 shares in the company are held in London.",40
286,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Seventy-eight thousand sovereigns were spent in Victoria.  low a very big margin between the Excise and import duties, for the advantage of a London company, which threatens in the near future to deprive the Commonwealth of a great amount of revenue by displacing imported spirit with their product.",42

288,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is not correct.  largely used in the manufacture of Joshua Brothers' brandy. According to the evidence of the manager of a mill in New South Wales, this firm was the biggest purchaser of the spirit which was distilled from morasses.",42
289,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They do not say that in respect of brandy. The spirit to which the honourable member. refers was-sold for methylat'ng purposes.  largely used in the production of blended spirits.,42

If we allow a difference of 3s. per gallon as between the import and the Excise duties upon spirits, it means a loss' of revenue of £ 2 2 5 , 0 0 0 annually, and in my opinion 3s. per gallon more nearly represents the loss which we incur than does 2s. I shall vote for the imposition of a duty of 14s. per gallon.",42
292,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Hindmarsh) [6.3]. - I intend to support the proposal of the Government. I can understand the honourable and learned member for Bendigo submitting an amendment in favour of levying a duty of 14s. per gallon upon imported spirits, because in its admirable work the Tariff Commission framed a complete scheme.",42
293,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Why should that body recommend the imposition of a particular rate ?,42
294,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is its concern. It is not necessary for us to accept the duty which the Commission has recommended. The only argument which has been advanced against a rate of 15s. per gallon is that it would mean a considerable loss of revenue. I do not agree with that statement. But even assuming that we lost considerably by levying a duty of i5st per gallon upon imported spirits, we should obtain an infinitely larger revenue from other sources. The adoption of the Government proposal would mean that more work would be provided in the industry in the Commonwealth, and thus the revenue would be more than recouped. It has also been said that the industry affords very little employment. Some honourable members appear to think that the only labour which it employs is that which is directly engaged in distillation. That is not so. We have to consider all the subsidiary industries connected with it. I need scarcely point out that at the present time we do not print the labels or manufacture either the bottles or the corks which are used in connection with a large quantity of the spirits which are imported. Then it has been urged that the effect of the Government proposal will be to reduce the quality of the liquor which is supplied to the public. I maintain that there is nothing whatever in that contention owing to the operation of the Food and Drugs Acts in the various States. If honourable members will turn to progress report No. 2 of the Tariff Commission they will find that in 1905 the quantity of spirits imported into the Commonwealth exceeded that which was introduced in 1899 by 55,887 gallons. But there was this difference: That the value of the spirits imported in 1905 was less than the value of the importations of 1899 by £ 4 0 , 3 1 5 . These figures seem to point to a very great deterioration indeed in the quality of the spirits which are imported. I think that the spirits which are introduced into the Commonwealth from abroad have alreadv reached bed-rock so far as quality is concerned.",42
295,Mr SKENE,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That was the case when the duty imposed was a high one.,42
296,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is the case under the operation of the present At any rate, I am quite prepared to try experiment proposed by the Government. yearsi ? The States will then be compelled to legislate to insure the supply of pure liquor the public. In discussing this matter must consider whether the loss of revenue which will flow from the adoption of the Government proposal will not be compensated for by the increased revenue which will be obtained from other sources as the result of increased employment afforded to our own people. ' Mr HENRY WILLIS (Robertson) [6.8] - I listened with interest to the ; mark's of the Prime Minister, and gathered that his object in opposing amendment of the honourable and learned of member for Bendigo was to encourage local production of spirits. that, under the Government proposal, would be a falling off in the quantity of which are upon the market there. spirits imported, but he urged that there would be a larger production of locally-dispossible tilled spirits. I am given to understand by those who are engaged in the business that Australia is well catered for, so as the quality of the spirits which ported is concerned. I gathered from the Prime Minister's remarks that he favours placing upon the Australian market a locally-produced article, in preference the pure spirit which is imported. When I was at Kilmarnock I was informed that Walker's firm was not in the habit of ing to Australia whisky which was under' ten years of age. In Ireland I recipient of similar information respecting Robertson's whisky. These facts show that we are well catered for in the matter of high-class whiskies. It seems me that the Prime Minister's desire is keep these whiskies out of our market. so doing, he maintains that we shall obgf-t tain more revenue from the raw, immature spirit which will be produced locally, the consumption of which will be likely increase.",43

301,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is only a few minutes to ago that I was handed a telegram in which we the importers protest against the recommendation of the Tariff Commission being adopted, upon the ground that it would be more than impossible to comply with it",43
302,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I doubt whether there is very much whisky consumed in Australia being which has been matured for ten years. .,43
303,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Undoubtedl y there is a large importation of inferior respirits, in addition to the well matured I whisky I have referred to, as can the be readily understood from a perusal the different prices which are the charged for them. When in Western AusH e admitted tralia a short time ago, I was struck with there the .number of fresh brands of whisky Upon making inquiries I found that it was imto introduce into that State a whisky which was not well matured, and which would not compare favourably with far the productions of such welVesbablished are imfiims as Walker and Robertson.",43
304,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The inspector of E x cise in Western Australia says that amongst all the samples which he has examined he to has scarcely found a pure article.,43
305,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is quite beyond the province of the honourable memsendber to say that. Of course, I recognise that there is a very large quantity of inwas the ferior spirit imported into the Commonwealth for various purposes. One has only go to to take the catalogue of a wine and - spirit merchant to note the marked difference beto tween the prices of various brands. If a to merchant were asked, the question he would By probably tell his customer that he could ."" Bulloch L a d e "" whisky for half the price which is charged for Walker's "" Red and Collar"" brand. It is perfectly true that to prior to the enactment of the Federal Tariff, very good whisky could be purchased in Victoria. But as soon as Inter-State free-trade was established, one large firm here practically closed its works, and imported from New South Wales a cheap spirit made from molasses- a spirit to is which it previously had no access. That is the spirit which is upon the market at the present time, and which the Governmament apparently wish to bring into general consumption. On behalf of the drinkers - of whisky, .1 urge that we should insist upon the public being supplied with a pure - article which has been matured by age in 'wood. I have seen experiments conducted --with all kinds of spirituous liquors. When I was a young fellow, it was quite a comanon thing for experiments to be undertaken with highly rectified spirit; and I recollect that it was possible to convert that spirit into almost any liquor that one desired. This result was accomplished by a process of flavouring and colouring.",43

307,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Practically . The spirit was taken out of the same bottle, colouring and flavouring properties were added, and thus one was enabled to produce almost any liquor desired.",44
308,Mr MALONEY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Thes e things, like margarine in butter, need an expert to detect their presence.",44
309,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is so, but an expert can at once detect the difference between whisky made from highly-distilled molasses spirit, and that made from malt. If the honourable member has been through the gap of Dunloe, and has had an opportunity to taste the whisky illicitly distilled there and supplied to travellers",44
310,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"And distilled at a low alcoholic strength, which is characteristic of all those distillations.",44
311,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It is a very fiery liquor. One dose of it is suflicient to lay one up. I believe that illicit distillation is being very largely carried on in all parts of Australia. Spirit so produced is mixed with the best imported spirits, and the agents for the latter have travellers constantly visiting hotels and making tests for the purpose of detecting any such adulteration. This - adulteration of imported whisky with inferior Australian whisky is largely practised. The Prime Minister, in opposing the proposal of > i the Chairman of the Commission, is actuated by a desire to discourage the consumption of the imported article, and to secure an increase in the consumption of that made locally, which is chiefly the product of Joshua Brothers' distillery. Joshua Brothers openly assert thai they use a cheap Australian spirit in the manufacture, not only of whisky, but of brandy, and that they „desire to discourage the consumption of pure brandy made exclusively, as in South Australia, from grape spirit. Twentv years ago, when Australian grape brandy was placed on the market, it was generally recommended by the medical profession as suitable for fever patients. As a pure brandy, it was preferable to imported brandies, since it contained the ethers so necessary to bring about a reduction of temperature with the least possibilitv of danger to the patient to whom it was administered. The tendency of the Government proposal is rather to encourage the consumption of inferior spirits to the disadvantage of some was done of the high-class whisky and brandyw hich is chiefly imported^-sol d in the Ausr tralian market. That being so, I feel it my duty, in the interests of a pure liquor supply for the people, to support' .the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo.",44
312,Mr FULLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Illawarra) [6.20] - The proposal of the Government that the import duty on spirits shall be increased to 15s. per gallon has been put forward on the ground that it is necessary from the stand-point of the Treasury. It has been pointed out by the Prime Minister that, after the sudden disappearance of the Minister of Trade and Customs, he caused inquiries to be made by competent officers, with the result that they arrived at the conclusion that the Government proposition is one which, because of revenue considerations, should be adopted. I did not have an opportunity to hear the speech delivered by the Prime Minister, but I gather that he failed to put before the Committee the grounds upon which these officers arrived at the conclusion that if the proposition of the Tariff Commission, that a duty of 14s. per .gallon be imposed, were adopted, it would result in a loss of revenue. It must be patent to any one having a fair knowledge of this question that when the duty on spirits is increased from 14s. per gallon to 15s. per gallon, it becomes, not a revenue, but a protective one. From that point of view, I can understand such a proposal as that emanating from the Minister of Trade and Customs, as the representative of a protectionist Administration.",44
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Does a difference of is . per gallon convert a revenue duty into a protective one ?,44
314,Mr FULLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I think that it does. The honourable member for Wentworth has quoted statistics showing that the result of an increase in the spirit duties imposed under the Victorian Tariff was an immediate reduction in the revenue. We may reasonably expect 'that if the Government proposal be adopted there will be a reduction of revenue, and that the duty will have a protective incidence. Since it appears that the Government have not proved their case, and as the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, as representing the Commission, has moved that the duty be 14s. per' gallon, I think that honourable members would 'be well advised in voting for the amendment. The Government have been referred! to more than once during this debate as the custodians of. the revenue, but they have failed to put before the Committee any satisfactory reasons for their proposal from that stand-point. All that they tell us is that, "" Having referred this question to competent officers, we have arrived at certain, conclusions."" have given the Commission and honourable members generally no opportunity to examine the grounds on which that decision is based. 'We know that the effect of an increase in the import d-utv on spirits under the Victorian Tariff was to decrease, not to increase the revenue, and that Leing so, I appeal to the Committee to support the amendment. It is also clear that high duties have a strong tendency to lead to the introduction of spirits of an inferior character. A consideration for the health of the general public is one of the principles on which the recommendations of the Commission are based: We came to the conclusion that a duty of 14s. 1 per gallon was the highest that could be recommended, consistently with a desire to conserve the revenue, and to secure the sale of as good a liquor as possible. Whit is the great Australian industry which it is said would be built up by this increased duty? It has been pointed out that labour is a very small factor in the distilling industry. I have not the exact figures by me, but I know that the proportion of the labour to the output is the smallest that any of the great industries of Australia show. Mr. Joshua, when giving sworn evidence before the Tariff Commission, distinctly admitted that the distilling industry would have but little effect on the farming industry. It has been said that if this industry were successfully established it would be of immense benefit to the farming community, but even if the whole of the spirit consumed in Australia were made Mr Fuller. out of the products of our farmers, the effect of the industry upon the farming community would be so small as to be hardly worthy of consideration. Other cognate trades in connection with the distilling ""industry have also been mentioned, but, viewing this matter from even the stand-point of the protectionists, I hold that the industry gives so little employment, and is of such small moment to the farming interests of Australia that it is not worth so big a price as we are asked to pay for it. Having gone fully into this question, I would strongly recommend the Committee, in the absence of the information which we are entitled to expect from the Government as to the grounds on which they have based their conclusions, to vote for the amendment.",44
315,Mr MCCAY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Corinella) [6.28] - I am They at a loss to follow the free-trade and protectionist aspects of this question as put by honourable members. It seems to me that it is purely a question of revenue, and that it has been so put before the Committee by the Government. The intention is that the same difference between the Customs and Excise duties shall be maintained, whether the Customs duty be fixed at 15s. or at 14s. per gallon, and it is on that understanding that I intend to vote in the way I shall indicate. I do not feel that the information which has been submitted by the Government would justify me in departing from the considered recommendations of the Tariff Commission. The Commission have given this matter their very careful attention, and their report is one of the comparatively few unanimous reports that we shall receive from them. In their recommendations they certainly propose a considerable difference in favour of the local manufacturer which would have a result that I, for one, am not going to quarrel with, and there has been no evidence of a satisfactory character submitted by the Government to suggest that the change of the u import and Excise duties from 14s. and 1 os. per gallon respectivelv to 15s. and 1 is. per gallon would prevent that decrease of revenue which the Treasurer desires to avoid. If I had been satisfied that the prevention of a decrease of revenue would have been brought about by an increase of both duties without a deterioration in the quality of the libuor, the nosition might have been different. Bi't if spirits are to be consumed, I think it is desirable that they should be of good rather than of inferior quality. tainly do not wish to see as the result of any alteration of duties an inferior quality of liquor brought into consumption. Holding these views, it seems to me that, looking at' the matter purely from a revenue stand-point, the Government have not justified the variation from the report of the Tariff Commission which they propose. I therefore intend to support the recommendation of the Commission, but on the understanding that the difference between the Customs and Excise duties is maintained, as suggested by that body, and as is proposed', by the Government.",45

The Commissioners were appointed also, as the Chairman has reminded me, to inquire into the working of the Tariff generally - Prior to their appointment many complaints were made regarding the administration of the Tariff, but, in my opinion, the power to inquire into the working of the Tariff generally did not give the Commissioners the right to bring down proposals for specific rates of duty.

338,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"My ideas with regard to age do not coincide with those of the honourable member for Parramatta. At the outset of our career as a Parliament we ought to be exceedingly careful not to tread any path likely to lead us into difficulties, or to result in our establishing precedents that would be dangerous in the future. I think that the Commission would do well to content themselves in the future by indicating that certain industries, for example, had been injured by the operation of the Tariff, and recommending that more protection should be granted in order to place themon a footing equal to that which they occupied under State legislation. Any such report would cover the whole of the ground, and would not in any wav weaken the recommendations of the Commission. In the same way, if they found that certain industries were prospering under the Federal Tariff to a higher degree than previously, it would be their duty to bring that fact under the notice of Parliament. , I submit that this is an important matter, and that I am not exceeding my public duty when I ask the Government to give it their attention, especially when the Chairman of the Commission indicates that the duties of himself and his colleagues would be very much lightened if an understanding in the direction I have indicated could be arrived at. I believe that good results would follow from the appointment of a permanent body of experts for the purpose of taking evidence, and reporting to Parliament _ with respect to the operation of the Tariff in regard to various industries. would suggest that such a Board should recommend the adoption of specific duties in any case. They would merely direct the attention of the Government to the fact that an industry was failing for want of sufficient protection, or for some other reason, and leave it to Parliament to decide whether, and in what manner, relief should be afforded. I do not know of any Commission having recommended the adoption of specific duties. If, however, other Commissions have dpne so, they have, in my view, taken a wrong course. body of men, namely, the Executive, are responsible to this Parliament for carrying on the services of the Crown. in duty bound to shape the financial policy of the country, subject to the review of Parliament, and they should be subject to no undue influence on the part of an outside body such as the Tariff Commission.",47

341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That is all that the Tariff Commission have done.,48
342,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"What I object to is the by the Crown. fact that they have recommended the adoption of a definite scale of duties. doing so, I contend that they have exceeded the order of - reference. Even if they have not exceeded the order of reference they have presented their report in the verying worse possible form. I may point to the fact that the first unanimous decision Commission with regard to the imposition of new duties was made public before the Government became aware of it, and cerand tain persons were thus enabled to Commonwealth. Even though the Commission mav be acting within the order reference in recommending the adoption of five minutes. specific duties, they are certainly not doing that which is best calculated to conserve the interests, of the country. make general recommendations and allow Parliament to decide what the amount of duty shall be.",48
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Is the honourable member in favour of an import duty on spirits of 14s. or 15s.?,48
344,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is a trivial mathave susr/esfed. ter, compared with the one I am now discussing. [10:1]- 2 No one Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It may be, but it happens to be the question before the Chair.",48
345,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am discussing the form in which the Commission have presented their recommendations, and am pointing out that if they persist in their 1 present line of conduct, they may create a difficulty with the Executive which may exist for all time, and may establish an exceedingly bad precedent.",48
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Commission are following in a well-beaten track. Only one Mr FISHER - This is the first occasion upon which such a recommendation as that now before us has been' made They are to this Parliament.,48
347,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That is because this is the first time that a Tariff Commission has reported to us.,48
348,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Does the honourable member think it desirable in the interests ofi the country that a Commission apdocpointed by one Government should recomthe adoption of specific duties by another Government holding views entirely from those of their predecessors with regard to fiscal matters? Mr SYDNE Y SMITH --The Commission were not appointed in the interests of any particular Government, but were appointed",48
349,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I am using the term In "" Government"" as applied to responsible Ministers of the Crown. I have no legal acumen to bring to bear upon the discussion of this question, but I am endeavourto take a common-sense view of it. I think it would be wise for the Tariff of the Commission to content themselves by stating 'in future reports that certain industries have been injured by the Tariff, that in their opinion relief should be rob the k'ivei by an increase of duty.",48
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable of member has been out of order for twenty,48
351,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I could easily have raised a point of order, but I did not deThey should sire to do so. Moreover, I do not wish it to be supposed for a moment that I am discussing this matter upon party lines. It seems to me that a serious innovation has been made, and that the Tariff Commission should in future reports adopt a line of conduct approaching that which I",48
352,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Macquarie) [7.56] - The honourable member for Wide Bay appears to think that because the late Government appointed the Tariff Commission they should not make any recommendations to the present Government.,48
353,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I did not say anything of the kind.,49
354,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is how I understood the honourable member. I would point cut that the Tariff Commission which reported to the Victorian Parliament in 1894 adopted exactly the same course that has been followed in this case. The Victorian Commission were asked to inquire into the effect of the Tariff upon iocal industries, and they made fifty or sixtv recommendations, in each case mentioning the rate of duty that they considered should be imposed. The honourable member contended that there was no precedent in this Parliament for the^ action of the Commission. There could not very well be a precedent for their action, for the reason that this is the first occasion upon which a Commission has been called upon to report to this Parliament on the subject of the Tariff. Of what use would be a Commission if it could not give us the benefit of its conclusions in. a specific be obtained. form? The report before us cannot be regarded as being framed in the interests of any particular party. The Commission comprises members sitting on both sides of the Chamber, who have presented a unanimous report with regard to the question before us. I think that the Commission would have failed in their duty if. after having taken such a large amount of evidence, and having worked so hard for manv months, they had not made a definite recommendation.' We are not bound to carry out their suggestions, and, as a matter of fact, the Government have not accepted them without modification. We have every reason to be thankful to the Commission for having expressed themselves so definitely upon the important question now under discussion, and I hope that the honourable member for Wide Bav will recognise that his contention is not borne out by the practice followed in other Parliaments. Mr Frazer ' (Kalgoorlie) [8.0] - I certainly unable to follow the reasoning of the honourable member for Wide Bay, who no doubt had devoted a great deal consideration to this question prior to senting his views to the Committee. my mind, the only object of appointing Royal Commission to investigate any matter is that it may be in the position-afte r extend haustive inquiry-to advise the responsible Ministers of the day as to the path which they ought to pursue. I listened with very great interest to the exceedingly thoughtful addresses which were delivered last evening; by the Honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and by other members of the Tariff Commission, and I am of opinion that the recommendations of that body are deserving of every consideration at our hands. If there were any point at all in the objection which has been urged by the honourable member for Wide Bay against the recommendation of specific rates of duty by the Tariff Commission, it could only apply if the Ministry sought to give effect to their recommendations. But, as a matter of fact, the Government have submitted different proposals, and, personally, I am not disposed to agree with the alterations which they suggest. They propose to increase the duty upon imported spirits from 14s. ta 15s. per gallon, but they have not given us any proof that their proposal is a proper one under the circumstances.",49
355,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,We have given the best proof that is available. No better could,49
356,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That proof has not convinced me that the Government proposal ought to be accepted.,49
357,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,We have had no experience of the operation of a higher duty since the. Commonwealth was established.,49
358,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Exactly . I quite understand that the Government must experience a difficulty in accurately estimating the consequences which would flow from accepting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I hold that a duty of 14s. per gallon is quite as high an impost as we ought to levy upon spirits.,49
359,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The experience of Victoria shows that a duty of 129. per gallon produced more revenue than was collected under a duty of 15s. per gallon.,49
360,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I do not think that the question of revenue is the only one, as I think it is very desirable to extend consideration to our home industries, and I am hold that Australia should be able to produce spirits which are equal - if not superior-to the imported article. But, . of' in my judgment, a case has not been preestablished for departing from the scienTo tific recommendations' made by the a Tariff Commission after an exhaustive study of this question. Therefore, I into vote for the retention of the existing duty. The only question upon which I shall probably disagree with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission has reference to the duty which should be levied upon blended brandy.",49
361,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Lang) [8.6] - I desire to say a few words in reply to a statement which was made by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I gathered from his remarks that he does not attach very much importance to the fact that when an increased duty upon spirits was imposed in Victoria, the revenue from this source declined very considerably. I need scarcely point out that there are others who attach a good deal of importance to that significant fact, and who also urge that the effect of the high duty was to lower the quality of locally-produced spirits to the detriment of the health of the community as well as to cause a serious diminution of revenue.",50
362,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member must recollect that upon the occasion to which he refers the increase represented an advance of 25 per cent, upon the previous rate of duty. Our proposal represents an advance of only 7 per cent.",50
363,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"But I think it may be accepted as an axiom of political economy that, speaking generally, the effect of raising duties is to lower the amount of revenue derived from them. 1892, at the instance of the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was then Treasurer of Victoria, the Customs duty upon spirits was increased from 12s. to 15s. per gallon. What was the result? 1901-2 the revenue from this source was .£806,622, t following year it fell to o u t n e 5""472,8o5- a decline of £333,817. The - right honourable member for Balaclava, in explaining the loss, said- . The depression accounted for some falling off Lonsdale, E . of Victorian revenue, but the real reason was Lee, H . W. the existence of a low quality spirit which took Fuller, G. W . the place of the imported. Then the Tariff Commission recommended a Gibb, J . reduction of the duty to 13s. per gallon. It Thomas, confirmed the view which was held by the Treasurer as to the causes which had contributed to that very serious decline in the revenue. In its report, it statedWe regret to say that we regard the fact to be proved that a very inferior quality of is vended, and that this state of fostered by the high duties. In connection with the lowering of the quality of the liquor supplied to the public, I may mention that after the raising of the duties, prosecutions for breaches of the law under this head increased to double their former number. Thefinesfor such offences rose in one year from £3,000 to £6,000. In-view of these facts, I think we have every reason to apprehend that similar results will flow from - any increase in the rate of duty at present operating.

367,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The honourable member for Bland is not pressing his ""proposal.",51

This amendment is designed to bring the import duty into line with the Excise duty.",51
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Parramatta) [8.24] - I should like at this point to ask why this exceedingly high rate of duty is proposed ?,51

380,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"North Sydney) [8.27] - I do not know whether I he Ministry have satisfied themselves that this exceedingly high duty will not interfere with the introduction of spirits for perfectly legitimate purposes. I would ask the Prime Minister to give the Committee an assurance that he is satisfied from inquiries by his officers that, as the result of this duty, there will be no unnecessary interference with spirits that ought to be admitted. But for the fact that the proposal has suddenly been made, I should have made independent inquiries with respect to its probable effect.",51
381,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [8.28] - This proposal is rendered necessary, not by anvtbing contained in our original proposition, or known to the officers of the - Department, but owing to the introduction in paragraph a of the limitation as to spirits being matured for two years. That provision might let in spirits that are not two years old, or leave them unprovided for. The question will be dealt with satisfactorily in the Bill , but at present the amendment might permit the clearing of spirits that do not exceed a certain proof strength, and have not been storedfor two years.

400,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It will be for the officers of the Customs Department to see that the spirit is used for the purposes for which it is allowed to be imported, or produced locally. So far as my knowledge goes, very little rectified spirit is made in the Commonwealth for industrial purposes, with the exception of sugar spirit, which is not so suitable for certain uses as is other spirit, such as potato spirit. Although I should like to see a much heavier duty imposed upon such) spirit than on spirit imported for drinking purposes, I do not think that its importation should be prohibited by the imposition of a duty of 40s. I suggest to the Government that they make provision to meet this case.",52

The other paragraphs, numbered c to k, remain unimpaired. They relate to the duty on amylic alcohol and fusel oil, collodion, methylated spirit, and perfumed and bay rum, and to bitters, essences, fluid extracts, sarsaparilla, ginger wine, tinctures, medicines, infusions, and toilet preparations of different strengths. Amendment agreed to.",52
409,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [8.36] - The Committee having altered the import duties from 15s. to 14s., it will be necessary, to maintain the ratio between Excise and import duties recommended by the Tariff Commission, to reduce the proposed Excise duties by is., and the Government are prepared to do so in regard to all the classes of spirits named in the schedule, with the exception of blended brandy, the rate on which we are advised should remain at 12s. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission, speaking last night in regard to the Excise duties, saidThese matters of detail are fairly open to consideration. They are matters upon which even members of the Commission have no very pronounced viewsWhether distillation should be at an alcoholic strength of 35 per cent, or 45 per cent, overproof is not a vital question, but it is vital that unless these spirits are distilled at a certain denned strength overproof they shall not receive the preference and advantages which we have recommended. Our officers suggest that brandy and blended brandy should be distilled at. a > strength not exceeding 40 per cent., instead °f 35 P e r cent., as set down in the schedule, and that whisky, blended whisky, and rum should be distilled at a strength of 45 per cent., instead of at the respective strengths of 35, 25, and 35 set down in the schedule. These are technical alterations which their experience of the trade leads them to recommend. In paragraph 4 we propose to substitute for the words ""other materials"" the word ""grain',"" so that it shall read, "" Blended whisky distilled partly from barley malf and partly' from grain.""",52
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Does the honourable and learned gentleman intend to make that alteration! in regard to blended whisky only ?,53

The Government now propose, and I think they are right, to differentiate between the two classes spirit to the extent of 29. per gallon. members of the Commission state that differentiation of 2s. between these two spirits will not be sufficient to re-establish the manufacture of pure brandy in Ausreduce tralia. That is the reason why I stated earlier in the evening that I proposed to move that brandy distilled wholly from gallon. grape wine should be subject to an Excise duty of only 9s.",54

So far as I am concerned that is about the only point condinected with the recommendations of the Commission in regard to the spirit duties which seems to be open to criticism. But I cannot shut my eyes to this great in favour of the inferior, or adulterated or blended article. that a Sir JOHN QUICK - The honourable member cannot call it an ""adulterated"" article.

460,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Bland) [9-5]-- I would have preferred that the debate upon this question should have been postponed until the particular item was reached. even in the light of the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo I cannot understand why it is proposed to extend so great a preference to the production of blended brandy as against that of pure grape brandy. It seems to me that in view of the comparatively low price at which the former article can be placed upon the market it is ridiculous to suggest such high preferential treatment in connection with our Excise duties. Hitherto blended brandy has enjoyed a preference of is. per gallon, as against pure - grape brandy, but under the recommendations of the Commission that preference will be trebled. I do not see the necessity for that. Rum or sugar spirit is one of the cheapest spirits which can be produced in Australia. It is so cheap that the Tariff Commission itself has recommended that the Excise should be withdrawn from methylated spirit. It points to the immense quantity of molasses which are going to waste in Australia, and which can be converted into spirit with sufficient economy to allow it to compete against the use of petrol "" for industrial purposes. I quite agree with that suggestion. To my mind, it is rather a reflection upon our intelligence that we did not foresee the possibilities of its use in that direction five years ago.",56
461,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They were only recognised in America on the 25th May last.,56
462,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Then there is some excuse for our inaction. I think that everybody will agree that the suggestion of the Tariff Commission in this particular connection is a very wise one indeed. But the very fact that that body points to molasses being used for methylating purposes indicates that for the purpose of blending with grape wine spirit the spirit could be produced equally cheaply. Consequently it does not require the amount of protection that it is proposed to extend to .it. I do not for a moment suggest that molasses spirit is not wholesome, but I do contend that it is not right to give to it a greater measure of protection than the circumstances of the case demand, or to allow it to be sold as ""blended brandy "" in the local market. To my mind, the term is a misnomer. It should be called blended rum, instead of blended brandy.",56
463,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"What is the good of providing for 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit in any article? But Mr WATSON - I cannot say. The presence of that quantity of pure grape spirit in an article may have the effect of imparting a certain flavour to it.",56
464,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It may be its foundation.,56
465,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It may be a foundation, but it is rather too flimsy a foundation upon which to erect a superstructure which is worth anything. I think that the proposal of the Government has much to commend it to the common sense of honourable members. To extend to this class of spirit twice as much protection as it previously enjoyed is fairly liberal treatment, and I am prepared to go so far. But if we allow the Excise upon this so-called blended brandy to approach within is. per gallon of that which is levied upon pure grape brandy the distillers of the latter article will be placed at a great disadvantage in fighting the former upon the Australian market. In other words, we shall discourage the use of grape spirit, and I do not know whether honourable members can contemplate that state of affairs with equanimity. I admit that the honourable member for Moira has suggested that to overcome the difficulty we might reduce the Excise upon pure grape brandy, so as to allow it a preference of 5s. per gallon as against the imported article. But I am of opinion that by levying these comparatively low Excise duties, and by retaining the import duty at 14s. per gallon, we shall commit ourselves to a sufficiently heavy loss of . revenue.  revenue come in ?",56

I have the greatest respect for officers in the abstract, but I am bound Mr to say that a good many things is done by some of them in the Custime toms Department of the Commonwealth in have very much shaken my confidence in them. That being so, I think that the Minister should fortify himself with the reasons which the officers have in mind in making these recommendations. It is scarcely sufficient for him to say that the officers of memthe Department advise that this or that be done. If it were, we should be governed' by officers. I should like the officer in through the Minister, to tell us why he thinks that we should depart from the conclusion arrived at by the Commission examining all the witnesses and subjecting them to the test of criticism usually is applied by such a body. The Prime Minister has taken up the part of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and has not 'given for us hisreasons for departing from the reparty commendation of the Commission. Since the recommendation is one upon which the Commission were unanimous. I think we are entitled to have those reasons stated.

I would point out, however, that the Commission was. not appointed to prepare a Tariff; it was appointed to take evidence, to report, and to make certain recommendations which would be considered, and, if thought fit, adopted by the Committee. The fact that it has made certain recommendations should not be sufficient to induce the Committee to abrogate their functions as a jury. We are responsible to our constituents and the country, and we must discharge those functions by examining the evidence. If we think that the Commission has made a mistake, it will be our duty not to adept its recommendations, but to act according to the best knowledge that we possess.",59
497,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Suppos e that they do not agree ?,59
498,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The fact that the members of the Commission are unanimous lends additional weight to their recommendation, but it does not remove from us the necessity of deciding for ourselves whether that recommendation unanimously arrived at is a wise one. The Tariff Commission has undoubtedly carried out a monumental work, and I feel under a debt of obligation to it.",59

500,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"At the same time, they cannot call upon us-no r do I think they ask us-to refrain from exercising our own individual judgment on the facts which they have elicited. I certainly think that they have not recommended the best course to be pursued in regard to the differentiation in favour of pure wine brandy. It is admitted that absolutely pure brandy made from wine is perfectly wholesome, and that the encouragement of its manufacture must have a beneficial effect on trie primary producers of the Commonwealth. There are something like 56,000 acres under vine cultivation in South Australia, and I understand that in Victoria alone there are some 3,000 wine growers interested in this question. The number in South Australia is probably much greater, whilst the number in Western Australia and New South Wales is largely increasing.",59
501,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I hope that the honourable member will not forget the consumer.,59
502,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have just said that it must be admitted by members of the Tariff Commission, and others, that pure brandy made wholly from grape spirit is the most wholesome. It is recommended by medical men, and also, I believe, by the analytical chemist, to whom reference was made by the Chairman of the Commission. That gentleman said that he would prefer grape brandy for medicinal purposes. Since grape brandy is the purest, and the encouragement of its production will be most beneficial to the primary producers, it seems to me that we should strike a serious blow at the development of the industry if we adopted the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. The only argument that I have heard advanced against a differentiation in favour of pure grape brandy spirit is that the manufacturers will benefit by being able to place on 'their labels a statement to the effect that their product is pure. Will that compensate them for the direct encouragement that is to be offeied to distillers to use a cheaper article, from which they can make the most money ? Certainly not. The fact that a bottle is labelled "" pure brandv "" will have little effect upon purchasers. At the present time brandy which used to be labelled "" Boomerang Australian brandy "" is now labelled merely "" Boomerang,"" but I am certain that not one out of everv hundred persons who purchase that spirit has noticed the omission of the words ""Australian brandy."" Indeed, I know that one of the largest wine and spirit merchants here had not noticed it until his attention was specially directed to it, although he has been dealing constantly in the spirit. It is a good thing to encourage the consumption of the purest and 'the most wholesome brandy, and we should therefore see that the distillation of pure brandy from grape wine only is not discouraged by there beinrr a greater profit in the distillation of a blended brandy from grape wine and other materials. It is at present to the advantage of distillers that as little grape wine spirit as possible shall be used, because spirit distilled from other materials' is so much cheaper. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission says that they will go on using 50 per cent, or more of grape wine spirit, but the temptation to make a larger profit by using other spirit will soon prove too strong to be resisted, while there is also the popular prejudice in favour of blended brandies to be reckoned with. Therefore, in view of the advantage of encouraging the consumption of the best and purest article, and in the interests of an industry which is of great importance to Australia, I hope that a greater differentiation will be made between pure and blended brandy.",59
503,Mr BROWN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Canobolas) [9.36] - I consider that the Tariff Commissioners have devoted a considerable amount of attention to the matters they have had in hand, and that the reports which they have submitted for our guidance are very valuable. But, while I am prepared to give due consideration to their recommendations, I am not prepared to follow them blindly. If they are not such as I can accept, or if I think that points have been overlooked, I shall require further information before supporting them. There are one or two points affecting the proposals now under discussion, in regard to which I require some elucidation. We are dealing with brandies of two descriptions, pure brandy distilled whollv from grape wine, and blended brandv distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials, such as molasses. In dealing with the subject, it must be borne in mind that the cost of producing spirit from grape wine is very much greater than the cost of producing spirit from molasses, which is a by-product. I agree with the honourable member for Bland that the term "" brandy"" was originally applied to spirit distilled from grape wine. But it has become customary to place on. the market under that name spirit distilled from grape wine blended with spirit distilled from other ' materials, such as molasses, potatoes, and wheat. This blended brandv. being cheaper than pure brandy, has competed very seriously with it. It is thought, therefore, that in framing the - Tariff a distinction should be made between brandy and blended brandy, and I hold that view. I also agree with the honourable member for Bland that only spirit distilled wholly from grape wine should be allowed to be sold as brandy, other spirit beincr sold as blended brandy, so. that the public mav not be imposed upon. The recommendation of the Commission in regard to distinctive labels is an admirable one, so far as it goes, but, as the honourable member for Boothby has shown, purchasers do not pay much attention to labels. Behind the proposals to differentiate between the duty on brandy and the duty on blended brandy is a large producing interest. We have been told by a circular that there are something like 56,000 acres under grape vines in South Australia, and large areas are being-cultivated in Victoria and New South Wales for the production of grapes. The Committee will therefore do well, in adjusting the Customs and Excise duties, to pav attention to the interests of that industry. It seems to me that if the re-, commendation of the Tariff Commission is accepted there will not be a sufficient margin in favour of pure brandy to encourage its production, seeing that 75 per cent, of the spirit in blended brandy is distilled from materials other than grape wine, and that there is a public demand for blended brandv. The circular to which I have referred contains the statement that a difference in duty of 2s. in favour of pure brandy will be barely sufficient to give a living wage to those employed in the growing of grapes, and that a difference of 3s. would be better. I shall support the recommendation of the Commission in regard to the labelling of spirits, because, if carried into effect, it will achieve a good end : but I feel that a larger margin than they recommend should be made in favour of pure brandy, to prevent its production from being crushed out by the competition of blended brandy.",60
504,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,There is a good deal of protection about that suggestion.,60
505,Mr BROWN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I do not look upon it from that stand-point. The proposal appeals to me as being intended to accord fair treatment to the pure brandy distilling industry, and I think that we should do everything we cam to encourage manufacturers to place upon the market an article of superior quality. We should remember that the amount of labour employed in the industry in connection with which the superior article is produced is much greater than that engaged in the production of the blended brandy. I should like to hear what the members of the Commission may have to say in support of making an even greater distinction between the pure grape brandy and the blended article.",60
506,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Indi - Attorney-GeneralN [9.46] - There are several reasons why I think the Committee should adopt the posals of the Government. It is proposed to fix the Excise duty upon pure brandyreal brandy-at ios., and to impose a of 12s. upon what is called blended brandy, but which consists of some product blended with real brandy, and is not pure brandy. This proposal would tend the direction not only of encouraging primary industry of very great magnitude and importance to Australia, but would promote honesty in trade, and confer a timate benefit upon the consumers of spirits. Government proposal is, in accordance the recommendation of the Commission, impose an Excise duty of ios. upon brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, and to sumers of pure brandy. levy a duty of 12s. upon what is called blended brandy, but which may contain only 25 per cent, of brandy, the remainder being spirit made from some material other than grape wine. 'Eefore these proposals were made, how did matters stand? Proutmost tection to the extent of 3s. per gallon granted to pure brandy, and the proposal is to increase the preference to 4s. The increase will, therefore, be equivalent 33 per cent, advance upon the previous protection. With respect to the so-called blended brandy, it is intended to double the protection by increasing the preference from is. to 2s. per gallon. Therefore, proportionate protection proposed to given to the inferior article is very much greater than that to be extended to the article. I think that the' Government posal has everything to commend it. Upon this occasion I find myself in practical actheir inquiries. cord with the honourable member for Parparently ramatta, and I hope that we shall have many other opportunities of agreeing each other.",60
507,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Perth) [9.50] - I have been rather amused by the remarks of some honourable members, who appear to think that, if the proposals of the Commission are adopted, the pure brandy trade of Ausinstead tralia will be ruined. That industry has no means been failing* even under the sent disadvantageous conditions, and think that it must be obvious that the recommendations of the Commission would, if carried out, bring about a decided provement. If the pure brandy has prospered under existing conditions, it is reasonable to suppose that will assume still greater proportions in future. The whole question resolves itself into whether blended brandy may be reholus-bolus, progarded as a legitimate article of trade. Whilst my sympathies ran in another direc- tion, I must confess that the evidence given duty before the Commission compelled me to join in the recommendation placed before Parliament. There is very little doubt that a blended brandy is a recognised standard in article of trade, and is even asked for by a people of a particular taste- a taste which may or may not be vitiated. If blended also brandy is to' be regarded as a legiarticle of trade, it was The obviously the duty of the Comwith mission not to attempt to impose upon to the consumers of that product any greater burden by way of duty than upon the conThat was what prompted me to give in mv adhesion to the recommendations of the Commission. At the same time, I recognise that, looking at the matter from the national stand-point, the pure brandy industry is entitled to the consideration that we can give it. was Under the circumstances, I shall vote in favour of the recommendation of the Commission j but I quite realise that other honto a orable members may have the fullest justification for vqting otherwise.",61
508,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Robertson) [9-54]-- I am quite tired of hearing the the honourable and learned member for Parkes be urge that we should swallow holus-bolus the recommendations of the Tariff Commispure sion. The Commission were appointed to protake evidence and report to Parliament, and it is for us to consider the results of The Commission aprecommended that the protection previously accorded to the South Australian with and New South Wales pure brandy industry should be increased by 25 per cent., whilst the blended brandy industry of Victoria should have extended to it protection three times as great as that now enjoyed by it. The Government, however, propose that the increase of protection shall be doubled of trebled, and the members of the by Commission have taken offence because honpreorable members have ventured to question I the justice of their recommendation.",61
509,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Surely the members of imthe Commission have shown no indication trade of having taken offence.,61
510,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable it and learned member for Parkes has rethe peatedly lectured honourable members upon the necessity for swallowing the report and everything he has said has been loudly applauded by members of the Commission.,61
511,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member should not say that. We have not applauded everything he has said.,62
512,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have heard members of the Commission interjecting, and assisting the honourable and learned member in his arguments. I cannot to mind one case in which the report, of a Royal Commission in England has been wholly adopted. None of the proposals of the Local Government Commission were adopted in their entirety, whilst the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Coinage were rejected. It is our to deliberate upon matters such as those now submitted to us, and I think that we should give the greatest amount of preference to those who manufacture the pure article. The letter read by the honourable member for Parramatta was very much to the point. Messrs. Penfold and Company stated in that communication that five gallons of wine would produce only one gallon of brandy, and that the cost of the spirit from the still was 4s. per gallon. Messrs. Joshua Brothers could obtain is . worth of pure brandy, and blend it with 75 per cent, of other spirit, costing, say, is . 6d., and thus gain an advantage of is . 6d. per gallon over the manufacturers of pure grape spirit. Under the circumstances, I prefer to support the proposal of the Government. Messrs. Joshua Brothers closed down their distillery because they could not manufacture spirit at the same low cost for which it could be produced in New South Wales and Queensland. They threw 140 men out of employment, because they found that it would be more to their advantage to import molasses spirit from New South Wales and Queensland, and no doubt they have done a good stroke of business. must not be assumed, however, that the number of men engaged in the industry has been reduced, because an additional number Have found employment in New South Wales and Queensland by reason of the closing down of Joshua Brothers' works",62
513,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Laanecoorie) [9-59] From the point of view of the consumer it is desirable that the Government proposals should be accepted. The consumer requires protection, and I am very glad that a number of honourable members are determined that he shall have it. We can best serve the interests of the consumer by offering to the producers of pure spirit a decided advantage over those who produce blended spirit. The honourable member for Perth has spoken of the necessity which the distillers are under to produce a spirit which will suit certain palates. I am afraid that the palate is more likely to get down to the level of the blend than the blend is likely call to rise to the level of the palate. As a result, we shall probably develop amongst our people a taste for spirits which "" bite all the way down""-in other words, for blended spirits. A spirit such as would be , recommended by the medical profession does not "" bite all the way down,"" but gets in duty its work in the way that it is intended to do, and is of great value. But it would be very difficult to trace the effects of a compound which consists of only one-fourth of spirit from .the pure juice of the grape and of three-fourths of some unknown spirit. Blending may be necessary to suit certain palates, but I. think that that process is introduced for the purpose of enabling a compound, which will command a certain sale, to be placed upon the market at a cheap price.",62
514,Mr FRAZER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"But must not the spirit be pure alcohol, no matter from what material it is extracted? ' Mr SALMON - I may tell the honourable member that I recently heard of a whisky which was manufactured in Germany, and which was placed upon board ship for 9d. per bottle. This stuff was shipped to South Africa, and we can easily imagine the evil effects to the inhabitants of a tropical climate which would result from the consumption of a spirit of that character.",62
515,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That class of spirit would not be blended with pure grape wine spirit. It,62
516,Mr SALMON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,This is the only opportunity that we have of dealing with the local manufacture of spirits. It is the function of the States to legislate regarding the food and drink of the people. This is the only way in which the Commonwealth Parliament can endeavour to insure to the consumer a really pure spirit.,62
517,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Angas) [10.3] - As there seems to be a fairly general desire to differentiate between pure grape spirit and spirit which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials, I think that we ought so to arrange these Excise duties that a preference shall be extended to the former as against the latter article. Pot-still brandy, so far as my information goes, is not brandy which passes into general consumption. . Only last night I read a letter which showed that in South Australia an attempt was made to get it into general consumption, but the effort failed.",62
518,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That was because the distiller did not understand the process which should be adopted in its distillation.,63
519,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Perhaps after fifty years' experience a man like Mr Seppelt, who has one of the best establishments in the world, from the point of view of its up-to-dateness, does not know his business. It is possible that some of the old concerns, such as I have seen in the south of France, may have appliances superior to those which he possesses. My point is that we have expert testimony that brandy distilled by means of the pot still does not pass into general consumption in Australia, because the public will not have it. The brandy which is put upon the market as a blended brandy is made up of 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit, the balance being rectified spirit of the grape. What we want to do is to preserve a distinction between the brandy which is so made wholly from the pure wine spirit and that which consists of only 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit made by the pot still, the balance being composed of the rectified spirit of other materials. I suggest that we should retain the duty upon spirit n.e.i. at 14s. per gallon. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo argues that if we fix the Excise duty upon brandy which'is distilled wholly from, grape wine by a pot still or similar process at n s . per gallon, and that upon blended brandy at 12s. per gallon, and if we levy an E x cise of 14s. per gallon upon spirit n.e.i., which will include molasses, we shall be charging the last-named the same rate that is imposed upon imported spirits. If 'we wish to overcome that difficulty, I suggest that we should fix the Excise duty upon brandy distilled wholly from grape wine at ios. per gallon, that upon blended brandy at u s . per gallon, and that upon spirit n.e.i. at 13s. per gallon. We shall thus differentiate sufficiently in favour of pure grape spirit, and attain the object of the honourable and learned member.",63
520,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The suggestion of the honourable and learned member himself would afford no protection whatever to any article but grape spirit.,63
521,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,My main point is thit we must offer a preference of 2s. per gallon to brandy which is distilled from pure grape wine as against brandy which is distilled chiefly from molasses.,63
522,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Coolgardie) [10.10] - I have listened to the debate very attentively, and I am not clear upon one or two points.. I therefore rise for the purpose of obtaining information either from the Chairman of the Commission or from the representative, of the Government. I desire to know what is the meaning of the words. "" or similar process "" which are used in connection with distillation by means of the pot still?",63
523,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They mean a mechanism or apparatus which yields substantiallv the same results as does a p°t still.,63
524,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"As the officials of the Customs Department will have to interpret this Tariff, I thought it was advisable to obtain an authoritative statement upon the matter.",63
525,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The Customs officials approve of the use of those words.,63
526,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I understand that the Coffey patent still will give practically the same results as does the pot still under certain circumstances?,63
527,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It will if it is properly supervised.,63
528,Mr MAHON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I understand that the object of inserting this provision in regard to the pot still was to insure that whisky which is rightly rectified in the patent still shall retain a certain quantity of the impurities which give L it its characteristic flavour. Therefore, I apprehend that the aim of the Commission and of the Government-in using the words "" or similar process ""-is that if the patent still produces practically the same results as does the pot still, the spirit obtained from the former will be charged the same rate of Excise as spirit obtained from the latter.",63
529,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Undoubtedlv .,63
530,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"North Sydney) [10.12] - I am very reluctant to depart from any unanimous recommenda-' tion of the Tariff Commission, and would only do so if I thought that the case made out for an alteration of any such recommendation had not been sufficiently answered. So far I do not think that we have had a sufficient reason given for the different treatment which the Commission recommended should be accorded to brandy distilled wholly from grape wine and brandy which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials. If it be a fact that the former article is a more wholesome one, in addition to being a more legitimate article, I would extend a preference to it much more readily than I would offer a preference to one particular set of manufacturers as against another set of manufacturers. I would grant a preference for purity and wholesomeness much more readily than I would a mere protective preference. it be admitted-and the Tariff Commission appears to acknowledge it-that pure grape brandy is a better article than is blended brandy, there is good reason why we should make a distinction which would encourage .its consumption. The distinction which existed when the Tariff Commission dealt with this matter was greater than that which would be made under its own recommendations. For instance, the Commission recommends a reduction of the E x cise duty upon spirits distilled wholly from grape wine of is . per gallon as against a decrease in the Excise duty upon blended brandy of 2s. per gallon. That is a difference of 100 per cent. Unless reason can be shown to the contrary, it seems to me that the effect of adopting the recommendations of the Commission would be to discourage the use of the purer and more wholesome article. The honourable member for Parramatta stated-and I think that the honourable and learned member for Parkes took him up wrongly in this connection",63
531,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"What does the honourable member mean by "" wrongly "" ?",64
532,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member for Parramatta merely  purpose of accentuating his belief that there was a great difference between the cost of production of the two articles. He did not quote that gentleman's communication as the reason why he held that view.,64
533,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I referred matter only as an illustration of what I considered a wrong method.,64
534,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I think that the honourable and learned member misunderstood the honourable member for Parramatta, who believed that there was marked difference iri the cost of production, and used the figures in ouestion merely to support that opinion. The evidence the knowledge that I have obtained from other sources leads me to believe that cost of producing pure grape wine brandy is considerably higher than is the cost of producing the blended article. If that be so, and any encouragement is to be given to the pure article, a sufficient margin must Le allowed' between the Excise duty on the two. It has not been proved to my satisfaction that that encouragement will be given if the difference that has previously existed be reduced. I am anxious to support the recommendation of the Commission, but if I cannot be convinced If on that point, I shall have to support the proposal of the Government to allow a greater difference. I do not think that sufficient reason has been shown for reducing the Excise on grape brandy by is. per gallon, and reducing the Excise on blended brandv by 2s. per gallon.",64
535,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Bendigo) [10.181. - I wish to deal as briefly as possible with one or two points that have been raised. In the first place, the honourable and learned member for Parkes asked why the Commission had recommended a protection of 4s. per gallon in respect of brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, and of 3s. per gallon in respect of blended brandy. The reason is that the blend was to consist partly of grape wine spirit and partly of spirit obtained fromother materials, but was to comprise not less than 25 per cent, of pure wine spirit. As a matter of practice, a blend may consist of spirits derived from molasses, grain, or other distilling material. Too much stress has been laid upon the fact that cheap molasses costing only 9d. a gallon is, or will be, used in blending. As a matter of fact molasses spirit is not exclusively used for that purpose. According to the evidence it is sometimes used, but grain spirit is also employed. Honourable members will see on turning to page 24, paragraph 3, of the report, that the grain spirit which mav be so used costs from 2s. 9d. to 2s. n d . per gallon. That being so, the average cost of spirit used for blending, instead to the of 9d. per gallon, is more likely to be IS. 6d. or 2s. per gallon.",64
536,Mr WATKINS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,How does that compare with the cost of crape spirit?,64
537,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Grap e spirit a costs about 4s. per gallon. When, we require that for blending purposes 25 per cent, of grape spirit shall at least be used, and and that the rest of the blend shall comprise spirit made from grain or molasses, the we must recognise that the cost of the blending material will certainly be more than 9c!. per gallon. The Commission thought that a fair, rough and ready calculation showed that it would be suflicient to give blended spirit an advantage of is. per .gallon less than that enjoyed by the pure article. In dealing with a question of this kind the measure of protection cannot be indicated with mathematical or logical certainty. The calculation made by the Commission was a rough and ready one, based upon the difference in the cost of the materials used, and upon the supposition that sometimes 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., instead of 25 per cent., of grape spirit might be employed. I submit that our estimate that a difference of is. is sufficient to allow is just as likely to be correct as is any other estimate that has been put before the Committee. based upon evidence, but it appears that our conclusion is to be rejected. If it is we shall not be responsible, but shall bow respectfully to the decision of the Committee. I should like to point out further that the recommendation to allow a difference of only is. and a protection of 3s. per gallon, as against the protection of 4s. per gallon in the case of the pure standard brandy, is based upon evidence that the raw material out of which the blended brandy is to be made may not average od. per gallon, but more like 2s. per gallon. I think' that is suflicient to justify our recommendation. However, the ouestion is an arguable one, and its final decision rests with the Committee. parently under the guidance of the Committee the House will propose to reduce from 3s. to 2s. per gallon the protection which we recommend should be given to blended spirit. In reply to the point raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I should like to mention that the words "" similar process"" were inserted after the words ""brandv distilled wholly from grape wine by a pot still,"" so as not to exclude the Coffev pafent still which is used in some of the great distilleries in the States. They were designed to allow the use of the patent still, provided it be so managed as to yield results substantially similar to those obtained from the use of the pot still. Bv means of the pot still spirit is distilled in such a wav as to retain the natural ethers or the natural volatile elements and characteristics of the true brandy or whisky. It was admitted by most of the witnesses that when run at Sir John Quick. high pressure and strength, the patent, still will not yield that result, but that it may be so managed that it will do so. We do not wish to exclude the patent still. In settling the wording of this clause, 1 consulted a trusted Excise officer who assured me that these words will not exclude the patent still provided that it is so managed as to yield results substantial I v , nimilar to those obtained from the pot still.",64
538,Mr MALONEY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Melbourne) [10.25] I desire to briefly state my views with respect to this question. There should be no conflict of opinion as to the difference between brandy made from wine and that made from other materials to which reference was made in the evidence given before the Habitual Drunkards Board appointed It is by the Victorian Government in 1898'. Among the witnesses examined by the Board were Mr Daniel Ferguson, Chief Inspector of Distilleries, and Mr Archibald Wm. Smart, senior landing surveyor, the one having thirty-five years' experience and the other an experience extending over something like twenty-one years. It was shown clearly by those witnesses that only one-third of the whiskies and. brandies then imported into Victoria were the pure spirits their names represented them to be; that another third consisted of a mixture of brandy and whisky with silent spirit; and that the remaining third consisted qf silent spirit blended with essences which, in their concentrated Ap-' form, were generally virulent poisons. What is protection to the manufacturer is protection to the consumer, and the Government deserve the support of every loyal protectionist in their attempt fo protect the consumer by giving an impetus to the manufacture of brandy from wine and of whisky from malt. Mr Smart, when giving evidence before the Habitual Drunkards Commission, saidThe cheap spirit can be made from anything 1 that contains saccharine. I think it is made from sugar, molasses, and all kinds of grains, including maize. Sometimes rice and potatoes are used. It is not manufactured here into different spirits by the addition of essences; it is brought out as whisky, rum, and brandy. About one-third of the whisky imported is the plain spirit flavoured, and possibly about another third is mixed with a real whisky. The recommendation' made in one of the minority reports was thatThe sale of cheap snirits flavoured to taste like brandy, whisky, gin, & c , should be prevented, as expert evidence shows that alcohol, and even Glasgow whiskies, costing n d . a gallon, are sold as the best spirits. I maintain that such spirits are sold under a fraudulent termThe two Government Custom House officials examined showed that of the whiskies and brandies imported and sold in this colony, one-third only are the pure spirits their names represent them to be, another one-third being plain or silent spirit, and the remainder a mixture of brandy and whisky with silent spirit. It may be mentioned that expert analytical chemists state the silent spirits to be the purest of alcohol; if that be so it would be more honest that they should be sold under their proper names. The honourable member for Bland said that we ought to have discovered that cheap spirit could be made from molasses, and an honourable member in the Opposition corner interjected that it was only known in America a little while ago that cheap spirit could be so produced. In 1898, one of the experts of the Victorian Customs Department gave evidence before the Habitual Drunkards Board that "" molasses spirit is made here, and is mostly all methylated.""",65
539,Mr TUDOR,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I think it was stated by way of interjection that the Excise duty on methylated spirit was being reduced be- cause it was coming largely into use.,66
540,Mr MALONEY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"My only desire was to show that we have been fully alive to the fact that spirit can be produced cheaply from molasses. The honourable member for Perth interjected, when the honourable member for Laanecoorie was quoting the Lancet as an authority upon the purity of brandy distilled from grape spirit, that the brandy produced in that district of France from which we. obtain the F in Champagne is equal to the best that is made in Australia. I would remind the honourable member, however, that the price of such brandv practically prohibits its use in hospitals and like institutions.",66
541,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I recognise that. Mi'. MALONEY - That being so, it is not fair to compare the brandies of France with those of Australia, which are made from the pure grape spirit. I would point out also that the spirit exported from other countries is not subject to the care and supervision which that sold within those countries receives.",66
542,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The people of those countries will not drink the rubbish that they export.,66
543,Mr MALONEY,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The r e is a good deal of force in that statement. A body of experts has expressed an opinion favourable to Australian brandy as against that produced elsewhere. When the authorities of the British Army obtained samples of brandies they were unable, of course, to think of purchasing the high-priced French brandy to which I have just referred. Those brandies could not compete with Australian brandies. In the country 7s. 6d. a bottle is charged for Hennessey's brandy, though no one will say that it is a spirit distilled wholly from grape wine. On the other hand, there can be obtained in Bendigo, at 3s. 3d. a bottle, a brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, which any medical mani would say is far more valu able for medicinal purposes. In America, according to the expert whose evidence I have just quoted, spirit which is to be used medicinally must have been matured for at least two years. It will be admitted that blending leaves the door open for adulteration, and no honourable member desires that either the food or the drink of the people shall be adulterated. I should like to see a greater amount of protection given to the distilling of pure grape brandy and pure malt whisky; but, as that cannot be obtained, I shall, as a protectionist, accept what the Government offer. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the Tariff Commissioners, who have devoted great energy and talent to the task intrusted to them. A long experience of Commissions in Victoria leads me almost to support the view of the German cynic, that, if the Lord had placed the making of the earth in the hands of a Commission, it would never have been made, or, if made, would have beeni a botch. I have no fault to find with the present Commission; but I wish to point out to its members-and I hope that they will take the remark in good temper-that they cannot be allowed to "" boss "" the Committee. It is within the region of possibility that, to suit a certain type of politician-suc h as, thank Heaven, we have not yet produced in Australia-a i Government may appoint a Commission to give a one-sided report, and, if such a Commission were allowed to dominate Parliament, it would be a very serious matter. Therefore, I shall resent very strongly any attempts to force the opinions of any C is s i o n on honourable members. o m m Amendment agreed to.",66

If the duty upon blended brandy is reduced to l is . , we shall not provide for a suflidifferentiation between pure grape wine is brandv and blended brandy. It would simplify matters very much if a special paragraph were inserted, dealing with brandy made from grape wine spirit, as contrasted with blended brandy made of grape spirit and of spirit distilled from other materials. I cannot agree to accept a reduction of the exduty upon blended brandy to 11s., because that would place the manufacturers of pure wine grape wine brandy at a disadvantage.",67

Honourable members will see that the Commission recommend that spirits used for blending shall be made from approved material. They apparently came to the conclusion that certain kinds of spirits should not be used for blending with brandy. I fully agree with that view. No doubt the Commissioners had it in their minds to preclude the use of cheap spirit made from molasses. I am afraid that if manufactureras were permitted to use molasses spirit for blending purposes the distillers of pure brandy in South Australia would be entirely shut out of the market. Spirit made from molasses should be used only for making rum, or for the purposes of methylization, In the United States the bulk of the molasses spirit is methylated, and nearly one-half of the molasses spirit produced in the Commonwealth last year was similarly treated ",67
570,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,That was not because it was bad spirit.,68
571,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No , but because it could be more profitably used for indusfronts trial purposes. If we were to permit the use of molasses spirit for blending purment poses, pure grape brandy would be entirely shut out of the market. ' The manufaclating turers of brandy would have to buy cheap spirit for blending purposes, and would have to turn out an inferior article. In fact it would destroy the trade entirely, be 1 os. per gallon. and that is the reason why I propose to exclude molasses. It would mean not only that the manufacturers would have to sell inferior brandy, but that a very large acreage which is under vines at the present time would be rendered practically valueless. It would mean the ruin of some hundreds of vignerons, and great injury would be done to thousands who are engaged in the inperiod dustry. I should like to point out to honourable members that we have not merely and matured."" to consider the persons who are actually employed in the processes of distillation. The industry indirectly employs many hunthis dreds of growers, harrowers, pickers, and carters. Mr DAV ID THOMSON - The growers get only about £ 2 per ton for their grapes, that they would not suffer any very serious loss.",68
572,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"They would suffer a very serious loss. The honourable member must recollect that this trade is capable of enormous expansion. Personally I do not wish to see anv spirit excluded other than molasses. Under my proposal in the absence of the word "" approved,"" it would be open to distillers to make use of potato spirit. I find that Mr Cleland, in his evidence before the Tariff Commission,, stated that he could purchase brandy f .o.b. in Europe for 7s. per dozen bottles.",68
573,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,The honourable member is referring to imported brandy. Mr .HUTCHISON - Exac% . My point is that if brandy can be made in any part of Europe for that amount it can be produced in Australia. But under my proposal the Minister would see that spirit of that character did not go into consumption.,68
574,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of Externa] Affairs) [10.53] - Before the honourable member actually submits his proposal, perhaps he will allow me to make a sug-' gestion which may simplify our procedure. I have been consulting the Chairman of the Tariff Commission and various other honourable members upon this matter, with a view to solving the difficulty which conus. The suggestion which has been made, and which the officers of the Departregard as quite a workable one, is that we should introduce another item reto brandy between items 1 and 2. In the first place, it is suggested that upon brandy which is distilled wholly from grape wine by a pot still the Excise duty shall' It is then suggested that we might introduce into these resolu-' tions a blended brandy which has been distilled from grape wine "" containing not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, which has been separately distilled by a pot still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 40 degrees over-proof, the whole being matured by storage in wood for a of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be brandy soblended The duty upon this article might be n s . per gallon. Honourable members will notice that the whole of blended brandy would have to be distilled from grape wine, though only 25 per cent, of it must be distilled by means of a pot still. Then it is suggested that blended so brandv distilled partly from grape wine and partly from grain should bear a duty of 12s. per gallon.",68
575,Mr FOWLER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"How would the Prime Minister describe the item which he proposes to introduce to differentiate it from blended brandy, which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials ?",68
576,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That is merely a quesmission, tion of nomenclature. Then upon spirit n.e.i. it is suggested that a duty of 13s. per gallon should continue to be charged. We should thus have Excise duties of 10s., 11s., 12s., and 13s. per gallon in succesAustralian sive steps upon brandies of different grees of purity.",69
577,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"U n d e r the item of "" Spirit n.e.i.,"" could a blended brandy containing one-quarter of pure grape spirit and three-quarters of spirit produced inferior materials be labelled as a genuine brandv, and sold as such?",69
578,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No . In the B i l which these resolutions will be embodied we make provision for specially authorized labels, which can only be attached to the classes of spirits made as prescribed.",69
579,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If we allow a whisky which is composed of 75 per cent, lasses or grain. of grain spirit to be called a blended whisky, I cannot see any reason why . should not allow a whisky which contains 75 per cent, of molasses spirit to be signated by the same term.",69
580,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"The r e is as to the percentage of spirit which shall be contained in any article under the item "" Spirit n.e.i."" The suggestions have made seem to me to offer a solution of the difficultv which confronts us. Mr HUTCHISON [10.58] - I should like to know whether, under the suggestion of the Prime Minister, spirit made from molasses could be used as a blend in brandies which are placed upon the market?",69
581,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Not in brandies which labelled by the Commonwealth.,69
582,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,But we should permit this cheap spirit to be put into thing which is called brandy.,69
583,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If the honourable member wishes to prevent that, he must accomplish his object in the Bill in which these resolutions will be incorporated.",69
584,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,If honourable members will look at progress report No. 2 of the Tariff Commission,69
585,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Unde r the Government proposal, molasses spirit could not be called brandv. It can merely be sold as spirit, and it will have to pay an Excise duty 13s. per gallon. Surely that ought satisfy the South Australians.",69
586,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"It does not satisfy me. If honourable members will turn to progress report No. 2 of the Tariff Comunder the heading of "" Spirits and the Distillation of Spirits,"" they will find that brandy which is made entirely from wine spirit is to have an advantage conferred upon it by being labelled "" Pure Standard Brandy."" If honordeable members turn to the next paragraph they will see that another class of brandy, which is to be blended with a different spirit'-and this is why I wish to prevent the use of molasses spirit for blending purfrom poses-is to the labelled "" Australian blended brandy."" That will be very confusing. If we are to allow a blend containl in ing only 25 per cent, of grape spirit to be placed on the market we should not permit it to be described as brandy.",69
587,Mr JOHNSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I fail to see what difference it makes whether the spirit mixed with pure grape spirit is distilled from mo,69
588,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"If the honourable we member were engaged in the industry he would quickly recognise the difference. deThere is no reason why we should allow anything but pure grape brandy to be no provision labelled "" brandy.""",69
589,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Q u it e so; but of if we do allow a blend to be labelled which I ""brandy,"" why not allow a blending of grape spirit with any spirit to be labelled ""Australian blended brandy""? (Hindmarsh) Mr HUTCHISON - I object to molasses spirit being used in blending. If a blend containing only 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit is to be labelled "" Australian blended brandy,"" it* should bear a statement to the effectthat it contains only are 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit. The public would then know what they were not buying, and a blend so described would anyfind but few purchasers. I do not think that honourable members recognise the full significance of the Prime Minister's proposal. H is object is a good one, but I do not think that he proposes to go far enough. There is no reason why we should permit a blend which contains only 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit to be labelled ""brandv.""",69
590,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Wide Bay) [11.4] - The view of the honourable member that grape spirit only should be used in the producof tion of brandy is worthy of commendation; to but whilst I think that the nature of a blend should be clearly stated on the label, I have vet to learn that it is undesirable to be able to obtain a good article at a low price.",69
591,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,But this is to be nasty thing sold cheaply.,70
592,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I have been searching for any evidence that molasses spirit is bad. It is not as good for certain purposes as a spirit made from the grape, but",70
593,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Why should we allow a blend to consist of 75 per cent, of rice spirit if we are not going to permit the use of molasses spirit for blending purposes ?",70
594,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think we should be justified in excluding one particular spirit.,70
595,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Not if it were equally wholesome.,70
596,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Q u it e so. I fully recognise the care which the Commission has bestowed on its work, and the extent of the expert evidence given before it ; but I think that it is, to say the least, singular if the opinions of its members can be swayed by the fact that certain honourable members have not risen to protest against the exclusion of molasses spirit. If the Commission are sure of their facts, surely it should make no difference to them whether 10 or 100. men oppose their proposal. It has no evidence that is opposed to the manufacture of spirit from molasses, and I hold that we should not penalize such a spirit because of its cheapness.",70
597,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"North SydSydney. ney) [ n . 6 ] - My point is that if spirit produced from grain, molasses, or any other equitable. material containing sugar is declared to be unwholesome we ought to exclude it,' but that we ought not to exclude a spirit which is not less wholesome than any grain spirit which may be blended with grape spirit sold as brandy. I agree with the member for Hindmarsh that if we decide that brandy shall be only that which is the product of the grape, we should exclude per. - grain and all other spirit; but since we are prepared to allow a mixture of grape spirit with spirit distilled from wheat or any other grain to be described as ""blended brandy,"" I fail to see why we should exclude the use of molasses spirit for the same purpose, unless it can be shown that it is less wholeterious. some. There seem to be only two logical courses open to us. We must either prothe vide that nothing shall be labelled as that is all. "" brandy "" except that-which is the product of the grape, or if we are to allow a blendthe result will be that the more cheaply ing of grape and other spirits to be deproduced scribed as blended brandy, we should not a prevent any spirit being so used except on the ground of its being deleterious.",70
598,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [n.9] - The honourable member has been 'good enough to indicate the difficulty which he feels in regard to these proposals, and I move That the following new paragraph be inserted after paragraph i , line 43 :""' liiended wine brandy distilled from grape wine, and containing not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit (which has been separately distilled by a pot still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 40 per cent, over-proof), the whole being matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be brandy so blended and matured, per proof gallon, ns. I propose that paragraph No. 2, which will become paragraph No. 3, shall relate to ""blended grain brandy."" That being so, there will be no doubt as to the class of brandy to which it refers. In the first paragraph we shall deal with pure brandy, in the'second, with blended wine brandy, and in the third, with blended grain brandy in which not more than 25 per cent, of grain spirit may be used. These will be the only brandies.",70
599,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Parramatta) [ n . n] - It appears to me that while the j'rime Minister's proposal will in part meet the difficulty as to the want of further classification, it will not meet the criticism offered by the honourable member for North",70
600,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It is more clever than,70
601,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,All three of these classifications exclude molasses.,70
602,Mr WILSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,So they should.,70
603,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,If molasses are and unfit for the production of brandy it is honourable proper to exclude them.,70
604,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"They are not unfit for a blend, but they are unfit for brandy pro",70
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,This classification excludes them altogether. The whole question is: ought molasses to be excluded from the making of brandv ? I take it that the principle of this classification is to exclude spirit made from molasses as dele,70
606,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Oh , no; it would not have right to bear any of these special names,",70
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"I m afraid that a stuff will compete with the other, and the general public will not trouble much what it is distilled from. They will only know that it is called brandy, without troubling much whether it is made from grain, grapes, or anything else. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission ,shows that the public taste is hit by a blend more than by the genuine stuff. The popular brandy is a blended brandy, and it is just possible that we may have a blended brandv that will taste just as well as a better' kind. The more logical course to take would be, if we intend to exclude brandv made from molasses from being officially called brandy, to prevent it going on to the market, as a drink at all . If it is vicious stuff, exclude it from consumption; rule it out altogether. If the Government intends to adopt this classification it certainly ought to go further, because, as now proposed to us, it seems to me that it will only be making things worse. The stuff which is pot genuine brandy should be ruled out of the market as a drink altogether.",70
608,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.15] - I feel, of course, that we are submitting a proposal which requires a good deal of further consideration. At present we are dealing with a schedule, which, if agreed to, becomes a schedule to a Bill yet to be submitted. If on further examination honourable members think that there is any imperfection in the proposal, they will still have it in their power to remedy it. The Committee can add just what it pleases. We are dealing here with the titles which we propose to confer upon certain liquids. We refer to blended wine brandy and grain brandy. But other brandies are not excluded.",71
609,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Why not also say "" blended sugar brandy "" ?",71
610,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"That can be done, but it will not be possible for manufacturers apply those names which are appropriated by Act, and for which labels are assigned, to other brandy. Outside may be made from any spirit whatever, if it is matured for two years in the wood. There is nothing but the taste and of the public to guide them as to which liquor they will consume. We start with brandv at ios., wine brandy 'brandv 12s.; and then we come to all the other brandies or whiskies from whatever they may be manufactured.",71
611,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Can they be called brandies?,71
612,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"They can be, but the manufacturers cannot use the labels that will be specified in the Act. They can use any other names of their own. There will be a label which can be applied only to the compound to which it is assigned.",71
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I can conceive of nothing which will tend so much to the popularization of inferior stuff as that; it gives manufacturers the privilege of labelling their compounds as brandies.,71
614,Mr ISAACS,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,It does not give them any privilege.,71
615,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"No one has ever been refused the right to attach the name brandy to whatever he wishes to sell as brandy; but it rests with the public to say whether they will buy it or will not. That liberty is not diminished in the slightest degree by what we propose; but such brandies cannot be sold under the special titles that will be legalized. There are to be labels authorized by the Act, and I will ask honourable members to wait until they see the Bill and the labels before they decide that there is any unfairness in what is proposed.",71
616,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Wide Bay) [11.19] - I think that, owing to the new proposal which the Government has made, it is appropriate that we should adjourn now, so that we may have an opportunity of considering the scheme. The proposal is entirely new. It has not been even hinted at by that celebrated Commission whose investigations were supposed to reach to the last of these important matters. The proposal appears to me to be inequitable, because it excludes a certain spirit without naming it. I care nothing as to what the Committee may decide in a direct, open, and straightforward manner, but we ought not to hide our meaning in a cloud of words which would be interpreted to mean one thing and one thing only. If we mean to exclude spirit to made from molasses or from any grains, let us state that clearly and be done with' it ; but I shall not support the Government these brandy proposal drafted as it is.",71

622,Mr FISHER,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,Le t it be remembered that certain distilleries have been built up since the Federal Tariff was imposed.,72

643,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Bland) [ii.29] - When I interjected about distilling in New South Wales prior to Federation, I thought that my memory was not quite so much at fault as the extract quoted by the honourable member for Wide Bay would perhaps lead one to believe. The extract is quite correct as it was quoted, but I find that just prior to Federation distillation had ceased in the State owing to the fact that the Excise and import duties had been made equal. Some years prior to Federation, however, the distilleries of the State were producing a great deal of spirit, and I had that fact in mind when I spoke. No doubt the honourable member for Wide Bay is correct in saying that the difference between! the Excise and Customs duties imposed by the Federal Tariff have had a beneficial effect on the distilling industry of New South Wales. No attempt is now being made to injure that industry. What is proposed is that the Excise duty on molasses spirit shall remain as it is, namely, 13s., or is. less than the import duty.",72
644,Mr TUDOR,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"But molasses spirit is prohibited in connection with the manufacture of brandy, blended brandy, and malt whisky.",73
645,Mr WATSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"Yes , because it is desired to give a special degree of protection to spirits produced from materials which are a great deal more costly than molasses or potatoes. For this reason, the Excise duty on pure grape spirit has been made as low as ios. The action of the Committee in agreeing to that duty was an admission of the principle that we are justified in giving special consideration to spirits distilled from costly material. So far as the preservation of the public health is concerned, it is said by some that a blended grain whisky is as wholesome as a pure malt, whisky. I see nothing to prevent the distillers of molasses spirit from placing it on the maiket, though if they do so they must pay an Excise duty of 13s. They will not be able to call it by any of the names mentioned in the schedule, but they could do as Messrs. Joshua Brothers do in naming their spirit merely "" Boomerang."" Provision is made for the use of the terms ""pure Australian brandy,"" ""pure Australian malt whisky,"" ""blended wine brandy,"" and ""blended grain whisky.""",73
646,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,They could call it sugar brandy.,73

648,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,"North Sydney) [11-35] - I objection to this proposal, not on account of the difference made in the Excise duty, as that may be met by the cheapness with which this spirit is distilled, but because it is sought to prohibit the use of spirit which is not shown to be more harmful than the spirit which is allowed. If the distinction which is attempted to be made is drawn, it seems to me that the Excise Department may prevent spirit made in the northern States from being labelled "" blended sugar brandv-"" They may say, ""You shall not call this spirit brandy, because the Excise Act allows the application of the term brandy to certain specified spirits only.",73
649,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL DEFENC E,I do not think that that is so. It will depend on the wording of the Bill.,73
