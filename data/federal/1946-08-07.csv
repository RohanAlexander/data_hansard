The canteen supplies here ara terrific as far as the Army is concerned. Our ration is half a cake a fortnight, so I am going ask you to get gome for me and forward on, as it is impossible to make half - a cake do one for a fortnight. From what I can see of this Australian contingent, the the canteen supplies from Australia go "" Ponims"". One instance: 32 cases of teen goods arrived here on the River ilitta about a fortnight ago, and the Indians the whole issue.",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Can the honourable member not condense that?,13
6,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,The letter endsSo now you can see why I am asking for in ' the soap. Will the Minister for the Army investi gate the position and arrange for Austhat tralian . troops in Japan to be .supplied with adequate supplies of soap?,13
7,Mr FORDE,Unknown,The Commander-instudies Chief of British Commonwealth Occushall pation Forces has complete authority and 'power to deal with all such on the spot. I shall communicate with him to ensure adequate supplies of soap.,13
8,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,Number s of young men still in thearmed forces who matriculated are desirous of taking up a personnel. course of study at a university. As some time has elapsed since the termination of the w.ar I ask the Minister for the Army whether he is in the position indicate that all. such matriculated sons still in the services who desire take up courses of study will be released by early in 1947 in order to do so ?,13
9,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"This subject received great deal of consideration from league the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction when the demobilization scheme was being evolved. The honourable gentle^ man soughttlie advice, of the' Universities Commission, and' that body, in turn, conferred with the Australian universities. Because of lack of accommodation and other factors the university authorities that all they would request for - the time being was that persons who had S successfully completed one year of study in an Australian university should lie granted accelerated discharge. To give accelerated discharge to tens of thousands of matriculated persons would have bees an impracticable at that time, on the best advice available to the Government. The subject was subsequently considered by Cabinet which decided that, accelerated discharges could not be given to all who to wished to. begin a course at a university, it any more than it could he given to all ether persons who wish to learn a trade,, bulk of such as plumbing or carpentering, beto the cause every accelerated discharge that canwas given involved calling upon another copped person to serve longer than he would otherwise have been required to serve. However, the Leader of the Opposition has now asked whether something can be - done ' to ensure that persons still the services who wish to. begin university courses next year may receive accelerated discharges. I give an assur: ance to the right .honourable gentleman 1 the most sympathetic consideration will be given .to his suggestion. The Government is desirous that, those whose were, interrupted by war service be allowed to-' enter upon university COUTSCS or apprenticeship's of various matters kinds without unnecessary delay.",13
10,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"Many persons, qualified for discharge, are not being released have because they are regarded as key Mr Forde I gave the honourable member an assurance yesterday that the procedure in regard to the release of key to personnel was . being completely, overperhauled by a special committee appointed to for the purpose. The Government is anxious that demobilization 'shall be com. pleted at the earliest possible date, but a taking an overall view of the pioture, a my colsplendid job has already been done.",13
11,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the broken-hearted, mother of a member, of' the Royal Australian Ait Force who is a member of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. She desires that members of that force shall be granted leave, because of them are suffering a nervous breakto down. She says that she has received letter from her son; who had "" never written in that strain before "". This portion of the son's letterI don't know what is the real cause but most of the jokers here closing' in on them, as we put it, but you go around feeling as though you are in a cage from which you can never escape. Sis letter went, on to say that there no cafes at which food can be obtained; that food is scarce; and the men have , exist on tinned meat. The worse feature is that which I am now about to relate. This woman said in her letter that recently a neighbour' had informed that both she and her mother had wept when they had received advice from brother and son respectively that one his colleagues, a member of the tralian Imperial Force in the occupation them? force in Japan, had committed suicide throwing himself under a train, so escape from the conditions under which. - he had been living. Can the Minister for A i r obtain some amenities for tralian members of the occupation force in Japan ?' Will he consider the granting of leave, in order that these men may escape for a time from the condifor tions in which they are placed today?",13
12,Mr DRAKEFOBD,Unknown,I can hardly be expected to have absorbed all the details of the letter from a heart-broken mother which the honourable member has read the House. I promise to have inquiries made. I find it very difficult to underRobertson stand why anybody should feel so ments aggrieved as to weep about persons who volunteered to serve in the British monwealth Occupation Force in Japan.,14
13,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,Because of their having been neglected.,14
14,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"All that I say is that complaints have not previously come to-me. Had the honourable member, instead of ventilating the matter in this Souse, brought this complaint to mv notice, I would have been most willing have it"" investigated. Even in Australia persons commit suicide without waiting practicable. for the hills to close in on them "". I am <Â£ not at all unsympathetic'in regard'to the conditions of the men who are. serving in many Japan. The Government has endeavoured provide the best, possible conditions for a them. So far as I know, this is the first complaint that has been made about is a unfair treatment of members of the Royal Australian Air Force. I regret that the of it, honourable member has raised the matter have the hills in. this House.",14
15,Mr GULLETT,Unknown,"Eeport s have appeared in the press in regard to the inadequacy of the amenities provided for are the occupation force in Japan, and I have also received letters on the subject. The . to health and morale of men must inevitably deteriorate when so many of. them are stationed in an eastern country with not much to do. I ask the Minister for the her Army whether suitable hospitals have been hired, eamps provided, and leave their arrangements made for these troops? of What is the strength of the personnel Ausengaged in providing amenities for How are those personnel by employed? Has the amenities branch as to in Melbourne had staff and equipment ready for some time for embarkation for Japan? What is the reason for the Ausdelay in emibarking these personnel? When will they leave Australia?",14
16,Mr FORDE,Unknown," by leave-This matter has been raised by several honourable members, and this morning I read in the press a further statement on the subject in an article by Mr Massey Stanley. That to statement is incorrect, and I have no doubt whatever that Lieutenant-General did not make certain statewhich have been attributed to him. Massey Stanley, in the article appearing Comin the Daily Telegraph, is reported to have"" stated that' Lieutenant-General Eobertson would ask General MACArthur whether the American forces can temporarily extend the amenities the Auscan tralian Government has denied. The Australian Government has not denied amenities to the Australian troops, and as I have already indicated, .it is the policy of the Government to provide amenities to and leave facilities for our Australian . troops in Japan to the greatest extent Lieutenant-General Robertson, in a recent message to Army and defence headquarters, had stated that he had come to the conclusion - that the only way to provide for British Commonwealth Occupation Force troops in time to enable them to have relief during hot summer and autumn months, was to request the appropriate American authorities to hand over a percentage of United States operated centres for operation by the British Commonwealth Occupation Eorce on a sterling' basis. Lieutenant-General Robertson had stated that he proposed taking such action. He was clothed with the necessary power to act in the best interest of the troops. The. Australian troops number 12,600 out of atotal of 37,300 of the British Commonwealth Occupation Eorce, and it is pointed out that a small advance party of Australian troops arrived in February this year, and other troops followed in April, May and June. On the last occasion, when this question was raised, I intimated that Lieutenant-General Robertson had been asked to furnish his recoiunrendations as to any additional amenities or facilities that, in his opinion, should be made - available. On the 31st July, a signal was received hy the Joint Chiefs of Staffs in Australia from Lieutenant-General Robertsou stating that the fundamental problem in regard to amenities was to provide civilized surroundings for the occupation troops. It will be appreciated that his responsibilities relate to all troops of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and not merely the Australian troops. The signal continued that the area occupied by these troops did not include any Japanese city where men could find anything approaching western facilities, and he considered the solution of the problem could be found in (a) providing adequate clubs, cinemas, libraries and education facilities in garrison centres; and (b) providing leave centres at attractive resorts outside British Commonwealth Occupation Force areas. He advised that he was submitting detailed recommendations for provision of adequate clubs, cinemas, library and education facilities, . but these detailed recommendations are still awaited, and will receive urgent Mr Forde. attention as soon as they come to hand. In the meantime, the Australian Amenities Service have provided goods to the value of Â£160,000 for Australian troops, and, in additionto equipment already forwarded, 200 tons of equipment was now in course of transit to Japan. In addition, the Australian Comforts Fund provided Â£45,000 for the establishment and conduct of leave centres for Australian troops. Four cafeterias and non-residential club3 for other ranks had already been selected, and the plant and equipment for these was already in Japan. In addition, buildings have been selected at Kyoto and Kobe for the establishment of holiday leave hostels. These will provide accommodation for 250 persons who may spend their leave there free of cost, on a basis similar to that provided for American troops. Anothercentre which will provide accommodation for 500 personnel is being, established on Kyushu Island. Two canteen cars are being prepared for attachment to British Commonwealth. Occupation Force troop trains. These are of a buffet type and similar to those already provided by the American Red ""Cross for American leave trains. The f suggestion in the Daily Telegraph article' that Lieutenant-General Robertson is turning to the United States authorities for the provision of amenities is most misleading. Lieutenant-General Robertson has already advised that the United States authorities, who have been longer in the field and have established facilities, recognized the needs of the British Commonwealth Occupation' Force, and discussions have been proceeding for thcallotment from their resources of accommodation for our troops on leave in areas under the United States Army control. This involves the expenditure of dollars to cover the free accommodation for our leave parties in such areas and hostels, and such expenditure has been authorized by the Government and communicated to Lieutenant - General Robertson. As already indicated, the Government the is doing everything possible to ensure adequate recreational' facilities' and' amenities for our troops in Japan. The problems that have to he surmounted in Japan in providing these facilities are. for Lieutenant-General Robertson himself to overcome, and the Government has given him full authority to act in this direction. To the degree that assistance can be rendered from Australia, provision of equipment and supplies has been forwarded in accordance with Lieutenant-General Robertson's requirements. The joint Chiefs of Staffs in Australia are aware of the desire of the Australian Government, and also of the other governments participating in the British Commonwealth Occupation - Force, that full amenities shall be provided for the troops of that, force in Japan. Their representatives have recently visited Japan and returned to Australia, and fully realise that, the normal scale of vision of amenities has proved inadequate because of the devastation of the countryrefund side and'the lack of entertainment facilisuggested, ties available in the area occupied those troops. They know of the practiexamine the matter. cal difficulties that have to be surmounted and are doing everything possible on behalf of all the participating govern-, ments to meet requirements. They have Xhe full authority of the Australian Government, as well as of their own governasked ments, to take what action is necessary. Tho difficulties -'to be surmounted physical and not financial, and everything possible is being done to overcome Promotion them. On reading the newspapers, parfund ticularly the statements such as those attributed to Mr J. W. Bavin, president of the Air Force Association, that the story relating to amenities was a ""most deplorable reflection on the Australian Government and its inefficient adminisment tration "", it is evident that frantic efforts are being made by biased and jaundiced political influences to exnloit these plaints for partu political purposes and to influence the soldiers' vote.",14
17,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Repatriation in a position to reply to question which I directed to him on -26th July last regarding an ex-serviceman named Stevens who used the whole of his deferred pay to provide his England by air so that he could see his dying wife? I learn that her condition has since improved. The amount of fare was Â£325. Mr Stevens's workmates contributed Â£20, and his employers will pay him half his wages during his absence. Will the Minister inform me whether the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act provides for the granting of assistance in cases of this kind, so that Stevens's deferred pay may remain his inviolate right? If not, will the honourable gentleman consider calling together the useful repatriation committees in city areas for the purpose of raising funds to provide for this kind of emergency?",16
18,Mr FROST,Unknown,"When the honourable member asked this question a few days ago, I instructed my department to ascertain whether the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act empowered us to assist this man. The - report on the matter arrived this morning, and I.shall hand proit to the'honourable member later. I do not believe that the act empowers us to his fare. As the honourable member the act may require amendby ment to meet such cases, and I shall WOOL. LEVY.",16
19,Mr BREEN,Unknown,"<Some time ago I a question in regard to the need for collecting a levy of 2s. a bale on wool, are under the provisions of the Wool Use Act 1945. The Government has stated its intention to put into the amounts approximating Â£7,000,000, comprising Â£2,500,000 derived from handling sheepskins and Â£2,500,000 from he export of processed wool in* the form of tops, noils and waste, under order of the British Government, and an adjustof price with textile manufacturers on cloth exported from Australia, representing approximately Â£2,000,000. All comthese amounts were received by the Central Wool Committee, and frozen by the Treasury. Will the Minister consider now cancelling that section of the 1945 act dealing with the levy on wool-growers the of 2s. a bale? Can the Minister tell the the House what is the contributory charge paid by growers in New Zealand and South Africa for the joint ownership fare to scheme in those countries?",16
20,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"Some of the questions the asked by the honourable member are a little involved, hut it appears that he wants to know whether the contributory levy of 2s. a bale paid to the Australian Wool Board by the growers for publicity and research purposes is to be dispensed with, and whether the Commonwealth subsidy of 2s. a bale is to be paid in the future. The Commonwealth contribution of 2s. a bale will continue and the levy on producers of 2s. a bale will be suspended and the required amount paid to the fund from the 5 per cent, contributory charge now imposed on wool. might mention that. in New Zealand - and .South Africa the contributory levy paid by growers is 1$ per cent. THE PARLIAMENT. THE SENATE : CLERK OF PAPERS. Mr RANKIN"" - Has an appointment been made to the position of clerk of .papers and accountant in the Senate, as advertised in Gazette No. 91 of 1946? If so, was the position given to a returned soldier? If not, what reason can be given for so serious a departure from the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act and the avowed policy of the Government?",16
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Appointment s to the staff of the Parliament are made either by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate. As the person mentioned by the honourable member is an officer of the Senate, the question should properly be addressed to the President of the Senate. CIVIL AVIATION. MASCOT AERODROME. _ Mr SHEEHAN - Is the Minister for jjL.li yet able to give any details about the proposal for the reconstruction of the Mascot aerodrome, including the date when the job. is expected to be finished. - Can he give an estimate of the cost, and iis it proposed to establish a flying-boat i-base in conjunction with the aerodrome? How many men Avill be employed on the ^undertaking?",17
22,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"A statement is ""being prepared for publication, which will contain all this information. It is estimated that between Â£5,000,000 and. Â£6,000,000 will be expended on the first part of the project. The area of the airport will be enlarged, and will include a flying-boat base which will probably be the most suitable baseiof its kind near, any Australian capital city. It will be the international airport for Australia. About 10,000 persons will be eventually employed in the area. IMMIGRATION . FARES-CONDITION S ON MIGRANT VESSELS. I Mr WHITE - I have received a lette; from a resident in my electorate who recently returned from Great Britain to Australia with his wife and two daughters on Orbita. He complains that the fare of Â£109 sterling for each passenger was exorbitant, the accommodation on the vessel bad, the food poor, and the conveniences filthy and inadequate, and that there was general overcrowding. Is the Minister for Immigration aware of these complaints about conditions on Orbita, and if so, does he believe that conditions of that kind will encourage migrants to come to Australia? In the circumstances does not the honourable gentleman believe that a portion of the passage money should be refunded to the people concerned, and that an officer should be sent from Australia House."" London, to inspect such vessels before they sail from the United Kingdom?",17
23,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I am aware of the complaints made by some at least of the travellers on Orbita; they were of such a character that I immediately cabled to the Resident Minister in London, Mr. Beasley, a request that investigations be made as to the conditions under which ' passengers had to travel and the fare charged, which was claimed to be extortionate. The charge quoted by the honourable member, Â£109 sterling, is certainly much higher than this Government and the British Government will agree to pay under the free and assisted passage scheme - The Resident Minister in London is doing his best in very difficult circumstances, and I am sure he will make the fullest investigations possible. - Officers of my department .will inspect Orbita before it leaves Sydney on the return voyage to London. The honourable member will agree 'that there are many difficulties associated with immigration for which neither the shipping companies nor the Australian or British Governments can be held responsible. POSTMASTER-GEN""ERAX'S DEPARTMENT. NA KINGDOM. Mr - DALY - I have received a number of complaints that parcels sent by Australians to their relatives in the United Kingdom are not reaching their destinations. Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General have inquiries made to ascertain the reason why so many parcels are not delivered to the addressees, and will he indicate what steps are being taken to ensure that deliveries are effected in the United Kingdom?",17
24,Mr CALWELL,DELIVERY OF PARCELS IN THE UNITED,I shall ask the Postmaster-General to examine the complaint made by the honourable member. If there be ground for the complaint I hope it will be found that the Australian postal authorities are not responsible. If it be discovered that the defect lies overseas we shall ask the British postal authorities to do what they can to see that parcels - sent from Australia roach their destinations in the United Kingdom in a satisfactory condition and with their contents complete. MEAT INDUSTRY. PRICE OF EXPORT LAMB ,18
25,Mr TURNBULL,DELIVERY OF PARCELS IN THE UNITED,Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture now indicate what will be the export price per lb. t'ov first-grade lamb this export season?,18
26,Mr SCULLY,DELIVERY OF PARCELS IN THE UNITED,"The price has not yet been determined, but we are aware that it will be considerably in excess of .that tained in earlier export years. As - a matter of faet. the prospects for lambraisers are now better than they have been at any other time in the history of lambraising in Australia. PUBLIC SERVICE. RETIREMENT OF OVER-AGE OFFICERS.",18
27,Mr JAMES,DELIVERY OF PARCELS IN THE UNITED,"Is the Prime Minister aware that a circular has been issued government departments with instructions that the services of retired officials a* present employed temporarily shall he dispensed with by the 31st August? Is he also aware that, owing to the diffithe culty of accommodating staff in Canbags berra, a number of experienced retired officials doing valuable work will be charged without the possibility of their replacement by younger men ? Is it a fact that the work of some departments will be seriously affected if these instructions are strictly enforced? If so, will the Prime Minister take steps to alleviate the position,- by retaining retired officers in positions where ex-servicemen or younger officers cannot be obtained to carry on the work?",18
28,Mr CHIFLEY,DELIVERY OF PARCELS IN THE UNITED,"I a m aware that that circular has been issued. The general belief, which, I think, is supported by the organizations associated with the Public Service, is that an opportunity should be given for younger men to fill the higher positions when public servants have reached the retiring age of 65. It is true that it is necessary in some cases, because of special qualifications, to retain men after they have reached the retiring age. I shall discuss the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question with - the Chairman of the Public Service Board, whose advice is sought about these matters, and let the honourable gentleman have a reply. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. NA COLLIERY. Mr Ryan"" - I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether the strike at the Renown Extended colliery, nearLithgow, yesterday was due to the stealing of a man's pants. If so, does he regard the strike as frivolous? What ob- action is proposed either by the Government or the miners' federation to discipline the men concerned? - Mr HOLLO WAY - I agree that the man would be cold without his pants.; nevertheless^ the strike, if it occurred, would be frivolous. All I know about it is what I read in the press. I shall refer the honourable gentleman's question to the Minister for Supply and Shipping,, to who controls the coal-mining industry. JUTE GOODS. .",18
29,Mr ANTHONY,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"During the war the Commonwealth Government subsidized users of jute goods, notably wheat and sacks of various kinds for produce. The sugar-growers' organizations disof New South Wales and Queensland in form me that they have asked the Prime Minister more than once to extend this concession to the sugar industry, but their representations have been rejected. The amount involved is more than Â£500,000. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited has agreed that any subsidy payment made on account of sugar bags shall be returned to the growers. As the sugargrower did not receive any increase of price during World War II . , although costs of all kinds increased, will the Prime Minister inform me why he has denied to this industry the subsidy which is granted to almost every other user of bags? Will the right honourable gentleman reconsider the matter and, if necessary, receive a further deputation on the subject?",18
30,Mr CHIFLEY,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"The sugar-growers organizations of New South Wales and Queensland submitted to me a request for the extension of the subsidy to the users of sugar bags. On the first occasion on which the matter was raised, the amount involved was Â£300,000. Since then, apparently, from the figures mentioned by the honourable member for Richmond, the amount has increased. It is true that a subsidy is paid to wheat-growers and wool-growers in respect of the jute goods that they use. But sugar-growers receive extensive subsidies on the fertilizers that they use. The particular reason why the request for the extension of the subsidy to the users.of jute goods in the sugar industry was rejected, was that the Tariff Board had inquired into the industry aud reported that its financial position was very satisfactory. The then Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Keane, submitted the whole of the facts to Cabinet, which considered, in view of the report, that no justification existed for subsidizing jute goods for the sugar industry. However, the fertilizer subsidy, which is paid to all primary producers, was continued. Recently, I received further representations from the sugar growers' organizations, and I promised that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator J. M . Fraser) and I would re-examine the matter - We determine on behalf of the Government the payment of subsidies in connection with the stabilization of industries. I shall reexamine this matter in view of the fact that some changes may have occurred since the Tariff Board submitted its last report. TAXATION. DECENTRALIZATIO N OF OFFICES.",19
31,Mr WATKINS,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"Will the Prime Minister inform me whether the Government has given any consideration to the decentralization of taxation offices. Because of the increased volume of the work in the capital cities a great deal of congestion has occurred. I believe that this would be relieved by decentralization. .1 desire that offices should be established in big cities outside of the capital cities, with authority to receive returns, issue assessments and collect payments.",19
32,Mr CHIFLEY,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"This subject has been under consideration for some time. The honourable member 'for Bass, in particular, has raised it with special reference to Launceston.",19
33,Mr JAMES,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,Newcastl e has a larger population than the whole of Tasmania.,19
34,Mr CHIFLEY,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner of Taxation. As soon as men of a suitable standard and capacity are available, the endeavour will be made to decentralize administration, as far as possible, by establishing branches in large centres other than capital cities. FILM ""INDONESI A CALLING"".",19
35,Mr HOLT,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"I ask the Prime Minister whether any assistance was given by am Government department or any permanent or temporary .Government official in the preparation of the propaganda film "" Indonesia Calling "" ? I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs hasviewedthis film - Has he made a report to the Government as to whether or not it reflects accurately the attitude of the Government to the matter with which it deals? The film will circulate in Australia, and possibly abroad, and-may be interpreted as an official propaganda film. If the Government believes that it CIOPS not, accurately reflect its attitude, what action does it propose with a view to pnÂ°nHng that tbo=e who view it will r-lenrlv understand that it is not an official film?""'",19
36,Mr CHTFLEY,STRIKE AT RENOWNED EXTENDED,"I read a short newspaper article in regard to a film dealing with Indonesia. Neither the - Government nor any of its officers was connected in any way with the preparation of the film. Whether or not it is suitable for public exhibition is a matter which, I imagine, must be decided by the Commonwealth F i l m Censor. I was unaware that the Minister for Trade and Customs had viewed the film. He has not made any report to me on the matter. I have not given any thought to whether the Government should disclaim responsibility for any films exhibited in picture theatres. Films of all sorts are screened. The fact that the - Government has not placed its i m p r imatur upon a film should certainly be sufficient indication to the public that it is not sponsored by the Government. I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Trade, and Customs. RE - ESTABLISHMEN T. NA ALLOWANCE.",19
37,Mr MORGAN,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING,"Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction review allowance that is paid to persons going reconstruction training courses, particularly adult students, with a view to raising the allowance to at least a mount of the 'basic wage ?",20
38,Mr DEDMAN,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING,"The allowance paid to students undergoing reconstruction training courses has been the subject consideration by Cabinet on several occagation sions. On the last occasion, Cabinet the Charter. decided that the present rates are adequate to meet the circumstances. However, I shall have another look at matter. NEW GUINEA. TRUSTEESHIP.",20
39,Mr CHIFLEY,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING," by leave-O the 17th January, 1946, the Australian Government declared its intention of 'placing the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship tem established by the United Nations. Similar declarations were made governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand concerning their mandated territories in A f r i c a and Western - respectively. The United Nations Charter provides that the terms of trusteeship for each territory to be placed under the trusteeship system shall be agreed upon by the "" States directly concerned "", including the mandatory power, and approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations. In his statement to the House on the 13th March, 1946, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) indicated that the House would be informed of the Government's, proposals for - bringing New Guinea within the trusteeship system. Consultation with other States which may be regarded as directly concerned is now taking place, and as yet there is no definitive text which can be placed before the House.. A draft agreement, however, has been prepared aa a basis for our discussions with other governments. I shall read the articles of this agreement to honourable members at the. conclusion of this statement, thus affording an opportunity for expression of views on the principles which the Go the vernment will be following in the undernegotiation of the agreement. There are two fundamental considerations on which the Government bases its the attitude in the negotiation of the trusteeship agreement, namely, the fact that Australia will bave complete and exclusive power in controlling the administration of New Guinea and that the only of limitation upon this control is the oblito carry out the duties imposed by The Commonwealth of Australia, as the the administering authority, must bare full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction over the territory. This was the position under the mandate, and the Government is resolved that it must continue. The Territory of New Guinea, n in which so many of our men died in battle against the Japanese, is of such importance to the safety of this country that nothing but absolute control could be sysaccepted by any Australian government. Moreover, the welfare of the native by the peoples demands such control. The Minister for External Affairs made this point very clear in his stateSamoa ment to the House on the 13th March of this year, when he declared that "" in order to be acceptable to Australia the new agreement must, like the present mandate, designate the Government of Australia as the exclusive administering authority in the territory. Like the present mandate it must also permit the territory to be administered as an integral portion of the territory of - Australia and under Australian laws, subject, of course, to the general duty laid down in the Charter and also contained in the mandate to promote the welfare .and advancement of the inhabitants."" furthermore, under the provisions of the United Nations Charter, to which this country is a signatory, the administration may make use of volunteer forces, facilities and assistance from the territory in providing for the defence of New Guinea. We could not do this under the old C mandate terms. The Government, moreover, intends to go farther and to ensure that its complete administrative authority will be utilized to the full in providing, where necessary, 'for naval, military and air bases in New Guinea and for the erection of fortifications. No agreement would be considered by us which restricted in any way our right to provide for the defence of New Guinea and consequently for the safety of Australia. I must emphasize that such comprehensive defence measures were not possible under the old mandate. By bringing the mandated territory under the trusteeship system we are permitted to plan and cany out measures directly relevant to the security, of Australia-itself. The second consideration of fundait mental importance is that we shall recogsary nize and gladly accept the general laid down in the Charter, to promote the welfare and advancement of the inhabihonorable tants of New Guinea. This obligation to advance the social, economic and political development of the inhabitants is new. A similar duty was imposed by the preamble:mandate. The Charter has simply redefined, clarified and elaborated that obligation. There are clearly set out in istered Chapter XTT. of the Charter the basic Covenant objectives-of the trusteeship system. At San Francisco last year our delegation was prominent in securing recognition of .Australia. the principle that all members of .the United Nations responsible for the adminat istration of dependent territories recognize provides Mr Chifley. in relation to them the principle of trusteeship, that is, that the main purpose of administration is the welfare of the dependent peoples and their economic, social and political development. It is our responsibility to ensure thar tha welfare of the inhabitants shall be the motive inspiring all such administrative acts. That duty we have discharged in the past as the mandatory power. Under the trusteeship system we shall likewise be faced with the necessity for advancing native welfare, and we must be prepared to discharge whatever responsibilities fall upon us in the execution of our obligations. The Charter, furthermore, require Australia, in return for its full control, to give an account of its stewardship in the form of an annual report drawn upon, the basis of a questionnaire formulated by the Trusteeship Council. The initiative in drafting the terms of the trusteeship agreement rests with Australia. ' Until the agreement is approved by the United Nations Assembly the right? existing under the mandate continue in being. Before any trusteeship agreement in. respect of New Guinea can he approved by the General Assembly and enter into force, Australia must, under the terms , of the Charter, be a - consenting party to it. Eventually, Australian legislation will be required to give effect to the trusteeship agreement and to make the appropriate amendments in the New Guinea Act. As the General Assembly will not meet until. September, at the earliest, will not be possible to bring the necesmeasures before the House during duty, the present session. In conclusion, I should like' to read to ' members the draft terms which we propose to use as a basis for our discussions with other governments. These not terms commence with the following The Territory of New Guinea has been adminin accordance with article 22 of the of the League 'of Nations and in piirsunn-e of a mandate conferred upon His Britannic Majesty and exercised on-His hehalf by the Government of the Commonwealth of The Charter of the United Nations, signed Ran Francisco on the-2.0th June, 1945. hy article 75 for the establishment of an international trusteeship system for the administration and supervision of such territories as may be placed thereunder by subsequent individual agreements. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia now undertakes to place the Territory of New, Guinea under the trusteeship, system, on the terms set forth in the present Trusteeship Agreement. Therefore the General Assembly of the United Nations, acting in pursuance of article 85 of the Charter, approves the following terms of trusteeship for the Territory of New Guinea, in substitution for the terms of the Mandate under which the Territory has been administered: ARTICL E 1. The Territory to which this Trusteeship Agreement applies (hereinafter called the Territory) consists of that portion of the island of New Guinea aiid the groups of islands administered therewith under the Mandate dated the 17th December, 1920, conferred upon His Britannic Majesty and exercised by the Government of Australia. ARTICLE 2. The Government of Australia (hereinafter called the Administering Authority) is hereby designated as the sole authority which will exercise the administration of the Territory. ARTICLE 3. The Administering Authority undertakes to administer the Territory in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and in such a manner as to achieve in the Territory the basic objectives of the international trusteeship system, which are set forth in article 76 of the Charter. ARTICL E 4. The Administering Authority will be responsible for the peace, order, good government and defence of the Territory and for this purpose will have the same powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction in and over the Territory, as if it were an integral part of the Commonwealth of Australia, and will be entitled to apply to the Territory, Bubieet to such modifications as it deems desirable, such laws of the Commonwealth of Australia as it deems appropriate to the needs and conditions of the Territory. ARTICLE 5 It is agreed that the Administering Authority, in the exercise of its powers under article 4, will be at liberty to bring the Territory into a customs, fiscal or administrative union or federation with other dependent territories under, its jurisdiction or control, and to establish common services between the territory and any or all of these territories, if in its opinion it would be in the interests of the territory and not inconsistent with the basic objectives of the trusteeship system to do so. ARTICLE fi. The Administering Authority further under- takes to apply in the Territory the provisions of such international agreements and such recommendations of the specialized agencies referred to in article 57 of the Charter as are, in the opinion of the Administering Authority, suited to the needs and conditions of the Territory and conducive to the achievement of the basic objectives of the trusteeship system. ARTICL E 7: The Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory and for maintenance of international peace and security. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. DETENTION OF ACl-JONES.",20
40,Mr HARRISON,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING,"I am concerned about the statement published in the Canberra Times that AC l Jones, who had been kept in detention for 111 days awaiting court-martial, and was sentenced to detention for 28 days, has been kept in the Royal Australian Air Force for the last two months although his sentence was suspended as the result of an. official inquiry. On the 10th July the Minister for Air advised me, in answer to a question, that the discharge of ACl Jones had been arranged. I now ask the Minister whether the discharge of this man has been effected? If not, can the honourable gentleman explain the failure to effect it?",22
41,Mr DRAKEFORD,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING,"As , I recently informed the House in answer to a question by the honourable member, I was under the impression that ACl Jones had been discharged from the Royal Aus1 tralian Air Force. I have read the paragraph in today's Canberra Times, a newspaper that I find the time to read before I come to the House because it is published in pithy form and does not take long to read. When the case was brought to my notice, I was given to understand that immediate effect had been given to the suspension of the sentence upon and the discharge from custody of ACl Jones. I'also understood that action was being , taken to discbarge him from the Royal Australian Air Force. According to the press report, however, such action has not yet been taken. I have directed that if AC l Jones is still in the Royal Australian Air Force"" he shall be discharged immediately. Arrangements to that end 1 should be completed within the next few days. If he is then still in the Royal tralian Air Force, I shall ask for an explanation of the incorrectness of the . information previouslyfurnishedto nie. APPLES AND PEARS. Mr FRASER,-Can the Minister say when the apple and pear growers in the Winsole, Penrose, Talong and Exeter districts will receive the payments due to them from many years under the. acquisition scheme? The payments have been held up because of litigation, and the growers are in urgent need of the money.",22
42,Mr SCULLY,RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING,"The whole matter of x compensation for fruit-growers is held because of the. delay in getting decision from the High Court, which been dealing with the matter. The officers of the Apple and Pear Acquisition Board were required to make submissions, and Committee. these have been before the Court, but there has been, delay because of the accumulation of work. NA PROCUREMENT.",23
43,Mr FADDEN,DIVISION OF IMPORT,"Has . the Prime ister read the comment by David MCNicoll in yesterday's Daily Telegraph that by the time the Criminal Investigaand tion Branch hasfinished its inquiries into the defunct Division of Import Procurement, the Commonwealth Goquantities vernment would have no alternative to appoint a royal commission? In view of this exceedingly grave reflection upon an important section of a Commonwealth department, will the Prirh.e Minister make a statement on the subject either now or before the House is dissolved?",23
44,Mr CHIFLEY,DIVISION OF IMPORT,"As a matter of fact, I did read the paragraph in Mr. MCNicoll's article which was publishedhas yesterday, and I understood from it that some investigations were being made by the Criminal Investigation Branch. was not previously aware that investigadeclared tions were being made, nor that any improper practices were alleged nexion with the working of the division. I shall certainly ask the Minister Trade and Customs whether he has any tities knowledge of these matters. For the time Aus- being, there is no need for me to make a statement about something of which 1 know nothing. NA TELEPHONE EXCHANGE. REPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.

45,Mr LAZZARINI,BATMAN AUTOMATIC," by leave- 1 recently promised the honourable member Minfor Robertson (Mr Williams) that I would make inquiries whether quantities of galvanized iron, wire netting barbed wire could be made available to farmers, and also in regard to the allegation that there were enormous of these materials lying in but Queensland awaiting distribution. As honourable members are aware, supplies of these items are in acute short supply, and it has been necessary for my department to distribute the production of these items to all States on an equitable basis - From inquiries made of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, it is understood that 24,000 feet of wire netting in Brisbane just been declared surplus to re.quirements and will shortly he disposed of. In addition, a further quantity of 126,000 I feet at Townsville has also recently been surplus and will shortly be 'allocated. It is the responsibility of in contbe Commonwealth Disposals Commission to furnish my department with inforfor mation concerning any large quanof housing and fencing materials that are available for disposal. When disposal is subsequently made within a State my department makes any necessary adjustments of' that State's quota. At the present time, my department has no advice other than I have stated from the commission that there are any large quantities of galvanized iron, wire netting 'and barbed wire that have been declared surplus to requirements and thus available fpr disposal. If specific information as to the locality where the material is alleged to be stored is furnished, the matter will be investigated further with the Disposals Commission and the Army and A i r Force authorities.

Motion (by Mr Holloway) agreed toThat leave he given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Tuberculosis Act 1045. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",24
48,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.24] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the bill is to amend the Tuberculosis Act 1945 by substituting :new section for the existing section which provides for the payment of special allowances to sufferers from tuberculosis and their dependants. The Tuberculosis Act was passed by the present Government in October, 1945, to give effect to its plan to strengthen the attack on tuberculosis by means of improved diagnostic and aftev-care facilities, treatment in suitable hospitals and the payment of special allowances to sufferers and their dependants. With a view to encouraging the States to establish additional diagnostic facilities, provision was made under section 4 for the Commonwealth to subsidize, on a pound for pound basis, the expenditure of the States in the maintenance of diagnostic facilities such as clinics, dispensaries, and X-ray equipment, established after the commence-: ment of the act. For this purpose the Commonwealth has provided the sum of Â£50,000 per annum for distribution amongst the States, as determined by the Minister. Under the same section a further sum of Â£50,000 per annum has been provided for payment to the States, also on a pound for pound basis, for the maintenance of after-care facilities, on the same basis as for diagnostic facilities. Provision has been made in section 5 under which the Commonwealth will pay to the States a subsidy of six shillings for each daily occupied bed in approved tuberculosis hospitals established after the commencement of the act. This payment is subject to the condition that no charge is made for accommodation or treatment in the public wards of the hospitals. Section 6 of the act as it now stands. provides for the payment of special allowances to sufferers from tuberculosis and to dependants of sufferers, provided such payments will assist in preventing the spread of tuberculosis or promote the better treatment of the disease. For this purpose the Government set aside the sum of Â£250,000 per annum. In attempting to give effect to the objects of the section, however, policy and administrative difficulties have arisen, because there, is no power, such as is provided in sections 4 and 5, to make grants to the States"" for this purpose. It is now proposed to' amend the act a by repealing section 6 and substituting a 0, new section whereby the Commonwealth' will make available to the States the sum of Â£250,000 per annum, to be distributed as determined, by the Minister. This will bring section 6 into line with sections 4 and 5 of the act. The money will payable to the States upon the condition HOLLOWAY that it shall be applied by the States during the year in which it is received, in making payments to, or in respect of, sufferers from tuberculosis, or the dependants of such sufferers, with the objects of-(a ) encouraging such sufferers to frain from working and to take treatin ment; (i>) minimizing the spread of , tuberculosis; and .(c) promoting the better treatment of tuberculosis. The States, owing to their constituall. tional powers, have a large share of responsibility towards tuberculosis ferers, and this Commonwealth grant should make a valuable contribution wards the problem, particularly when it is supplemented by existing State agencies. The States will be entirely sponsible for the distribution of this money and will select the people to whom payment should be made. Proposed new section 6 contains special provisionto the effect that ments made to tubercular sufferers and their dependants by the States, whether from moneys provided by the Commonas wealth under the section or from their own moneys, will not be treated as come in the hands of the recipients the purpose of applying the means test under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions, Widows Pensions and Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Acts. This provision will ensure that these moneys will be applied fully to the worthy objects set out in the new section, without in any way affecting pensions and benefits paytion. able under the acts to which I have ferred. A minor amendment has been made to lodged, section 7 of the act by the addition of the words "" by the Commonwealth or the marks Treasurer "" after the word "" payments "". complete This has the effect of clarifying the section tion. The worthy objects of this representing as they do a valuable con- ' tribution to the problem of tuberculosis, will, I feel sure, commend themselves honourable members. Debate (on motion by Sir FREDERICK - WTISWART) adjourned. Mr Holloway. PATENTS BILL 1946. SECOND READING . .Debate resumed from the 4th July be (vide page 2238), on motion, by Mr. That the hill be now read a second time.",24
49,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.29] - The purpose reof this bill is to amend the Patents Act various respects. The bill itself is, of necessity, very technical, although some of the matters dealt with in it are of some general importance. However, the bill possesses no party character at I want to make comments on about four points that arise in the bill, and 1 sufparticularly urge the Minister to take those points into consideration and toand not proceed with the bill any further at this stage. After all, there is reno very great hurry about any' of its provisions, and it would be unfortunate if changes in the patents law were made without full consideration of the various points of view. I illustrate that by turna ing at once to the points I intend to payemphasize. Clause 2 deals with the publication of complete specification. . There is considerable delay, which I recognize being owing to staff difficulties in the Patent Office, in examining applications, inand, as the result of that, a complete for specification may be lodged and a very substantial time elapse before the matter comes to finality. The delay, as the Minister pointed out, is' serious, because it abridges the inventor's right in his invention, by abridging the life of his patent, which operates from the date of applicaBut I notice that the words in the reproposed new provision are theseAfter a complete specification has been the Commissioner shall publish in the Australian Official Journal of Patents, Tradeand Designs a notification that the specification is open to public inspecand, thereupon, the complete specification and provisional specification -(if any) shall be bill, open to public inspection. In his second-Teading speech, the Ministo ' ter' indicated that the design of' that provision was "" to provide for the publication of the complete specification forthwith after lodgement at the Patent Office"". So I take it that the intention is that, forthwith, after the complete speprincipal cification has been lodged, there is to be publication in the manner described the remaining words of the proposed new section. On that, 1 point out to the House that the Official Journal is usually its steud:despatched, or it was when I last knew of of ""91A -.'(I. it, each week to the patent offices of all principal countries. Therefore,, if the ceedings proposal be carried out, the complete spelike cification of an invention will be pubinterested lished in those countries 'shortly after filing of the complete specification in Australia, and that will seriously affect the validity of subsequent overseas patent that the threats applications of the inventor. Let me junction make that quite clear. The inventor puts in a complete specification in Australia. He, perhaps, intends to secure protection in other countries. Time must elapse ings between his filing his complete specification in Australia and his making application abroad, unless be has the great . fortune to bring his .invention to a final satisfactory state very early in the piece. If , in fact, .the' inventor, having filed the complete specification in Australia, proceeds - by the ordinary course of the post to take steps to make applications in other countries, his applications may be confronted when they arrive by the fact that his invention has been published in those countries anticipation of the claims that he is makproposed ing. This advance publication of his vention in another country may turn out attorney by sayingto invalidate his application when it is made in that country. I suggest very any earnestly for the consideration of the ""Minister that the real remedy is to telegraphed insert at the beginning of the clause the words "" not less than three months"". provided The proposed new section would then person rea'd-; Not less than three months after a complete specification has been lodged the Commissioner .shall publish . . . Then the inventor would have three months-of grace in which to forward his applications in-other countries.. The next point arises on clause 7, which deals with what the lawyers call "" a threats action"", in the patent law, the kind of action provided under the principal act when threats are made of legal proceedings on behalf of some inconsults vention that turns out to be invalid. There is a provision in section 91A of .the act dealing with the matter. It is now proposed in this bill to substitute in a new provision. Clause 7 providesSection ninety-one A of the Principal Act it repealed and' the following section inserted in. ) Where any person, by mean* circulars, advertisements or otherwise threatens any person, with any action or profor infringement of a patent, or other proceedings, .then whether the person making the threats is or is not entitled to or in a patent, or is or is not interested the in an application for a patent, any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him and may obtain a declaration to the effect are unjustifiable and an inagainst the continuance of the threads, and may recover such damages (if any) as he has sustained thereby, unless the person making the threats satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the proceedwere threatened constitute or if done would vonstitute(a) an infringement of a patent in respect of a claim in the specification which is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid; or (6) an infringement of rights arising from the publication of the complete specification in respect of a claim therein which is not shown to be one which would be invalid if a patent had been granted in respect thereof. The person who writes the actual threat will, perhaps in nine cases out of ten. be in a solicitor or a patent attorney. The new section goes on to deal, with in the cases of a solicitor or a patent (2.) Nothing in this section shall render solicitor or patent attorney, in respect of any act done by him in his professional capacity on behalf, and with the written or authority, of his client, liable to any action or proceeding under this section, that the solicitor or patent attorney produces the authority for inspection by the threatened or satisfies the court that the authority was received by him but has been inadvertently lost or destroyed. ' So the solicitor or the patent attorney will beliable to a threats action, unless be can produce or explain the"" non-production, unless be can prove-let me put itthat way-writte n or telegraphed ' authority from his client to write the - letter containing the threat. That is a very far-reaching restriction on the ordinary relation between solicitor and client. It is a novelty that a client who a solicitor and instructs him to take charge of a proceeding for him should have to give any written authority to the solicitor to issue a letter, which is a perfectly normal step in proceedings of that kind. In the same way, it would be a remarkable evasion of the ordinary position of a solicitor or patent attorney if, being threatened i i i this way, be was able to prove that his client had told him to write the letter but was not able to show be bad got authority from his client in writing. That seems to me to be an entirely unnecessary invasion..",25
50,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I thought lawyers insisted-on having everything in writing.,27
51,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"No . The Minister will perhaps be surprised to be told that 95 times of 100 a solicitor who acts for a client has acted for bim many times, and. there is no question of getting written authority. They act on the basis of mutual confidence.. .But this provision will make it necessary that the solicitor or patent attorney shall protect himself in ' relation to correspondence of this kind by securing the written authority - of his client. The third point I want to mention is - contained in sub-section 3 of proposed new section 91A. It says The High Court shall have jurisdiction to - hear and determine any action or proceeding under this section. This, I venture to say with great respect to the draftsman, is a complete oversight. The threats action usually produces a counter claim for infringement, as the honourable - member for Warringah (Mr . Spender) knows. The man who has been threatened with proceedings says, "" Very well, I shall tackle you. You are the defendant in my action for damages for your threats "". Then the man who made the threat replies, "" You are inf ringin g my patent and I shall sue you for infringement"" . Consequently, in the experience of patent lawyers, it almost inevitably happens that an action for threats will produce a counter-claim, for infringement. The threats action may, under this proposed new sub-section, be brought in the High Court, but infringement proceedings can be brought only in the Supreme Court. There was, at one stage, a proposed patents bill in which it was intended to give jurisdiction to the High Court in infringement proceedings; but until jurisdiction is given to the High Court in infringement proceedings, it is absurd to say that the man who is claiming on the "" threats "" may go into the High Court, and the other person who wants to take the normal counter-action must go into a Supreme Court. That is a serious anomaly, and until the High Court is giveij infringement jurisdiction, the proposed sub-section should not be agreed to. The last matter to which I desire to refer arises in clause 8, which provides for the insertion in the principal act of the following new section:112u - (1.) A person shall not falsely represent that he or any other person, is the patentee of an invention. (2.) A person shall not falsely represent that any article sold by him is patented in Australia or is the subject of an application for a'patent in Australia. That is. a very wise provision, and 1 entirely agree with it , but I ' am at a loss to understand why proposed new subsection 3 has been inserted. Proposed new sub-section 2 is in perfectly general terms, and in quite effective terms, but proposed new sub-section 3 states(3.) For the purposes of this section(a) a person shall be deemed to represent that an article is patented in Australia if there are stamped, engraved or impressed on, or otherwise applied to, the article the word "" patent "" or "" patented "", the words "" provisional patent"", or any - other word or words expressing or - implying that a patent for the article has been obtained in' Australia; and (6) a perfon shall be deemed to represent, that an article is the subject of an application for a patent in Aus_ ti'alia - if there are stamped, engraved or impressed on, or otherwise applied to, the article the words "" patent applied for"". "" patent pending"" or any other word or' words implying that an application for a patent for the article has been, made in Australia. As honourable members know,' many patented articles made abroad, for example in .the United Kingdom or the .United States .of America, have stamped upon them the word "" patented "",'or the words ""patent applied for "" or the number of the patent given in the United States' of America Patent Office or the Patent Office of Great B r it a in . If that article comes into Australia, as it very frequently will for sale, the label, stamp or mark cannot be removed; and yet there may be a serious danger of the seller of the article being prosecuted fora breach of this proposed new sub-section, because a person shall be deemed to represent that an article is patented in Australia if there are stamped, engraved or impressed on it the words "" patent"" or ""patented"". In my view, that matter deserves very careful thought. I consider chat proposed new sub-section 3 should he left out. Surely the language of proposed new sub-section 2 is perfectly adequate. It is a very simple matter of fact to decide whether a. man is putting * on the goods some mark which suggests that they are patented in Australia, ff, in the view of the tribunal, that is the effect of the label, then he is guilty of a breach of this proposed new section. But if the label states quite plainly that the article is patented in some other country, then in the interests of ordinary international trade, no barrier should be put in the way of goods so marked being sold., ' To summarize my speech, I invite the ' Minister to consider the points which have raised about the publication of complete specification, about the provision for another authority from client solicitor or patent attorney in a threats action, about the anomaly created by section 3 of proposed new section 91A, and about articles which come into AusSupreme Court? tralia marked with some reference to a patent abroad.",27
52,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Melbourne Ports - Minister for Labourand National Service) [11.6] - in reply-Knowin qualifications of the Leader of the. Opposition (Mr Menzies) to deal with patent, law, my colleagues and I must and will take notice of the points that be has its stead:raised. I do not desire to take any action which will in any way destroy the to ""(3.) efficacy of, this small bill to three objectives. The first is to encourage and assist the development of Australian industries by informing as quickly as possible about pending patents or changes of technological out. method. We do not want them to tool-up, and generally prepare to make articles, only to discover later that petitor abroad has a new process of manufacture which' will make their method obsolete. In addition, we do not desire to clutter up and increase the work of the patent examiners by obliging them to devote a. great deal of time to examining provisional applications which sometimes are not followed up with complete specifications. As the Leader of the Opposition will agree, that must be short-circuited. We. desire also to protect the patentee, whose rights in a patent are reduced by the momentum of scientific changes - Sixteen years now seems to be a much shorter period than it was in the last century. If we waste two or three years of .that period before we can announce that the patent is sealed and admissible, we shall do a great deal of barm.",28
53,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I agree with that view. The object of the bill, is most commendable, but the measure itself is a little short of perfection.",28
54,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Those three objectives must be preserved. The officials of the Attorney-General's Department will carefully examine the suggesI tions of the Leader of the Opposition. I the am prepared to agree now to the deletion of sub-section 3 of proposed new section to 91A, which provides that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to bear'a sub- "" threats "" action. Wby should not the whole of the proceedings be heard by the Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: g the "" - Clauses 1 to 6 agreed to.

Debate resumed from the 25th July (vide page 3117), on motion by Mr. SCULLYThat the bill he now read a second time.",29
59,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Forrest) [11.52] When I obtained leave on the 25th July to continue my remarks I bad completed what I wished to say on the. necessity for the introduction of this bill. I intend now to discuss the policy being applied under the existing legislation, and, in particular, to devote some attention to the need to encourage the marketing of beef, lamb and pig meats on the weight, and grade basis. This, in my opinion, is absolutely necessary if we are to ensure .a better return to the producers. Sales by auction on commission should be abandoned. It is also necessary to take action to avoid the wastage that occurs in stock through trucking and untrucking at auction sale-yards. We have heard a good deal in the course of this debate' about the high quality of New Zealand or, as it is called, Canterbury lamb. One important reason why New Zealand lamb and young beef can be marketed in such good condition. is that the stock is not required to undergo long train journeys. In fact, only a minimum of time, elapse? between the removal of the stock from the pastures and the slaughtering of it at the abattoirs. The procedure - in Australia, is quite different, for generally speaking, our lambs and young cattle have to be trucked for long distances from the pastures to the sale-yards and the abattoirs or factory, and during such has' journeys the stock suffer considerable wastage. In New Zealand the abattoirs ""are usually situated close to the pastures, and as a rule only about 8 hours elapse .from the time that the stock leave the pastures until the meat is banging in the chilling chamber. In Australia it frequently happens that three days elapse. The wastage starts immediately the stock leave the pasture. This occurs through the absorption' by the animal of juices or, as the trade says, the sap, owing to the animal being without food. The retention of this sap is important if we desire to win a better name on the English' market. The sap, or "" sogginess "", is retained in-the New Zealand, meat. I believe that our auction sale system, involving, as it does, long train journeys, results in heavy economic loss in weight and quality. We must do everything possible to avoid this. ' The attitude adopted by the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) to this bill was extraordinary. Early in his speech he objected, to the provisions in the measure which conferred certain powers on the Controller of Meat Supplies. He said that the Minister ought to have more direct responsibility and should not be able to shelter behind the Controller. He then objected to the transfer of power from the Controller to the board and later said that, as the Minister would have certain auwority over the board, the Minister would be in the position of a czar. First of all, therefore, the honourable gentleman objected to the transfer of power from the Controller to a board, and then he objected to the Minister having authority over the board in certain respects. He also criticized the actions of the Controller during recent times, although his colleagues, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), highly praised the Controller for the work be had done during .very difficult days. The honourable member for'Ind i attacked the controller because of actions taken by him to oblige processors to observe the law'of the land in regard to price control.",29

65,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable gentleman objected because the Controller of Meat _ Supplies was endeavouring to ensure the observance of the economic policy of Australia, which includes prices control. That policy is breached only by persons who place food on the black market. It is rather strange, that the able gentleman should have defended actions of that kind on three occasions in this House. He did - so when there was black marketing in fodder, again when there was a strike by meat operators because they could not make enough profit to suit themselves, and on the third occasion when there was black marketing in pig meats. Yet, be will flap the Union Jack in this House until it is in shreds.",30

68,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It is rather strange that the honourable member for Richmond should find it necessaiy to take exception to my statements, although the honourable member to whom I referred is in the House. The honourable member for Indi makes statements about other Honourable members during their absence from the chamber, and in that respect differs from me. On three occasions, honourable members opposite . have condoned by their actions in this House, black marketing throughout this country. Ceiling price? are essential if we are to continue to supply butter, pork and pig meats to Great Britain. Honourable members opposite would feed the already overfed, while denying to the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to obtain food at the prices at which Australia' hat contracted to supply it. As the honourable member for Indi was the spokesman for the Australian Country party, that honorparty must be held responsible for the policy that he expounded. He objected to control, first by the Controller of Meat Supplies, secondly, by the Australian Meat Board, and, thirdly, by the Minister. The only concrete suggestion that he made in the course of a long speech was that the bill should be rejected. He wants a "" free go "", not orderly marketing under a grower-controlled board. His policy throughout has been to return' to the open market.. He would allow the whole of our primary products to pass into the hands of the speculators and profiteers. He said that the board is a "" political sham"". The policy adopted on the three occasions I have mentioned proves that the Australian Country party is a <: political sham "".",30
69,Mr TTJRWBTJLL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wimmera) [12.5]. honourable member for Forrest (Mr. in Lemmon) on many occasions since 1 j memhave been a member of this House; but of I concede that it would be in the best interests of the export of our fat lambs if more freezing works were opened in inland centres. Lambs that travel long tances do not usually arrive at their destination in as good a condition as those that can be killed shortly after leaving their pastures. It must not be considered, however, that occasionally lambs that have travelled long distances are not better than those that have travelled a short distance. Lilydale, in Victoria, is approximately 40 or 50 miles from Newmarket, whereas the distance to Patchewallock is 300 miles. Lamb3 from Lilydale, loaded into trucks at 11 a.m., are bandied in the market on the same day, whilst lamb3 from Patchewallock, which are trucked on a Sunday night are not handled at Newmarket until the following Tuesday; yet these latter are in better condition in the market than are those from the adjacent grazing or fattening area of Lilydale. Nevertheless, it is important that killing centres should be opened in different districts of Victoria and other States. This system has been tried in Victoria, works having operated at . Ballarat, Murtoa, Donald and Bendigo. Some of those works proved .a dismal failure. The works at Ballarat and Bendigo are functioning, but those at Murtoa have been closed. I was pleased to hear recently that the Donald works will he reopened during this season. The trouble previously was caused by the adoption of the weight basis of killing. This resulted in so many lambs being put into the works that, within a week or so, some of them could not be killed and bad to stand in the yards because of lack of sufficient killing space.  the inland killing works.",30
70,Mr TTJRNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It happened at Murtoa, and that was one indirect reason why the works had to close. On that account, certain lambs were "" docked"" and were designated second quality and third quality, although they were first quality when they entered the works. That difficulty can be overcome. I am not using it as an argument against the extension of the system. Any extension of inland killing which the Minister may see fit to make will have my unqualified support. This is an important bill. The honordis- able member for Forrest has made many references' to the Australian Country party. When he spoke previously, he stated that that party bad advised certain fat lamb-raisers not to mate Downs ram* with their ewes. Tbat charge is misleading. I have advised many personsnot to mate Downs rams with their ewes. The matter is governed by the circumstances. We know that Downs lamb is the best for export purposes. A statement in general terms, and having such wide implications as that of the honourable member for Eorrest, would make it appear that the members of the Australian Country party were advising producers not to raise the best class of lamb.",31
71,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Does the honourable member deny that members of the Australian Country party gave that advice ?,31
72,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not deny it. But the honourable. member either has attempted to confuse the issue or has no knowledge of lamb-raising; because there are occasions on which, as the Minister knows, it is not in the best interests of the industry to mate Downs rams with certain ewes. For example, some parts of northern Victoria occasionally experience a series of droughts. In such circumstances, ewes are mated with Border Leicester rams, the reason being that, in a dry season when lambs cannot be fattened, the grower has a good store line. One would not think of mating a Downs ram with a very fine Comeback ewe, but one would mate it with a Border Leicester or an English Leicester or a Romney Marsh ewe; because, the result of mating a Downs ram with a fine Comeback ewe would be to throw back to the merino,.which would not be a good export lamb. Therefore, the decision, depends upon the district in which the lambs are raised, factors to be taken into consideration being freedom - from drought and the breed of ewe being mated. Consequently, members of the Australian Country party against whom the charge has been made, have done the right thing, not the wrong thing. Perhaps I should thank the honourable member for Forrest for having drawn attention to the matter.",31
73,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"In other words, the advice was not to breed any lambs for export.",32
74,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Not at all. Does the honourable member know that, at the Newmarket saleyards, the largest in Australia, if not in the world, the biggest, proportion of the fat lambs sold are bred from Border Leicester rams, for the sole reason that they are bred in certain districts and make a good store line if they cannot be fattened? Downs cross lambs which cannot be exported as fat lambs are not much good for any other purpose. The honourable member has either tried to confuse the issue or lacks knowledge of the subject.",32
75,Mr LEMMON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I have grown more lambs than has the honourable member.,32
76,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I have been handling them all my life. Because of the time that has elapsed since the bill was last discussed, its purpose may not, be quite clear to some honourable members. It is "" a bill for an act to provide for the transfer of the powers, authorities and functions conferred upon and exercised by the Controller of Meat Supplies and the Meat Canning Committee appointed under the National Security (Meat Industry Control) Regulations and the National Security (Meat Industry) Regulations respectively to the Australian Meat Board during the continuance of the National Security Act 19391946, and the regulations thereunder"". I believe that the authority in question should rest where it now resides, so that, when any action is taken, it will not be attributed to the so ealled producercontrolled board, but the light will be thrown on those actually responsible. The only result of the restriction of open competition, of which there was an example in Victoria recently, is to cause loss to the producer. The reason given by the Minister for the introduction of this measure cannot be accepted. He has said that its object is to stop black marketing. It has been claimed that uecause meat was sold above ceiling prices at Newmarket and elsewhere, purchasers could not retail it with 1 - out themselves resorting to black marketing. The price fixed for the one bid at auction was stated to be in re^tion to the price permitted in retail sales. Honourable members will recall that this onebid isystem did not last long. Having acquired meat for a time, the Minister decided to allow the business to revert to the conditions that obtained prior to his intervention. When the restriction was imposed, chaos ensued at Newmarket. A few of the producers sent their stock tn the saleyards,- but the majority of thern withheld supplies until the restriction? were lifted. The effect of that withholding of supplies has been reflected in the heavv winter yardings, which, during the last eight or ten weeks, have probably been heavier than those that bad been experienced for many years. That this invasion of the market is not in the best interests of either the producer or the consumer will readily be realized. ""When it appeared that prices would be permanently lower on account of the enforcement of the restriction of one bid, many fatteners sold their stock in the paddocks, at rates much lower than those which had prevailed before the auction. They sold them to speculators and other persons with whom true producers do not want to deal to a great degree. As. I have said, the rates were much lower than those which prevailed before the auction, and were definitely lower than those that have prevailed since the restrictions were lifted. It is well known that, generally speaking."" there is only a limited time in which to market fat stock if they are to be sold in prime condition. Especially in wintertime, when feed is short and the weather is cold, there may be just one week in which stock can he marketed in order : to get the maximum return. It is probable that when chaotic conditions prevailed in the Newmarket sale-yards a good proportion of the stock passed this peak period, and the owners will never have opportunity to recoup the losses then sustained. It is, of course, recognized that we cannot provide against an act of God, but it is also true that, many of the stock lost 'in the disastrous floods of the western districts of Victoria would have. been sold in Victoria before that date bad normal conditions prevailed at Newmarket. If the Government proposes in future to take action which might lead to .nidi chaos, it should, not shelter behind a board which allegedly represents the primary producers. All the indications are that restrictions similar to the onebid provision at Newmarket may be introduced again, and if that is done chaos must result. I maintain, that in such a case the spotlight should be focused, upon, those really responsible.",32
77,Mr FULLER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Hume) [12.17] During the course of this debate it has been interesting to note the line-up of the Liberal party and the remnants of the Australian Country party, who are now in poor favour with recognized farmers' organizations. They are being supported by the vanquished Liberal party, which has fought every attempt by the farmers to shake the middlemen and food speculators off their backs. An unholy combination of men who have consistently betrayed the organizations of genuine farmers is suddenly blossoming forth.as the champion of a newly formed organization. It was obvious, of course, when the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) was questioning the bona fides of the Australian Wool and Meat Federation and, in particular, pointing the finger at the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Federation, that he was grieved because be was not able to dictate the policy of those organizations.. The members of the New South Wales Wheat . Growers Union have a stake in the meat industry equal to that of any other organization of similar calibre, affiliated with the Australian Wool and Wheat Federation. It is obvious that the Opposition, particularly the Australian Country party, is. attempting reprisals, and using another organization for the purpose. In naming the two meat producers' organizations, and in providing for majority representation of producers on the Australian Meat Board, the Government has gone immeasurably farther than did ihe previous government when it gave the producers only minority representation. Yet we find the Leader of the Australian Countiy party (Mr Fadden) and the Deputy Leader (Mr MCEwen), expressing dissatisfaction with composition of the board, and being cheered on by the Leader of the Liberal party (Mr Menzies) and the Deputy Leader (Mr Harrison), who would not know beef from mutton unless they were cooked. The Liberal party appears now to be deeply interested in obtaining representation for the newly formed organization with a rural name. ' What is the reason for this nascent interest in rural affairs? The tie-up between the Australian Countiy party members, who are peeved because they cannot dominate recognized producers' organizations, and the Liberal party, which believes in the law of supply and demand, and which, therefore, has never been in favour of farmers' organizations, stimulates the belief that the Primary Producers Union is either the foster-child of political parties in the Opposition, or that it is expected to be more pliable than the recognized farmers' - organizations. There is nothing in the name of this new organization to indicate what section of producers it claims to represent. We know that all growers of wheat and wool are stock-owners, and have a vital interest in meat prices. We know that among the members of the organization are no persons who do not own any stock. That cannot be said of the Primary Producers Union, which ' might include-and no. doubt does include-person s who have not - the remotest interest in meat or stock. I understand that some of the members are berry-growers in the Dandenong Ranges, some are market gardeners, others apple-growers, whilst there are other producers whose interests are not .even remotely connected with meat. The Minister has pointed out that the board will consist of four representatives of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of the pig producers. Parliament is not asked to take a step in the dark. It is proposed to set up a meat industry board, and we know that this measure ensures that such a board will be appointed.",33
78,Mr RANKIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order in reading his speech, and reading it very badly? ' The DEPUTY SPEAKER,--The the honourable member is merely referring to his notes; he is not reading his speech.",33
79,Mr FULLER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Honourable members opposite do not like to listen' to anything that gets' under their skins. All last week they were hurling innuendoes across - the floor of the House, but when we - throw something back they winge. However, they will ' not stifle my voice. I am here to speak for the primary producers, and I will do so. Is Parliament expected to examine the views expressed by producers' organizations in order to find out whether they are in accord with the political views of members opposite? That is actually what members of the Australian Country party and the Liberal party want. The bill provides for majority representation of the meat producers on the board. Those who have no political axe to grind will not ask for more. "" Therefore, I support the measure.  L support - the measure, believing that it is an advantage upon previous legislation providing for the handling and disposal of meat. Honourable members will realise that meat is a difficult commodity to deal with-for governments, for primary producers, for butchers and for processors. Meat is very perishable, and its production depends upon the-seasons. It is true that, before the Avar, there was an Australian Meat Board, but it ceased to operate when war broke out. An attempt was made""under the National Security Regulations to bestow, its powers upon the Australian Meat Industries Commission, but unfortunately the Senate disallowed the regulation. Subsequently, the whole matter of meat export, control became, the concern of the present meat board, established under National Security Regulations. Now. that the war is over, the Government believes that a new board should be established, and it has provided for the. constitution of a board to deal with the control of meat exports. The bill provides that the board shallconsist of twelve members, with a chairman appointed by the Government, seven representatives of various sections of meat-producers, and the other members representing publicly owned abattoirs, privately owned moat works, and the workers engaged in the industry. If the board is properly selected it will be thoroughly representative. I have no doubt that it will'prove to be satisfactory, because the members will be selected f r persons nominated by the various interests concerned. The board will discharge most important functions. Under the terms of the meat agreement with Great Britain , the whole of our exportable surplus will be sent to B r it a in for u specified number of years. The board will have authority to purchase meat on behalf of the Commonwealth, to advise the - Government generally, and to be the main authority dealing with the subject. The board will be also authorized under its licensing powers to prevent the licensing of any exporter unless he, under instructions from the board and the Minister, is prepared, to accept stock on a graded basis. That is a marked advance on previous legislation. It will ensure the protection of the producers from speculators and dealers, and from the great'meat trust operating in Australia. When people of that kind depress markets as the result of questionable methods or the eliminition of their 'competitors-and they havf donethat repeatedly ..in-the past-fth e primary producer has' recourse to operating on the weight and grade basis at the works which will be financed by the Meat Board. I am glad that this measure ha? reached .a stage which will ensure its passage during the l if e of this Parliament. The substantial producer representation on the board'and the powers to be vested in the board constitute a marked improvement on the set-up of meat board establisbed by earlier administrations. In that regard the measure gives effect to the policy of this Government in contrast to that of former governments. Here are some interesting statements relative to the operation of legislation introduced by earlier administrations in connection with this industry:The tardy recognition by the Federal Government of the vital importance of primary production in the national Avar effort is entirely in keeping with the attitude of indifference manifested by the same political forces over the past decade. Whilst secondary industries supplying equipment and foodstuff? are accorded production costs, plus a profit as' a matter of course, primary producers artbeing compelled with varying success, to use political pressure in an effort to obtain production costs for essential foodstuffs commandeered by the Federal Government. Upon the various boards constructed by the Federal Government to handle primary commodities o m there is evidence of political patronage rather than of a desire to provide suitable and adequate representation for those who produce and own the products. ' No Labour man, no political propagandist, could have uttered truer words about was rampant. the incapacity and political shortcomings, of governments which held office in the national Parliament for a decade prior to March, 1941. I did not make that statement but I was interested in it as it had been made in Ballarat, and I found on inquiry that it bad been read to - the twenty-sixth annual conference of the United Country party held in Ballarat in March, 1941, and that it was published over the signature of no less a person than Mr George Bowden, now the honourable member for Gippsland in this Parliament and a prominent member of the Australian Country party. If a representative of the Labour party had made such a statement it would have immediately been characterized as partypolitical propaganda. What was the composition of the Commonwealth governments to which the statement refers? For nine years prior to 1941 composite governments supported by honourable members opposite were in office in the National Parliament. In such a government in 1941 the honourable member for fndi (Mr MCEwen), held ministerial rank as did also the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). The honourable'member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), was a member of the governments in office for almost the whole of that period. Thus Australian Country party supporters bad been associated with those governments over a long period of years, yet the best the annual conference of the United Country party could say about them was that they had been guilty of political patronage and that during their term of office the farmers bad experienced the greatest difficulty in obtaining their just dues. It is true that when the stateunable ment was made the honourable member for Â£ndi' was not a member of the Australian Country party; be was then on the "" outer "" having been associated with the break-away faction; but be was on the crawl back and not long afterwards was again received into the fold. However, conditions did - not improve for the primary producers, particularly the pig producers of this country, until October, 1941, when a Labour government came into power. . From then onwards conditions improved substantially and continuously for the primary producers. ",33
80,Mr RANKIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"And political patronagt-  truth or falsity of that statement, political patronage could not have existed in a more marked degree than it did during the regime of governments composed partly of members of the party which the honourable member himself supports. If it be true that political patronage exist? today the worse that may be said is that we are following in the footsteps of previous administrations in which members of the Australian Country party held office. I should like to say a word or two about inland killing in which the honourable member . for Wimmera (Mr. TurnbuU) affirmed his belief today. Many loose statements have been madr about that subject during the debate on this bill. I believe in inland killing. Many years ago the farmers of Victoria raised the necessary money with the assistance of the Commonwealth Government to finance and operate co-operative killing works at Ballarat, Bendigo, Murtoa and Donald. The honourable member for Wimmera has right told us that those works were dismal failures because they had operated on the weight and grade basis, with the result that sheep were kept too long in the stock-yards before being killed.",35
81,Mr TTJKNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Tbat statement applied only to the meat works at Murtoa.  failed because they were too close to Donald, with the result that they were to draw lambs from a sufficiently wide area. If the works at the other centres were dismal failures it was not because they bad operated on the weight and grade basis but because of the machinations of subtle, keen, clever' representatives of the great meat combine which, when it found that the farmers had established their own co-operative works, sent, agents into the areas in which the works were located and wheedled the farmers away from their own, co-operative concerns by offering them an additional 5s. or 6s. on the hoof if they would take their stock to the combine's works. One of the directors of a co-operative works who was a member of the Victorian Parliament confessed in the Parliament that be bad sent his lambs to W. Angliss and Company (Australia) Proprietary Limited because he thought he would get a little more for them. As the result of the loss of patronage brought about in that way"" the works collapsed financially and they bad to be taken over by the Victorian Government. Their collapse can be attributed solely to the operations of the great meat combine and the speculators who batten and fatten on the primary producers of this country. Another factor which caused the collapse of these works was the existence in Victoria of a composite government of the Nationalist and Countiy parties. It was so inefficient in its administration of the affairs of the State that when it was followed by a Labour government in 1929, and Mr Slater became Minister for Agriculture and I became his Assistant Minister, we found that the Victorian inland killing works, which at that time were being operated by a board of directors responsible to the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, were gradually - getting further and further into debt. ""We found that the directors were going out into the paddocks and buying lambs oh a speculative basis, and that if after processing and export to the United Kingdom the market collapsed, the works had to meet the loss. We discovered further that they were uo longer killing stock on the weight and grade basis. The shrewd, competent, and wise Labour administration quickly issued, instructions to the directors of the works that henceforth they were not to buy on a speculative basis, that they were first to obtain firm orders from London and to buy on the basis of such orders, thus ensuring that no further losses would be made. In addition they were instructed to operate on the weight and grade basis. From that time ' onwards the works improved. These are the facts concerning the closing down of the great inland killing works in Victoria. I have dealt at length with this matter in order to clear up misconceptions and to inform the mind of the honourable member for Wimmera-. who obviously knows very little about it.",35
82,Unknown,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Sitting suspended from l.kh to 2.15  was suspended, I was about torefer to speeches made in this chamber on and before the 25th July about the handling of pig-meats. It is significant that, knowing of my intention, all the members of the Australian Country party are absent from the chamber. They saw fit to attack me in my absence. I have no objection to members of this Parliament using its facilities to state a case on any matter or to attack me or any one else, because that is their right, and I claim no immunity from attack, even in my absence, but it would be common decency for them to be here when I am about to defend myself. On the 4th July, the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) and I had a verbal passage at arms. He referred to a meeting of the Victorian Ham and Bacon Curers Association in Melbourne in 1945, and said, that at it an inspector was appointed, of course by the Government, to police the pigmeat - prices, and that I was in the chair. I was under the impression then that he was referring to a meeting in Melbourne on the 16fcb May this year, and 1 interjected, ""Yes, 1 was present"". But. as lie developed his speech, I realized that be was referring to the 1945 meeting, and. later, I made the following personal explanation:I , perhaps, misled the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) when I said that I warpresent at the meeting at which he alleged I occupied the chair. I neither attended nor chaired the meeting at which, according tn him, an exporter was appointed an inspectoi or pig-meat prices. It is true that from time to time, by invitation, I have attended meetings of the Newmarket Meat Producers Asso ciation, and other primary producer organizations of one kind and another, and I know that the honourable member has attended similar meetings, for he has been working hand in glove with-such organizations in their variousramifications. Tbat was my only comment. I made it quite clear that I was not at the 1945 meeting. I made no reference in that statement, because it was merely a personal explanation, to any subsequent meeting, but the honourable member for Indi, in this chamber, on the 25th July, in my absence, practically repeated his allegap.m. tion, notwithstanding that, after my personal explanation, he had accepted my denial. 'He saidl am bound to point out that the decision to appoint an inspector who was empowered to go to country auction sales is said to hav.e been made at a meeting. I emphasize that that meeting possessed some authority. Ultimately its authority was the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. By virtue .of the powers vested in him under National Security 'Regulations, the Minister was not at the meeting in person, but his delegate was there. That is the meeting at which the inspector ""-as appointedIt has been suggested that the delegate wag the honourable member for Ballarat. lie qualified the charge that, I had been present by using the words "" It has been s u g g e s t e d He read a letter .sent secretary of the Victorian H a m and Bacon Curers Association, Mr Johnston; who had seen a. press report of my statement during the passage - at arms. The report was not exactly complete. The honourable member for Indi read that letter and led the country and this Parliament to believe that, I was a liar. Since then I have been informed by letter that the secretary of the Victorian Ham and Bacon Curers Association, on the 29th July, sent the following telegram to the honourable member:Received your reply regarding meeting bacon curers. Advise meeting referred to in fhmsurd no connection with meeting which  that pig prices should conform to pig plan price.",36
83,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Did Mr Johnson giye the honourable member my answer to the telegram? able member has not been decent enough t.o make a personal explanation exonerating me.,37

The inference in this statement was that the meeting ''referred to ' was that convened hy the Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies in May, 1940, whereas in fact the discussion which took place in Parliament concerned the appointment of an inspector in 1945. Tho meeting which was convened by the Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies in May of this year was at the request of members of this association, and also the pig operators with a view to devising some plan whereby prices being paid in the markets for pigs could be stabilized at the prices laid down in the Pi<r Meat plan, and also of ascertaining i i margins in canning contracts were such as to permit operators to pay prices in excess of the plan price. S. regret any inconvenience or embarrassment our letter may have caused you, and trust the foregoing may to some extent rectify this. Tbat clarifies the situation, except that 1 desire to point out that, notwithstanding that I bad denied being at the 1945 by the meeting, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) saw fit to repeat the allegations of the honourable member for Indi in the following terms:The honourable .member for Ballarat did not chair the meeting. However, he was present at. the 'meeting and he addressed it as a representative'of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. This fact was not disclosed by the honourable member for Ballarat. He lead the House to believe that if he were there at all, he was present only in an innocuous capacity. He well knew that he was misrepresenting the facts. The truth is that from back in 1.945 the Controller of Meat Supplies was' having difficulty in obtaining the co-opevation of the ham and bacon curers and processors in adhering to the pig-meat plan, although he valiantly struggled with the problem that confronted him. At some date before the 16th May, in ' response, no doubt, to repeated complaints that had reached him and because of the observations of his officers at the market, he decided that an attempt must be made to bring the pigmeat plan into - effective operation as regards price margins, and he convened bad a the meeting of the ham and bacon etirers and processors held on the 16th May. It was attended by the Acting Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies, who telephoned to me and suggested that I attend.",37

87,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member could attend only as the honourable member for Ballarat.  tomed to sheltering in funk-holes I would not have gone, but 1 did go, and, before rhe meeting opened, I discussed the situation with the Acting Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies, who gave me the following memorandum to read:During the first four months of the present year no control has been .exercised over slaughterings. Curers have been placed on quota for local sales of bacon. In addition to this orders ire being carried out for supply of bacon to Australian Military Force, and for export on account of the British Ministry of Food. The balance of curers slaughterings were intended for shipment as frozen pork to the United Kingdom. During this period it has been found that the total sales of bacon to the local trade have exceeded the quota to a considerable extent and very little Ifas been - placed into store by curers for export as frozen pork, furthermore, prices have continued at levels very much in excess of the Pig-meat Acquisition Plan schedule. In addition, I perused the weekly return submitted in accordance with. the requirements of the pig-meat plan by the bam and bacon curers and processors of Victoria, and; without exception, those returns indicated that they had substantially pierced the ceiling prices for pigs on the hoof. Furthermore, in the week ended the 4th May, the returns indicated that 924 pigs that should have been sent to the people of Great Britain to assist them in their hour of need were put on the local market. As those pigs were withheld from export to Great Britain, and, as the pig-meat plan was being broken down, I had no hesitation, after'the meeting bad been opened with the Acting Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies the chair, in addressing .it in the plainest and strongestterms that I could muster, believing that it was essential, from many points of view, that I should do so. Af ter the chairman bad opened the proceedings and stated the position that existed, I appealed to the curers and processors to adhere to the plan. I mention in passing that also present were the Deputy Prices Commissioner and one of his staff.. I did not definitely state what would be the policy of the Commonwealth Government if the buyers did not play the game, but I did say that their own admissions and returns plainly showed that ' they bad broken away from a plan to which the Government required adherence. I said that, in my' opinion, if they did not return to the plan and play the game, the Government would have no hesitation, I believed, in . instructing the Prices Commissioner to take action, perhaps by reducing the margin between the price of the pig on the hoof and the price of bacon to consumers. Nothing else was said.' Those at the meeting appeared to realise from that statement that something was required of them. Immediately, they decided to hold' a meeting - among themselves, and announced that intention to the Acting Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies, the Deputy Prices Commissioner, and myself. I have nothing to bide in this matter. As no other room was - available, I suggested that the departmental officials and I should retire in order to allow them to discuss their business in private. Tbey replied, "" We having nothing to hide, and we do not object to your remaining in the room"". While they held their conference at one end of the room under their own chairman, I conversed at the otheT end of the room on general matters with the Acting Deputy Controller of Meal Supplies and the Deputy Prices Commissioner. I did not desire to bear, nor have I the faintest idea of'what methods the bacon curers and processors discussed to secure adherence to the plan. After they had concluded their business, their chair- man reported to the Acting Deputy Controller of Meat Supplies and myself that they decided to adhere to the pig plan.",38

According to allegations.. made in - this - chamber recently, the bacon curers and processors could observe the plan only by defying the Victorian Lot-splitting Act. All I can 'say, to those who made the allegation, is that I do not believe it to be a fact. I do not know their methods, but I do know that the Acting DeputyController of Meat Supplies and I did not advise them to ignore the Victorian LotTsplitting Act or even eliminate competition'. It was their business to decide bow they should play the game, bring into operation a system of fair dealing' - between man and man, and observe the requirements of the pig-meat plan.",38

On the 25th July last, one honourable member stated in this House that that meeting was a "" secret conclave"", and claimed that the representatives of the producers should have been present."" The meeting was not a secret - conclave. No meeting of any seGtion of the trade which is attended by the honourable member assisting the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and departmental officials could possibly be a secret assembly. From time to time, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have adopted the practice of conferring with outside authorities on particular subjects of immediate concern to the Commonwealth. About a week ago, members of the Australian Country party in this Hoiife condemned and abused the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture because be did not call into conference on the wheat legislation the representatives - of the Primary Producers Union. If the honourable gentleman had conferred with them, they would have met him in his office unaccompanied by any one else, and the discussions might have meant that finally the Minister, being impressed by their contentions would have agreed to incorporate in that measure a provision which would benefit the wheat-srrowers but could affect adversely all other sections of the community. Such a conference could not be called a "" secret conclave "", and in the same way, the meeting to which I referred was not a secret assembly.

91,Mr RANKIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It was a good imitation of one.  note that the Ham and Bacon Curers Association in effect repudiated the remarks of the honourable member for Indi. In addition, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr TurnbuU) repudiated his references to Mr Cullen, a member of the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association. The attack which the Australian Country party has made on this bill suggests to me a defence of black marketing. What is the difference between black marketing in primary products, and black marketing in motor cars or wearing apparel? There is none. In those circumstances, the Government was perfectly justified in endeavouring to prevent that kind of operation. What is' the - pig-meat plan? The scheme came into operation in 1943 as theresult of the recommendations of the Meat Industry Commission and the pig producers. It prescribed the price which should be paid to the producer, and the price at which operators should sell to the public and make meat available for export. The plan substantially improved the position of pig producers. In 1941. when the honourable member for Indi was a Minister in the Menzies Government, .pig prices were at a disastrously low level. According to the Argus of the 20tb. March, 1941, the price of prime lightweight pork was 29s. 6d. to 34s. od.; medium, 35s. 6d. to 40s. 6d.; heavy to ' 45s.; and extra heavy to 48s. The priee under the plan is Â£6 13s.",39
92,Mr RANKIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Not for pork.  The price of pork is correspondingly high. According to the Argus report, the price for prime porkers was 6d. to 6Â£d. per lb.; good, to o^d.; medium, 5d. The price of baconers was 5|d -.to 5$d. per lb.; good to 4-Ad. To-day, under the plan, the price is . 9d. per lb. I agree .that it is difficult for a person r,o judge on the boof the weight of a pig to within a few pounds. The honourable member for Indi, the honourable member for B.endigo and the honourable member for Richmond know, that persons who are familiar with the stock business can judge the weight of a lamb to within a couple of pounds.",39
93,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Will the honourable member inform' me whether the plan has resulted in a reduction of price to the consumer ?  ber for Richmond should know that at the meeting to which I referred, the Acting Deputy Prices Commissioner, as the result of the revelations, told the bacon curers and processors that if that kind of thing were possible, he would consider whether the margin between the price to be charged to the public and that which the processors were then paying to the producers should be reduced.",40
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL, Order ! The honourable member has exhausted his time.,40
95,Mr SCULLY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [2.40] - in reply-The honourable member for  thoroughly ' with the purposes of this bill, and the criticisms which honourable members opposite directed against it. The object of the measure is to transfer the powers, now exercised by the Controller of Meat Supplies to the board which will be established by this legislation, and at the outset, I believed that honourable members could not possibly object to it. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) made many statements of such a questionable nature that they destroyed the whole force of his argument, and filled his listeners with a sense of repugnance. He lowered the standard of this Parliament. The honourable member for Indi was supported, although less offensively, by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), who appeared in a new role. In the past, be was alwaysa clean fighter, and played the game. On this occasion he made innuendoes and. uttered half-truths. The honourable member for Ballarat effectively replied to bo'h honourable members. This Government has treated the meat producers with greater generosity than, was shown by members of the Australian. Countiy party who were Ministers in"" the Menzies Government. The honourable member for Ballarat referred to the exceedingly low prices which were paidto pig producers before the Labour Government took office towards the end of 1941. Equally low prices were payablefor fat lambs and other meat. In 1941, ' before we took office, the prices for pigmeats and fat lambs in Australia collapsed.. That disaster was caused by thecessation of shipping as the result of the Japanese threat. Although the primary producers appealed to the Menzies Government - for assistance, no effort was made to relieve their plight. Under the.authority of my predecessors, the Department of Commerce warned lamb producers not to joint their ewes at that: time. Pig-meat prices also collapsed. On the border of my electorate, there is a. big market for pig-meats. Because of theunprecedentedly low prices, some producers took their pigs back to their farms, some sold them for as low as 5s. each, and others were prepared to - give away a pig with - young pigs.' That was the kind of "" protection "" which members of the Australian Country party afforded to meat producers on that occasion. About that time, the honourable member for Richmond, who was Assistant Minister for Commerce, visited New Zealand, where a Labour government was in office. It bad the same problems as those which confronted the Commonwealth government of the day. What did the honourable member find? The Labour government rose to the occasion, and purchased all the meat at export parity and placedit in cold storage. The government expended millions of pounds, and, in doing so, took enormous risks; but ultimately, when the shipping services were restored, the whole of the meat was exported to the United Kingdom which required it so urgently, and the producers of New Zealand, under the Labour Government, ' were adequately protected.. When the honourable gentleman returned from New Zealand did he recommend that the Australian Government should act as the Government of New Zealand had done to protect the fat lamb and pig producers from absolute ruin? He did not. He was not prepared to take any risk. That is the difference between . the treatment of the producers by a Labour government and by a so-called Country party government which was Country party only in name. I wish to refer to despicable suggescontinue ? tions and innuendoes made during the debate that certain persons in the organization of the Controller of Meat SupCommerce plies had made a "" rake-off"" - More objectionable statements have never been made in this House, and an unjustifiable stigma has been cast upon officers who have been responsible for the sale of meat. Such attacks upon public officials debase the standards of Parliament. An unfair blow has been dealt at persons who. are not here to defend themselves. Yet the juncture. fight honourable gentleman for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) in the same debate, spoke in high appreciation of the - efficiency of the Controller of Meat plies and his staff. I have attended without amendment. meetings in the capital cities of Australia from Brisbane to Perth in company the Controller of Meat Supplies members of his staff and I have been pleased to hear the eulogistic references which have been made to tbem for sympathetic consideration they have given to the primary producers of tralia. That very fact gives the lie agreed. - direct to the baseless allegations that have been made during this debate. have no more to say, except that I for the sake of parliamentary propriety and the maintenance of a high standard - of debate, we shall not witness another such exhibition.

113,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Richmond) [2.55] That the bill be now recommitted to 'a committee of the whole House for reconsideration. My reason for doing so is that I consider it was quite wrong for the Chairman to put the question, "" That the hill be taken as a whole "". The measure contains eight clauses. The usual procedure is that each in clause shall be put. to the committeebis separately. Sometimes a chairman, in order to cause a bill to be passed quickly, especially' if it is an embarrassing withmeasure, may ask whether it is the pleasure of the committee that the bill be taken as a whole. I do not regard that as correct procedure. The clauses should 1 be called one by one. When that question was put to the committee some honourable members were otherwise engaged. Honourable members are entitled .to an to consider each clause, and 1 most strongly against the method Is adopted to push this bill through.

There were certain reasons wby the honourable gentleman may have done this.

125,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Fawkner) [3.13] - This is rather an involved measure, and the circumstances with which it proposes to deal may not be known by many members of the Parliament. There are aspects of it, and principles embodied in it, which I believe demand our close scrutiny. The Minister (Mr Holloway) said, in his F. second-reading speech, that honourable members on both sides of the House would 36 wish to redeem the pledge given to our 23 bona fide tradesmen that pre-war practices and customs would he restored, and 13 that we would also wish to provide a just measure of rehabilitation for men who AYES. had served in the fighting forces. ""With both of those sentiments, I am certain, all members will agree. The bill purports to give effect to undertakings that were given to unions and employers when the dilution agreements were made, and it is claimed that it will assist in the ' rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. I propose to address myself to both of those aspects. . First, howeverj I should like to make some remarks dealing with the history of this' matter. Early in 1940, it became clear that Australia would need to expand rapidly and extensively its Sheehan, T. facilities for making munitions. At that NOES. time, the role which Australia was to play in the war bad not been so clearly defined as was the case later. Japan was not in the war, and it was believed that large numbers of troops would not be sent from Australia, but that Australia would have an important part to play as a manufacturer of munitions, and in the supply of foodstuffs and goods of various kinds. At that time, reference was frequently made >to our position as the arsenal of the Pacific. If we were to expand our capacity to manufacture munitions, it was clear that we could not do so by using only qualified tradesmen in the traditional fashion. Tradesmen in the metal trades group, who were in key positions, had gone through five years of apprentices bip. Some had been elevated by their employers in the workshops, but only if they showed that they bad acquired the necessary degree of skill. The craft unions had guarded very jealously and justifiably the rights of their members, as, in die past, had other organizations associated with trades and professions. Tbey had stipulated that those who were to receive the title and the advantages of tradesmen should be properly, qualified. However, the war could not wait for everything to be done in the prescribed way. The emergency of war called for - emergency measures. Just as in Great Britain an arrangement was entered into between the representatives of the Government, the employers and the employees for what was termed the dilution of the metal trades, so we in Australia tried to bring about a similar result here. It was my responsibility, as the Assismatters, tant Minister for Supply at the time, game "". to preside at discussions early in1940 on these important matters. I think I can say with justice to those who attended - these conferences that worked out with, skill, and certainly the great advantage of the producing capacity of Australia, especially regardrepresentative ing munitions. The negotiation of the agreements was not easy. Strong views were held by the. representatives of employers and the employees. The early discussions were led, so far as employees were concerned, by representatives of what is, perhaps, the most powerful' significant union .in Australia, the Amaltook gamated Engineering Union. largely as the result of the leadership that union that other trades followed suit, and joined in the dilution arrangement The success of the agreement evidenced by the Minister's statement that 50,000 men were added to the various trades. Although many have now returned to their normal occupations, 20,000 of this added number still remain ment. . in the metal trades. I - have tioned' the Amalgamated Engineering Union, but there were five trades con- earned-engineers, boilermakers, smiths, electricians, and sheet workers. Some trades would not come into the scheme, and for that reason should be more appreciative of those that follows:did. The Minister, when the bill,' concluded his speech by expresscreated ing his appreciation of representatives the organizations of employers employees who had participated negotiations. I, as the Minister negotiated the agreement at the time, also wish to express my appreciation, and that able of other members oftbe Without wishing to make any invidious distinction, I feel justified in paying special tribute to Mr Cranwell, who led ditions the' Amalgamated Engineering during the war. Tbat union has given loyal and unstinted service to monwealth. It exercises - a of great _ - authority - and Mr Holt. because its workers are in key positionsi n practically every establishment of importance in Australia. In spite of the undoubted power which the union could exercise by departing from constitutional practices in industrial it has consistently "" played the Honourable members will obtain some idea of its importance when I cite the they were figures associated with the introduction to of dilutees. According to information placed before the Arbitration Court by a of the union, of the 50,000 dilutees engaged during the war, 37,000 entered the engineering unions, and of the those 1S,000 are still employed, in the industry. There is, of course, another engineering union, the Australasian . Society of Engineers, but the principal and Union, numerically, and the one which the lead in negotiations with the GoI t was vernment and the employers, is the Amalof gamated Engineering' Union. In Sep: tember, 1939, its membership was 28,000. - It reached a. peak figure of 72,000 in 1944, and its membership is now, I underreached is stand, 64,000. I now pass on to the statement of the Minister 'that this bill honours the undertaking contained in the dilution agreeSome honourable members will mennaturally wish to know what those undertakings were. They were embodied in a ' comparatively short and simple docublackment known as the Dilution Agreement. metal If I read some of the clauses of this document, it will be clear what we had we in mind at the time.

Clearly, there is a good deal of misunderpez'iod standing in the minds of many people, including members of Parliament, as to the arrangements made at that time. I will Jbe seen that, in the first place, set out-.to add to the number of men' working in the munitions industry, and secondly, to provide that recognized tradesmen would not be dismissed before dilutees-in other words, the first to come should be the last to go. I emphasize this because some persons have sought to read into the agreement a limitation on the capacity of the Government to provide for the rehabilitation of servicemen. Quite clearly, it would have been impossible at that time to lay down any bard and fast rule regarding the rights of servicemen. Nobody could predict what, would have to be borne by those who worked in the factories. It might be, and proved to be the case in other countries, that the factories would be subject to attack from, the air; or that, in the event of invasion, they might even be in the battle line itself. Thus, no one .could determine the rights of factory employees as against members of the services. We could not tell for example how long the men who enlisted in the forces would be required to serve. The war might be over in twelve months; it might not be over for ten years, and consequently no government with any sense of responsibility would have endeavoured to determine where its obligations ended. We did not attempt to do that, nor has any government since we were in office done so until this measure was brought before us. WhatNo ever this Parliament believes should be done with respect to theabsorption of certain members of trades or professions among returned servicemen, nothing that was'done by the government of which I was a member would limit its capacity to do so. The Minister told us that the purpose of this bill is to honour the undertakings given under the Dilution Agreement. Honourable members will find that it goes much further than that. I do not taken criticize the unions for pressing for the which they believe should be imposed. Tbey have a very considerable to membership to look after; they know that to their trades have expanded under the impact of the munitions programme, and they may foresee difficulties in maintaining in constant employment during a of possible declining production all those who have come into the metal trades. It is natural that as far as pract ticable they should seek to' restrict the we admission of other persons into their callings. They may regard the limited absorption provided in this measure as a gesture of willingness. on their part to rehabilitate ex-servicemen. I shall examine bow extensive that absorption is likely to be. By this bill the Government is establishing a very much greater protection than was contemplated in the Dilution Agreement, a greater protection than has ever been known before in the history of this country. We are limiting not only the right of the employer to revert to pre-war practices and, if he so desires, elevate or up-grade his employee as in the past, but we are also, making it virtually impossiblefor certain groups of persons to find their way into .the trades covered by this bill. "" I have already mentioned that there are five important trades so covered. If honourable members wish to get a quick view of bow extensive that limitation is likely to be, I suggest that they examine the schedule to the bill where they will see that the trades come under the headings of engineers, boilermakers, blacksmiths, electricians and sheet-metal workers.",44
126,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,-In fact the whole of the dilution trades.,47
127,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"-Tba t is so, but their members comprise a very substantial section of industry. Tbey constitute not merely the heart, but also most of the body of the metal trades group. The protection accorded to the members of the unions by this bill will create an unchallengeable vested interest and impose a serious limitation upon the rights of thousands of young ex-servicemen to enter the trades and trade classifications set out in the schedule to the bill. This limitation on the entry of members might almost bedescribed as a reversion to the practice of the mediaeval guilds. I turn now to the position of ex-servicemen. As I pointed out earlier the Minister has claimed that one of the principal functions of the bill is to provide a measure of rehabilitation. I am certain the Minister is-fully aware that the bill would have a very doubtful constitutional validity if it were not purely a rehabilitation measure. Consequently we must examine just how sound and warranted is the claim that the bill does in fact provide a measure of rehabilitation. The bers of those who have bad trade experience in the services within the respective categoriesis enormous. We would get some idea of the problem that would confront us should all of them, desire to engage in those classes of work. Quite clearly many thousands of them will not wish to do so. Indeed the applications already received suggest that only a very small proportion of those who had experience during the war, either in the Army or the Air Force- I have not been able to obtain the figures for the Navywill seek employment in the metal trades group.",47
128,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Coul d a migrant tradesman secure employment .under this bill ?,47
129,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member refers to a fully qualified tradesman from Great Britain ?,47
130,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Yes .,47
131,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I believe he probably could; that would depend upon the unions. As far as' I am aware, there is nothing in the bill which would limit h i ; right of entry. I am informed by the Department of the Army that excluding, personnel specifically enlisted as tradesmen, 14,400 persons were trained in the Army during the war within these trade classifications. I have been informed by Army authorities that the number of specifically trained tradesmen who entered the forces would more than equal the number trained while members of the forces. We may assume that the total number who had served in the Army and had trade experience, either received in the Forces or prior to their enlistment, would be approximately 30,000. The Department of Air is unable to supply up-to-date figures. Some statistics which were compiled in September, 1945, however give an idea of the numbers involved. At that time there were 38,700 personnel in the"" metal trade? mustering, of whom 13,000 had been tradesmen on entry. That indicates that 25,700 had received training in the met.nl trades group while in the Air Force. - Mr Holloway - Many of them would be motor mechanics.",47
132,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"No ; I asked the Air Force authorities not to include motor nummechanics and drivers. That they are 'lefinitely within the.groups I have mentioned is clearly shown from the following list of musterings which have been included in the figures I have cited:""Electrical TradesElectrician. Electrical Mechanic. Electrical Fitter. Electroplater. Fitter TradesArmourer. Fitter General. Fitter armourer. Fitter Motor Boat. Flight Mechanic. Fitter Works. Flight Rigger. 1 nstrument Repairer. Fitter HE. Instrument Maker. Fitter I1A . W/O. Engineer. Fitter DMT. Flight Engineer. Metal TradesCoppersmith. Metal Motor Body Turner. 'Builder. Welder.",47
133,Mr RANKIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The y are tradesmen?,48
134,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Whether they would be classified as tradesmen in the pre-war sense I am unable to say, but they were so classified in the Air Force. Tbey either entered as fully fledged tradesmen or underwent a period of training before being drafted into those musteringSi I propose now to examine bow the bill has dealt with the problem of the rights of those ex-servicemen and their opportunities for entry into the metal.trades groups. The bill provides that in the first instance there shall"" be this protection for the recognized tradesman! It does not give priority to the dilutee tradesman over the limited number of persons who may go into the trades from the Forces. In practice it is difficult to .see how such opportunities will exist for any substantial number of ex-servicemen if the dilutee tradesmen are to be retained in their positions. Tbat is one aspect of the bill which I believe should be given the most careful consideration. The Minister has told us that there were still 24,000 dilutee tradesmen in the metal trades. Compared with many ex-servicemen, they would not have had any experience of note when they entered the trade. Tbey engaged in the calling in a civilian capacity. On the other hand tens of thousands of ex-servicemen who did not have trade experience before they went into the services got their training while members of the Forces. Contrast the relative position of those two In one group there are 24,000 persons who are now employed in the metal trades and will apparently remain there. Only a fractional number of those who received their training in the services are likely to - be able to find their way 1 into the metal trades industry. Whether or not it is so specified in the bill, a definite preference and priority will be given to the dilutee tradesman who served in a civilian capacity over the dilutee tradesman who served in the fighting Forces. I ask the House to bear that point in mind.",48
135,Mr ABBOTT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"That means that a dilutee tradesman is to be given preference over ,ah ex-serviceman?",48
136,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Yes . Tbat is how I view the purport of the bill. If I am mistaken I should like the Minister to - point out my mistake. The second point is that the bill makes provision for some of these people who have been in the services to receive a period of training and subsequently to be taken into the metal trades. Tbey are described as trainee tradesmen. Another group is described as probationary tradesmen. In order to come within those categories they must first go through an elimination process. Tn the first instance there is automatic exclusion of those persons who had trade experience before - the war but who had no trade experience in the services during the war. I emphasize that, because it means that in practice a man who had two or three years of experience before the war as, say, a motor mechanic, but - enlisted and saw active service with a combatant unit, such as the infantry or the artillery, or as a fighter or bomber pilot, is automatically excluded from the right to be trained; whereas the man who received trade training during the war and perhaps saw no fighting at any stage, but served in the trade in which he was trained, does get the right, which, as I shall show, is a very limited right in practice, of training and subsequent absorption in the metal trades. This Parliament cannot accept for a moment a provision that would exclude men with some trade experience, whose sole disqualification is their service in fighting units during the war.",48
137,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They bad. some trade groups. experience before enlistment?,48
138,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Yes . I know of many of them. In committee, I propose to move an amendment that would have the effect of admitting them for consideration and training in the trades in which they have had experience. That is one point. The other is that the right is given to those who had experience during the war in a trade. Here again, although the bill is flaunted as a measure of rehabilitation, it restricts the right that existed under the regulations that it will replace. The regulationsprovided that if a man had trade experience during the war, he could be given a period of training. In other words, be may have served in a trade capacity for one or two. years and later gone into service, and, even if-he did not have any trade experience.in that service, be would have stili been eligible for. training the regulations. So the bill, far from extending as a measure of rehabilitation the right of these men, bas severely limited the field of those who will be eligible for absorption. In order to give the House some idea of how severe that limitation is, I say that I have been told that if the same rule bad applied from the outset as is laid down' in the bill, 50 per cent, of those accepted by the local committee for absorption would have been excluded. Therefore we have evidence of the hollownes3 of the claim that this is a rehabilitation measure. actually restricts the right that previously existed under the regulations. There are - many thousands of persons with the sort of experience that the bill purports to cover. Figures have been given to me in respect of Victoria. To the 12th July, 273 applications had been forwarded to the five local committees by the re-establishment division of the Department of .Post-war Reconstruction. That division makes its own eliminations before it sends ^applications to the local committees. It - does not send applications that it believes have no prospect of success. It sends the :applications of those who it believes .should receive the consideration of the - committees. Of the 273 applicationsJ. emphasize the figure of 273 out of many thousands-only 27 have been accepted, and 56 have been rejected, and the rest have not been dealt with finally. I do not know how many of the applications that are. not yet dealt with would be automatically excluded by the provisions that the Government has inserted in this bill. The Mr Molt. point that I bring to the notice of the House is that even the amendment that I will move in committee will not be of very much value, unless there is a considerably larger absorption than the figures at present available suggest if taking place. Another proposal that I make for the consideration of the Parliament is that there ought to be some direct representation of the Returned Sailors, Soldier? and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia upon the committees that are to be set up under this bill. The rehabilitation rights of ex-servicemen are directly involved, and it is only just that the committees set up to examine those rights under - should include people who have had war service and, as representatives of the league, are prepared to give direct personal attention to the rights of members.",48
139,Mr ABBOTT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The league bas no representation at all?,49
140,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"No prescribed representation. I originally contemplated moving an amendment that would add two representatives, of the league .to the central committee and to the local committees in the States, but I thought that it might be argued that that would overIt load the committees, even against representatives of the employees. So ' .1 thought it would be far better and, 1 hope, acceptable to the Government, that, one at least of the representatives nominated by the employers and employee? should be members of the league. I am certain that many members of the. league are engaged in the engineering trade.",49
141,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Thousands! .,49
142,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The Minister emphasises what I say. It should not be difficult for the union to nominate a member who is also a. member of the league. Similarly, on the employers' side, there are many representatives who would be eligible under that head. I hope that is one amendment that the Government will accept. - My third amendment will be to clause 41, which provides in sub-clause 4An application . . . shall, unless a Local Committee in a particular case otherwise, permits, be made within six months after the 'date of discharge of the member of the forces or after the twenty-second day of March, One thousand nine Imndred and fortysix . . . whichever is the later. In other words, March this year. Six months .from then will be about a fortnight hence. So I suggest that the Minister look at the figures in relation to Victoria-onl y 273 applications! Yet hundreds of thousands of people have been discharged from the services. Because little publicity has been given to this scheme, I am certain that few of them are aware of their rights.",49
143,Mr ABBOTT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Onl y 83 applications have been dealt with.,50
144,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Yes . The Government has been, apparently, aware of the difficulty of placing such a short limit of time on applications for training under the Reconstruction Training Scheme, because I am advised that it recently extended the period under which those applications may be made to twelve months after the date of discharge, or the 30th June, 1947, whichever is the later. If it is fairto extend the period of eligibility for training under the Post-war Reconstruction"" training scheme, it is equally fair that the Parliament should extend the period of eligibility under this scheme, at least until twelve.months after the date of the discharge or the 30bh June, 1947, whichever is the later. Tbat is all I desire to say at this stage on the bill, but I think the House will have heard enough to realise that it goes a ^.reat deal beyond what the Minister has - said. Our undertaking to the trade unions under the dilution agreements must be honoured, and all parties would desire that. But the bill goes a long way beyond that. In regard-to its second aspect, the Minister has erred in the other direction. He claims that it is a measure of rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. I do not accept it assuch and I am certain that no other honourable gentleman on this side does so. Judging by the communication that we have received from the representatives of ex-servicemen and by the disappointment expressed by those who have already realized that their rights to admission to the trades are f rustrated by the application of this measure, I believe that there is a vast body of indignation in the community against the bill. The Minister has the reputation of being a fair and reasonable man, and I do not wish to detract, from that. I believe that, conscious as he must nave been of the need to get a measure of agreement on this matter, he may not have realized the full extent of the exclusion of ex-servicemen with trade experience before or during the war. Consequently I hope that as the result of the matters being debated openly, he will accept as reasonable the amendments that I intend' to move. I have not drafted an amendment .so far that would go the whole way, although' I believe that the Parliament should do that. I have not drafted an'amendment that would bring in the man who had trade experience before the war and enlisted immediately on its'outbreak, and - therefore had no experience during the war in either his own or any other trade. To that extent even the amendments that I have suggested remain unsatisfactory.",50
145,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wb y not bring them in, too? Many air-crew members are excluded.",50
146,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Frankly , I had my amendments prepared before I became aware' that that group was excluded, although it might well be included. It would be a travesty of justice if the Parliament were to pass a measure to disqualify from training men who served in combatant .units from the outbreak of war. The DEPUTY .SPEAKER - Order ! - Tb e honourable member's time has expired.",50
147,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL," [3.59] - The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) clearly showed the defects of this bill, and I very much question the need for it. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) said in commencing his second-reading speechThis is intended to give effect to the undertakings given to the unions and further' to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. I think the honourable member for' Fawkner bas shown that the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen does not come into the bill. On the contrary, it excludes them and makes their position more difficult. Therefore, it is on that point principally that I desire to make a few observations. I say advisedly that many men enlisted, particularly in . the Royal Australian Air Force, who had experience in trades before they entered the service, and who now cannot be considered as tradesmen. At the outbreak of the war, I was commanding officer at the Initial Training School at Somers, in Victoria, where I saw the records of every man who passed into the establishment to be trained for air crew. I noted that large' numbers of the men had been employed in the categories of engineers, metal workers and electricians. some of them became pilots, observers and air gunners and achieved high distinction in the service. Because of their determination to serve as air crew they were away from their trades for a number of years - Had they not been able to make the grade as air crew, or had they any physical defects, they would have remained in' their trade in the Royal Australian Air Force. I am sure that the Minister will recognize that this bill will do a great injustice to many outstanding young men. I cannot say why he did not think of them wh^n this bill was being drafted. Now that the omission has been brought to his notice, I hope that the scope of the bill will be widened so as to include those who were tradesmen or had some experience in a trade before the outbreak of war. The post-war Air Force is not attractive to these young men. The Government has not yet announced a suitable establishment, but has stated only that there will be an Interim Air Force and personnel may enlist in it for a period of two years. In those circumstances, many former members of the Royal Australian Air Force will'desire to return to the trade or calling to which they belonged before their enlistment. Some worked as bank and insurance clerks, or as business executives"". Many of tbo.=e who distinguished themselves. as much as men with the best ' education were the young men in the mechanic class, who bad worked at the bpneb or forge. Their names became famous in the service, yet this bill will exclude them. I exhort the honourable gentleman to remove this hardship. The bill will create more confusion in industry, but if the Government insists on passing it, the measure should be just. Mr While. Let there be preference to those who left the workshop to go into the front line to fight! Preference should not be extended to the man who, whatever his reasons, worked in Australia during the war. When the honourable member for' Fawkner was speaking, I asked what would be the position of British tradesmen who came to Australia as migrants.",50
148,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If the migrant had been a tradesman in the services or got his trade experience in the services, he would Later probably be excluded, just as our own people are.",51
149,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"What a prospect at a time when the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) is issuing booklets ad lib to advertise Australia and encourage men trained in the building trade to migrate here! This bill will defeat the objects of the Minister for Immigration. I have received the following letter from, the Returned. Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League cf Australia, ex-Imperial sub-branch:Our organization is of the opinion that British ex-service personnel on the whole are getting a rough deal. They have been promised a fair go on paper, but what are the actual facts. These men get little or no consideration when it comes to employment and training because of a clause in an instruction given to rehabilitation officers for their guidance that reads ns follows:""United Kingdom ex-servicemen and women selected as eligible and suitable for trainingwill rank after Australian ex-servicemen and women where there is competition for training vacancies "". Our members contend that British ex-service personnel have been automatically barred from training because by the time that Australian personnel have been absorbed (which at the present rate will take years) our men will have graduated to he useful members of the community per medium of the pick and shovel or as genera] labourers. This bill will impose an additional hardship upon this class .of person. In my opinion, this Parliament is passing too much legislation. Too many authorities are planning other men's lives. Their ideas are put forward to receptive Ministers. I know that the Minister in charge of the bill is steeped in industrial affairs, and I have no doubt that the trade unions instruct him that he must preserve their vested right in industry, and ensure that, they shall receive preferential treatment. That is the reverse of the policy of preference to ex-servicemenf I invite the honourable gentleman to explain bow former members of the services and immigrants will fare under this bill.",51
150,Mr FADDEJT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [4.6J. - This measure affords me an opportunity to direct attention to further examples of the Government's shocking bungling of the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, and to its deplorable treatment of .e^-servicenien anxious to engage in useful trades. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway), who introduced the bill, said that one of its purposes was to assist the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. But it is futile to talk of assisting, their rehabilitation while the Government is content to allow the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs to continue. It is evident that in addition to red-tape strangling effective rehabilitation, certain trade unions are determined to prevent men who fought for their country from engaging in useful trades. A few days ago, the Sydney press reported that Mr. Roy Jackson, secretary of the federal shipwrights and ship constructors organization, declared, first, that soldiertrainees .were not admitted under the post-war reconstruction training scheme, and, secondly, that there was not enough work to admit soldier trainees who, in any case, were too old and had bad the opportunity before the war. of entering a trade. Earlier, in Brisbane, a man with - three years' service in the Royal Australian Air Force in Darwin and overseas, was thrown out of work because' the local branch of the Amalgamated.

The function of this panel was to place trainees with suitable and reputable firms and establishments in oider to ensure that they should receive adequate training in the trade that theybad chosen. In theory, the scheme was an excellent one, as it would have cut out a lot of the red tape and delay involved in having to forward the matter to Brisbane for approval.

It may be that honourable gentlemen opposite are critical of the measure, or that they do not regard it as a rehabilitation bill; but the fact remains that they have not answered the serious charges that we have made. I do not wonder at the doubt as to whether this is a rehabilitation measure, because when the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) made certain observations concerning the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen you, Mr. Speaker, called him to order and said of that this was not a rehabilitation bill. I can understand you making such a mistake. It is high time that the ex-serviceshould know where they stand in regard to this measure and, in fact, to Government policy generally. By the introduction of this hill the Government is seeking to give peace-time permanency to regulations promulgated to meet a war-time emergency. I , fail to understand how the two sets of circumstances can be reconciled. .During the war the regulations to which I am referring which, by the way, were framed largely by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), who was then in ministerial office, served a very good purpose; but now that peace has returned and we expect a considerable expansion of industry to occur in Australia, I can see no reason why such restrictive provisions should be applied to industrial employment. Surely it-must be recognized'that if our vast industrial potential is to be developed, there must be a considerable expansion of employment. understand, therefore, wby the Government should-seek to continue in peacetime restrictions which were intended only to meet the emergencies of war. In claiming that this was a rehabilitation measure the Minister, in his second reading speech, saidThe hill makes provision for the admission to the engineering, boilermaking, blacksmithing, electrical, and sheet-metal trades of ex-servicemen who have had sufficient training and experience in .those trades while in the forces to enable them, after a reasonable period of probation or training in employment, to reach the standard of skilled tradesmen. I was greatly heartened when I beard that statement, - u n t i l I noticed one "" catch "" in it . The honourable gentleman referred to ""experience in these tradeswhile in the forces "". Tbat caused me to examine the measure more closely. The Minister having made a statement of someconsiderable importance, immediately qualified it hy sayingAt the same time, I must warn honourable members that the Australian engineering - industry, despite its expansion since 1939, has not unlimited absorptive capacity, and, fore, one function of the committees provided for in the bill will be ""to avoid the overloading of industry, which would result in the ultimate unemployment of both ex-servicemen and recognized tradesmen.",53

At that time Opposition members' criticized the Government's, proposal to establish an employment service. I cannot Our criticism has since been amply justified. The technique of the re-establishment and employment legislation is being continued in this bill, for the ex-serviceman is being used as a stalking-horse. This is not a rehabilitation bill, as I shall prove before I resume my seat. The measure., has been designed, in . fact, to give to trade unionists complete control of their respective trades, and to apply restrictive measures to ex-servicemen who wish to enter various trades. Our ex-servicemen have won the right to just and generous treatment, and they are entitled to be re-admitted to industries in which they served, many of them as apprentices, prior to enlistment; but if anything reveals the insincerity of the Government and its supporters in regard to ex-servicemen this bill does. The measure creates a close preserve in ;the dilutee trades for members of unions, 95 per cent, of whom, were not on active service. Ever since demobilization began, and in fact ever since the passage of the Re-establishment and Employment thereAct, it has been apparent that Ministers, by instructions given to various committees, Hy press statements and by answers to questions in this Parliament, have been endeavouring to. discourage ex-servicemen from seeking to enter An answer which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction the gave to a question which I asked him is further evidence of this f a c t the Government policy, is becoming more to positive in this respect as the days somego by, for Ministers are saying to exi n effect, "" You must not enter this or that trade "". In fact, some trade unions have closed their books even apprentices formerly engaged in the the trades concerned. Consequently these We men will be denied the right to resume must work in the callings of their choice. A to specious reason given to excuse this action is that the absorptive capacity of the industry may not permit of the rebowemployment of the men. By this means ex-servicemen are being debarred from . Dedtaking advantage of the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Only a very limited number of them will be able to secure employment in' the trades mentioned in the schedules of the bill. Do honourable gentlemen opposite take the view that we shall have no development in the engineering, boiler-making, blacksmithing, electrical and sheet-metal trades? That seems to be the assumption on which this bill is based. Actually we should be preparing for a considerable expansion in these industries. - It is true that a handful of ex-servicemen may gain admission to these trades, but an unqualified preference will be given to members of the unions concerned to the disadvantage of ex-servicemen who may desire to obtain such employment. This, of course, is in line with the policy of the Australasian Council of TradesUnions, the body controlling this Parliament for the time being. Tbat policy has also been expounded from time to time - by honourable gentlemen opposite, but it is unjust and a complete violation of the promises ma'de to the men of this countiy when they entered the armed forces. Such a situation'should not be tolerated by the great body of men and women who rendered such glorious service to Australia in its hour of need. In view of what I have said it will be realized that the promise of preference that was given to servicemen when they were fighting has been so emasculated that the preference is now nothing more than a sham. This is particularly so in view of the exclusion of ex-servicemen from the dilutee trades. I suppose that the greatest prospects of industrial expansion in Australia are to be found in these trades, yet the Government is doing its utmost to prevent ordiscourage ex-servicemen from entering them. It is well that this fact should be made clear at this juncture - The policy that is being applied in these dilutee trades is similar to that' being applied to the coal-miners. The Government is seeking to sectionalize the industries of this country. It is separating certain classes of the community from other classes. I do not desire to discuss in detail .the dangers inevitably associated with such a policy, but it is deplorable that such a procedure should be app^ed not only to eoal-mininsr, as is shown by many provisions of the Coal Industry Bill which we passed yesterday, but also tn the dilutee trades referred to Mr Harrison. 'in the schedule to this bill. Only a few ex-servicemen who possess certain qualifications will be able to enter these trades, as I shall later show. Secondly, be may apply for the status of probationary tradesman and, having bad sufficient experience, apply for that of recognized tradesman. Thirdly, he may apply for admission as a trainee tradesman and, when proficient, apply for the status of recognized tradesman. These three grades are hedged round with all possible qualifications, which render them almost abortive in relation to ex-servicemen. Let us consider the effect in four of the five trades. Up to the 2nd August, 1946, HS8 applicants bad been accepted in New South Wales for entry to the "" dilutee "" trades, and 253 applicants had been rejected. I invite ministerial supporters to explain to the House and - the country the figures I am placing before them, because they refute the Government's claim that it is anxioustbat ex-servicemen shall be rehabilitated. In the engineering trade, 344 applicants were accepted and 207 applicants were rejected. In the blacksmithing trade, two applicants were accepted and no applicant was rejected - In the boiler-making trade, 13 applicants were accepted and 27 applicants were rejected. In the electrical trade, 29 applicants were accepted and 20 applicants were rejected. These figures do not take into account the.many hundreds of ex-servicemen who had had technical training prior to and during their war service, and whose applications have not seen the light of day because theydid not come within the restricted categories prescribed by the regulations. Mr SHEEHAN' - Does the honourable, member claim that every applicant should bo accepted ? '",54
169,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That is not my suggestion. I am pointing out that the preference provisions of the Re-establishment and' Employment Act give to ex- servicemen with the necessary qualifications the right to enter and be trained in their - chosen trades and callings. It seems obvious that the Government does not propose even to facilitate entry to trades of apprentices who relinquished their articles to join up with the armed forces. Men who did not possess the necessary qualifications would not apply . for admission to a trade.,55
170,Mr SHEKHAST,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They do.,56
171,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I propose to show that very few of the many who have had experience, and who desire to enter a trade, will be allowed to do so. A recogbationary nized tradesman must have secured whole of his experience during the period of his war service. Tbat means that he must have had five years' service in trade concerned while he was in the armed forces. Where could experience for that length of time have been gained It appears to me that it would have possible only, in an engineering unit.",56
172,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,There is no five years' limitation. Where does the honourable gentleman get that?,56
173,Mr HARRIS ON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"He must have gained the whole of the experience he was a member of the forces, usually aperiod of five years. I assume that the Minister 'does . not propose that the provisions of industrial awards shall be violated, by allowing these men to be classed as tradesmen! after training that bas lasted for only three years. If that be. his intention, I should like him to state it. If he agrees that a man could become a tradesand man in the armed forces in three years, vast industrial possibilities will opened up. If we accept the principle that only men who have bad. five years - experience during their war service shall be accepted as recognized tradesmen, what number of men will be brought into industry? Only in engineering units - could such conditions exist. But we do not accept that principle. As the honbeen orable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) has pointed out, this bill places a mium on the non-fighting branches of the services, because a man who had some experience in any of these industries prior to enlistment would be precluded from deriving any advantage from the provisions of this bill if he - unfortunate as to enlist in the AirForce as apilot, or in the Army as. a commando or in an artillery unit. Unfortunately for his civil rehabilitation, he fought with arms for the preservation of the conditions that are now denied to him. On the other band, a man who belonged to a unit that did not have active service experience, such as workshops in an area not even subject to bombing, may come under this bill. Let us consider the position of protradesmen. In order to qualify the for admission to that grade, .an ex-serviceman must have' had training and experience in the forces during the period the,of the war, and be so experienced in the trade concerned that he can acquire the skill of a recognized tradesman in that ? trade within twelve months. In this in- ' been stance, the duration of the experience while in the forces is to be four years.",56
174,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Not necessarily.,56
175,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am interested in the Minister's interjections; because, if a' man who has had two years' exwhile perience in the forces can become a recognized tradesman after twelve months training, what becomes of the principle that has been established in .regard to training under industrial awards?",56
176,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable gen-' tleman does not worry about that ,56
177,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I doThe Minister's interjections are most illuminating, I should like him. to elaborate on them. It will be noted that a large be number of ex-servicemen who obtained experience as dilutees or added tradesmen prior to enlistment, but whose actual experience in the trades during service in the armed forces, lasted for less than four years, . will be excluded from the benefits of this legislation. In this connection, it should be noted that there has a serious departure from the terms of the regulations to which the. Minister now seeks to give effect as a permanent prepeace-time measure, because those provide that the experience of probationary had tradesmen need have .been secured only during the war period. The bill, however, provides in effect that only some of his experience need have been secured had been so during his war service. I pass on to the trainees. In order to qualify for admission to this grade, the applicant must have received in"" the forces during the period of war training and experience in the trade concerned. That is interesting. If honourable memnot bers can grasp the full significance they will realise bow restrictiveit is its incidence. The next requirement that the applicant must be certified regional training committee as being eligible for benefit under the Commonon wealth reconstruction training scheme. This requirement will necessitate, instances, that the serviceman must been under the age of 21 years upon enlistment. Therefore, even if the intencallings. . tion be to admit many trainees who eligible,. vast numbers of ex-servicemen who were over 21 years of age upon enlistmade ment, but who had bad trade exafforded perience prior to enlistment either had or had not less than four years' experience during their service in the forces, will be ineligible. Actually, however, it appears that extremely few trainees are being admitted, and that servicemen who would normally be factors eligible are turned away when they apply to the regional training committee in the trade concerned"". Department of Post-war Reconstruction, being told that the "" dilutee "" trades "" saturated "". It will be noted that provision exists for industry to avail itself of the valued experience that has been gained by thousands of ex-servicemen, both in civil life prior to enlistment during their service in the forces, because their experience does not happen to fall within the restricted categories that necessary to gain admission to the scheme. The experience and training of these will bejost to industry for all time. loss should be viewed in the light of projected expansion of industry. A bationary tradesman or a trainee who gains admission to the scheme will still have difficult hurdles to negotiate me give a few examples. Trade comemployees mittees will have full discretion matter of the admission of applicant ex-servicemen to a trade. There will be obligation on them to admit any appli-. cant, even though be may have the necessary qualifications. I do not suggest men. that a trade committee would deliberately exclude an ex-serviceman who possessed the necessary qualifications. But say that a committee which has the responsibility of making such a decision should at least have on it a representative of ex-servicemen. The Government has Mr Harrison. made any provision for the represenof it, tation of ex-servicemen on these comin mittees. Under the Australian Soldiers' is Repatriation Act, the endeavour bas been by a made to provide ex-servicemen with representation on bodies that adjudicate their claims. This is supposedly a rehabilitation measure, yet I have in most proved that under it ex-servicemen have may be prevented from engaging to any great degree in different trades and The possibility exists for , a are. veto to be exercised against an ex-serviceman, yet no provision is being for his protection, which could be by a representative - of the exand servicemen's organizations, who would have a complete understanding of the problems that are peculiar to ex-servicemen. The committees will be able to select numerous pretexts for not admitexting applicants. Several indeterminate can influence their decision. One of them is the "" absorptive capacity of the This expression "" absorptive capacity "" keeps bobbing up are like "" that blessed word Mesopotamia no It bas been mentioned again and again ' by the Minister and is always associated with attempts to resist the admittance of returned soldiers to trade unions. Even and a trained economist would have difficulty in determining what is. meant by the absorptive capacity of a trade. It is to arc be presumed that the trade committees will be guided by the demand, for tradesmen men obtaining at the present time. This This takes no account of the needs - of the industry when it expands as is expected. proI-have pointed out that the Government is not seized of the possibility of trade expansion in Australia. The committees Let will have on them representatives of the as well as the employers, and in the the chairman will be a government nominee. I have no doubt that they, as no Labour spokesmen have said, will be used to keep the unions a close preserve for - privileged unionists as against ex-service",56
178,Mr BARNARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Tba t has never been I do .said on behalf of the Government.,57
179,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Hansar d is full of quotations which I myself have made to that effect. It has - been said by representatives of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. These matters history. The policy of the Government is to protect jealously the rights of unionists, and committees are to be appointed which are to consider the applihis cations.of ex-servicemen for admission industry. .Between the Government and the committees, the unfortunate eximplication serviceman will be ground as between the upper and nether millstones. If the Government proposes to continue, with this iniquitous measure under the guise of a rehabilitation bill, it should at give .the organizations of returned soldiers representation on the committees which the are to decide whether or not they shall admitted to industry. . Mr HAYLEN (Parkes) [4.50] - I it have examined this. measure, and would not have spoken on it were it not for distortion practised by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). Since I have been in the House, whenever anything is put up to pit servicemen against their civilian counterparts, it falls to the lot of the honourable member for Wentworth to do it. He bas a phobia for dividing the people upon matters on which they are really indivisible. As an ex-serviceman myself, I take exception to what be has said on this 'bill today. community was disrupted. 11. is one thing to mount the tribune like puppet Mussolini,' and say what the vernment proposes to do for the returned soldier is wrong, but it is another thing to find work for returned soldiers, thing: which the Opposition has never been able to do. The speech of the honourable member constituted the negation of true preference to ex-servicemen. It mere sabre-rattling; there was no sincerity in it. Whenever he finds that his arguments lack the basis of common sense, he rushes the returned servicemen stunt. If I may be pardoned the use simile, let me say that, during the years that I have been in this House, whenever the honourable-member for WentFawkner worth comes riding into the chamber it on the back of the returned soldier: His behaviour is disgusting, his language moderate, and his argument not .worth answering. ' He said that there were two groups in the community, servicemen and unionists. It is obvious that he has no study of the subject. Even Sir Thomas Blarney, who could never by any are stretch of the imagination be called a supporter of the party to which I have the honour to belong, admitted that SO per cent, of the men in the' forces under command were trade unionists. Thus, to if this Government should do soidetbing against the interests of servicemen the is that it - would be doing something against the interests of its own union supporters. Still the honourable member seeks to apply his ""divide and conquer "" technique, although he should least be well aware of where it originated. There may - be difficul ties - associated with application of this plan, but'.there can be be Australians who really believe that the measure is designed to damage the interests of Servicemen. To suggest that is so designed is a most dastardly playing at politics, and servicemen will not the thank .the honourable member for Wentworth for trying to whip them into a fury over an imaginary injustice. In this - bill, the Government seeks to carry on the great work of re-establishment which has been very successfully begun. We admit that there are great gaps yet to be filled. The job is not easy, and will take years to complete. During the war, the whole .composition of the Clerks, a counterhands, engineers and men of all. Gocallings were taken into the services. Now the operation has been put into reverse, and the replanning for civil life is someslow and tortuous. However, the Government is sincere, and its plans, if given a chance, will work. This bill deals with the great problem of dilutees was in industry. Tht honourable member for Wentworth made a great deal of his contention that some ex-servicemen might not be placed in industry. It may be useful to remind him that the agreement of a between the employers, employees and three the Government on this subject was negotiated by the honourable member for (Mr Holt), with-the approval is of the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart); and the Minis-, imtor' for Transport (Mr Ward). The agreements were found to be acceptable, and under them the country was geared to a 100 per cent, war effort. The result is made history. We must now realise that we cannot overburden industry by an oversympathetic attitude towards those who have been on service. The honourable member for Wentworth contends that these men should be admitted to any and - every union in any numbers. Presumably, when industry could not carry them any longer, they could go on the dole. 'The Labour party bas remembered what folever lowed the "" boom and bust "" policy which applied previously-tba t there were a few happy years, after which came the depression. This bill represents a part of Government's planned programme, which is designed to prevent another such occurrence. The Minister showed a touch statesmanship when he warned honourable members of the danger of placing indiscriminately in industry, little while might not be able to keep them in employment. Against this, the able member for Wentworth, with a flamthe boyant wave of his band, said that dustry in Australia is expanding. I is, no thanks are due to members of the. Opposition. Industry is expanding, but it is a planned expansion. The able member tried to paint a gay picture of flourishing industries, with everybody marching forward to greater prosperity, but the fact is that the Government must plan carefully and see just what load industry can carry. The honourable member devoted much of his speech to complaints against the possible exclusion of ex-servicenow men from trades. It is possible are that some ex-servicemen employed as specialists in the forces are ready to find employment immediately industry. Their interests are secure. It ter's arguments. is utterly absurd for the honourable'member to assert that this bill has been drawn with the deliberate purpose of injuring ex-servicemen. On the other hand, it is a supplementary measure to the general rehabilitation plan, which bill was the result. includes ex-servicemen as well as civilians, and provides for our economic development in the years to come. The measure deserves nothing but praise, because of level-headed, carefully-thought-out prothis visions. We must view things as they are. It is not right for the honourable member to talk glibly of unions-accepting thousands of applications for membership by ex-servicemen. Of cour.=e, the honorbring able member for Wentworth belongs to the era of the Battle of Omdurman. Tie Sir. Llaylen. has never - been able to envisage total war. He thinks of war in terms of horses and flashing sabres, as' does the honourable, member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin), who - fell from his horse some years ago, and whose capacity to think has been retarded since. The plan of the Government provides for the man who made the bombs . as well as the man Avho piloted the airtbe. craft which dropped them. It provides fox the man who used a rifle and bayonet, - as well as the man concerned in their of manufacture. Unless honourable members, realise those things, it is obvious that they men have not given much thought to the which in a contents of this bill.",57

The honorMinister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), in the course of his second-reading speech, laid great emphasis on the obligation of the Government to promote rehabilitation.

The Government says that as the result its of the agreement, it must now bring down legislation. I point out however that this bill marks an entirely new departure and establishes a completely new principle in Commonwealth legislation. The Government has said, in effect, "" We must down this legislation because, as the result of the dilution agreement, it bas become almost impossible for us to provide for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen "". The agreement is contained in twelve short clauses, which readMemorandum of agreement between ComDepartment' monwealth Government, Engineering Union and Employers' Association regarding temporary relaxation existing customs to overcome difficulties due to shortage of engineering tradesmen"" for war requirements.

Winterbottom, Secretary. - Melbourne, 8th May, 1940. It will be seen that in May, 1940, when this country was in the gravest danger, an agreement was made under which the unions were .to relax existing - customs as to permit the introduction of dilutees under such - conditions as 'would afford absolute protection to recognized tradesmen; There is, as will be seen from a perusal of the document, no foundation for the claim that there is need for this legislation, or that there is any problem of. rehabilition as the result of the tion agreement. ""When the war came to an end the .only task that had to be undertaken was to preserve the rights of recognized tradesmen asi-against the so-called added dilutees. No one disputes the necessity to do that. But is it necessary to approach that task by legislation of this kind? .Not at all; it could be carried out effectively, as indeed it was intended to be carried out, by the Arbitration Court. An examination of the bill shows that it goes vastly further than the mere carrying out>of what the Minister agrees was the real essence of the. problem, namely, the preservation of the rights of recognized' tradesmen as against dilutees. There was no question, arising from the agreement, of the preservation of the rights of recognized tradesmen as against those of men who served in the war, and it is well that that should be made plain. Under the bill, the rights of the recognized tradesmen will in substance be extended and consolidated above the rights of all other people, including dilutees or ex-servicemen. Dilutees are not in terms referred to in this legislation; but they are already in the trade. The only way in which people will be able to get into the trade now will be by permission of a local committee. That is the substance : ,of, this legislation. In simple language it means that the Government - will establish what I understood Labour always fought, against, namely, a monopoly more vicious than those usually made the subject of its attacks, a monMr Spender. opoly of men inside a trade who will keep it' a. close preserve for themselves. The bill is divided into parts covering, amongst other things, the engineering, boiler-making, blacksmithing, electrical and sheet-metal trades. Each qf those trades is made the subject of a definitions clause. All of the trades are then brought within the provisions .of Part VII . of the bill. which is headed "" Incorporated Provisions"", which is the very essence of this legislation.. It will so be observed that it is intended that the recognized tradesman in the sense of the man who was engaged in the trade before the dilution agreement was made, shall be protected against everybody; the only persons who are given no rights at all, and indeed, from whom rights are to. be subtracted by the bill, are ex-servicedilu- men. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) bas said that this Government is desirous of assisting ex-service-: men. If that be so all I can say is that in this legislation it has been very much overborne by the union. If the unions themselves had been given the task of drafting a bill to protect the interests of their members, I can not imagine that they would have produced a more satisfactory measure than this. No doubt they' were consulted and their, lawyers had a good look at the bill before it was brought before us. In the incorporated provisions in Part VII . clause 34 establishes a central committee which is to have power to give directions on any matters referred to it by ,a local committee, to issue directions to localcommittees, to determine the form of certificate to be granted to any person, and, finally, to advise the Minister generally with respect' to any action considered necessary to give effect to Part VII . of .the bill. The decisions of. the Central Committee are to be final and it may act on any evidence it thinks fit. Clause 35 prescribes that a local committee shall have power to' determine any matter arising in the State in which it is established, and without limitation of that very general power it may authorize the employment of probationary and trainee tradesmen, and direct the removal from' the register of the name of any probationary or trainee - tradesman. I .point out that in clause 44 power is given to an employee already in the industry to appeal even to the supreme court of a State against a decision of the local committee directing, approving or. consenting to his dismissal. Under clause 35 however, no power of appeal is given to a person who is refused the opportunity to become a probationary or trainee - tradesman. What is even worse still, no power' is given to the probationary or trainee tradesman to appeal if his name is removed by a local committee from the register. Under .clause 35 the local committee is also to have power to issue certificates of recognition as a re cognized tradesman and to act in any manner it thinks fit without challenge on the part of the man concerned. It is also to have power to consider, and to issue ' directions to employers in relation to any matters in dispute regarding the claims of persons under this Part-and note these words- "" or under any other law of the Commonwealth-"" to employment in any trade to which Part VII . applies. So, irrespective of any law of the Commonwealth contained in any award, a - local committee may issue directions to employers relating to employment in any of the specified trades. When a local committee gives directions-and no doubt ultimately power will be taken to make regulations to carry out the provisions of the hill-it will have in substance the power of determining the future life of a large number of people, particularly of ex-servicemen, and it is to have power to do that arbitrarily, without any right of appeal against its decisions. The next serious provision is in clause 41 which prescribes that if a local committee . is satisfied, upon application by any person, that that person is a recognized tradesman within the meaning of the definition of "" recognized tradesman "", or ' a member of the forces who has, during the period of the war, acquired, by reason of his service in the Forces, the skill necessary for the performance of work ordinarily ' performed by recognized tradesmen, the committee may, if it thinks fit, issue to that person a certificate of recognition as - a recognized tradesman. Let us stop there a. moment. Consider the two sub-clauses. Paragraph a of sub-clause 1 readsIf the Local Committee is satisfied that he is a recognized tradesman . . . Tbat is in the case of the boilermaking trades, a person who was employed as a tradesman prior to the 29th of November, 1940, and other dates in ' 1940 in the case of other trades. Whether a man who, prior to this agreement, had. been recognized as a tradesman or not, it should not be left for anyone to say whether he shall be re-engaged in the industry or not. I should like the Minister to pay some heed to what I am saying. L All that the suh-clause provides is that the local committee is not obliged, even if it is satisfied that an applicant is a recognized tradesman, to issue a certificate of recognition.' The committee has complete discretion to say, "" No, we will not issue a certificate. We do not see f it "" . If that power does not'lend itself to the utmost abuse, I should like to know any power that does. Is the Commonwealth Parliament to embark on a series of legislative acts, of which this is proposed to be the first, under which so-called tribunals will be able to affect the lives of thousands and thousands, of people .in this community by having the power to determine that they shall or shall not be permitted entrance to the.metal industry or some other avocation. Tbat is what this-bill provides. Then,, dealing with other people, the clause says(2.) If a Local Committee is satisfied that an adult member of the Forces who, during the period of the war, has had training and experience in the Forces in a trade to which this Part applies could, within a period not .exceeding twelve months, acquire the skill necessary for the performance of work ordinarilyperformed by a recognized tradesman, the Committee may, on the application of that member, authorize the employment, subject to the provisions of section forty-three of this Act, of that member as a probationary tradesman . . . All that is subject to' clause 43, with which I shall deal in a moment. What will happen if a man discharged from the forces goes to the local committee and says, "" I want to.go into ihe trade, because I believe that.there is a future in it "" ? Despite what the Minister has said about the saturation point in the metal trades, the employers have not been consulted .on opportunities for expansion, and I know from experience that there is a great dearth of trained men in the trades. An ex-serviceman in some branches of metal trades, for example, sheet - metal work, bas no chance whatever of becoming a sheet-metal worker, because of no branch of the services in which be could have got the necessary experience. He is out straight away. But a man wants to .become a member of, say, elecsatisfy trical trades, must first be an adult then the local committee must be satisfied that during the war be bad training and experience in the forces. It does not matter what other experience be may have had. He may have bad training as dilutee and then gone into the forces, where be had no opportunity for further training. He cannot apply.",59
181,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,-Nonsense !,63
182,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Le t the Minister tell me then under what provision be can a member apply. I will not be told that it is nonsense. It is the Minister's bill - He must, have read it. He must know all about it. Let him tell me the clause under which be can apply.",63
183,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I will tell the honourable member when the bill is in committee.,63
184,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Tell me now order that I may make an effective 3econd-reading speech.,63
185,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"He can apply, to the acquire local committee.",63
186,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Unde r what conditions can he apply to the local committee'? If the Minister will not tell me now, I shall ask him again in committee' where provision is made in the bill for those eases. I give only one example, that of a dilutee who has had some war experience in a trade and then left it to serve in a non-technical unit of the forces. The question I shall ask in committee is where in the bill provision is made to cover his case.",63
187,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,He is entitled to instatement in the position he occupied before joining the forces. The honourable member knows that as well as I do.,63
188,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,But the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment ' Act are for all practical purposes excluded from operation as far as the trades the specified in this bill are concerned.,63
189,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,No : the men in that I know group are covered.,63
190,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Sub-claus e 2 of' clause 41 cannot apply, as a probationary who tradesman must be an adult and must the local committee that he could, and within twelve months obtain the necessary experience. That in itself is limituig. I have good reason to believe that that provision was made in order not toa aid but to exclude ex-servicemen.",63
191,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,An ex-servicemen could not get that experience in twelve months.,63
192,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Of course not. 1 come now to trainee tradesmen. Subclause 3 provides(3.) If a Local Committee is satisfied that of the Forces who(a) during the period pf the war has had training and experience in the Forces in a trade to which this Part applies; and (6) is certified by a Regional Training Committee to be eligible for training benefits under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme established under Part III . of the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945, in could, within a reasonable period, as to what that reasonable period is no one has any guide at all the skill necessary for the performance of work ordinarily performed by a recognized tradesman, the Committee may, upon the application of that member, authorize the employment, subject to the provisions of section forty-three of this Act, of that member as a trainee tradesman for the purpose of undergoing a course of training in an industrial establishment in a trade to which this Part applies. It is well to turn to clause 43 with this final observation' on the powers of the local committee: The aspirant bas to' go through the gateways heldby the local c.omniittee, and, even then, only a man of a certain type can qualify under the re- provisions of clause 41. A probationary tradesman, must be an adult whom the committee is satisfied can, within twelve months, acquire the necessary skill. A trainee tradesman must be one who, amongst other things, could within a reasonable period-and no indication is .given of what a reasonable period isacquire the skill necessary for performance of the work ordinarily performed by recognized tradesmen. No indication is given of what that is. In both cases there is no appeal if the application is - rejected.",63
193,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"He goes to the - central committee if he' is not satisfied with the decision of the local committee. 'The honourable member has read"" the bill .and says that be knows all about it.",64
194,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not know all about it. I said that the Minister knew all about it. Would he mind telling me where it is provided that a man turned down by the local committee can go to the central committee? If the Minister does not answer me now, I shall have to askhim in committee. The power is given to the local committee in clause 41. The local committee is .in, substance an arbitrary body' The provisions relating to probationary and trainee tradesmen are subject to clause 43, which reads(1.) Subject to the provisions of this Part, the provisions of Division 2 of Part II . Re-establishment and Employment Act shall apply in relation to employment i trades to which this Part applies. That makes it appear that the Parliament is extending preference in employment ex-servicemen, but when the bill says discussed. "" subject to the provisions of the act"", substantially cuts down the whole of preference conditions of the Re-establishthe ment and Employment Act. Before I leave that, I point out that clause says(1.) A person shall not be entitled an application to a court of summary jurisdiction under section twenty-eight of the lieestablishment and Employment Apt 1945 In respect of a failure to engage him in employment in a trade to which this Part applies unless the matter has first been considered by a Local Committee. So there is a distinct writing down of the provisions of the Re-establishment' and Employment Act. An application must first be considered by the local' committee, but clause 43 provides(1.) Subject to the provisions of Part, the provisions of Division 2 of Part II . of the Re-estab'ishment and Employment 1945 shall apply . . . Then it (2.) An employer shall not, in the engagement or .elcvuliuu of any person to carry out. work ordinarily performed by a recognized tradesman of a particular classification, engage or elevate(a) a person other than a recognized tradesman if a recognized tradesman of that classification who is competent to perforin that work is available and offeringfor employment; or (6) a person other than a recognized tradesman or a probationary tradesman if a probationary tradesman of that classification who is corn- petent to perform that work i> available and offering for employ ment. '",64
195,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That was the promise made to him by the dilution committee.,64
196,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"No such promise is contained in the dilution agreement. Time after-time the allegation has been made that that promise was made by the dilut i o n committee, but on the 11th May. 1946, Mr F. T. Perry, president of the Australian Metal Industries. Association, was invited to attend a meeting in, Melof the bourne of the central engineering trades 1945 committee to discuss the future term? n the of the "" agreement "". At that meeting. I am informed, he restoration of pre-war practices and customs in relation to the employment, of bona, fide tradesmen to was fully and frankly considered and  it ' of the metal trades employers of Austhe tralia, agreed that the enunciation of undermentioned principle would be a full and proper implementation of the 45 winding-up of the "" agreement "". This was assented to by the Amalgamated Engineering Union and .the Australasian to make Society of Engineers. It was agreedConditions in the industry to be those operating prior to the signing of the dilution agreement on 8tli May, 1940"", which means that the custom of the trade was to recruit tradesmen in the greatest percentage of case's in the industry, through the apprenticeship system or other approved training, scheme. It is well to disclose what the agreement provides, because no greater rights can exist than are provided in it. Reverting again to the bill, paragraph a of sub-clause 2 of clause 43 gives to the recognized tradesman, preemption in this respect of engagement or elevation over Act any one else in a job, regardless of whether a probationary tradesman or even a full tradesman who has given most distinguished, military ' service overseas and is much more competent. So long rhe recognized tradesman is competent'no degrees of competency are provided for - h e is given complete priority over videseveryone. This bill is designed to consolidate the interests of men already in the trades'. "" Mr WHITE - It is the reverse of preference to ex-servicemen.",64
197,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Of course it is. of Then sub-clause 4 of clause 43 proof vides(4.) An employer shall not, without the rnnsent ot a Local Committee(a) dismiss a recognized tradesman of a particular classification while any person of that classification, other than a recognized tradesman, is employed by him in the same establishment ; or So there is no choice between recognized tradesmen. AH are to be brought under the control of the local committee. I time of war, I could understand the need for some of these provisions, but, in days of peace, I shall resist them with every argument that I can advance. Then it was said that the purpose of this bill is to protect the rights employers' and the employees under the dilution .agreements. I direct to the fact that in existing awards power exists for an employer to dismiss ah emapplication ployee for inefficiency. As honourable tion members will see, sub-clause 5 of clause 43 providesThe provisions of sub-section (4.) of this section shall not prevent the exercise by an employer of any rights which he possesses under any law or any award, order, determination or industrial agreement to dismiss an employee for malingering, neglect of duty or misconduct. Sub-clause 4, of course, provides that an employer shall not, without the consent of a local committee, dismiss a recognized tradesman or probationary tradesman. From sub-clause 5 the word ""inefficiency"" bas been omitted. ""Why? That is a direct denial of the rights of the,ems ployer, Wfhich are contained in the dilution agreement and which, we were told, this bill will preserve. Provision is made for some, but only some, of the decisions of a local committee to be reviewed. According ,to statement of the Minister, an appeal is allowed to the central committee. I point as out that under clause 44, only a very limited right of appeal is permitted in special cases, because sub-clause 1 proWhere a local committee has directed or approved or consented to the dismissal of"" a person from employment, or the refusal by an employer to engage or elevate a person' in employment, and that person or the em-' ployer considers that the direction, approval or consent is not justified by the provisions this part, he may request the Chairman the local committee to refer the matter to the central committee, and the Chairman shall, as soon as practicable, refer the matter accordingly. If the person concerned is dissatisfied with the decision of the central' committee, he may appeal to a judge of the Supreme Court: Now, this clause limits the appeal to two cases, first the refusal of an employer to engage or elevate the employee and,' secondly, the dismissal of a person from employment. So far as 1 n am able to observe, all other cases under clause 41, such as the refusal by the local committee to grant a certificate that a man is a recognized tradesman, will not be made the subject of appeal ",65
198,Mr HOLLOW AT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,'Clause 45 takes it of both the a little further.,65
199,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Sub-claus e 1 of attention elause 45 provides that:A person shall not he entitled to make an to a court of summary jurisdic-. under section 28 of the He-establishment and Employment Act 1945, in respect of a failure . to engage him . in employment in a trade to which this Parliament applies unless the matter has first been considered hy a local committee. I Temind honourable members that section 28 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act statesWhere any person whom an employer hae refused to engage in employment considers that, having regard to the provisions of the last preceding section, the employer should have engaged him in employment, that person in ay apply to a court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a Police, Stipendiary or Special Magistrate for an^order under this section. ..The magistrate can then deal with the matter, and order that the person shall be employed and given the preference which the act prescribes. That absolute right has been cut down by the bill. . the Mr Holloway - It has not.",65
200,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"That is a matter of opinion. I know the real reason for this clause. When the person appears before the magistrate, it will be pointed out that the matter has been dealt with by the local committee.",66
201,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,No . The reason is that we do not desire the person concerned to waste time Jby going to court when the local committee can determine the matter.,66
202,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If the court has complete jurisdiction in the matter, wby should not the person concerned have the right, at his own option, to go there?",66
203,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If he does not get justice from the local committee, be go to the court.",66
204,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,He can go to the first court only in respect of preference.,66
205,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable memshall ber is trying to evade the issue.,66
206,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I am not.,66
207,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable memvernment's ber has been snared by his own cunning.,66
208,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Do not the prodesire visions of a special act such as this,-in respect of employment, overridetbe general act which deals with all employtbe ment? I direct attention to the opening words of sub-clause 1 of clause 43, namely, ""Subject to the provisions this Part"" - They mean ""except insofar as this part provides otherwise, the establishment and Employment. Act shall apply"". The implication is that this bill will reduce the efficacy of the establishment and Employment Act. Therefore, when, the person ultimately appears before the magistrate under the preference provisions, he will be confronted with the decision of the local committee.",66
209,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member would explain his point much more quickly if he had a good case.,66
210,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am not one of those who says that the Minister always answers a question fair l y . I have heard him, on occasions, give an unfair answer. Sub-clause 2 of clause 45 providesIn any prosecution of an employer contravention of section forty three of and clause 43 imposes an obligation upon the employer to employ, not an ex-serviceman, but persons other than ex-servicemen- and in any proceedings against an employer under section twenty-eight of the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945, it shall be a defence for the employer to prove that the act or omission with which he is charged or which is called in question was directed, approved, or consented to by a local committee duly or, on review or appeal, by the central committee or a court, and that the decision of the local committee or central committee, as the ease may he, does not stand reversed as the result of review or appeal. Obviously when the person appears before the court, be will be confronted with the finding of the local committee. The whole purpose of these provisions is can to prevent the applicant from appearing before the court under clause 28, unless be is heard by the local committee. The local committee may decide that he not be engaged, and the employer then will have an absolute defence. Yet the- Minister claimed that this bill will assist ex-servicemen.. If this is the Goidea of. a fair deal to ex-servicemen, it is not mine. I . have no to divide this - community into those who are ex-servicemen and those who are not. I have some conception of meaning of a 'total war effort. The Parliament has, however, passed legislation .described as .the Re-establishment of and Employment Act. That legislation was supposed to represent the high policy Reof the Labour, party towards granting preference in employment to ex-servicemen. In every way, the Government is Renow destroying the efficacy of the act. Why? Because in all industrial matters which are presented to this Parliament for its formal approval, the Government must adhere to the policy laid down by the trade unions.",66
211,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [5.39] - in reply-After having listened .to the speeches'.of honourable members opposite, one might be excused for thinking that we h a d no experience to guide us in the regulation of tradesmen's rights of employment in certain trades. Most honourable members will recall what ton a happened after World W a r I . A this Minister in a Nationalist government appointed me to .assist .to d r a ft the"" vocational training scheme. A f t e r the scheme began to operate, I was elected to a small appeal board for tbepurpose - if watching how employers treated ex-servicemen who were trainees, ensuring that employers trained ex-servicemen as thoroughly as they were obliged to. do under the agreement, and making certain that employers assessed the full value of the ex-servicemen from time to time, so that the taxpayer's would not be cheated. We bad to protest against the action of some employers in keeping ex-servicemen driving bakers' carts instead of training them as bakers and pastry cooks. We had to fine certain employers, and re-assess the values of their ex-servicemen employees because they would not do it. But what taught us most was the experience of the number of men who could not be absorbed into industry. discovered the danger of having an unbalanced industry by allowing some industries, to free themselves altogether from any responsibility to 'train ex-crvicemen while other industries were overloaded. Therefore, surely we are wise in endeavouring to ensure that we shall maintain a proper balance in industry for. the purpose of meeting the somewhat hopeful, but I am sure quite logical, forecasts of honourable members opposite, that Australia is about to experience a period of ""full employment in its secondary industries. Honourable members opposite may not have intended to be unfair, but I regard as unfair their action in regarding this as .a debate on the issue of preference in employment to ex-servicemen. The truth is that preference does hot enter into this bill at all. The. only persons who are dealt with, are ex-servicemen, and the matter of preferance between ex-servicemen does not arise here. The Be-establishment and Employment Act contains a section providing for preference in' employment to ex-servicemen, but the scheme proposed under this bill is in addition to the ing provided under the act. It is an additonto the ordinary proportion of apprentices to men in the engineering boilermaking, blacksmithing, electrical and sheet metal trades. This scheme has been arrived at voluntarily by the unions and employers. There is no suggestion of preference except in regard to the selection of the right kind of exHr. Holloway. servicemen, according to the training that they had in the past', to determine whether they will be able to qualify and maintain, their families in the future . in those particular trades.",66
212,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Are not - the tradesmenautomatically secured, and,' in that way,, have preference?",67
213,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) is-' generally fair. I shall deal later with the matter which he raised. Surely honourable members opposite recognizethat the matter of preference in employment to ex-servicemen does not arise here. All thereferences to the necessity to fulfil our promises to rehabilitate ex-servicemen after the war are not relevant to this bill, We which deals only with the training of ex-servicemen. The second purpose of the bill is to honour the promise given by the honourable member * forParramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) as. the representative of the government of the day. The agreement was partly drafted by. the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt).",67
214,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Tb e bill goes a long way further than that.,67
215,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If all the things that the honourable member for Warringah- (Mr Spender) imagined, and some of the things upon which the honourable member for Fawkner grew expansive, were involved, the bill would undoubtedly go a;long way further than I said.",67
216,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I shall' be happy if the Minister will show me where I was wrong.,67
217,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The only matter apart from the training of ex-servicemen in certain trades is the desire of the Government to honour the promise which was made by a previous administration train- and renewed by this Government. The Government, with which honourable gentlemen opposite, were - associated is just as responsible as this Government is in this matter. One honourable gentleman has said, "" I would not promise, anything"", whilst another bas said, "" I would make all the promises in the world to tradesmen while their trades' were being diluted during the war, but I would not promise them anything after the war "". That, as a matter of fact, has been the practice of all governments. But there was no need to make promises for the war period, because everybody was working. A total of. 119,000 men received training during the war, and the training.was given with the assistance of the unions. The promise made by the previous Government and re-affirmed .by this Government was that if any men had to be dismissed after the war, the recognizedtradesmen would be the last to go. We all hope that there will be no need to dismiss anybody. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), bas told us that our industrial potential is such tKat we may reasonably expect an. expansion 'of employment of some hundreds per cent. I hope that he is proved right. I hope, also, that in our lifetime there will be no need for anybody to be dismissed. All the signs and portents suggest that that will be so, We should be able to discuss this ject without heat or bias, for we all industries. desire to do the best that can be done for ex-servicemen. I ask honourable gentlemen, therefore, to look ject dispassionately. We should bear in mind, first, that this measure is to have application only to the five trades speciThe fied in the schedules and, secondly; that in peace-time only skilled journeymen and apprentices are employed in these skilled industries.",67
218,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,What about elevated men Many tradesmen were elevated during war.,68
219,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I wish to deal in order with the various points that have been raised. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) ba'S issued a challenge. I am. confident that I can show - that his interpretation of the clauses to which he bas referred is' incorrect. It has been argued that men who bad some experience before they enlisted, but bad no experience during their service, will be penalized under this measure. It ' would almost impossible to find more than a. very few men with pre-war experience who are not adequately, covered - I know of a few special cases, as abouts f am sure other honourable members do.",68
220,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Hundred s of men in the Royal Australian Air Force will not be cos-ered.,68
221,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I think that the honourable gentleman is in error in that regard. In these fivetechnical trades all journeymen and apprentices will be covered. In respect of. the journeymen there is no difficulty, and in. respect of apprentices, the difference between the wages they would - receive as apprentices and-the full wage of a-journeyman will be made up to'them partly by the Government and partly by the employers. In these trades the number of apprentices is maintained, in normal times, up to the limit of the law. No manufacturer worthy of the name would risk allowing the number of skilled artisans in his employ to fall below what it should be. It is true that that happened during the . depression years, but at that time no government was willing to spend any money *on technical training and no subscheme was provided for the dilution of",68
222,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Honourable gentlemen opposite resisted the application of techniat the subcal training schemes. - Mr Holloway - That is not so. point is, however, that journeymen and apprentices are completely covered. In years gone by, improvers were employed in these industries, but that was in the bad old days, and dead-end occupations of .that kind are no longer sanc? tioned. I make it clear that men who had the experience before they enlisted are . covered, and the employer and the Government have agreed to make up the difference between the wage for apprentices and that for journeymen in the case of men who are now over 21 years of age. but have not completed their training.",68
223,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I agree with that.,68
224,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"There may have been a few men 'who bad some training in these industries in backyard factories or with their fathers before the war, be but who were not apprentices. There cannot have been very many of them, although I admit that some young fellows sixteen years of age or theregave a wrong age in order to get into the forces. If these young men had received some training.', without being indentured they were, of course, breaking the law. But even men who bad some training in such circumstances could make application for consideration, though, as I have said, the number would not be very great.",68
225,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,W h at about motor mechanics?,69
226,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They are not in these trades.,69
227,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They are specifically mentioned in .the first schedule.,69
228,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It is possible that ii few miscellaneous persons have received some training. Other men may have broken their apprenticeship in order to enlist and. they may, or may not have had some training while they .were in the forces. It is open for them to make application to the expert committees for - special consideration.",69
229,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,J5u' t the committees cannot give a certificate to any one who lacks the specified qualifications? Mr Holloway' - Tba t is true.,69
230,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,What about young men who partly served an apprenticeship before joining'the forces but received training whatever while overseas and now are more than 21 years of age?,69
231,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Such individuals would be covered by the bill.,69
232,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,If that-is the view rhe Minister will be not accept an amendtbe ment to put the matter beyond doubt?,69
233,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not think that it is necessary to do so. Any persons who are not covered"" by this measure their war service. would come within the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act.",69
234,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am concerned about young men who broke ,their articles.",69
235,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable gested member is now breaking new ground. If men abandoned their articles,69
236,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They did .it in order to enlist.,69
237,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The fact remains State. that theyidid not have to do so; but even they would not be disqualified - I have dealt with the case .ofapprentices who bad twoor three years' experience before they joined the forces."" .They will be able to resume their training where .they left off, even if they had no training while they were on active service.",69
238,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Mus t an employer receive such men back into his employment or will the Government find them jobs elsewhere?,69
239,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It would not matter very much which course was taken, but my view is that the employer would be required to take them back.",69
240,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Some men did not sign articles. I am concerned about them.,69
241,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"As a matter of fact, they are the only class of men to whom the arguments of honourable members opposite apply. Only two points have been legitimately taken' against the bill. I have received some correspondence from branches of the Returned Sailors. Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia asking for an explanation of certain provisions of the measure.",69
242,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I believe that the federal president of the league has written to the , Minister.",69
243,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"That is so. Mr. Millhouse seems to be much more satisfied with the bill than doesthe honourable no member for Eawkner. Some honourable - members oposite have suggested that men who had some training before they enlisted would be debarred from re-entering the industries in which they were then working. That is not the case, The men of would be able to resume their training at point where they ceased it in .order to enlist. It would be ridiculous to prevent them from doing so. Many men will' be better fitted for training, because of The next point with which I shall deal relates to representation on' the expert the committees that are to be established.. Honourable gentlemen opposite have sugthat there should be a direct representative of ex-servicemen on ties* committees.",69
244,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,There should be one ex-serviceman on each committee in each,69
245,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not consider that to be necessary, because, as I have . already pointed out, no question - of preference arises. The points at issuei . will be purely technical. There are large .numbers of returned men in these industries in all States, but, in any case, it is essential that the men to be examined should come before experts capable of assessing their efficiency. For this reason it would not matter whether a member of a committee was an ex-serviceman or not. Only experts could say, with authority, whether a person who appeared before a committee was 40 per cent., 50 per cent., or 60 per cent, efficient in respect of his technical knowledge. As a matter of fact, the chairman of one of these conimittees is a returned soldier. I refer to Mr. White, chairmanof the committee in Western.Australia. It should be remembered that thousands of men who enlisted 'at about the age of 30 years were already fully trained artisans and there is no - reason why some of them should not be appointed to these committees. It would be desirable, in the interests of the servicemen themselves, that they should appear before experts rather than before a committee whose members had been appointed only because they were ex-servicemen. Experts would be able to test all the men who appeared before them strictly on their technical knowledge and training.",69
246,Unknown,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,70
247,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Unde r the bill, an appeal will lie from a local committee to a central committee, and if the decision of the second committee be not satisfactory a further appeal may be made to the court. Men who can be regarded as being in the borderline class will have the right of appeal to the committee, and if they can show that they possess the necessary qualifications they can be examined and attacbe'd to a trade. There cannot be many in this class, apart from men who. had followed their trades, prior to enlistment, and these would return to their former positions and be regarded as tradesmen. Those men who do not possess full qualifications will commence their employment at the full award rates of wages. As the employer cannot be expected.to, and would not, pay , the full rates in such instances, and the difference will have to be paid by the Goj vernment out of revenue contributed by the. taxpayers, there must be some control of .the' number of applicants accepted. Whilst it is not obligatory that members of the conimittees shall be ex-servicemen, there is no reason why ex-servicemen should not be nominated and be elected to the committees - Probably 50 per cent, or more of the members of the engineering and allied trades, are ex-servicemen of either World War I . or World War II . This fact would be likely to assure the election of ex-servicemen to the committees. For the reasons that I have given, neither' the Government nor I can see any logical reason for accepting the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt). If I could see any reason, I would certainly accept them. I believe that their incorporation in the measure would weaken rather than strengthen it. The honourable member for Wentworth cited some figures in relation to the number of applicants accepted and rejected. I have been supplied by telephone with quite different figures! up to the 24th July, in relation to the engineering trade only in New South Wales. These show that 225 probationary tradesmen have been approved and 42 not approved, and that 107 trajnee tradesmen have been approved and 30 not approved. Maybe the bill has one weakness. I am not convinced that it is a weakness; nevertheless I intend to make the position secure. . Honourable members will recall the Footscray test case, in which the Crown allegedly was an offender. The Government has realized bow difficult it is for an ex-service'man or women to prosecute the .manager of a government factory, with the Crown as the defendant. The Solicitor-General. Professor Bailey, with the assistance of his staff, is preparing amendments to both this bill and the Re-establishment and Employment Act, in order to make sure that the Crown will be placed on exactly the same footing as any other employer. The. Government desires that it shall be just as easy for a man or woman to prosecute the - manager - of a"" government factory or workshop as any other employer. The amendment has not yet been completed'; consequently, I shall haveit inserted when the bill is ""beihg>'cori-' : sidered in the Senate. I-trust that that will be regarded as satisfactory. From the outset, the intention .of the Government has been that an ex-service man or woman should be able to obtain satisfaction under the law, whether the Crown or a private employer is sued.

248,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Warringah) [8.16] I should like the Minister to give me some information about the definition of "" recognized tradesman which runs as follows:"" recognized tradesman"" means a person who, in relation to any trade to which this Part applies(a) was employed, prior to the eighth day of May, One thousand nine hundred and forty, as a tradesman; (b) has qualified or qualifies by service as an apprentice for employment .. 37 . as a tradesman; .. 18 (c) has completed his course'of training as a trainee ' tradesman to the satisfaction of a Local Committee: 19 or AXES. (d) has been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized trades. man. Assuming that a certificate is given, or that a man complies otherwise with the requirements laid down, what is there to compel a union to admit him as a member? Several cases, have come before me of men who have been full y qualified for a particular occupation, who have been offered employment, and against whom no personal reason can be. advanced for refusing to accept them as unionists, yet . they have been refused admittance to a That, in itself, is a sufficient bar to employment, because the Minister knows that in the' metal trades no NOES. unionist will work with a non-unionist. It would be useless for a man to obtain fro m the committee a certificate of recognition as a tradesman unless such a recogFrederick nition entitles him to membership of the union pertaining to ,the craft in which be wishes to work / Paragraph a of the definition which I have just quoted defines a recognized tradesman as a person who was employed prior to the PAIRS. 8th May, 1940 as a tradesman. That was the date of - the dilution agreement, and T should like to know whether the provision limits recognition to persons who were tradesmen in Australia at that time, or does it cover persons who were tradesmen elsewhere, such as British servicemen who might have been good tradesmen before that date? Paragraph d of the definition provides that a recognized tradesman means a person who bas been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized-tradesman. Does that mean that it is open to the committee, to give OIACJI a certificate, irrespective - |iia.lifications stipulated in paragraphs h and c? . Mr Holt (Faulkner) [8.21] - Thi bill seeks to restore in the unions cerned pre-war. practices. I understand able to obtain permanent employment that, before the Avar, recognized men included those persons who had qualified by apprenticeship in a particuately lar trade, and also those who ulevated. by their, employers, and were thereafter paid tradesmens' rates. Such persons were regarded by their employers and by the unions also as fully qualified, and were accepted by the union for - - bership as fully fledged tradesmen. now ask the Minister to state, out of long experience in industrial matters, what is the approximate number of such persons in the unions under review, what proportion of them would today be recognized as tradesmen under the provisions of-the bill. . The point raised by the honourable clear. member for Warringah (Mr .Spender) about tradesmen who come here from f>ther countries is important. The ister for Migration (Mr Calwell) that it was proposed to bring to Australia 1,000 building tradesmen. Minister inform the committee what be the position of those men when a rrive ?",71
249,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Balaclava) [8.24] - I - this clause, - ""recognized tradesman"" means a person who was employed prior ro the 8tK May, 1940, as a tradesman. It is not stipulated that such a person shall have worked, at his trade within recent years. He may have been out the tTade for many years. Thus, status of a member of any of the 31 trades listed in the schedule is preserved, though be may not have worked at his trade for years, and he is given priority over an air force fitter who worked high-speed engines or on maintenance . .jobs. Such a person must go before mittee in order to prove that he is fit be recognized as a tradesman, and committee there need not be one returned serviceman. There may be. a serviceman on it by chance, but not by virtue of bill. This clause loads the hill against ' the servicemen. I regard the bill as necessary. It is a piece of skilful of ihe flage, and this is the principal camoua, flaging clause. Why should aman who worked in Australia at good wages all. throughout the war-be may have had s good reasons for not joining the forces, conbut the fact remains that be did not-be tradesand full security, while the man who served in the forces cannot be immediclassed as a tradesman, and must bad been rank second in priority? The Government says it hopes that - whole industries will migrate to Australia. We join in that hope, and I seememno reason why it should not be fulfilled, I if we are sensible in our politics, and in 1 his our taxation policy. However, if tbisbill is passed in its present form, the position of qualified tradesmen from overand seas who - come, to Australia will not be clear. When be was .speaking, ] asked the Minister to define the positionof tradesmen migrating here from Great Britain, but he did not make the position",72
250,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wentworth) [8.27]. Min- - Tb e bill defines a ""recognized tradessaid man "" as a person who was employedprior to the Stb May, 1940, as a tradesCan the man. As the honourable member for Warwill ringah (Mr Spender) pointed out, that they was the date upon which the dilution agreement was made', but I want to know what effect this provision will have upon n - an apprentice who did not complete hiatraining until 1941, who then became a recognized tradesman in his industry, and later went overseas and served in the armed forces for a period... Such a person cannot have served for the requisite of period at his trade, and he was not athe recognized tradesman on the 8th May, 1940. Perhaus the-Minister will say that, even he is covered by paragraph b of the difinition of "" recognized tradesman "", but 1 should like the position to be clarified. on . The point made about the closing of the books of unions to persons over 23 a comyears of age is important, and the practo tice is a menace to servicemen. I should on the like to know what action the Minister proposes to take to ensure that, the booksshall be re-opened. , In the Re-establishthis ment and Employment Bill, there was a clause to compel unions to accept serviceunmen as members,'but that power has notcamoubeen exercised,' despite protests from.' honourable members. What will be the position of servicemen who .have fulfilled their indentures and other requirements at a date later than that set down in the agreement? If be - be given recognition in the particular trade in which be proposes to engage, what action will the Government take to see that be will get union recognition As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender.)' this bill will enable the unions to exercise a form of industrial, dictatorship. Tbey will be able to refuse membership of their organizations if they so desire. If a union believes that it has sufficient members to cover the absorptive capacity of the industry it will refuse to open its books to newcomers, [f a non-unionist is employed in any shop a union will declare a strike in that ticular shop until such time as the non-unionist is discharged. This bill has been represented as a rehabilitation measure; that in itself pre-supposes that the Government intends to give full effect to promise of full preference to ex-servicemen. If that be so, the Minister should have no difficulty in saying what action he proposes to' take to safeguard the interests of trained men who do not come within the provisions of the bill, and to state definitely whether, on being recognized as tradesmen, they will have the right to join their appropriate unions. - Mr Rosevear (Dalley) ' [8.32] Following the movement of large numbers of people into the engineering trade just after the outbreak of the war, I was appointed a member of the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee which was established by the Menzies Government. In the course of my service on that committee, I had ample opportunity to see the working of the dilution scheme and the benefits it brought to. the war effort. I am amazed, therefore, to' tear criticism voiced by honourable members opposite of the definition of what is known as a "" recognized tradesman"". The definition of a "" recognized tradesman "" in the measure now before us is much broader and more generous than that contained in the original dilution 'agreement signed by the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart), and in the second agreement signed by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt).",72
251,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I negotiated the agreement in the first place.,73
252,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Simila r agreements were also signed by the present ? Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) and the Minister, for Transport (Mr Ward). I propose briefly to traverse the original agreement in order to show quite clearly that thedefinition of "" recognized tradesman"" has been considerably widened in this bill. , ",73
253,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That is not the point.,73
254,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wit h respect to par- the honourable member, I contend that it is relevant to the point. This bill deals with certain regulations which were promulgated following the making of an agreement between the Government and its certain trade unions, under which it was agreed that the unions were to forgo a number of customs and' usages of their particular trades. One of the principal unions affected by the agreement was the Engineering Trades Union which had a very rigid system of apprenticeship and tradesmanship. In the engineering trade before the war, no man was recognized as an engineer unless be had served a full time apprenticeship at his .trade. When it became necessary to expand the engineering trades to meet wa'r requirements and . the number of engineers available was insufficient to cater for that expansion, the unions were approached and readily agreed to admit dilutees to the industry, subject to the important safeguard that after the war had terminated the Government would agree to revert - to the customs and usages previously obtaining in the trade. The original agreement signed by the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) as Minister for Social Services provided that, as soon as the necessities of war no longer existed, the men who had sacrificed the customs and usages of their trade in order to submit to dilution would have their former rights restored. During this debate, there bas been a lot of talk about trade union tyranny. The original agreement providedNo ""' recognized "" tradesman A recognized tradesman at that time was one who had served a full apprenticeshipis to be discharged because of a reduction - of work in his section whilst any of the "" added "" tradesmen are employed within that - section, and when skilled labour becomes avail.able restoration of the pre-agreement practices will be made.",73
255,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Tba t is all right.,74
256,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I am endeavouring to point out that the honourable member is trying to repudiate the provisions - of the first agreement. I repeat that at that time there was no recognized tradesman other than the man who had served ' a full-time apprenticeship.,74
257,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,No up-graded men?,74
258,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,There were no upgraded men then; there were no dilutees. NTo persons who bad not completed full time apprenticeship were being paidfull rates of wages.,74
259,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Does the honourable member contend that at the time no men had been elevated to the position of tradesmen and were being paid as such?,74
260,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Yes . A recognized tradesman in the engineering industry was one who bad served his full apprenticeship. The Engineering Union was then completely organized, and the agreement to keep recognized tradesmen in employment while other men were put off was part and parcel of the principle of preference to skilled unionists. Not only was the agreement signed by the ministerial representative of the parties opposite; it also recognized that the unionist, while forgoing the time-honoured principles of his union in order to meet the exigencies of the war, would have his full rights restored to him after the war bad terminated. It was realized then that in the event of work slackening tha first men to go would be the dilutees or added tradesmen. Let us look at that clause. [140] about which there has been so much discussion. The clause provides- "" Recognized tradesman "" means a person who, in relation to any trade to which thi? Part applies- (a) was empioj'ed, prior to the eighth day of May, One thousand nine hundred and forty, as a tradesman; That was the date of the first agreement(d) has been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized tradesman; Tbat gets right back to the original position. The man had to be either employed as a tradesman at the prescribed date or an apprentice who bad served his time and had gained a certificate. But this is where this bill broadens the definition. The third classification covers "" one who has completed his course of training as a trainee tradesman to the satisfaction of a local committee "". Prior to the signing of the first agreement, nobody was a recognized tradesman until he bad served a full-time apprenticeship. This clause makes provision for the inclusion of men who had completed to the satisfaction of the local committee a course of training, as a trainee tradesman. The next important definition relates to trainee tradesmen. A trainee tradesman is defined as "" a member of the forces (not being an apprentice) whose employment as a trainee tradesman in a trade to which this part applies; for the purpose of undergoing a course of training in an industrial establishment, has been authorized by a local committee"". Honourable members will see that this interpretation of a recognized tradesman is infinitely broader thantbe definition included in the original agreement signed with the union. I come now to the right of the unions to close their books. While the provisions of this bill remain the law, the unions will not be in a position to close their books except on the advice of a local committee, and there are good reasons for believing that that might be done because the committee is representative of the unions and the employers. If the employers were of opinion that a greater number of men were needed in a particular trade, surely they would not agree to the union closing its books. But the representatives of both employers and employees, and the chairman appointed by the Minister, might come to the conclu-.. dion that the trade was overmanned, that the prospects of the industry were such that new men should not be introthe duced. Surely, in the event of a setback or economic depression, the partly trained men would be the first to be dismissed. The committee, as a responsible body, would be able to gauge the man-power requirements of the industry. That is all-important. It is rubbish to talk about faking ex-servicemen into this scheme, i 'here are no safeguards whereby, at any particular time, some responsible body --an say, "" The prospects of this industry are not bright, and there seems little possibility of its expansion. You should"" not be encouraged to join it "" . '",74
261,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Tba t argument could be applied to every industry.,75
262,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Does the honorto-day, able member believe that he does the but, ex-serviceman a good ' turn by inviting him to seek employment .in an industry whether there is work in it or not? ""What would be - the use of saying to such man, "" Come into this industry.. ""We shall train you, but as soon as we experience a setback, you must be the first to be rbrown out?"" In the last analysis, the pledge. employer would always give preference to the most skilled tradesmen in his Honourable members would not do exnot servicemen a good turn by inviting to go into an industry, the ramifications of which they do not understand. The conditions of the industry will be much better understood by a committee conclearly sisting of representatives of unions employers presided over by a chairman nominated by the Minister. In ' the circumstances which I have outlined, such a committee would say to the man, "" I your own interests, you should consider looking to another industry for employin ment. If you join this industry, you when we were the Government. might waste a couple of years of your life in being trained for a trade which eannot permanently absorb you "". All us remember that after World War I . men were encouraged temporarily to go into industries which were doomed fail. We no longer desire to put square pegs into round holes. Every man should he given an opportunity, as far as practicable, to follow the calling for. which be is best suited. This bill, in effect, not only broadens the interpretaand tion of "" recognized tradesman"", but also says to the man who has been in services, "" Provided there is work"" or prospects of continued employment in an industry, here is an opportunity which you probably never had .before to learn a useful occupation "". I have followed this matter very closely. Erankly, as a trade - unionist, I had grave misgivings when the engineers were the first to sign the f agreement, because I know bow easy it is. years afterwards, for one of the contracting parties to shirk its obligations, and that is exactly what is happening today. When the agreement was negotiated on behalf of the Menzies Government, Ministers did not talk about ex-servicemen. The added tradesmen, the dilutees, were wanted then, but the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) said "" Tbey are all right in war-time, in peace-time, I will fight them to the last ditch"". He meant that he would sign a solemn agreement or support a Ministry that signed a solemn agreement a in order to ensure the production of the weapons of war, but - that, when the war. was over and he did not need munitions to protect his bide, he would repudiate his shop. . Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.46] - I did intend to speak at length on this them clause; but the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) has given such a distorted version' of the attitude of the Opposition that I must state the facts for the benefit of the committee. and Apparently be did not have the benefit of hearing the full debate on the second reading, because, speaking on behalf of and with the full authority of the Oppon sition, I said that we intended fully to honour the obligation that we accepted' entering into the dilution agreement The honourable member referred to the fact, that the agreement was signed by the then of Minister for Supply and Development .(Sir Frederick Stewart) ; but, if any responsibility for the agreement is to be to taken, I take it, because, as Minister assist in gthe Minister for Supply and Development, I negotiated and carried is the agreement through to the point at which the parties, were agreed and the arrangement was submitted to the net. I have followed it with great interest ever since. We would not have divided the House on the second reading bad Minister, for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) not indicated that would reject the three amendments foreshadowed in my second-reading speech, which would ""do nothing to judice the rights of the unionists the agreement, but would do something preserve the rights of the servicemen, whom, this bill is ostensibly designed benefit. The dilution agreement designed to give us when we were plunged into war the necessary rapid expansion the munitions industries by an infusion into the metal trades of a group who had not qualified through apprentice-, ship for the work. The. ready lead the Amalgamated Engineering' Union, which is affiliated with its counter_ part in Great Britain, in accepting dilutees, was followed by other four unions. I assured unions on behalf of the then government that the main clause of the agreement enshrined the principle upon which discussion revolves, namely that preferduring ence in employment would be given to recognized tradesman, who was defined a person who was in a trade and accepted as a tradesman when the agreement - made, over the added tradesmen, on the . basis that the last to come should first to go. No recognized tradesman was to be displaced while added tradesbership men remainedin employment. We as determined to honour that pledge is the Government. Although we mented-that the bill gave a stronger of protection to recognized tradesmen than the dilution agreement gives, our criticism was of the exclusion from ' bill of a large body of men with trade experience, not apprentices or qualified, but men like motor mechanics or others with some trade experience, who served in the forces. The honourable member for Dalley says that in effect in that - agreement we gave preference to unionists and excluded ex-servicemen. Tbat, was never an' element of our discover cussions. It is to the credit of the unions concerned and to the Government the employers that they tried to deal a situation that no one at that time Cabijudge with authority. Who knew in 1940 whether the war would last twelve months or ten years, or whether our factories the would be in the front line of attack, bombed out' and shattered as in Great he Britain, - or invaded as in Erance and that I Russia? Tbey were matters that we could not consider as within the scope preof reality. We could not even realise under bow the war would develop. But we to could determine the respective rights of recognized tradesmen and added tradesto men, and that is what we set out to cover was in the agreement. We have no intention of departing from the principles set of out therein. After World War I . the Minister spoke about this. Governments of men took action to facilitate the entry of returned men into trades and proof fessions. Accelerated courses were given at the universities to ex-servicemen in the professions of law, medicine and dentistry, and I have no doubt that in the the trades similar assistance - was given the to them to get back into civil life. Our criticism is of the failure of the Government to give a reasonable opportunity to this tens of thousands of ex-servicemen who, the war were trained in mechanitbe cal or technical units and desire to go as into the civil counterparts of the trades in which they were engaged. We know was - that this, is not an easy problem. I earlier cited the enormous growth during be the the war of the membership of unions - associated with metal trades. The memof the Amalgamated Engineering are Union rose from about 29,000 in as 1939 to the peak figure of about com- '74,000 in 1944. Even today 64,000 right persons are members of the union, and, unless a considerable expansion of the engineering trade occurs, obviously there the will not be scope for a vast body of men to enter' it. In the Army and A ir Force alone the men engaged in the trades affected by this bill numbered about 60,000. Many of them were tradesmen when they enlisted, and no doubt mos.t"" of these will want to return to their civil trades. Our strongest criticism has been directed to the three points that I will later with amendments. I do not intend to go into those matters now. I merely and rose to state my view of the correct with position of the Menzies Government could and the employers' organizations that negotiated the dilution agreement with the unions. Tiiat .agreement stands. We want to honour it, and, as between .the recognized tradesmen and the added tradesmen, the principle itbe last to come should be the first to go must apply. But added tradesmen will get practical preferonce, although the bill is discreetly silent on that point, over men with a comparable training and service in the forces. The added tradesman is on the job There is no proposal to displace him. The Minister bas. told us that there are still 24,000 added tradesmen in the trades today. In Victoria of 273 applications for training only 27 have been approved. There must be tens of thousands of men with training equal to that of the dilutees still - in the services or demobilized. There are 24,000 added tradesmen still in the trades as against the 27 ex-servicemen accepted for training in Victoria. I imagine that the proportion of men accepted in the other States is about the same. If that does not signify practical preference given, to the added tradesmen, I do not know what does. I do not criticize the added tradesmen, who did a valuable job during the war, but they have had no greater training and have no greater rights than the men who weretrained in"" the forces. The added tradesman is a member of his union, and under this legislation, without the safeguards of my amendments, be will receive preference in practice over the men whose training was received as members of the forces. He will have absolute preference over added tradesmen with two or three years trade experience before the war who served during the war in combatant units. These servicemen are absolutely excluded from the metal trades group while the provisions of the bill remain unchanged. The Opposition adheres to the dilution agreement, but insists upon amendments that will give nothing short of bare justice to the .serviceman who is entitled to his opportunity in these trades.",75
263,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Warringah) [8.57] I hoped that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) would speak before I rose again.,77
264,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I will speak. ' Mr .SPENDER - I am glad of that. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) has engaged in his usual practice-rathe r mnworthy of a man occupying the iSpeakersbip of the House of Representatives-o Â£ making false allegations against another member for the purpose of bolstering his arguments.,77
265,Mr ROSEVEAE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The y were not false. - Mr SPENDER - I .shall deal with the honourable member in a moment. I can deal with him when he joins in committee consideration of a bill, even though - his high office protects him in the House. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Barnard) - Order ! Deal with the clause.",77
266,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I will, and in doing so I will deal-with the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley. He said that I had said that the dilution agreement was all right - during the war, but that when peace came it was a different matter. That is completely false. The honourable member must know it is false, or be did not listen to the' debate on the second reading, because what I said was that, under the terms of this bill, a. right was vested in the local committee to prevent an employer from dismissing men. I said that that was all right to meet the exigencies of war; but I went on to say that in, time of peace it could not be justified. What I said bad nothing to do with the subject that we are now discussing. The honourable member for Eawkner (Mr. Holt) made pur position on this bill clear. We stand four-square for carrying out the dilution agreement, the terms of which I read to honourable members, and from the terms of which no warrant can be found for the exclusion of ex-servicemen from the benefits of this bill. This bill will do more th'an extend the provisions of the dilution' agreement. It will exclude ex-servicemen very largely from entering the industry.",77
267,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Order! I ask the honourable member to confine his. remarks to this clause, which deals with definitions.",77

269,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member is discussing the general purposes of the bill.,78
270,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wit h great respect, I am not able to discuss this clause without having regard to the purposes of the bill. The measure contains various definitions and provisions relating to recognized tradesmen, and I am pointing out that when I asked three questions, the honourable member for Dalley did not answer one of them. "" Recognized tradesman"" means a person who, in relation to any trade to which this part applies(a) was employed, prior to the eighth day of May,' One thousand nine hundred and forty, as a tradesman; The first question which I asked'was: Is this intended to be confined solely to the persons employed in Australia prior to the 8th May, 1940, as tradesmen? If . the answer be in the affirmative, this provision will exclude ex-servicemen from Great Britain who may migrate here; I have received a copy of a letter which the Ex-Imperial Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's League addressed to the Minister for Labour and National Service seeking to have the definition clause widened so as to include British ex-servicemen who have the qualification of tradesmen. The honourable gentleman replied by telegram, as follows- . Definition member forces Tradesmens Rights Act same as definition in Re-establishment and Employment Act. No intention to amend Re-establieshment Act. Therefore, unable amend Tradesmens Rights Act. I point out that, apart from the complete non sequitur in the telegram, the definition of "" member - of the Forces "" in the Re-establishment and. Employment Act does not include British ex-servicemen. If this bill excludes British ex-servicemen, we shall know where' we stand, and, no doubt, the Government will give reasons for its decision.. A ""recognized tradesman"" is also a person who, in relation to any trade to which, this part of the bill applies-> (a) has been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized tradesman. Does it mean that a person may be granted a certificate in respect of any industry or any trade, regardless of whether he complied with the specific qualifications contained in the bill? Tbat question is clear, and I am entitled to an answer. It may be that many dilutees have already received certificates. I do not know. But I should like to know whether power is given, by virtue of this definition, to the local committees, to grant certificates of recognition to any person whom they think fit, irrespective of whether be was employed prior to the 8th May, 1940, and was an apprentice, a trainee or a probationary trainee. Surely I am entitled to an answer to that question! My third question is, assuming that a man. bas been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized tradesman, is the union obliged to accept him as such? I pointed out, when dealing with clauses 35 and 41, 'that a local committee had power to determine whether a person shall or shall not follow one or more of the trades mentioned in the bill. If a local committee refuses to grant to that person a certificate, be had no appeal from its decision. What I seek to discover is, assuming that he does get a certificate, what obligation, if any, is imposed upon the union to accept him ? He bas to apply to a local committee for a certificate, obtain a certificate, seek employment, be told that he is a non-unionist, ask the union to admit him as a member, and perhaps be met with a refusal. Itwill be futile to tell me that that will not occur. I know of specific instances of such occurrences in other industries. I am not very much persuaded by the argument that a local committee will know whether saturation point bas been reached in any particular industry, and consequently will not issue a certificate unless there is room for more employees. It does not follow that a man, having got the certificate, will be entitled to follow his avocation. Otvr protest upon this bill can be made quite plainly. We are wholly in favour of protecting the rights of the men who were employed as tradesmen prior to the dilution agreement. As I said in my second-reading speech, the purpose of the agreement was to protect those men against dilutees. The whole basis of our contention, which has not yet been met except by alleging that it has been answered, is that as the result of these definitions and the consequent provisions of the bill operating them, ex-servicemen will be excluded except under limited conditions. ' They must satisfy a local committee, and if its decireason', sion be adverse, they have no remedy. Those are my three questions, and I hope thai they will be answered. Honourable members must concede that I am entitled to know precisely what interpretation the Government has placed upon the definitions.",78
271,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Dalley) [9.8] - I listened in vain for some convincing argument by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) - against my submission that the interpretation of the persons who will be acceptable under this scheme is infinitely broader than the agreement which was signed by the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) on behalf of the government of the day. The honourable member for Fawkner endeavourtd to cloud the issue by mixing the teem "" added tradesman"" with that of "" recognized tradesman"". He would have us believe that at the time the agree- mont was signed, there were classes of people other than the recognized tradesmen and the apprentices who were learning to be recognized tradesmen. Of course, there were not, and the award covering the engineering trades at that'time specifically precluded any unapprenticed youth or woman from doing anything which could be described as work for journeymen and apprentices. So no confusion can arise regarding the conditions existing at the time this agreement was signed. I emphasize that the agreement did not contain any 'provision nearly so generous as the provision in this bill. Definitely the agreement provided that in the event of the slackening of work, the whole of it should be monopolized by members of the Amalgamated Engineers Union who were recognized tradesmen and bad served their apprenticeship. Tbat meant, in effect, preference to unionists. This bill is not.a measure for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen except in the sense that in the formulation of the legislation, there is recognition that the engineering industry is expanding, the prospects are good, and there is a likeliliood of permanent employment in it. For that the situation is visualized that not only recognized tradesmen, but also dilutees and added tradesmen will have permanent jobs. In addition, there will still be room for ex-servicemen who desire to enter the industry. The honourable member for Fawkner built up a man of straw with the object of knocking it down. He visualized thousands of men entering the industry. Of course, that is foolish. I challenge the honourable member to prove that thousands of servicemen had three years' experience as apprentices in this trade. About six months after the outbreak of World War II . , and from that time onward, men who had three years' experience in the trade were not allowed to enlist. Therefore, the situation visualized by the honourable member does not exist. When early in 1940 the agreement was signed between the Government of which be was a member and the union, the necessity for the arrangement Was a clear indication', that the manpower authorities would not allow men to drift out of an industry that .the Government was endeavouring to build up with added tradesmen and dilutees. It would have been utterly foolish for the man-power authorities and the military authorities. to permit thousands of men with three years apprenticeship in the engineering industry to drift into the forces. Six months after the time of which I - speak, in order to encourage greater production, the factories were paying a f u ll journeyman's wages to m e n who were entering their last year of apprenticeship; I make those statements in order to emphasize the almost desperate position of this industry at the time when the honourable member for Fawkner considered that thousands of men were drifting from it. The conditions about which he spoke could not possibly have existed. The honourable member for Warringah said that he stood four square by the original agreement, entered into by the Government of which he was a member. What did the honourable gentleman mean by that remark? He has not been able to controvert what I have said concerning the definition of ""recognized tradesman"" in this bill, which is infinitely broader tban the definition in the agreement made by the Government of which be was a member.",79
272,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I shall deal .with that matter under the relevant clause. Will the honourable member answer the questions that I asked?,80
273,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I propose to do so. The honourable member asked what would happen in respect' of a tradesman who came to Australia from' overseas. Tbat question is answered in paragraphs a and b of the definition of "" recognized tradesman "". The definition provides that a-"" Recognized tradesman"" means a person who, in relation to any trade to which this Part applies(o) was employed prior to the eighth day ' of May, One thousand nine hundred and forty as a tradesman.",80
274,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,It does not say in Australia.,80
275,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,If it said in Australia there might be something to argue about.,80
276,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I do not think that the Minister would give the same reply to my question.,80
277,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not care what reply the Minister.would give. I understand plain English as well as the next man. To be qualified as a "" recognized tradesman"" a person must have been employed as a tradesman on the 8th May, 1940. That is quite clear. Therefore tradesmen from overseas are ' amply covered. Paragraph b relates to a person whohas qualified or qualifies hy service as an apprentice for employment as a tradesman. It is not stated that the qualification must be gained in Australia., If a trades^ man from Great Britain came to Australia-and I suppose we shall be glad to receive as many artisans from Britain as we can get-be would be qualified under the bill if he were a tradesman on the 8th May, 1940. Tbat disposes of the first question asked by the honourable member. The honourable gentleman's next question concerned men who bad been granted a certificate of recognition as a recognized tradesman. The local committees that will be authorized to grant these certificates will consist of two representatives of the union, two representatives of the employers and a representative of the Minister who' will be chairman. Surely it will not be suggested that the employers' representatives will vote for admission to any trade of a man who is an absolute "" dud "".",80
278,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,No one has suggested that.,80
279,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,A person who is granted a certificate by one of these committees will be entitled to recognition - as a tradesman. ',80
280,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,We all know that.,80
281,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If the honourable gentleman knew it, why was be so stupid as to ask the question? It is not likely that the representatives of the employers would agree to grant certificates tomen regardless of their qualifications. If such men were certificated they would become a burden on industry, and there must be a safeguard against that kind of thing.",80
282,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Will the union be under any obligation to accept as a member persons who are granted certificates by these committees?,80
283,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I take it that these committees will act by general agreement. The representative of the Minister will hold the balance between the two parties, and in the case of disagreement it will rest with him to say whether a man shall be granted a certificate of recognition or not. I understand that the trade unions involved in this matter are heart and soul behind this proposed legislation. I do not visualize, in such circumstances, that when these committees grant a certificate of recognition to a ""person there will be any reason why he should not be received into the union. The honourable gentleman, as a matter of fact, bas been setting up men of straw in order to knock them down'. If the representative of the Minister reported intolerable action against the spirit of this measure, I have no doubt that the Minister would have power to remove the person causing the trouble. The difficulties forecast by the honourable member for Warringah are not likely to arise, and I cannot for the life of me .understand why honourable gentlemen opposite are objecting to the broadening of the definition of men who will be eligible to come within the scheme.",80
284,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Indi) [9.23] - Tne honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) bas spoken twice on this clause and so is not able to speak again, but he put his case at considerable length and in words of almost one syllable, before he could induce the honourable member forDalley (Mr Rosevear) to descend from his elevated position to floor of the chamber to put his construcbership, tion upon paragraph a of the definition of "" recognized tradesmen"" and to exto plain what he thought of the entitlement of British ex-servicemen to recognition. The point could have been resolved easily and in a few words by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway). Even now the Minister granted could say, by interjection,, whether his opinion, British ex-servicemen come within the ambit of the scheme. I should be glad to hear bim express himself.",81
285,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,When the honourable gentleman resumes his 'seat I - shall try to answer two or three questions that have been raised.,81
286,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"This question could be answered by a simple "" Yes"" or ""No"". The British ex-serviceman is in or out. It is extraordinary to me that - be so? so many speeches should be needed to extract a - simple explanation from the Minister. I do not know what authority the honourable member for Dalley has to interpret the clause, but it is significant that the Minister bas refrained from giving an explanation. We shall wait with interest to bear whether the Minister confirms or disavows theexplanation given by the honourable member for stating Dalley, who used an incredible number of words in endeavouring to evade the real issue that is being raised. I frankly confess that I know more about live-stock than about the technicalities of trade for Bourkeunionism. I have never known a horse more difficult to get into a crush, nor a heifer more difficult to get into a bail, than the honourable member for Dalley has been to get into the ring to deal this issue, which, after all, is so simple that it should not require either eloquence or a great deal of talk to determine. wish to know whether the certificate of of recognition as a tradesman that will granted to individuals by these mittees will carry with it entitlement membership of the appropriate trade union, or whether it will be just another "" scrap of paper "". There is no mystery, about the issue. The honourable member for Dalley jigged about like a tap-dancer in endeavouring to avoid dealing with that issue. Will the Minister tell us plainly whether these certificates will the entitle the holders to trade union memfor unless they do, they will be worthless, for they will not enable a man get a job. If that is the position a certificate will be a sham. I ask for an answer to two.simple questions: Is the interpretation put on'the definition by the honourable member for. Dalley the true one, and will the men who are certificates by these committees in be entitled to union membership?",81
287,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Balaclava) [9.29] - I am glad that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) descended from his high place as Speaker of the House to discuss this subject in the committee, because he has made it perfectly clear that the status quo of unionists as at the 8th May, 1940, is to be preserved) and they are to enjoy No. 1 priority.",81
288,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Wb y should that not,81
289,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) believes in unionism before patriotism. Perhaps it is as well that I should mention here, that I have received a letter from the New Guinea Returned Soldiers Association objecting to the slur cast upon returned soldiers by the honourable member, and that it bad .written to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) requesting him to ask for an apology from the honourable gentleman for the remarks he made. It can be said of the honourable member His footballing cheers, And political jeers Equip him for everyday work. The honourable member for Dalley. has with clearly shown that the trade unionist comes first and the ex-serviceman second. If any doubt existed on that point, We it has been resolved by the text the bill. . According to this be clause, a probationary tradesman means com- "" an adult member of the forces to whose employment as a probationary tradesman in a trade to which' this Part applies has heen authorized by a local committee "". A trainee tradesman means "" a member of the forces, not being an apprentice, whose employment as a trainee tradesman in a trade to which this Part applies, for the purpose of undergoing a course of training in 'an industrial establishment, has been authorized by a local committee"". Therefore, an adult ex-serviceman must be either a probationary tradesman or a trainee tradesman. The persons who are to be protected are those unionists who were members of a union in 1940. Some of them may have gone overseas, but the majority remained in Australia. The essential thing is that all except those who were unionists in 1940 are in a different category; they are ticketed men. Ts it necessary that a man should have a licence to work in this country after be has been on active service in its defence for from four to six years? That appears to be the ' position. Surely the honourable member for Dalley has enunciated a policy of despair in having expressed the fear that these unions may be swamped with applications for membership. We do not want that. But at least we should be optimistic, and believe that production can be so expanded as to absorb these men. Otherwise, the unionists will have all the work preserved for them'.. Whilst some men are to be protected, - others who have had technical experience in the armed forces may he denied the right to be described as tradesmen in the country for which they fought. That is the issue, without exaggeration. Many of these men are skilled tradesmen. I have heard it stated that from the outbreak of the war approximately 30,000 men were given technical training in the Royal Australian Air Force, and became skilled craftsmen. The. Air Force established its own technical training schools, and staffed them with excellent instructors. pay tribute to the unions, which assisted to provide instruction in those schools. The Melbourne No. 1 Engineering School was larger than any technical school in Australia. There, were over 100,000 men and women in the ground staffs of the Royal Australian Air Force, in a total force of approximately 180,000. All of those 30,000 technically trained persons will be labelled probationers or trainees, notwithstanding that they can pit their skill against that of any other person. They will have to appear before a committee consisting, of two employers and two employees, with a Government representative as chairman. The members of the committees may be the fairest persons in the world. But why, in a democratic country, should not a man be permitted to obtain employment according to the degree of his skill.? All the members of the engineering unions are not highly skilled, nor have all of them passed through an apprenticeship. In the 31 classifications of tradesmen there are theseGround engineers, aircraft mechanic and ground engineer and aircraft mechanic, as specified in Classification No. 57 of clanie 3 (<*) of the Consolidated Award-Aircraf t .Industry of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; tradesman ground engineer or aircraft mechanic holding no certificate; motor cycle mechanic; motor mechanic; and motor tuner and tester. Many such men have not served an apprenticeship. Preference is to be given to men in .the aircraft industry who worked in an aircraft - factory for good wages and lived at home throughout the war. On the other hand, this legislation will operate against the man who went through a Royal Australian A i r Force technical training school and fitted himself to service a Spitfire or to become a flight engineer, or who may have piloted a Â£100,000 bomber such as the Lancaster in operational flying. Yet, in his native land, he is to be junior in the matter of employment to another man who happened to be a member of a union in 1940, even though that man may not have worked in his trade for years. I have asked the Minister to say whether that statement of the position is wrong in any respect. This is one of I the most dangerous and unfair bills that have been introduced in this Parliament. Merely because a man is a member of a union, it is likely that employment will be guaranteed to him, whereas the ex-serviceman is to be placed in the discard unless a committee permits him to be admitted to a trade after a period of training or an apprenticeship, no matter how skilled he may be. What will happen should there be a depression? There are portents of one in other countries, and over-control here will force one. There is a clause which provides that"" a man may he dismissed for certain reasons, but inefficiency is not one of them. The ex-serviceman who has had valuable technical training will have to take the labouring jobs, and do pick-and-shovel work. I hope that the Minister will not allow that to happen, and that he will accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Eawkner for the inclusion of these men in the scheme. If he does that, there will be no danger of the fears that I have expressed being realized. But if he does not, we cannot accept as a promise of adjustment any statement that he may make.",81
290,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.39] - Clause 10 deals with definitions. These are exactly the same as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) helped to draft when the dilution scheme was first brought into existence. The only difference between the proposal now before the committee and that for which the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) was responsible, in the evolving of which the honourable member for Fawkner played a prominent part, is that, by mutual agreement between employees and employers, other training facilities are being provided for ex-servicemen. Therefore, the very thing which the objectors, want to have done is being done. This addition was volunteered by union representatives and employers when they discussed in conference the discontinuance of the dilution scheme. The question asked repeatedly is: Who will come under the definition of "" recognized tradesman"" ? Recognized tradesman means any person who was employed as a tradesman prior to the 8th May, 1940, when the dilution scheme was first brought into existence; any person who has qualified or who qualifies by service as an apprentice for employment as' a tradesman; and any person who has completed his course of training as a trainee tradesman, as well as those men who broke their apprenticeship to serve . in the forces overseas, ex-servicemen who are probationary tradesmen, and recognized tradesmen from Great Britain.",83
291,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Does it also include any tradesmen froin Malta, the United States of America, or any other country?",83
292,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I would not go that far.,83
293,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Why not?,83
294,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) appears to consider that there is something sinister in this proposal because trade unions are associated with it. That is the very feature of it which provides a safeguard. The five skilled trades affected are part and parcel of the scheme. The engineering trades have already accepted as members, and admitted to employment, recognized tradesmen who have been discharged from the British Navy, and they will admit as many ex-servicemen from overseas as can show by the tickets that they hold that they are engineers, fitters or turners. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers has branches everywhere in the British Empire. It is one organization. The honourable member for Fawkner knows that as well as I do. Some members of it are continually travelling and working in different parts of the British Commonwealth. Naval tradesmen have been recognized as tradesmen under this scheme, and are working in engineering trades, in Australia. Others who follow them also will be recognized as tradesmen. It is expected that the scheme'will terminate within three years. Within six, eight or twelve months, probationary tradesmen will become recognized tradesmen, and those whose apprenticeship was broken will be in a similar category in less than three years. ' Mr WHITE - But they cannot be employed now as recognized tradesmen.",83
295,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"How couldthey be, if they are not tradesmen? I do not think that the honourable member for Balaclava has a grip of the matter. An - ex-serviceman who has given good service overseas may have obtained a smattering of engineering knowledge iri the Royal Australian Air Force. The honourable member says that these men got their training' in one of the ]' services, but are now in a worse position than recognized tradesmen under the act. As a matter of fact, such men are themselves aware that they are not fully trained tradesmen, and we want to train them fully. They will go into"" the scheme as trainees, and after two or three years they will be classified as recognized tradesmen. In the meantime, they will receive the wages of recognized tradesmen, the Government making up the difference between that wage and the wage that they are, for the time being, qualified to receive. How can there be anything harmful to servicemen in that ? The honourable member for Balaclava said that he can almost visualize the approach of another depression, and that if that should happen the ex-servicemen will get a very bad deal. As a matter of fact, this scheme is npcessary in order to protect the servicemen if there should be a depression. Of course, no one really believes that' there will be a depression, provided the country is run by a decent 'government like the present one. However, if there came a depression, the first persons to bo put off will be the dilutees. Tbey will have to make way for recognized tradesmen, including ex-servicemen.",83
296,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,iCa n dilutees become recognized tradesmen by undergoing training?,84
297,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,No .,84
298,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"But they are _ in the jobs now. - Mr Holloway-It is true that the dilutees are already in the trades, but when tradesmen re-enter the trades in greater numbers, the dilutees will probably go back to the positions of process workers. I helped to draw up this scheme, because I followed the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt). Senator MCBride wanted the tool-makers to break up the work and to up-grade fitters and turners so that they would be able to do some of the work of tool-makers. We wanted 7,000 tool-makers for 1940-41, hut there were only between 500 and 600 in the whole of Australia. I remember that the board room where we met was strewn with hundreds of precision tools which were needed for the making of munitions. We were shown blanks from which the precision tools would eventually be made. We asked how much onu'ld be cut off the time devoted to the work by the actual precision workers, and eventually the time was broken down and down until only the special precision part of the job was left to the tool-makers. I have satisfied the honourable member' for Balaclava that ex-servicemen willqualify very soon as recognized tradesmen. Then he retorts that that is no good* to him unless the unions will accept ex-servicemen as members. The answer is-' that the engineering, unions have never yet closed their books against any one.",84
299,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,What about the tally clerks ?,84
300,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has twice addressed himself to this clause, and the Minister did not interject. I intend now to ensure that the Minister is not interrupted, and I will not call honourable members to order again.",84
301,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The irrelevant interjection of the honourable member for Balaclava shows that he has already lost his case. As I have said, the engineering unions will not close their books against new members. They have been parties to the scheme from thebeginning. Were it not for their cooperation, Australia could not have made such a splendid war effort. Therefore, it is in bad taste to suggest that members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which has done so much for the country, would refuse to let ex-servicemen work with them, even if they were recognized tradesmen. I have so much faith in the men associated with the union that I have not the slightest fear that they will act in the way suggested. Honourable members opposite have also suggested that unless servicemen are. accepted by the unions they will not be allowed to work. I - will not admit that that is correct.",84
302,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wide Bay) [9.55] - I thank the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) for the trouble he has taken to explain points to members of the Opposition. He is. one Minister who does know his job. I should like him to explain the position regarding electricians, with reference to servicemen who qualified, perhaps after having had some prior experience, during their period of service in one of the armed forces. Such, men are thoroughly qualified, and are ready to receive certificates. What is their chance of obtaining employment? I represent an important industrial centre where many Royal Australian. Air Eorce men qualified during the war as electricians, but they are finding it difficult to obtain employment.",84
303,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour, and National Service) [9.56],-First , the honourable member wants to - know what will.happen in regard, to electricians who served in the forces, and then be asks why can they not get a job at their trade. It may be that ""there are not enough jobs in the electrical trade for all first-class electricians. In that case some of them will have to do something else in the meantime. I remind the honourable member that electricians are qualified to come under this scheme. A man who has worked as an electrician in 'the forces can, after a period of training, become qualified to receive a certificate. There are also State apprenticeship commissions which issue certificates to plumbers, engine drivers and electricians qualifying them to work at those trades. When the men have fully qualified, they must still compete with others in order to get jobs. The electrician who has served in the forces will get a certificate if he goes through 'with the training scheme.",85
304,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,What about the wireless air-gunner? - Mr Holloway - He would very ?oon get his. certificate.,85
305,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Indi) [9.59] - The Minister has somewhat belatedly explained two of the points raised by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender). I do not know whether to describe his explanation as more and more about less and less, or as less and less about more and more. If the law were to lie interpreted in the court, not according to what is written in the act, but by what a Minister said during the committee stages of the bill,, it would be easier for lawyers to interpret the law. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender)' asked whether it was intended that this clause would cover the position of 'migrant British ex-servicemen.",85
306,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The answer is ""Yes"".",85
307,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I remind the committee that the Minister said earlier that it would cover migrant ex-servicemen from the United Kingdom. When, by' interjection, he was questioned as to the position of other Empire ex-service personnel, he said that it would cover migrant ex-servicemenfrom the British Dominions. There should be no doubt about what is actually meant. The clause itself is silent on the point; it merely provides for the inclusion of persons who were employed as tradesmen prior to a certain date. Only two interpretations can be placed upon the language in which it is expressed. It either applies solely to Australian citizens, or it applies without limit to any tradesman who may come to this country. If there is no limit to its application it would cover a tradesman from Sweden equally with one from the United Kingdom. The Minister's explanation has only added to the confusion of the committee. It is not proper that .the committee should be invited to translate into law words which the spokesman. of the Government either cannot or will not interpret. The Minister can find no greater justification for saying that the clause applies to British ex-service personnel who may migrate to. Australia than for saying, that it covers a migrant Maltese ex-serviceman. If it has application only to Australians at least we can understand its implications; if it is to be construed as having general application we do not know what its implications are. ll f it applies without restriction, the more migrants to whom this entitlement is conceded the more inevitably will be the occasions when Australian ex-servicemen .will he excluded from thebenefits of the Re-establishment and Employment Act. It is clear that .the benefits of that legislation are to be overridden by the provisions of this measure at the discretion of a' local committee. The more people brought into this country and granted certificates of recognition the more occasions will inevitably arise when local committees will have to. decide whether, a certificated person who is not an ex-serviceman shall be entitled to be employed in preference to an. Australian ex-serviceman, notwithstanding the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act. Obviously the greater the number of people covered by this provision the less justification will there be for imposing on our own Australian ex-servicemen, who at the moment are not entitled to certificates of recognition, the conditions contained in the provision relating to trainee or probationary tradesmen.",85
308,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"That is not likely to happen. I have already said some engineers who were formerly in the British Navy have already been admitted. That does not mean that the door will be left wide open and that preference to Australian ex-servicemen will be destroyed The whole scheme operates for a period. of only three years, and the number of migrants who will come to this country during that period will not be very great.",86
309,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Whils t the Minister's reply is satisfying in some, respects, I point out that his. words in debate are not the law. The law is embodied in the act which is passed by this Parliament. On the one band the honourable gentleman would have us believe that the Commonwealth Government is entering into an agreement with the British Government for migration on a grand scale; on the other hand he now admits that not many. British ex-servicemen will come to Australia in the next three years.",86
310,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Order! The honourable member is. not in order in discussing immigration.,86
311,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do so only' insofar as immigration is intimately connected with the provisions of the clause. Immigration' on a grand scale would automatically bring to this country very many men who would be entitled to receive certificates. The second question raised by the honourable member for Warringah was whether the issue of a certificate of recognition carried automatic entitlement to membership of a union. We endeavoured to get the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) up to the barrier on that issue, but he shied away. We would, at, least, have expected the Minister to say whether the issue of'a certificate will, in fact, carrv such an entitlement. The. honourable gentleman, however,, merely repliedthat the books of the Amalgamated Engineering Union are already open, and he expects them to remain open. The provisions of this bill, however, extend far ^beyond the, sole organization referred to. by the honourable gentleman. What has he to say in respect of the other unions? The real issue is that we have before us a proposed law, under which Australian ex-servicemen may be given certificates of recognition, but their entitlement to become members of the appropriate union, and thus secure employment, is to be dependent on the anion itself. The Minister says that the Amalgamated Engineering Union had a very .good record during the war, and that, therefore, we can be assured that it will do the fair thing in the admission of new members. The wheat-growers of this country also had a very good record during the war, but the question as to whether they should continue to grow wheat was not left to the determination of their organizations.",86
312,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Order! The wheat industry is not involved in this bill. Mr MCEWEN"" - An ex-serviceman who desires to engage in a rural industry, the name of which I . shall not mentio'nTbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - The honourable member may not discuss rural industries on this clause.",86
313,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"S u c h a man must go to a government authority in order to secure permission to engage in his chosen occupation; but an ex-serviceman who, because of his training, is entitled to. become a registered tradesman, is dependent upon the decision of a non-government authority, to wit, a trade union. The Minister has failed completely to give a .satisfactory explanation of these two simple but important points.. I trust that we may - be able to get the honourable gentleman to face the barrier and not shy away from it.",86
314,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,""" The honourable member's time has expired.",86
315,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Bourke) [10.14] - I suggest that the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) should go back to his farm and milk his cows and yard his calves. From the outset of his remarks he showed clearly that he knows very little about unions and, as he continued his rambling talk, he displayed his complete lack of knowledge of industrial matters. The agreement which this bill proposes to honour was made, in the first instance, between the government of the day, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the employers in the engineering trades. The Government proposes to carry out the terms of' that agreement by this' bill - The provisions of the measure, . however, are a little more liberal than those contained in the original agreement. Honourable members opposite are raising .bogys, in an endeavour to cloud the real issues. .Although they supported the government which was a party to the original agreement in 1940, it is clear that they are now seeking to repudiate its provisions. That is typical of their hostile attitude towards the industrial movement. Ever since I became a member of this Parlial have become increasingly aware of the fact that honourable members opposite believe that anything that emanates from a union or an industrial organization must be scotched. The Opposition must come into the open instead of beating about the bush. Honourable members opposite deny that they are advocating repudiation of the agreement made between the Menzies Government and the unions affected by dilution. If they are not trying to have the agreement repudiated, they must support the bill.",86
316,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,If the honourable memr ber listened to our speeches he - would know that we are not seeking to repudiate the agreement.,87
317,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Honourable * members opposite have raised all sorts of side issues: "" Will artisans who come to this country from overseas be recognized tradesmen? Will' apprentices be .able to qualify as recognized tradesmen ? "" What happens to people who come to Australia next year, the year after or in any subsequent year does not matter as far as this measure is concerned. It gives to the agreement entered into with the niions by the Menzies Government.",87
318,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member bas not read the bill if he thinks that.,87
319,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I have read the bill and I have read a little of the agreement that the honourable member negotiated.,87
320,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Well , read the whole of it",87
321,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Stan d up to the agreement.,87
322,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,We do.,87
323,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The Opposition wants to bring in all sorts of irrelevancies. Only a few minutes ago the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White), made his usual wail about preference to ex-servicemen. He has been wailing about that for years, but when he was a Minister of the Crown, he ignored his. opportunity to give them preference. A man who advocates a policy should have the honesty and sincerity to apply it when he has the chance.",87
324,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Chairman, the honourable member has said that I have not given preference to ex-servicemen. That is absolutely incorrect.",87
325,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That is not a point of order.,87
326,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If the honourable member for Balaclava were able to understand words, be would know that this bill goes as far as possible to help, ex-servicemen. Its prime purpose is to restore to the tradesmen in the engineering and other trades covered by the bill, the conditions that they had before 1940, in accordance with the promise of the Menzies Government that this would be done if the unions would accept, dilutees during the war. The members of the organizations - concerned in the agreement carried out their part, and it is this Government's duty to do it's part by putting them back in exactly the same position :as they - occupied before the agreement was signed. Further than that, the Government is providing, in plain terms, in the definitions, for exse.rvicemen who were not tradesmen when they joined the services but gained some engineering knowledge in their service in the Army, Navy or Air Force. I recom-effect mend the honourable member for Balaclava to read clause 10. He will then see that "" probationary tradesman"" means "" an adult member of the forces whose employment as a probationary tradesman in a trade to which this part applies has been authorized hy a local committee "". That bring the ex-servicemen, about whom the honourable member cries so plaintively, into the scheme. It gives them an opportunity of training in a skilled trade that they would hot have attained had they not joined the forces. Mr - WHITE - A lot of .them are trained.",87
327,Mr BUYS ON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Yes , in various ways. The honourable member referred to men skilled with aeroplane engines. They are covered. If . the honourable member had read the bill properly, he would know that.",88

330,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,It is up to the Chair do so.,88
331,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable mem-, ber has been here for many years and never learned anything.",88
332,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Order! I ask the honourable member Bourke to address himself to the clause.,88
333,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"In addition to carrythey ing out the agreement entered into by the Menzies Government, this Government is they can get. providing ex-servicemen with preferenneeded tial treatment. Opposition members not so much concerned about carrying out the agreement and giving preference to ex-servicemen, as with their primary object of attacking the Amalgamated Engineering Union.",88
334,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Nothin g of the sort!,88
335,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"That is true. The attack of honourable gentlemen opposite on the Amalgamated Engineering Union is similar to attacks that it makes on all sections of the industrial movelittle ment whenever opportunity offers in this cbamber. The attack, of the honourable - member for Balaclava is not on the agreement or the bill but on the union. honourable member, as well as other honour the able members opposite, have said that because some one has had some training somewhere and has a smattering of knowamongst ledge as the result of duty with'the armed forces he ought to be able to get into the engineering trade, and the suggestion that goes with that claim is that they will be non-unionists. I know many ex-servicemen. They do not want to get into any trade for which they are not qualified, and, above all, they do not want, to avoid trade union membership. On the contrary, when they return. to civil life and get' jobs, the first thing they do is join the union appropriate to their jobs. The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), asked, ""What about the books of the unions being closed ?"", but we beard of only one union whose books have been closed, the Tally Clerks Union, which is a very small organization. My to experience of the industrial movement, which is considerably greater than that of any honourable member opposite, is that the books of the unions are open to anyone who can competently fill the positions covered by their constitutions and to rules. I ask honourable members to go through the list of unions and check whether that is. not correct. The Amalgamated Engineering Union has - admitted to membership all people qualified as engineers that have sought to join it. That applies also to the Waterside for Workers Federation - The miners' federation will take more members if can be got. The unions associated with the building trade will take, all that The only qualification is skill in the trade or calling are covered by the' union. That is the case throughout the industrial movement. These Aunt Sallys that honor- able members opposite put up for us to knock down are' an indication of their hostility to' the industrial movement.",88
336,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Richmond) flO.24]. - The remarks of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) are scarcely worth replying to, and I would not bemyself by replying to most of them. I rose to answer certain statements of the Minister for Labour and National - Service (Mr Holloway) about who shall The be ' recognized as tradesmen. I have greatest admiration for the Amalgamated Engineering Union. It ranks with the Australian Workers Union the Australian trades unions and it did an excellent job in the war. It did negotiate an agreement for the dilution of its membership with - trainee tradesmen, and it must be'recognized that it has"" certain rights in the protection of the livelihood of its members who have given many years to learning their trade. That is not disputed by us. ""What we do claim is that, although the agreement was entered into with the union in May, 1940, lots of things have happened since then. After that many young men were taken forcibly from their various vocations and flung into the armed forces and other tasks when the Labour Government introduced conscription, both military and industrial. ""We not only entered into an agreement with the Amalgamated Engineering Union. We also gave, an undertaking to the men in the forces that if they returned they would be given the opportunity in this country to make a decent living. Because we believe that Australia is under an obligation to them we propose that the definitions in this clause should be widened to include more ex-servicemen. I pay tribute to the Minister for Labour and 'National Service for being one of the most .helpful Ministers that we have had handling a bill in this chamber during the Labour regime. He is always courteous and desirous of giving real information instead of handing out abuse. I , therefore, hope that he will give more mature consideration than is usually given to constructive amendments offered from this side.",88
337,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Will the honourable memon ber accept the Minister's decision?,89
338,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I will accept whatmen, ever decision is given by the electorate the 2Sth September. The decision 'then given will be the decision in this matter. The Minister was candid. He said that paragraph a of the definition of "" recoghe.believes nized tradesman"" meant that a tradesgineering man coming to Australia from the United Kingdom could be classed as recognized tradesmen under this legislation. evaded further questions as to the other countries who.Â°e tradesmen coming to tralia could hope to be recognized for the purposes of this legislation, but there was no ne.ed for him to evade the questbe tions. He.was perfectly right when said that a person with the. necessary qualifications coming from the United sufficiently Kingdom to Australia would come within the definition, - and he would have been equally right if he had said that people with similar qualifications coming to Australia from other countries would also come within the definition, because the' authority that will issue certificates of recognition will be the local committees. They will be appointed at the will of the Minister and will be removable at his will. It follows that they will have to accept his directions. Whoever is the Minister will be able to direct that artisans from the United Kingdom or any other country migrating to Australia shall be recognized as tradesmen if their trade is covered by this measure. I would not have it otherwise, because I hope and bebelieve that many skilled men of all kinds will be coming to this country from Great Britain and other European countries that were so badly battered during the war.' I do not wish to go into the matter of immigration at this stage, but I do know that it is necessary that there should be latitude for the admission to trades in this countiy of persons who have learned their trades in the countries of the old world.",89
339,Mr BKYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,They will be absorbed into the unions in the same way as immigrants were in the past.,89
340,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am glad to hear that statement, but honourable members this side of the chamber would be more heartened if they knew for a fact that that would be so. Many ex-servicewho have a higherdegree of preon ference than foreigners, are debarred from entering certain trades or joining certain unions. Doubtless, the Minister is perfectly sincere when he states that that the Amalgamated EnUnion will accept skilled men once they receive their certificates, but He the bill does not contain an assurance that that will be so. An ex-serviceman Ausmay undergo training for a period, and then discover that the books of the union have been closed. Despite the remark of honourable member .for Bourke- (Mr. he Bryson) that it 'might lead to non-unionists seeking employment, we are realistic and practical in this matter to know that no man will be able ' to obtain employment in the engineering trade unless he belongs to the union. A considerable number of ex-servicemen come within the definition mentioned by the honourable member for Fawkner. They were tradesmen or had been partly trained in the engineering trade prior to their enlistment or call-up for military service. Many of them did not join technical unitsin which they could pursue their trade, and, therefore, they will be disqualified under this clause.",89
341,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"As a matter of fact, they do not exist. Mr ANTHONY. - The honourable member - for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) speaks with a much more authoritative voice in this chamber than does the honourable member for Bourke, and he suggested that if the gates were opened, the time might' come when there would be too many tradesmen in the industry. Therefore, he emphasized the necessity to restrict the numbers of men entering it.",90
342,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,A man who worked at the trade before he enlisted would be re-established in it at the point where he left off.,90
343,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Not necessarily. I have a personal knowledge of a few men who were employed in certain branches of engineering. They had not completed their training when they enlisted. They entered, not a technical unit in which they could pursue their trade, but an infantry battalion. If they had entered a technical 'unit in which they could have continued their trade, they would have been qualified to register.",90
344,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,There are no such cases.,90
345,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has compiled a list of these men, giving their names, units, services rendered, and previous experience. Actually, the number of these men is considerable. If it were not, the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley this evening would not have been necessary. But he ejspressed concern at the possibility of too many people being trained in the industry. In my opinion, the Government should accept the amendment. Mr Archie CAMERON. (Barker) [10.35] - We have arrived at the battleground which the Opposition foresaw when the Re-establishment and Employment Bill was being debated last year. On that battleground, we shall test whether a man's right to work in this community shall be determined by his membership of a trade union, or the service which he rendered to his country in war-time. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) is one of the most suave and disarming members of this Government. His answers are those of a man who has learnt the art of not antagonizing the Opposition or his own supporters, because he never gives an answer which provokes another question. This evening, he has not succeeded in dealing with the important matter raised by certain honourable members on this side of the chamber. Despite what the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) may say, men who had no trade at all joined the services and were trained in the Navy, Army or Air Force in certain trades. In addition, certain men known as dilutees were trained to do certain jobs in industry. Those are"" the ones who are now under discussion.",90
346,Mr SHEEHY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That is not what the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) said.,90
347,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I support the honourable member for Richmond, because I know from personal experience when I was Minister for the Navy in 1940, I was not able to prevent certain skilled' tradesmen from leaving Cockatoo Island and Morts Dock in Sydney, where they were urgently required to repair ships, because they desired to enlist in the forces. That could occur only under the voluntary system which was in force at that time. I have never believed in the voluntary system, because I consider that in war-time the government, in order to make the best use of the resources of man-power and materials of the country, must be able to direct where men shall work and materials shall be"" used.",90
348,Mr SHEEHY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,What about finance?,90
349,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I include finance. If we allow skilled tradesmen to join an infantry battalion, it .stands to reason that we must replace them with unskilled tradesmen, who must be trained to do the jobs which have become vacant and to fill other jobs which were created as a result of the exigencies of war. The discussion to-night relates to that classof person. The burden of the Minister's charge is that certain members of the Opposition are attempting to evade the fulfilment of an agreement reached between certain. Ministers in May, 1940, and certain heads of trade unions. At that time, I was the second senior Minister, but I did not know until a long time after I had left the Government that the agreement existed. When the honourable member for Dalley ,(Mr Rosevear) first referred to it, T challenged the accuracy of his remarks. But Labour Ministers knew of the existence of the agreement,, and every provision contained in it. If that agreement bears and must bear the interpretation which they desire to place upon it this evening, I ask why was it not brought forward last year when we debated the Re-establishment and Employment Bill? That is the important point. At that time, the facts should have been made clear. The right to work is a matter of great importance in this community. For some time past, and no doubt it will continue during our lifetime, the right of a uian to work has been determined more and more by his membership of a certain union. The arbitration laws prescribe the rates of pay that shall apply only to members of industrial organizations. No other persons are so protected. Although those matters are outside the scope of this bill, it is important for us sometimes to see the shape of things to come. "" The vehemence with which certain honourable gentlemen opposite, have debated the merits of this case does not dispose of the fact that the honourable member for Fawkner is .doing his best to give effect to the. terms of an agreement. The fault, if any, lies with the Government because it did not disclose when the Re-establishment and Employment Bill was under consideration,.obligations which it had to certain tradesmen.",90
350,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Why did not the honortain able member for Fawkner raise the matter last year?,91
351,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The Go the vernment is' in charge of the legislation introduced in this chamber. Amendments submitted by the Opposition do not receive consideration, and are not accepted. If one of our amendments, other than one of a trivial technical nature were accepted, it. would be an occasion for us to treat the whole chamber to a champagne supper. It just cannot happen. The bills which the Government introduces into this chamber are as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. They have received the imprimatur of the Labour caucus, and cannot be altered. On this occasion, the onus was on Ministers to disclose, when the Re-establishment and Employment Bill was being considered, the existence of certain agreements with the trade unions. Apparently, the honourable member for Fawkner and others believed that those matters were covered. Now, Ministers say that they were not. They place on this agreement a different interpretation from what the Opposition and particularly those members who participated in the negotiations place upon it. Of course, that is not a new experience. In politics, business or private relations, an agreement reached in 1940 under one set of conditions may bear an .entirely different interpretation today. However, the issue will have to be resolved, not in this Parliament, but by our masters.",91
352,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wimmera) [10.44] - Despit e the assurance of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Bryson), this bill will determine whether ex-servicemen shall have preference in employment. I have been impressed by the manner in which the Minister (Mr. Holloway) has answered certain questions, and. his attempts to clarify the purposes of this legislation. I propose to address to him a question, and from his answer, I shall know definitely whether I can support the bill. From people at SwanHill, Mildura, Kerang and other centres in my electorate, I have received letters asking me about opportunities for men to enter certain trades. The purpose of the bill is to permit cerspecified classes of individuals to obtain training in the five industries to which the measure applies. I wish to ask Minister a direct question: Will the fx-sprvirpmen who receive certificates of qualification as tradesmen be given absolute preference over all other persons to enter these particular trades when the industries can absorb more employees and when vacancies exist, and will they be entitled to trade-union membership? That, to my mind, is the crux of the matter.",91
353,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [10.46] - The answer to the question of the honourable member for W i m mera (Mr TurnbuU) in'regard to preference is, "" Yes "" , with the single exception of the recognized tradesmen who were originally affected by. the agreement.",92
354,Mr TUKTSTBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Can the Minister give me a plain "" Yes "" or' "" No "" to the question whether the ex-servicemen will he given, absolute preference in the circumstances that I have outlined? Mr Holloway ; - I have said that riiey-wili have preference, with the single exception that I have mentioned. That exception is necessary because of the terms of an agreement to which some of the honourable gentleman's colleagues were a party, when they were members of a previous government, and to which this Government also is a party. Clause agreed to. Clause 11 agreed to. Clause 12(1.) There shall be a Central (Engineering TrnHes) Committee consisting of(Â« ) n .representative of the Minister, who shall be the Chairman of the Gonimittee; [b] two representatives of employers; and (o) two representatives of employees., (2.) The members of the Committee - shall Inappointed hy the Minister and shall hold - iHii-e during the pleasure of the Minister.",92
355,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Fawkner) [10.48] - Dur - . iug my second-reading speech I stated that at the committee stage I would move a number of amendments to this clause. The purpose of the clause is to constitute a central committee in respect of ,the engineering trades. This committee is to be the pattern of similar committees to be appointed in respect of other trades, affected .by the bill. The committees are to consist of five members, two of whom shall be representative of employers, and two of the employees, whilst the representative . of the Minister shall be the chairman. I desire that one representative of the employees and one representative of the employers shall be a member of the Returned Sailors, - Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. I therefore move That, after sub-clause (1.), the following new sub-clause be inserted:(l.v) One of the representatives specified in paragraph (6), and one of the representatives specified in paragraph (c), of the last preceding sub-section shall be a member of the Returned Sailors. Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia."" I had intended originally to move that the representatives of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia should be additional to those already provided for, but it has been suggested that the committee would be overloaded if two additional members were appointed to it . As my prime purpose is to ensure that two members shall be men who have been on war service, and I can achieve that end by the amendment, that 1I have moved, I do not. propose to proceed with my earlier suggestion. There should be no difficulty 1 whatever in the employees in engineering trades - nominating as one of their two representatives a person with war service, for, literally, tens of thousands of them were in the forces in either a trade or combatant capacity. Likewise, it should not be difficult for the employers to nominate as one of. their two representatives a person who has been on service. I stress the need for direct representation of ex-servicemen on these committees. My reading of the bill before today's debate and my judgement of the views that have been voiced by honourable gentlemen in the course of our discussion for t if y my view that the rights of ex-servicemen should be protected by means of direct representation on the committees. The Minister has said that the proposals in the bill are the result of agreement between the organizations representative of employers and employees. I question whether that is a correct statement because the employers' organizations have brought to my notice certain provisions of the bill to which they are opposed. They object, for example, to the exclusion from the scheme of members of the services, who had no trade experience during their war service, but had experience prior to the war. These men should be entitled to apply for certificates as probationary or trainee tradesmen.",92
356,Mr HOIXOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The central . committee has always dealt with these matters.,93
357,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"In any case the Opposition regards the measure as giving insufficient protection to ex-servicemen and for this reason I press very strongly for direct representation of ex-servicemen on the committees .that are to be appointed. ' Obviously the provisions of the bill must be given a generous interpretation. I said earlier that the period for qualification was too limited.. I believe that if ex-servicemen know that they will have direct representation in both the employer and employee sections they will be much more satisfied than they otherwise will be. We must consider"" this subject in a realistic and humane way. It can hardly be ""denied that ex-servicemen are likely to receive more consideration from former colleagues who know what the applicants who will appear before the committees have been through in their war service. Despite the earlier remarks of the Minister I hope that he will accept my amendment. Mr HARRISON. (Wentworth) [10.55]. - I support the amendment. We have travelled a. good distance from the arguments in the committee at an earlier stage on the rights of trade, unionists. This whole scheme, has been designed, according to the Minister, to protect the interests of ex-servicemen, but there is every reason, in my opinion, for granting direct representation to servicemen on the committees. I remind, the Minister that in New Zealand regional committees have been established to assist in placing ex-servicemen in employment and these committees give every consideration to the men who appear before them. In a sense, the committees that are to be established under the bill will act as regional committees. We should take every possible step to ensure that sympathetic consideration will be given to applicants for certificates as probationary tradesmen. The definition in this connection reads:"" Probationary tradesman "" means an adult member of the forces whose employment as a probationary tradesman in a trade to which this Part applies has been authorized by a local committee. Obviously sympathetic consideration must be given to applicants for certifiJ cates. Representatives of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, who know what servicemen have been called upon to go through in the course of five or six years of war service,, will understand the problems of the situation. In 1944 a committee consisting of .Dr Coombs, Dr Curtin, Professor Mills and a representative of the Apprenticeship Council of Victoria authorized the taking of a census last year to ascertain the wishes of servicemen in regard to post-war occupations! I do not know how many servicemen were invited to .submit answers to the questions, or how many indicated a preference for the engineering trade, or other trades specified in this bill; but it is obvious that many men will apply for certificates from these local committees as probationary tradesmen. It must be manifest to all honourable members from our discussions that no preference whatever is being afforded to ex-servicemen in this measure. The theme of the bill is ""preference to unionists"", and it will be necessary to take the greatest care in administering the measure in order to avoid discord and dislocation in industry. I ask the Minister, when considering the matter, to . bear in mind that committees appointed under other rehabilitation and repatriation legislation have on them representatives of ex-servicemen. The Minister has said that this is a rehabilitation measure. If it will affect-the lives and callings of ex-servicemen, surely they 1 should have representatives on the committees that are appointed under it ! It is pertinent to point out that the committees that will determine the registration of recognized tradesmen and will issue certificates, must have' on them representatives of the unions and the employers. Therefore, another section of workers that is to be affected also should be represented on them. The interjection of the Minister that still other sections are. likely to be. affected> begs the question. I concede his point. Doubtless, he has sought to convey the impression, that those sections, too,, might seek to have right to be represented on the committees. I point out to him,, however, that servicemen are in a special category. Many of them have served their country for five or six years. Therefore, they entitled to consideration additional that given to any other section of the community. I have much pleasure in f o supporting the. amendment.",93
358,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Balaclava) [11.2] Most of the men .who will be dealt by the committees, are ex-servicemen, will be in the categories of probationer and trainee tradesmen. The acknowaffirm that they should. ledged tradesmen were members of the unions prior to 1940, irrespective of whether or not they were skilled, because at one time the unions accepted almost anybody for membership. Therefore, the' committees will have a very duty to discharge, and will .be empowered to determine the future security and hapworth piness of the men concerned. It extremely unfair if ex-servicemen were, not represented on them. . I referred postpone earlier to the high standard of the trainmittee ing that was given in the Royal Ausbill, tralian A i r Force technical training schools. It has been urged constantly that ex-servicemen should be represented occupied on the committees by nominees of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. I should like their representative to be men with will the qualifications of the Director nical Training in the Royal Australian Air Force. He, of course, is not availand able. The advertisements that are pubSome lished daily, inviting enlistment in interim air force, give the whole gamut of musterings in the Royal Australian Ai r Force. I object to the statement the ' Minister that men who passed through the Royal Australian A i r Force technical training schools received only smattering of engineering knowledge, and consequently cannot be described as promise tradesmen - The young men who were trained as air crew under the Empire Air Training Scheme commanded squadservicemen rons overseas, and. took great risks which no unionist who stayed at home had take. That applies also to flight engineers, and to other men in the various, musterings associated with maintenance; they qualified to such high efficiency in some the two years, whereas apprenticeship for trade is for five, years. All of these extradesmen are to be ticketed as probationers and trainees, and although they are of sueh types that they can absorb are knowledgequickly, they are to be placed to secondary to men whoremained on the home front. I am sure that the Minister r A i r (Mr Drakeford), will agree that t the standard of technical training given in the Royal Australian A i r Force technical training schools was very high. The with question that we have to consider is, and whether ex-servicemen should have representatives on the committees. I definitely I do not intend to accept the Minister's promise that the matter will, be investigated. When earlier legislation was being considered, he made a promise that he did not keep! I have made this extract from the debate important that occurred at the timeI inform the honourable member for Went(Mr Harrison) that I am not arguing would be the merits of the amendment.",94

362,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"No; , some Ministers are in the Senate. I shall present this proposal to Cabinet with the same degree of sympathy as the honourable member for Wentworth has shown. He is aware that the bill not he implemented for some time!",94
363,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Then why should we of Techhasten to pass it?,94
364,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I have given my word I ask honourable members to accept it. honourable members have paid t r i the bute to the Minister's technique. I agree that he has a persuasive manner, and the soft, answer which "" turneth away of w r at h "" . I wish that I could emulate him. On the other hand, it is rather an oleagenous for m of appeasement, which a we cannot accept. Unless the statute . contains the provision that we desire, any ^by the Minister will be useless. The amendment referred to in the debate from which I have quoted was that exshould not have the amount of their pension deducted from ''any unemto ployment relief to which--they 'became' entitled. Although the Minister promised a year ago to secure that concession for them, it has not yet been given. The. honourable gentleman knows that the deduction is still made when ex-serviceHonorable men are without employment. Yet men in any other walk of life who receive payments from a friendly society or other source do not have the amount deducted from their unemployment Opposition relief. Therefore, we must make the position secure by having the' provision incorporated in the bill. The Minister can do that very simply. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie ists Cameron) has referred to the speed with which legislation is passed through this chamber. The ministerial caucus stamp is placed on a bill, and we are told that' there is to be no amendment of it. This legislation is important to the welfare-of a large number of men. Approximately .vides 40,000 members of the Royal Australian Air Force were technicians.",94
365,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,A large number of them are members of the engineering unions today.,95
366,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Perhaps they are. But a large number of them will not be admitted to those unions. They are' labelled probationers and trainees.,95

368,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member for Fawkner has moved for the reprecombatant sentation of exT'servicemen on the mittees. To deny that measure of justice is to exhibit bias against the ex-servicethis men. I urge the Minister to place that provision in the bill.,95
369,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Moreton) [11.8] This is one of the most important clauses, of the bill. I support the amendment that was so ably proposed by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), whose proposition is a simple one which should appeal to the Minister (Mr. Holloway) if he really desires to help the ex-servicemen and give them confidthe ence in . this legislation. There are to two representatives of each of the emmen. ployers and employees on the central engineering trades committee- a Comthe monwealth body-and the local engineering ing trades committee-^-a State body. The in it. proposal is that one of those representatives in. each instance shall be the nomineeof the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and: Airmen's Imperial League of Australiamembers opposite do not seem to display towards ex-servicemen that goodwill which might reasonably be exany pected of them. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) has accusedmembers of a-lack of goodwill in respect of trade unionists. Provision for those men is made by the bill, which - deals with two classes-'the trade unionwho, prior to May, 1940, were members of the unions, and those who are now about to come into the industry as ex-servicemen. I ask the Minister to provide that both of those classes of men shall have representation ' on the committees. He has stated that the bill prothat first preference shall be given .to members of the trade union movement, and that the second preference is to be given to those men who, after examination by 'the two committees that are to be constituted, are considered to be eligible to receive certificates entitling them to be regarded as recognized tradesmen. The amendment is mqst reasonable, and I cannot understand why the Minister should hesitate to accept it. If repreof ex-servicemen were on the be committees, they could deal with the problem of men who left the engineering industry to enlist, and were attached to units in which they fought for comtheir country. Such men will not be entitled to receive any consideration under legislation, whereas those men who, in the forces, followed - the trades they had left, will be recognized tradesmen under it. The Minister, has made that statement several times-to-night.",95
370,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Do not be so foolish. 1 Mr Francis - Thes e men devoted five or six years of their lives to the service of their country. The question is, whether trade unionists are to receive all consideration, or whether some conbe sideration shall be given to ex-serviceI f the Minister will accede-to our request, he will facilitate the passage of bill and will take a step towards givto ex-servicemen some confidence",95
371,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"East Sydney-Minister tfor Transport and Minister for External Territories) [11.14] - Oppositio n members complain that the Government refuses to accept amendments to this and - all other measures. What they want is, not the amendment of the bill, but its - entire rejection. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) adduced a most peculiar argument in support of his - contention that we should not persist with this legislation. He said, in effect, that it was quite true that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), as Minister for Labour and National Service in the Menzies Government, had made an agreement with the engineering unions, and had given certain promises to them - He then went on to argue that, because other promises were made, subsequently, on account of changed circumstances, the only promise that one was obliged to keep was the last. That is consistent with the policy of the Liberal party, and T hope that the people will bear it in mind at the forthcoming general elections. The Liberal party believes that it can break ""promises whenever it is convenient and advantageous to do so.' The view of the Government is. that, this agreement having been entered into by an anti-Labour administration with the trade union movement, it should be honoured.",96
372,Mr BEHNAKD COKSEB,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,It was made - during a time of war.,96
373,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I do not admit that that makes any difference. With me, and with the other members of the Labour party, a promise is a promise, and should be kept, whether it is made in war or in peace. The Labour Government, by proceeding with a programme of national works, is providing not only, for ex-servicemen, but also for all others who need work, and are able to do itl Honourable members opposite are attempting to make political capital out of their alleged solicitude for ex-servicemen. Servicemen from this and the last war received greater benefits from Labour governments than from other governments. What would be the advantage to servicemen if this amendment were accepted? Already, there are representatives of servicemen on the various committees, so that there is no need for the amendment. The honourable member for Balaclava would have us believe that he has now become a champion of trade unionism. Evidently even he recognizes that there are advantages in being a member of a . trade union, because he wants to force the unions to accept, certain members irrespective of the opinion of the union. At one time, he was not so considerate of trade unionists, nor did he regard it as an advantage for men to be members of a union. He was not always anxious that trade union conditions should be observed. I understand 1 that he .was associated with a lock-making firm",96
374,The CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,I ask the honourable member to discuss the amendment.,96
375,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,That is what I am doing. I am seeking to show that the amendment has not been put forward for the reasons stated.,96
376,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Is the honourable member in order in making a personal attack upon me under pretence of discussing the - amendment?,96
377,The CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,There is no point of order.,96
378,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I wish to show the inconsistency of honourable members opposite. Whatever they may say now, it was obvious from what they said during the second-reading debate, that they are trying to destroy the measure altogether. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) spoke of the right of people to work, but when did he ever want to give people the right to work?",96
379,The CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member must discuss the amendment, which deals with the constitution of the central committee.",96
380,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"It is the central committee which considers the absorption of men into specified industries. Members of the Opposition say that the amendment will assist in the absorption of men, but I am trying to show that .the amendment, if it is. accepted, will in no way affect the volume of employment offering. Do honourable members opposite press for the inclusion of a clause that employers should be compelled to employ all men offing and able to work? That is the only way in which ex-servicemen and others can be assured of the right to work. As a matter of fact, the.workers in this country have never had that right. The engineering unions are entitled to ask for the full - observance of the promises given to them at a time when this country was in great need of - skilled men. I believe that there will be ample employment for recognized tradesmen, and also for all those who have acquired skill in trades while serving with the forces and in defence industries. I believe that the expanding industry of the nation will be .capable of absorbing them all. Members of the Opposition, by their stone-walling tactics, are trying to hold up this bill, and to destroy it. They are not anxious to assist ex-servicemen, but only to assist their own political cause, which stands in much'need of assistance.",96
381,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Richmond) [11.20]. - The Minister for Transport (Mr. Ward) shows that he is bankrupt of ideas when he has to distort statements made by honourable members in reference' to another clause. He referred to a statement which I allegedly made, but I repudiate his charges against me, and the matter can be determined by reference to Hansard. The honourable member said that I had advocated the repudiation of the agreement with engineering unions because circumstances have changed since 1940. That is false, in that it is a distortion of what I said. If the Minister had followed the debate throughout instead of walking into the chamber and catching the last few words, he would have known that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) in defending the Government's action, had claimed, that not only was the original agreement being honoured, but' also that its scope had been extended to cover certain persons not mentioned in the agreement. Circumstances had altered since 1940, and there was now every justification",97
382,Mr WARD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,On a point of order: What relation have the remarks of the honourable member to the amendment?,97
383,The CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The honourable member is replying to statements made by the Minister.,97
384,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The Minister has distorted what I said, and now is trying to throttle attempts to make the truth known. There has not been the slightest suggestion that the agreement should be departed from, but we advocate that it should, be widened to include certain classes of ex-servicemen. As a matter of fact, it has already been widened in many respects. 1 support the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) that at least two ex-servicemen should be. members of the central committee. This committee' is the' only body to which servicemen can look for assistance. As for their admission to a union;- that is complete'y in the . hands of - the union. The central committee cannot dictate to a union what it shall do after the trainee has completed his course. We have tried to ensure that once a trainee has become qualified he shall be admitted to an appropriate union, but we have been unsuccessful in this. Only by appointing an ex-serviceman to the central committee can the general body of ex-servicemen be assured that their interests will be 1 protected. Several measures, including the Rehabilitation and Employment Act, have been passed by the Parliament, and they profess to give a measure of preference to ex-servicemen and women, but those provisions have not been put into force. The clause provides that there shall be on the central committee a representative of the Government who shall be chairman. Thus, the Labour party for the moment is to have the selection of the person who will have a deciding voice on the committee. I cannot see why the Government should object to one Of the other representatives on the board being an ex-serviceman.",97
385,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The Government has nonobjection.,97
386,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,But it is not stipulated in the bill.,97
387,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"We cannot, interfere with the rights of people to elect their own representatives. Mr ANTHONY.^-More than 750,000 persons enlisted in the services during the war out of a population of a little over' 7,000,000. Therefore, on the law of averages, we ought to get one or two servicemen on the committee. However, servicemen will be at a disadvantage in obtaining nomination because they have not yet had time to establish themselves in their trades, or to come to the front in those organizations from which representatives will be selected. Therefore, during the first few years that this legislation will operate the persons chosen are not likely to include a big proportion of ex-servicemen. Moreover, as the Minister has said that this legislation may not be needed after three years, it would - appear that ex-servicemen will receive little .consideration under it.  The amendment, if agreed to,-would make a farce of the bill. Listening to honora. able members opposite, one would, think that the Australian people are entirely unconscious of the services rendered by the men of the' fighting services in the subject. two wars in which Australia has been engaged since 1914. That is not so. Exhonorable servicemen would prefer to be ordinary citizens, and be appointed to positions because of their competence and experience to fill them, rather than cause they have fought for their country. They wish to take their place with other speech ? citizens on an equal footing. It must remembered that most of them have relaber tives who will look after their interests. The Opposition is endeavouring to make political capital out of the fact that measure does not contain any specific provision for the representation of ex-servicemen, as such, on the' committees to be appointed, but they made no such protest when other measures which may National affect ex-servicemen either directly directly were under consideration; ""Was given to an ex-serviceman to enter a trade there any demand by the Opposition ex-servicemen, as such, should have special representation on the board to control the wheat industry ? No protest was made by the Opposition against the absence from that measure of any specific prorepresents vision relating to ex-servicemen, notwithtitled standing that many thousands of men who were with the fighting services associated with the wheat industry. Honourable members realized that - the wheat-growers themselves could be trusted to look after the interests of the exgiven servicemen among themThe same may ister, be said concerning the board to control the meat industry; there was no outcry the Opposition that returned soldiers were . not given special representadiers tion. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) said that the Government and its supports paid lipservice to the policy of preference to returned soldiers, but I remind him that actions speak louder than words. When the parties now in opposition were in power, enlisted men in the fighting ser : vices were paid 5s. a day, an allowance of 2s. 6d. a day was made for a wife, and a."" lousy "" 9d. a day was allowed for each dependent child. When a Labour government came into office it increased the pay of ""men on service to 6s. 6d. a day with 2s. a day deferred pay, with 4s. 6d. day for a wife and a similar amount for each dependent child. Among honourable members opposite there is too much 1 lip-service, hypocrisy and humbug on this",97

This afternoon I asked the Minister for Labour and Service ' (Mr Holloway) or inwhether absolute preference would be c that for which he had qualified when that trade was able to absorb more men.

The honourable mem referred to other authorities concerning which no protest was made by the Opposition that ex-servicemen were not being"" special consideration. As the Minfor Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) is inviting certain organizations by to nominate representatives to certain boards, surely the Returned Sailors, Soland Airmen's Imperial League of Australia should have a right to make nominations to the proposed conimittees. The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) referred to many promises that have been made; hut he did not tell us about the promises made to the men - who went overseas. Those who remained in Australia in comfortable well-paid jobs, do not understand the reason for preference. The honourable member for Ballarat praised the present Government because it increased the pay of the private soldier by Is. a day. The 'CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member to deal with the clause.",98

392,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"The honourable member for Ballarat also said that ex-servicemen wish to be treated as normal members of the community. I agree, but after six years of war, some of which were probably spent in a prison camp, men require rehabilitation. The Minister for Transport does not understand such things. The Government believes in preference to unionists, but ex-servicemen have stronger claims on the community.

The members of those committeesprofited by their long experience of the.industries in.which they have been' in terested.

It is perfectly true that I did so, and I shall now give the facts of that case. The policy of the firm of which I am managing director has always .been to' give a direct preference to returned soldiers. Sixteen or eighteen men who are in the employ of my firm at present are returned soldiers and there is not one who was eligible to serve who is not also a soldier.'

434,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Fawkner) [12.45 a.m.] I intend to move an amendment to the clause, but, before doing so, I should like to outline the effect that it would have if accepted. The clause contains one of the key provisions of Part VII - Incorpor ated Provisions. It applies to all the different committees that are proposed to be setup. It contains the requirement that an applicant for training must have acquired his trade experience during his service in the forces. I dealt with the matter at some length in my second reading speech, but I wish briefly to repeat my criticism of the clause as it stands. In 'the first place, it automatically excludes the right to participate in the trainee tradesmen scheme all the men whose experience was gained before the war-assumin g that they were neither apprentices nor full fledged tradesmenif, in the course of the war, they were members, of a fighting unit and could not continue in their trades. My second comment is that, far from this bill widening the right's available to members of the forces with some trade-experience, it restricts the right that they previously had, if they had trade experience during the war but not necessarily in the forces, because it makes it obligatory on them to have obtained that experience in the forces. I move - 1 That, in sub-clause (1 . ), paragraph (6 ) , the words ' "" , during the period of the war, acquired, by reason of his service in the forces "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word '-' acquired "". The effect of the amendment would be. that if a member of the forces had trade per- experience, whether or not it was gained as a member of the forces, he would be' eligible for training. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy)' to quoted what was said by the federal president of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, Mr Millhouse. Therefore I bring' to the notice of the committee a copy of a communication sent by him, in his official capacity, to the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), because, in the course of that letter, he gives a few instances of men who will be adversely affected if this bill becomes law in its present form. The first case he cites is that of a man who enlisted on 4th July, 1942, at eighteen years of age. He was discharged on 25th May. 1946. Before enlisting he worked at Messrs. Eglinton and Company, engineers, Kent Town, as a general shop machinist. He was there for one year: Before that he worked for Ward Bagshaw Limited and Simpson and Sons Limited. He made application for training on the 25th May, 1946,' and was told that if he found an employer, he could be trained in the occupation that he had on his enlistment. He could not find an employer, and changed his application to cover the trade of a motor mechanic. He was again told to find an employer, but he could not find one. Then he changed his application to cover fitting and turning, and the Kerry Engineering Company Limited accepted him, but his .application was rejected by the local committee on the 11th July, as he had had no trade experience in the forces. As he enlisted in an infantry battalion, he had no chance of gaining experience. He is receiving a 20 per cent, pension for a war disability. The next case is that of a man who enlisted on the 2nd February, 1942, at eighteen years of age and was discharged on the 14th June, 1946. Before enlistment, he was an electrical improver with Battery and Electrical Service Limited. Before that he was for two years an electrical improver at the Croker Electrical Comthat pany, 39 Franklin-street, Adelaide. He was a driver in a battery for the most of the time he was on service. He was told that he would not be accepted for training owing to the central committee's ruling, which is similar to the proposal the bill. He had two and a half years of experience in the electrical trade, cannot be accepted, except as a labourer, but, under the National Security Regulacommittee, tions, he would have been accepted. The third case that I wish to place before the committee concerns'a. man who enlisted on the 17th December, 1942, the age of eighteen years and was diswithin charged on the 11th June, 1946. This men lad, who is a former employee of the Municipal Tramways Trust, Adelaide, desired to resume duty with the trust. He was employed by the trust as an apprentice fitter and turner on the 5th January, 1942. It is the practice of trust to employ such lads for at - 1 least three months before the indenprovision tures are signed. He, however, notified his intention to join the Royal Auswho tralian Navy, with the result that indentures were not signed ; but the Navy did not call on his services until the December, 1942. Meanwhile, he attended the school of apprentices for three terms, and obtained a pass. The apprenticeships authority, because he has not been indentured, cannot place him in the scheme whereby apprentices are by the Repatriation Department, but it suggests that he might be taken on as trainee fitter and turner by the trust, gaining his certificate in due course and being assisted by the Repatriation Departmentioned. ment. The general manager has approved cept the amendment. his'joining the staff of the trust in those circumstances. His case was placed fore the authorities. This lad, through no fault of his own, was inadvertently unindentured.",103
435,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,He is entitled to apprenticeship under the Re-establishmetal ment and Employment Act.,104
436,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am glad of that, but there are many other similar cases. The cases that I have cited are those of in Adelaide. I daresay they could be multiplied in the other capital cities. They are disqualified because war service interrupted their trade experience. But for service they could have become added tradesmen or qualified as trainee tradesmen under this scheme. It is intolerable that the Government should exclude them because they went on active service .in combatant units. I do not believe that in any government could hold its position in this Parliament, if the people knew but what was being done. Now that the position has been placed before him and the I ask the Minister to accept, the amendment which is reasonable. It does not seek to prejudice recognized at tradesmen, but it does seek to bring the ambit of the trainee tradesscheme men whose trade experience was interrupted by war service, but for which they would have been eligible to come within the scheme. Under the regulations which the Government originally promulgated to deal with this the problem, they would have been admitted. have been informed officially that if this in the bill had operated from the outset, 50 per cent, of the persons have already been accepted as trainee his. tradesmen would have been excluded. 1",104

441,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Wentworth) [12.56 bea.m.] - The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) must know that it was not until the beginning of this year that an award was made whereby a. .lad could be apprenticed to metal-spinning. Therefore, within the trade itself, we have the anomaly that for a number of years improvers, recognized by the - union, have been trained in metal-spinning. All those people men will not be entitled, under the definitions clause to be regarded as "" recognized tradesmen "", .and their, interests must be safeguarded. Their number includes men who are not ex-servicemen.",104
442,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [12.59 a.m.] - The particular class of worker to whom the honourable memthe amendment. ber for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) referred is not included in the engineering, boilermaking, blacksmithing, electrical agreed to. , and sheet metal trades, to which the bill applies. Those men have never worked in a diluted trade. However, that does not mean that they do not have rights under the Re-establishment and Employment Act. The instances cited by the honprable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) as the reason why the amendment should be accepted, have been grossly exaggerated. I agree that some borderline cases will occur.",105

444,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,The men who are accepted for training have had some experience in the. services in these particular trades.,105
445,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,Not necessarily in the - iorvices.,105
446,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"I am sure that the Government has not departed from the pro,per interpretation. Take the case of. a young man, aged eighteen years who prior to serving in the infantry, had been employed for a year in a machine shop, but had not been apprenticed. It is . claimed that he should_ Falstein, S. M . be covered by the provisions of this bill. . The answer to that submission is that the young man could not have become a tradesman in the ordinary course. He would have become an adult process worker. He was not indentured. When he desires to return to the industry, the committee will examine his qualifications. If it decides that he is 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, efficient,, it may send him to finish his training. Otherwise, he will be entitled to re-establishment as a process worker; but he is not entitled to come into the dilution scheme. We have now discussed this matter thoroughly for two or three hours, but I see no reason to alter my original decision.",105

449,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Fawkner) [1.10 a.m.] There is another amendment that I intend to submit. I regret that honourable members opposite should be inconvenienced by my persistence; but the committee has the responsibility of studying the provisions of this measure. If my amendment be accepted, the period of eligibility conferred by the bill will be extended. Some honourable members may jiot have analysed the bill closely. If they do so, they will be as astonished as I was to find that the period of eligibility of those who are to receive the benefits which the Minister has said the bill wll confer, will terminate six months after the date of discharge of the member of the services, or after the 22nd March, 1946, whichever is the later. In other words, the period of eligibility of the great majority of the members who have been discharged from the services has already expired. Only a very small proportion of those who are eligible, according to the limited operation that is given to. their right under this legislation, have as yet applied, or would have known of their right,'to apply in time to make application within the prescribed period.",105
450,Mr LAZZARINI,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If the .honourable member considers that the bill has no merit, why does he want any of its prodate visions to be extended?",106
451,Mr HOLT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Some benefit will be conferred by the bill, even though it be to a very limited group of persons. I am determined to put the Government to the test of showing whether it genuinely desires to give an opportunity to those persons to come under the scheme. If it dees, it will not fix a period of eligibility which, in respect of most of the men, has already expired, but will fix a period that has some relation to the circumstances in which those men are placed. One justification for theperiod 'that I shall propose is that the Government, in connection with the general'' reconstruction training scheme under the Re-establishment and Employment Act, has extended the period of eligibility. If it be sound, and fair to make that provision in respect of. the general reconstruction training scheme, it must be fair also in respect of this scheme. Honourable members opposite who profess to have some regard for the rights 1 can prove their bona - fides on this issue. If they are genuine, they will not support a proposal which would automatically place beyond the allotted [1411 time many of the persons whom the bill purports to benefit. I therefore move That, in sub-clause (4.) the words "" s i x months after the date of discharge of the member of the Forces or after the twenty-second day of March, One thousand nine hundred and forty-six (being the date of commencement of the National Security (Trades Dilution) Regulations (No. 2) "", be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""twelv e months after the date of discharge of the member of the Forces or after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and forty-seven "".",106

In the words of its members, they are anxious that ex-servicemen shall inform, as quickly as possible, the committees which will assess the value of their claims, in order that the exact picture may be discernible.

456,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"If a man has been sick, or if for some other good reason he has failed to apply, the time may be extended. I do not want to accept the amendment because I do not think there is any need for it, but I of ex-servicemen should not like to think that any one will be deprived of an opportunity to receive training simply because, by mischance or oversight, he has failed to apply in time. I shall confer with my colleagues to see whether the time prescribed ought to be extended before the bill goes to the Senate.",106

It was stated earlier that the purpose of the lull was to restore pre-war conditions, and it is my understanding that employers previously had the right to dismiss an employee on the ground of inefficiency.

465,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne. P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Ser[1.22] - In the first place, this is not a dilutee's scheme, it is something different.

467,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Warringah) [1.23 a.m.] - I dealt with this matter in my second-reading speech. In substance, the clause withdraws from the provisions of the the Re-establishment and Employment Act all those employed in the various trades set out in the schedule to this bill. The clause provides. (1.) A person shall not be entitled to make application to a court of summary jurisdiction under section twenty-eight of the and Employment Act 1045 respect of a failure to engage .him in employment in a trade to which this Part applies unless the matter has first been considered by a Local Committee.. (2.) In any prosecution ""of an employer for a contravention of section forty-three of this Act, and in any proceedings against an employer under section twenty-eight of the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1045, it shall be a for the employer to prove that the act or omission with which he is charged or which is called in question was directed, approved or consented to by a Local Committee duly or, on review or appeal, by the Central Committee or a court, and that the decision of the Local Committee or Central Committee, as the case may be, does not stand reversed as the result of review or appeal. The result is to' exclude the persons specified from the operation of'section 27 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act which provides that an employer shall,'in the engagement of any person, engage one.entitled to preference, unless he has' reasonable grounds for not doing so. Section 28 provides that a person whom an employer has refused to engage may make application to a court of summary jurisdiction, - which, may order that he he given preference. Clause 45 of the bill says that the persons previously entitled to preference under the Re-establishment and Employment Act shall no longer enjoy that - right unless they go before a local committee. Such a committee is not bound to observe the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, and if the committee says that the applicant is not entitled to the rights he claims, that is the end of the matter. Thus, the result is a foregone conclusion. This clause contains a fundamental principle. We solemnly passed the Re-establishment and Employment Act to give preference to ex-servicemen in all employment. By this clause we are taking their rights from them.",107
468,Mr HOLLOWAY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL BILL,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [1.26 a.m.] - I shall not dispute legal matters with the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), but my advice is that the purpose of this clause is to avoid an ex-serviceman wasting his . money, and giving himself unnecessary trouble, hy going to a court without first endeavouring to have his grievance settled by a local committee. The clause does not prevent him from having his case heard by a court eventually. We want' to make it easy for an ex-soldier to get his grievance rectified, and we think that in most cases that can be done best by having him approach the local committee in the first instance.",108

473,Mr HUTCHINSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"Deakin) [1.36 a.m.] - I regret that I have to discuss this bill at this unreasonable hour, hut I suppose the "" show "" must go on. This is a small bill, the provisions of which are printed on one sheet of paper, but like many other small things it is of considerable importance. The bill provides for the application of certain moneys which had accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool purchase agreement with the United Kingdom Government. The total has been estimated by the Government to be Â£7,000,000, but from advices I have received, it appears-that it is more likely to be Â£8,000,000. The bill proposes to dispose of moneys which rightly belong to the wool-growers of Australia, but of which the Government has now' taken control. The moneys are now to be placed to a trust fund which no doubt will be used on some future occasion to bolster subscriptions to a government loan so that once again the proud announcement may be made that a loan has been over subscribed. The Central Wool Committee has now been replaced by the Australian Wool Realization Commission. The bill has no. relation to the wool purchase agreement by which the United Kingdom Government agreed to purchase the great bulk of the Australian wool clip for the period of the war and one year thereafter. However, I propose to refer briefly to that agreement because of certain provisions in it which are relevant to the discussion of the measure now before us. Although the price fixed under that agreement represented a considerable advance: on the pre-war price it was nevertheless a little below the payable price as. determined by a committee which investigated the industry in the 1930's. The principal credit for the conclusion of the agreement with the United Kingdom belongs to the Prime Minister of the day, now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), who made personal representations to the Prime Minister of Great Britain with a view to obtaining a price winch would put the industry on a payable basis. Later the price was increased to 15Â£d. per lb.",109
474,Mr CALWELL,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,B y this Government.,109
475,Mr HUTCHINSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"Tba t is so. This Government took advantage of the provision in the agreement that the price should be reviewed' from time to time in the light of increased costs of production. Costs in all industries have risen since the present Government took office, and they are still rising. The price of 15^d. per lb., however,, was only the average price received for Australian wool sold to the British Government under an almost identical agreement during World War I . That the Australian wool industry has been able to continue on a basis of 30 years ago, speaks volumes for the enterprise and initiative of the Australian wool-growers. Provision was also made in the agreement whereby Australia would share in any profits derived from the sale of wool to foreign countries. I direct attention to that because it was one of the factors that made the agreement acceptable to the Australian wool-growers who recollected what happened after World War I . They had every reason to expect that on the termination of World War II . they would receive a substantial dividend from the sale of wool to foreign countries. That dividend, however, was not earned during the war largely because of the collapse of France, the overrunning of. Europe by Germany and, later, the entry of Japan into the war. These events prevented the marketing of Australian wool abroad, with the result that we accumulated a huge stock pile, which we are now in the process of liquidating. Part and parcel of the agreement relevant to the price of wool was this undertaking given in the first instance by the Minister for Commerce in the Menzies Government find renewed by the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, that Australia would, receive a sbare of the profits of all wool sold rc foreign countries.  Mr HUTCHINSON"" - Tba t is so. The wool-grower looked forward to a profitable Teturn from such sales to compensate bim for what he had put into the wool pool during the war. At the conelusion of hostilities there was a profit of Â£20,000,000 of which the Australian share was Â£10,000,000; but the Australian share was invested in the purchase of portion of the huge stock pile of wool not sold when the war ended, which is estimated to be worth Â£100,000,000, and so became merged in the new scheme. The wool growers, therefore, will not receive a penny from the sale of wool to foreign countries, at least until the present scheme ends. The sum of Â£8,000,000 came into the hands of the Central Wool Committee ' mainly in three ways; first, by a difference in - skin values between the "" table of limits"" average and the flat rate adjustment price. The flat rate adjustment was really the average price at which the United Kingdom bought the season's clip, namely, approximately 15Â£d. per ID. Running below and above that average was the "" table of limits"", which defined prices for different qualities of wool, and was designed to bring up sales, of a - season's clip as near as possible to the Hat rate price. The ""table of limits"", was framed on a conservative basis; and its average never approached the flat rate price. Consequently, there was a gap between the "" table of limits "" average and the flat rate price, which' was bridged by supplementary payments to growers. Those payments .which are made in July ranged from 16 per cent, to 13 per cent, per lb. This year, the flat rate adjustment represented an increase of the wool cheque .of 13 per cent., on last year's cheque. If this. Â£8,000,000 were distributed to the growers they would receive a little more than the flat rate adjustment they have received this year. Now I come to the sum of Â£2,400,000, which comes into the hands of the Central Wool Committee from the sale of skin wools. How does that money come into the committee's hands? The flat rate adjustment and "" table of limits "" average call' for examination under this item because not flat rate adjustment was to be paid on skin wools. Consequently, the fellmonger. knows that when he boughtskins all he could expect was the value of that wool according to the "" table of limits "". The Treasurer made this clear in his second-reading speech when he saidWhen the wool purchase arrangement wa>' commenced in 1939 it was announced by the then Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that wool derived from skeepskins would not participate in any adjustment over and above the appraised price, which was to he the final and only price paid for such wool. The fellmonger knew that the only value be would receive for the wool on skins was according to the ""table of limits""; but this arrangement had the significant .effect that the woolmon'ger, being paid only on the "" table of limits "", valued the wool on that basis. The fellmonger necessarily offered a lower price than if there had been a flat rate adjustment.",109
476,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"I remind the honourable member that the bill deals with the distribution of the moneys to which he refers, and not with their origin.",110
477,Mr HUTCHINSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"As the Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, dealt with the origin of these moneys, I submit that I am in order in dealing with the same matter.",110
478,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"The Treasurer may have referred incidentally to those matters; hut the bill deals with the disposition of certain sums of money. The honourable member is entitled to make passing reference to the origin of those moneys; but the essence of the bill is the disposition of them, that is, the application of the fund as provided by clause 6.",110
479,Mr SPENDER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"I rise to order. Although clause 6 deals with the application, of the fund, is it not important, for the purpose of determining whether the bill should be passed, and in order to determine, in particular, the application of the moneys standing to the credit of the fund, to know how those moneys came into being, and in whose interests, accordingly, they should be disbursed? Assuming that a large pro- portion of the moneys, in equity, belonged Wool-Industry [REPRESENTATIVES.] to the wool-growers, is it not permissible for an honourable member, in discussing the application of the fund, to show why he believes it should not be applied as proposed in clause 6, but in another way?",110
480,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,I have already indicated that the bill deals with the investment and application of the fund. We must assume that the fund has been created; and the bill deals with its application. I have already said that the honourable member may refer in passing to. the origin of the fund. I point out that the honourable member has already exhausted nearly half his time in dealing with the origin of the fund.,111
481,Mr HUTCHINSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"The Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, gave the amounts involved in this bill as follows:Skin-wools .. 2,400.000. Wool tops, noils and waste exported from 'Australia pursuant to the National Security (Wool - tops) Regulations 2.700,000 Deferred price on wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia, pursuant to the National. Security (Price of wool for manufacture for - export) Regulations 1,550,000 These are provisional figures, and other transactions will probably bring the net accumulation to over Â£7,000,000. This money has all come from the wool growers of Australia.",111
482,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,That is not a fact.,111
483,Mr HUTCHINSON,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"It has certainly come from the flock-owners. Was the Central Wool Committee acting as a trading agent for the Government or as a realizing body for the wool-growers? If"" the Government was trading in wool which was not subject to the agreement with the United Kingdom Government,' it is entitled to keep the money, but the wool-growers desire admittance of that fact. If the Government was not trading in wool, the Central Wool Committee was a realizing body. The Menzies - and Fadden Governments did not set up. a trading agency in wool, but the Central WoolCommittee was' utilized as a realizing body. The Government will not hand this money over to the growers; but it accepts the principle that the money does not belongto it. It states that it was ! Fund Bill 1946. not trading in wool, but it will not take the money into Consolidated Revenue. It proposes to place it in a fund and use it in the way it thinks best. The Government claims to be better able than the wool-growers to determine what should be done with it. Stock-owners suffering from the effects of drought, who require money to restock their holdings, will take a poor view of the Government's claim that it knows better than they do what should be done with their money. The Government will use portion of this money for wool research purposes, and is supplementing the existing provision of Â£300,000 a year. I doubt whether the money available could be wisely expended, because there is a worldÂ£ wide shortage of technicians for research regarding the problems of the wool industry. The proposed expenditure on research will be supplementary to that being incurred by private manufacturers. What is meant by the granting of temporary relief to the industry? If wool prices fell some relief could be given, according to the Treasurer, in respect of the contributory charge under the wool disposals plan. Most of the growers admit that that charge is .abnormally high. The Australian Wool Realization Commission has a habit of granting to its staff much larger salaries than those paid in the past. This new body seems to be indulging in a good deal of extravagance. The Wool Industry Fund is being built up so that the contributory charge may be reduced when the price of wool falls. Provision is therefore being made for that contingency. In his second-reading speech the Treasurer remarkedThe bill .also contains a provision that some part of the moneys referred to may be applied in meeting wholly or partly any ultimate loss the Commonwealth may incur undei the wool disposals plan. When the wool agreement with Great Britain was under. consideration in this chamber I dealt with the matter onbehalf of the Opposition, but I heard no suggestion that the wool-growers should bear any lo.?s that might occur as a result of the ramifications of the scheme. At that time. I thought the Government was at least acting courteously in carrying out the agreement, but nothing was said about any money to which the growers could lay claim being used to offset any loss arising from the wool disposals plan. From whatever aspect we may view the matter, the money has come from the wool-growers. The fellmongers have no claim to it at all. They bid only at a low price for skins on the sheep's backs. The tops and noils were exported and the money. went into the fund. If any one has the right to it, it is the wool-growers, because the top makers get their due profit in the combing. In fact, they were assured of it before they started combing. So they are satisfied. The only people who will lose are the wool-growers. The money should be repaid to them. If the Government does not pay it to them, the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, if returned at the general elections, will ensure they shall get it, because it is their due.",111
484,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"New England) [2.6] 1 support the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) about the distribution of the accumulated fund of between Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000 in the hands of the Central Wool Committee in respect of activities outside the provisions of the Wool Purchase Agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom. I also direct attention to the amount of Â£700,000, stolen from the wool-growers of Australia, which is in addition to the fund with which this bill is concerned. That money was stolen from, them because of the failure of the Commonwealth Government to get from the Australian woollen manufacturers the money due from them on the sale of wool to Australian manufacturers. In opening his second-reading speech the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Chifley) saidThe purpose of the hill is to provide for the application of certain moneys which had accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool purchase agreement with the United Kingdom Government. A strong body of opinion exists, among the wool-growers themselves and their organizations, the Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wo.ol Producers Federation, that the growers are entitled to the profits on the sales which the Prime Minister claims were made outside the agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom. However, that seems doubtfuland, consequently that money should be distributed in accordance with the arrangement proposed for the distribution of the profits from the sale to the"" UnitedKingdom of raw wool that was subsequently sold outside the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom surrenders its share of the profits, those profits should go to the Australian wool-growers. We believe that they are the property of the wool growers and are held in trust for them by the Commonwealth 'Government. Under the agreement between the United Kingdom .and the Commonwealth Government, which'was made in 1939 and to which the right honourable gentleman drew particular attention in his second reading speech, the United Kingdom acquired the Australian wool clips for the duration of the war and twelve months afterwards and 50 per cent, of the' profits on the sale of wool outside the United Kingdom was to he. paid to the Commonwealth Government to be held in trust for the Australian wool growers. The trusteeship was proved by the undertaking given on the 17th December, 1942, by the then Prime. Minister, the late Mr Curtin, that the profits would be distributed to the growers. That promise has been renewed. It was also provided under the agreement that Australian woollen manufacturers should have the right to select, after appraisement, certain wools to meet their own requirements. They got those wools on the basis of a certajn percentage loading to bring the price paid up to the flat rate paid by the Government of the United Kingdom. The Wool Purchase (War-time) Agreement, which really consisted of a series of letters and cables exchanged between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United Kingdom, but it has been summarized by the Commonwealth Government in the document that the Prime Minister promised the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzijss) to produce. It . provided that Australian manufacturers should, pay jfpr their wool a loading on the appraised price of I i per cent, in 1940-41; 15 per cent, in 1941-42; and 10 per cent, in 1942-43. In 1943-44 and 1944-45, the price paid by the Australian manufacturers was fixed by .the Prices Commissioner"". Under that arrangement, the prices paid by the Australian manufacturersto the Centra] Wool Committee should have been equal to the flat rate paid by the United Kingdom to the Commonwealth Government and passed on to the Australian wool-growers. For years there has been a deficiency of Â£700,000 in the account in respect of the prices paid by the Australian manufacturers, but no mention in. the bill or the second reading speech of the Prime Minister is made of its distribution along with the amount of between , Â£7,000,000 and Â£S,000,000 referred to in this legislation. That money is due to the Australian wool growers. One would have thought that, whatever the Government's views' might be about the accumulated fund of between Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000, sheer honesty would have compelled it to ensure the payment to them of the Â£700,000 that should have been paid to them, apart altogether from the other money, in respect of sales made to the Australian manufacturers. , Mr LBMMON - Shoul d that money not . be placed in the same fund as that in which the money that is the subject of this bill has been placed?",112
485,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"No , because it was due from the Australian manufacturers to the Australian wool-groAvers, but it has never been paid to them.",113
486,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,The Australian wool growers collected their money in full.,113
487,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,They did not.,113
488,Mr DBDMAN,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,They did.,113
489,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,The records of the Central Wool Committee prove the contrary.,113
490,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,There was an adjustment between the Central Wool Committee and the Prices Commissioner.,113
491,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"Yes . Mr SCULLY' - But the wool-growers were paid in full. . Mr ABBOTT - The Prices Commissioner fixed the price of wool sold to the Australian manufacturers and the wool growers, are still owed Â£700,000.",113
492,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,They were paid in full.,113
493,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"They were not. I was a member of the Central Wool Committee. After I left the price paid by'the Australian manufacturers was the appraised price plus a loading to bring the price up to the flat rate paid by the United Kingdom. An amount of Â£700,000 is outstanding as the Minister will realise if he examines the reports of the Central Wool Committee. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) and his accomplice, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), can shriek and make whatever statements they like, but they will not convince me or the wool-growers that Â£700,000 has not been filched from them.",113
494,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,It has not been.,113
495,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"I know that, compared with the colossal amounts that have been filched from other primary industries, an amount of Â£700,000, in the eyes of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, is a bagatelle, but it represents a lot of money to the wool-growers.",113
496,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,Order ! I ask the honourable member for New England to deal with the disposal of the fund referred to in this bill. ',113
497,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"Yes , I am coming to that. I am following the lines followed by the Prime Minister, who, on page 2868 of Hansard, is reported as having saidThe Central Wool Committee, in addition to handling the woo) purchase arrangement for the 'United Kingdom Government, has carried out other activities which have resulted in certain moneys being collected on behalf of the. Commonwealth Government. These moneys have mainly arisen from the following sources:Â£ Skin-wools 2,400,000 Wool tops, noils and waste exported from Australia pursuant to the National Security (Wool-tops) Regulations .. .. 2,700,000 Deferred price on wool content of manufactured - goods exported from Australia pursuant to the National Security (.Price of wool for manufacture for export) Regulations .. 1.550.000 These are provisional figures, and other transactions will probably bring the net acciumilatibn to over Â£7,000,000. Only one payment was to be made to fellmongers for skin wools. I recollect that when I was a member of the Central Wool Committee in 1939 the regulations governing skin wools were so drawn as to prevent the possibility of a repetition of what happened between 1916 and 1920, when, the skin wool funds were the subject of litigation that lasted for years. I quote from the ""Memorandum re profits earned by the Central Wool Committee 1916-1920 "". It stateslie PROFIT ON SHEEPSKINS ACCOUNT. The report states that- "" there are no profit-sharing conditions in regard to sheepskins acquired on account of the Imperial Government, but the Central Wool Committee Administration Account for sheepskins, for the various seasons shows the following credit balances through savings effected .in the. appraisement, handling storage and other charges from packers' warehouses to f.o.b. Australian ports:Season 101G-17 . . 23.365 15 2 Season 1017-18 .. 39,973 7 6 Season 1918-19 68,023 2 0 Season 1919-20 (estimated) 91,000 0 0 After completion of audit for the season ID19-20 the total profits will be transferred to the wool pool for distribution to wool growers."" That excellent precedent should have been followed in this instance. Unfortunately, it was not. The wool-growers will receive no additional payment for skin-wools. When the purchasers bought the sheep, they allowed for the skins only the appraised value. If , later, an additional payment had been made for the skins and if the fellmongers had known that they would receive the extra payment, they would have allowed for a higher skin value in the price that they paid"" for the sheep.",113
498,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,Order ! I ask the honourable member to deal with the disposition of the fund .,114
499,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,I am referring to the speech of the Prime Minister.,114
500,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,The honourable member may not take advantage of that. T have read the references in the Prime Minister's speech to how the-money was raised and whence it .came. That does not entitle the honourable member to t debate whether the money should have come .from that' source. The bill deals with the handing over of the f u n d to the Treasurer and the means by which he may apply it . The honourable member may not explore whether the fund should be created ,114
501,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"The Prime Minister said that these funds had accumulated during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool purchase agreement with the United K in g : dom Government. Having dealt with skin-wools, I shall now refer to wool tops, noils and waste exported from Australia, the proceeds from which amounted to Â£2,700,000. The Prime Minister saidAlthough this involved exports, the United Kingdom Government intimated that any moneys derived from these operations were for the account of the Commonwealth GovernÂ£ s - d. ment. Later, referring to the deferred price on wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia, the proceeds from , 222,362 4 8 which amounted to Â£1,550,000, the Prime Minister was very careful to repeat the same phraseAlthough this transaction related to exports, the United Kingdom Government stated that "" it was agreeable to the whole of this deferred payment being retained by the Commonwealth Government. Those statements prove conclusively that these sums of money in payment for. our wools were not outside the arranger ment made with the United Kingdom Government for the purchase of Australian wool clips. If they had been outside the arrangement, the Prime Minister would not have drawn specific attention itÂ© the fact that the Commonwealth Governr ment had consulted with the British Government, which was willin g to forgo its 50 per cent, of, the profits from the sales of those wools outside the United Kingdom. Those funds should have been disbursed in accordance with the undertaking given by the late Prime Minister,. Mr Curtin, on the 17th September, 1942, when he stated that the 50 per cent, of the funds due to the Commonwealth from the sale of wool clips to the United K in g dom would be disbursed to wool growers. The particular funds to .which I have referred were obtained under that scheme, and should be paid to the selves growers. . The producer representatives on Central Wool Committee in 1939-40 did not doubt that these profits would included in the total scheme. The late Mr A. F. Bell, the first chairman the committee, assured us wool-growers that the whole of those profits would become distributable under the scheme the wool-growers of Australia. At presecond-reading sent, when a disastrous drought is causa ing devastation in the greatest woolopportunity growing areas of Australia, I cannot understand the Government attempting io withhold from the wool-growers this large sum of money. If it were distive bursed, the large wool-growers would not derive substantial benefit - from it because the Government would recover most of from them in taxation. But the small wool-grower, who is desperately fighting the drought, would benefit from the paywith ment. A'few days ago, I was informed of a man in the electorate of Gwydir who expended 18s. a head for feed for 1,500 ewes, but all of them died. The magnitude of the disaster which is now been appointed. overwhelming the wool-growing areas of Australia is almost incalculable. The Government should distribute these fits as the growers believed they would he disbursed and in accordance with the strict letter of the agreement with the Government of the United Kingvoice dom. The Prime Minister, in his speech, revealed that these moneys were derived under the arrangement for the wool clips to Great Britain. No difficulties would arise in distributing this amount through the broker organizations whichhave handled the whole of these appraised clips during the war. A pertion centage could, he given to the woolshould growers on the basis of the total proceeds for their wool received during the operahonorable tion of the scheme. The bill provides thatThe moneys standing to the credit of Fund may be applied in any manner approved by the. Treasurer, after consultation wit Ministers, for purposes associated with wool industry and, without limitin g the generality of the foregoing, may be applied for any of the following purposes:;>JU. J -' ... Mr Abbott. I consider that the wool-growers themshould have been consulted regarding the expenditure of the funds. However estimable Ministers may be, they the are largely "" birds of passage"" who change from year to year, and doÂ»not be know as intimately as the growers how the interests of the industry generally of may best be served. The bill does not provide for the representatives of the wool-growers to advise Ministers on this to matter. The Prime Minister, in his speech, said, in response to request, that wool-growers will have an to make representations to Ministers through the Wool Consultative Council. I point out that the wool-growing organizations have not a representaon the Wool Consultative Council.",114
502,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"They have four reprei t sentatives, two of whom are members of the board on which the honourable member sits; and recently, during consultations the council of the Graziers Association, the agreement was reached that another two members '.should be appointed some to the Wool Consultative Council.",115
503,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,But they have not yet,115
504,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"There are on the Wool Consultative Council two members of the proAustralian Wool Board, of which the honourable gentleman is a member.",115
505,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,That board has no in the disbursement of this money.,115
506,Mr SCULLY,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,Of course it has. The board has acted as an adviser to the sale of Government in this matter.,115
507,Mr ABBOTT,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"On e of the functions of the Australian Wool Board is the promotion of the use of wool throughout the world. In this hill, the consider a. is what the wool-growers believe be done with the surplus proceeds from the sales of their wool. The member for Deakin has pointed out that it will be impossible to use this vast amount in scientific, economic and cost research in connection with the prothe duction and use of wool. The Government has undertaken to provide Â£300,000 h the a year for those purposes. The enabling the act has been in operation for more than twelve months, and I should imagine-that a very small proportion of the funds provided has been expended. There""is""'no point in accumulating those funds for purp.oses to which they cannot he devoted. The Government is ,not in a position to proceed with an extensive building programme for research inconnexion with wool. It may be able to do so if it causes more of our citizens to live in caves and gunyahs, and out in the Open. The bottleneck in connection with "" the provision of all things' necessary for, or incidental to, the carrying out of such research"" is that research scientists are not available today, and some years must elapse before there will be sufficient numbers. Nor can equipment or buildings ""be procured. Therefore, what is the use of providing Â£300,000 yearly, which, within tthree or four years, will aggregate more than Â£1,000,000, and ""taking"" Â£7,000,000 of the accumulated profits of the wool-growers, which they urgently need? The bill also provides for ""regulating or assisting the marketing, or stabilizing the price, of wool by the purchase of wool, or by other means "". When the Wool Realization Act was passed in 1945, those were functions of that legislation, and there was no provision that extra money would he taken from the wool-growers for such purposes. The Government gave that assurance at the time. Tbat scheme was complete in itself. The amount of the carry-over wools was written down by Â£20,000,000, of which Â£10,000,000 was to be borne by the Australian Government and the .balance by the United Kingdom Government. Any profits were to be distributed among the wool-growers, and any losses were to be borne by the Governments of the Commonwealth - and the United Kingdom. Yet it is how proposed that Â£7,000,000 belonging to the wool-growers shall be placed in a'fund to dp what the act of 1945 was intended by this Parliament to accomplish. Other purposes to which this money is to be applied areThe provision of temporary relief for the wool industry in such circumstances and under such conditions as the Treasurer, after consultation with the Ministers, thinks just; and in meeting, in whole or in part, any ultimate loss to which the Commonwealth may be subjected by reason of its participation in the disposals plan set forth in the schedule to the Wool Realization Act 1945. That act prescribes that any losses shall be borne by the Commonwealth Government, not by the Australian wool-growers*Therefore, the Government is acting most dishonestly in taking this money from the"" wool-growers, particularly as they need it so desperately to repair the damage caused by the drought that has afflicted Australia. Mr RYA2T (Flinders) [2.32 a.m.f!- The purpose of the bill is to make a certain disposition of funds which today, according to the Government, are in the possession of the Australian Wool Realization Commission. The amount in question, in the view of the wool-growers and members of the Opposition, is large - betwee n Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000. It represents the surplus on the sales effected under the war-time wool purchase scheme. At the beginning of the war, the wool-growers were informed that one-half of any profits from the sales of wool exported to foreign countries would be paid to them when the operations were completed. They also believed that moneys accruing from any other source would be equally, their property. These funds have accrued in this way: Â£2,400,000 from the sales of skins; Â£2,700,000 from the sales of tops; and Â£1,550,000, representing deferred prices in respect of certain exports. There can be no doubt that the Government has a moral responsibility towards the wool growers in respect of this money. I am sure that it must admit that responsibility, because in all these wool transactions it has acted not as a principal, but as the agent of the growers. Therefore, any surpluses that have accrued to it by reason of the operations that were carried out during the war and up to the present time should be handed to the real .owners, namely, the wool-growers Who produced the wool. I am unable to understand the argument advanced by the Prime Minister in his second-reading speech, and by other speakers, that the Government should with-hold this money from the growers and devote it to a number of purposes. The wool growers, who believe that they are entitled to this money, are anxious' as1 to how the Government proposes to 'd'ispose of it. They fear that it will be disposed of unfairly. A large proportion of Australian wool is produced by small growers, who have suffered - much, as the result of events arising out of the war. .Some of them have been engaged in mixed farming, either with the help of their families only, or with the help of hired, men. In any case, they suffered severely as the result of the call-up of men for military service. They also suffered because of the increase of the cost production. Everything connected with primary production has increased in cost far above the official index figure.' There has been a shortage of superphosphate, resulting in reduced production and increased costs. In recent years, there have been severe droughts, which have further reduced the profits of wool-growers. Therefore, it is only just that the - Government should do everything jpossible to increase the price of wool, instead of taking from the growers money which is their due, and using it for its own purposes. The' ,i mount involved is between Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000, and it is proposed that it should be devoted to research into the production and use of wool, the provision of those thingsnecessary for research, and the promotion by publicity and other means of the use of wool throughout the world. It is also proposed to spend some of the money on the regulation of markets and the stabilization of prices. It is impossible for the Government to make use of any large proportion of the money for the purposes set out. Already, large amounts are standing to the credit of organizations engaged, in promoting research into the production and use of wool. Therefore, it is not necessary that the Government should use the money under discussion. It belongs to the wool growers, from whom it came and to whom, it should be returned. I add my protest to those of the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) and the honourable, ftiemiber for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson). The bill sbould be withdrawn and the riioiiey returned ""to the growers. ; Mr SCULLY - (Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [2.40 a.m.]. ^-Reference was made by the honourable utsmbef for. Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) and the honourable member for New Engloss land (Mr Abbott) to the division of profits under the wool realization scheme. With the concurrence and authority of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), I propose to make a statement on the subject. The war-time wool, purchase arrangement, under which the. United Kingdom Government acquired ' Australian wool clips during the seasons 1939 to 1945, provided that should the sale by of the United Kingdom of acquired raw wool for use outside the United Kingdom produce a profit over the whole period of the arrangement, such profit would be divided equally between the two Governments. It was an essential feature of the arrangement that profits, if any, could only be determined at the winding up of the whole scheme. In 1942, the then Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, in answer to a question in Parliament, gave an undertaking that the Commonwealth share of any such profits would be distributed to wool-growers in proportion to their contribution of wool 'to the scheme during its operation. The war-time arrangement was merged into the wool disposals plan, which is set out. in the schedule to the Wool Realization Act. of 1945, and which forms the pattern for an orderly marketing of the huge wool stock-pile concurrently with current clips. The disposals plan, in turn, provides that, should a profit or a loss ultimately arise from the operations of the Joint Organization in Australian wool, it will be shared or borne equally between the Commonwealth and United Kingdom Governments - I now desire to make it quite clear that the Government, intends that any ultimate profit which might accrue to the Commonwealth under the .'disposals plan shall be distributed to those growers who supplied wool for appraisement under the war-time arrangement, in'the proportion that the appraised value of their wool bore to the total appraised value of all wool over the operation of the war-time scheme. In this manner, the Government considers that the undertaking given in 1942 will be honoured and the equity of each wool grower who supplied wool under the wartime arrangement will be safeguarded. However, the possibility of an ultimateunder the disposals plan must be faced, and in the event of such a result there will, of course, be iio distribution to growers. I sbould explain that the credit balance of approximately Â£20,000,000 which had accrued in the divisible profits account at the date of the merging of the war-time arrangement into the.disposals plan .must not be regarded as an indication that ultimate _ profits would have resulted from the sale by the United Kingdom of all acquired w.ool.' The wool sold for use outside the United Kingdom was of much higher quality than that which remained unsold, and heavy losses were inevitable on the remaining stocks. The stock-pile remaining to be disposed of cost approximately Â£100,000,000. The credit balance of Â£20,000,000 in the hands of the United Kingdom Government was utilized to write down the cost of this stock' to approximately Â£80,000,000, and the Australian Government, under the wool disposals plan, has purchased half of this stock for Â£40,000,000. This writing down has the same practical effect on the ultimate profit or loss as though the wartime arrangement had been continued until the whole stock-pile had been disposed of. The stock-pile must be disposed of by the Joint Organization in conjunction with any portion of new clips that it may be necessary for the organization to "" buy-in"" in order to protect prices. It will be the net result of the ultimate Hales of wools in both these categories that will be shared between the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Governments, whether it be a profit or a loss. Therefore, any distribution to growers would only be made from ultimate net profits arising out of the disposals plan, and in the assessment of any such profit a set-off must be made of any losses that may result from the resale of stocks taken in by the Australian ""Wool Eealization Commission operating under the plan. In all the circumstances, the Government believes that the late Prime Minister's promise of 1942 will be given effect in a reasonable _ and practical manner by the scheme just outlined, whereby any net profit that may accrue to the Government at the end of the disposals plan will be distributed pro rata to those growers who supplied wool under the war-time arrangement from 1939 to 1945.",115
508,Mr FADDEN,WOOL INDUSTRY FUND,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [2.45 a.m.].^- I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that if Mr Speaker had been in the Chair he, being conversant with the trend'of the debate, and remembering the attitude that he adopted towards the honourable member for Deakin , (Mr. Hutchinson), would not have permitted the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to read a sentence of the statement that he has just presented to the House. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the bill now before us. The measure is one to provide for the appli- cation of certain funds. In order to understand the Government's attitude towards the disposal of this money it is necessaiy to have some knowledge of the factors which brought about the accumulation of moneys in the fund. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) said that the purpose of the bill is to provide for the application of certain moneys which had accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee during the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the wool purchase arrangement with the United Kingdom Government. He said that the subject was dealt with at some length in a statement in this House by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) on the 11th April last. The Minister, after explaining how the moneys had accumulated, announced that the Government had decided they would not be taken, into Consolidated , Revenue and would not be distributed to individual growers, felfmongers, top ' makers and manufacturers concerned. They would, however, be used for thebenefit of the wool industry, particularly for research and promotion of the use of wool. It is necessary to know something of the source of the Â£7,000,000 in the fund. The Central Wool Committee, in addition to handling the wool purchase arrangement for the United Kingdom ""Government, has carried out other activities which have resulted in certain moneys being collected on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. moneys have mainly arisen from the following sources:- ' Skin-wools .. .. .. 2,400,000 Wool tops,- noils and waste exported from Australia pursuant to the National Security (Wool-tops) Regulations .. .. .. 2,700,000 Deferred price on wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia pursuant to the National Security (Price of Wool for Manufacture for Export) Regulations .. 1,550,000 These are provisional figures and. other transactions will probably bring the net accumulation to over Â£7,000,000. Treasurer went on to explain how the profits arose. In regard to skin wools be said that when the wool arrangement was commenced in '1939, it was announced by the .then Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that wool derived from sheepskins would not participate in any adjustment over and above the appraised price which was to be the final and only price paid for such wool. was necessary in order to"" enable the fellmonger, when purchasing woolled sheepskins, to - fix a - firm price the wool content of such sheepskins. This was confirmed each season to all concorned by the Central ""Wool Committee. That.referred to the fellmonger. result of activities in connection with wool Â£2,400,000 profit has been made. sum represents the difference between the appraised price paid to fellmongers and the purchase price received from United Kingdom Government, and covers the transactions of six seasons. On the subject, of wool-tops, &c, exported Australia, the Treasurer explained the control of the export of wool-tops, noils and waste was vested in the Central ""Wool Committee under National Regulations. The overseas market wool-tops to be supplied from increased mainly because of the inability of the United Kingdom to supply during the war. Top-makers were paid the cost, of raw wool plus other charges and profit, and the excess price obtained from overseas buyers was collected by the Central Wool Committee. There, were certain profits from the export of manufactured gpo.ds. Although these transMr Faddev. These actions related to exports, the United Kingdom Government said that it was agreeable to the whole of this deferred payment being reclaimed by the Commonwealth Government, which, as I have said, was .the constructive .trustee for the. owners of the wool. Honourable members know that it is the duty of a trustee to account for his trust. The Â£20,000,000 to which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) referred resulted from the acquisition of wool. It is wrong for him to say that the present Prime Minister is carrying out an undertaking entered into by his predecessor. The Â£7,000,000 was a windfall, and it belongs to the wool-growers of Australia. The During question time recently I asked the Minister about the disposal of the Â£7,000,000 and today I received from purchase him the following letter:During question time on Thursday, you asked nie without notice whether the accumulated funds, which had accrued from the activities of the Central Wool Committee in skin wools, wool-tops and noils, and the export of manufacturedwoollen goods, had been This appropriated to a trust account within the meaning of section 02A of the Audit Act. You also sought information as to whether the balance in such a trust fund had been for used by the Government for general purposes. I desire to advise you that these moneys have not been used for governmental purposes nor have they yet been appropriated to a As the trust account. Clause 4 of the Wool Industry Fund Bill That now before Parliament provides for the establishment of a trust account within the meaning of Section G2A of the Audit Act, and for the appropriation from Consolidated Revenue the of the moneys in... question. When this bill is' approved and becomes operative, the necessary action will be taken to give effect from to the provisions which it contains. that I should like to knowwhere the amount of Â£7,000,000 is to be found. The Treasurer stated that the money has not Security been expended, nor has it been included in in the ordinary funds which constitute Australia the moneys required for the ordinary purposes of government. . On the other India hand, he stated that it has not yet been placed to the trust fund. Obviously, the money has been received by the Government, and expended in the ordinary way. The aim of this bill is to establish a trust fund which will lead people' to believe that the money is actually in existence and available ..for the purposes set out in the bill. Clause 5 provides that moneys standing to the credit of the fund may be invested by the Treasurer in securities of the Commonwealth or of a State. The definition of "" securities "" in the Audit Act-and the trust account will come within the provisions of the Audit Act-include s treasury-bills. At the appropriate time, I propose to movean' amendment to clause 5 designed to prevent the Government from investing the proceeds of the trust fund in treasury-bills and to ensure that they shall be invested in Commonwealth Consolidated Stock. The fund should be invested - most advantageously, namely, in 3Â£ per cent. Consolidated Stock. The Government has no right to utilize, for the ordinary purposes of government, money which it has received as trustee for the wool growers. Like other trustees it must account for moneys coming into its possession. I voice my protest against the method adopted by the Government in the distribution of these moneys and I support the efforts of honourable members on this side of the chamber to ensure that it shall be accounted for strictly in accordance with accepted accountancy practice.

The Minister for Trade Council .and Customs has now supplied the followbeing ing information:1. It-is not a fact that cx-serviccmcn are receiving little or no consideration for coupons iroin the Rationing Commission - Every consideration is given to applications by exaerviccmen who are desirous of establishing themselves in cafes and other food supply services. Instructions to Deputy Directors of Rationing allow them to give permits for rationed foodstuffs to ex-servicemen. wishing to re-establish themselves if they were in that line of business prior to enlistment.. In other - eases the instructions provide, that no ex-serviceman's application is to be finally refused without reference to the commission, the members of which give personal consideration to each such case. It must be apparent, however, that while the necessity for food rationing continues it is impracticable to grant generalfy, applications. received from persons' who were not pre* ' -Â»jy in the catering trades. All per: mits given to cafes, &c,' represent additional consumption of rationed foodstuffs beyoild the individual ration, and, if unrestricted, could noon dissipate the savings being made by rationing in order to make foodstuffs available to the sorely pressed people of Britain, i Publicity is continually being given to the necessity for ex-servicemen not to incur any expense in connection with a proposed'cafe or catering ousinesb until their application for coupon permits has been approved. 2.
