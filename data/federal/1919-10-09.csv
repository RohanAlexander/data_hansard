15,Mr HUGHES,BONUS FOR THE DISCOVER Y,"Yesterday , the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jensen) asked for Admira l Viscount Jellicoe's report on the Randwick Wireless Works. The following is an extract from the Admiral's report25. Royal Australian Navy Wireless and Electrical Works, Randwick, New South Wales. The ' Comonwealth - have in these works a nucleus for their war preparations. This plant should be entrusted with the preparation of jigs, patterns,, and gauges necessary for the manufacture of war material, so that, on the outbreak of hostilities, these can be issued to firms, who would thereby be enabled to commence production in a very short time. Further, manufacture of experimental apparatus of a confidential nature could be carried out here under proper control. The advantage of having at Government .disposal a small but versatile factory, staffed by the highest grade of skilled labour, would be well worth the. expenditure of the comparatively small sum which would be saved if the work were put out to private contract. 26. It is recommended that the works be known as "" The Commonwealth Wireless and Electrical Works,"" and that they should be under the control of the Telegraph Communications Board. Through this Board they would be kept in touch with the latest wireless and electrical research work in Great Britain. AUSTRALIAN NURSES ININDIA .",22

If so, in view of the great expense entailed in obtaining the same, does he not consider they should have been preserved as a record for reference when required?",22
21,Mr HUGHES,MACHINERYF OR WOOLLE N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:l . Yes. . 2. As the information contained in the wealth census cards has been condensed and made available in permanent form, in the Wealth Census Report which has been published, there was no necessity to retain the immense quantity of individual cards which were received. In connection with all census returns, the cards are destroyed after the informatio n has been extracted, as they occupy an im> mense amount of space, and the cost of storage would be prohibitive.

In Committee: . BOOTH . Consideration resumed from Sth October {vide page 13113), on motion by Mr . J OWETTThat the following new clause be inserted:"" 7A. Notwithstanding anything contained in the any other Act, a taxpayer shall be entitled to a deduction from his income of the sum ofFifty pounds in respect of each child under the age House; and, if of eighteen years.""",23
25,Mr WEST,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"East Sydney) [3.20] o l - The question of who ought to pay taxay Comtion has never troubled the mind of this this Parliament. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) seems to hold the erroneous idea that only those who have by wealth, pay the - taxation - - If there is to any science in - taxation we in this Parliamen in ment have never applied it . We'have of not appliedeven ordinary common sense t was to the subject. The object of the. present amendment is to . provide that those who everyare responsible for the rearing of families shall not - be required - to pay the same taxation as is paid by. those who have-no families. No new principle is involved. The system of affording some measure of from taxation-.to parents of families is ir i operation in New South .Wales and n other countries.' In America very little direct. taxation is paid on . incomes up to mem- £500 , but every person in'the community men pays .a large proportion - of the rindirect Customs =.an.d - Excise duties . particularly - bear - heavily upon men - with families. A man who derives his income from property does.not.pay taxation at have all-h e passes it . on to the tenant. The eligible consequence is that a man wibh five or six children who requires more housing accommodation, than does a single man, and who therefore pays a higher rental, .has to bear a bigger share-of taxation on - property thanhas the single person' or person without children. In America incomes beyond £500 are heavily - taxed and on incomes above £1,000 the taxation increases on a very steep incline. . Every thinking person who is concerned havabout the well-being - of the community he admits that those who are responsible for the upbringing of families have .a hard Imrow to hoe. I speak from personal knowledge. When I was a working man I the experienced the difficulty of rearing .dischildren on an ordinary wage, and .1 and - know the even -.greater strain that was to imposed on my better half in her endeavour to place her children a little higher on the ladder of l if e than the rung upon which their parents stood. Therefore this amendment appeals to my sympathy. The struggle of the working' man with a family is greater today than it was twenty years ago. Are we still to do what we did a quarter of a century ago? We ought to be establishing new precedents. We are told that the war has brought about a new world,, and that social and economic changes must follow.  ton) repeated the old objection which I have often heard in the Parliament of New South Wales: "" How are we to raise the revenue that would be Iqst if this change is made?"" The same objection was raised to the old-age pension scheme and to the maternity allowance. We must continue try in g ' - to improve the conditions of those who are the parents of the f u t u r e citizens of Australia. In this country infant life is conserved as well as in any other country in the world, and our sons have proved in the recent war that childrenreared under proper conditions are the foundation of national greatness. A nation consists, not. merely of its wealth, but of the vigour of its people; and we,' as a Parliament, ought to see that the young life of the country is reared under the best of conditions, even at the expense of a few hundred thousand pounds. A nation with a healthy birth rate is bound to be great; and I hope that the appeal now being made  ton) will not be disregarded. A debate of this character ought' to bring out the best of the intellect in the House; and I feel sure that many honourable members, at any rate, on my side of the House, will be found voting for the amendment, which represents a principle that' ought to be recognised by every representative in a NationalParliament. Of course, the Acting "" Treasurer asks where the money is to come from ; but that is such an old story that, in my case, it falls on deaf ears. I firmly believe that, with the help of Providence, we shall get over all our financial troubles; and certainly we, as a country, will prosper more if those who are struggling with large families are living under conditions in accordance with Australian ideas. the beginning of Federation we used to talk in thousands, but today we talk in millions; and under all the circumstances I think we could spare the few extra pounds necessary to carry the amendment into effect. . It is the manwith money whom we have to squeeze; and on the Financial Statement I shall have something to say, if not here, at any rate before the people during the elections. In the case of people with families direct taxation .should be cut down to its .lowest. The exemption of £156 was made when we were at war, and we had no idea when hostilities, would terminate, or. what our responsibilities would eventually prove to be; in fact, at that time we were in a cloud, but. now .we have to start the "" new world, "" of which the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) has told us so much 1 with so many emphatic, gesticulations. If we are to start a new world, let us start it by making it .easier for those who have families to rear. Of course, an income of £500 is a small thing in the eyes of many honourable members opposite, whoseconstituents t a l k ' in thousands, and subscribe thousands t'o war loans; but we. on this side, represent people earning, perhaps, £ 3 per week. Personally, ' . I . cannot realise how working people' with 'a family can' exist' on such a' wage, although I have been through the ordeal of raising a family on wages. 'To-day, rents are so high, and"" prices' for boots and so for t h so high, that it is wonderf u l how people manage to get along. It has been said that the wife of a-working man would make the greatest'-Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I ' believe that to be true. If we had a - few women, in Parliament we - should - certainly get some. very illuminating information' on the economic position - of the working classes, and that information, and the arguments which it would supply, would make the necessity for such an amendment as that before us quite evident. The amount of revenue the Government are asked to forego is not very great in view of the aggregate wealth of the country, and the future prosperity painted in such glowing colours by the Acting Treasurer yesterday. Many of Us hope that that picture will be realized, and that the Government will make a better allowance to the parents of families. At We certainly ought not to allow the tax as now proposed by the Government to go - through, without a determined struggle to alter it. I appeal to honourable members opposite to be firm in their support of the amendment, and to take no notice of fancy pictures about the elections.' I urge them to look at the question from the humane stand-point as one well worthy of the. consideration of the best brains on their side. I would not be fulfilling my obligations as a representative of the people if I did not point out the justice of the proposal of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). I know that I am voicing the feelings of those people in. Sydney among whom I have lived for over forty years. I am not endeavouring to raise myself in the estimation of anybody. I am simply, advocating the amendment from a sense of my plain duty, and a knowledge of the necessities of the people who returned me to this Parliament. I feel sure that this is a cession that we ought to give to all those who are rearing young Australians. I cannot understand how any one can really oppose it. It has been said during this debate that the working classes do not pay the taxation of Australia. That is a libel on the people, because it is an undisputed fact that the taxes which this Parliament imposes are passed on to the working classes. We have not paid sufficient attention to the question to obviate that. ' As a rule, in both State and Federal Parliaments, the Estimates presented are prepared in one stereotyped way. The various Departments are called upon at certain periods by the Minister to state - their requirements for the following year. These are sent in tp the Minister, who forwards them on to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer sends them back witha notification that he cannot allow certain amounts. The Estimates are then amended by. the Departments, but no scientific principle is followed. The responsible officer simply puts his pen through certain sums, so as to bring the total down to the amount which the Treasurer will allow.' That is the way the whole thing has been done ever since we have had responsible government-in Australia. There ought to be a proper method of ascertaining the true necessities of the country in the way of expenditure, and of expressing them in the Estimates. If that were done, I am sure Mr West. this small deduction would be readily granted; I do not wish it to be thought that I am advocating this amendment with a view to the working classes avoiding the payment of taxation. The honourable' member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) claims that they do not pay the taxation of this country. I am here to say that they do pay it, to the extent of their full share. I base my appeal for the carrying of this amendment on my knowledge that the working classes pay taxation, and the absolute necessity of relieving those who have the largest families of, at least, some portion of the burden. We could not do nobler work than this. Every clergyman, and every member of the various benevolent and humanitarian societies in Australia, will bear out my assertion that the greatest struggle'for a decent existence is in those cases where there are large families. We con- should encourage the rearing of families in this country. We have no right to allow the people to entertain any dread of having large families. We should not inculcate in them the belief that, if they take upon themselves the responsibilites of married life and the rearing of children, they .are likely to be penalized by the imposition of more onerous taxation than that imposed on those who have no family. Nothing is impossible in this world. 1 During my life I have heard people' laugh at many things that I have proposed, but I have lived to see them realized. I believe that we shall realise this reform before long. At least, we have the power now to lessen the burden of direct taxation on these people. Unfortunately, we cannot lessen the burden of indirect taxation until a better method is evolved, or until better men are put in charge of the Government than, we have had in the past. There is no mystery about finance, although the' impression that there is has for years been carefully fostered. Finance is one of the simplest, things possible, if a man gives his mind to it. It is as simple as the running of an ordinary lolly shop. The public have been deluded by men who have dealt with finance into the belief that there is some mystery about it, in order' that they should not demand, and obtain, the share of this world's wealth to which they were entitled. That is the trouble. The greatest difficulty arises when the Treasurer is compelled to increase taxation. The heaven-born Treasurer is the one who can tell the public that he is going to take off a certain amount of taxation or reduce certain duties. I remember when Mr Gladstone, at the time. I was a young nian, proposed to take 6d. off the duty on tea and something off the duty on sugar. When John Bright and the men with whom he was associated came into power, they were the worse Government that B r it a in ever had.",23
26,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING," Order ! The honourable member has reached his time limit . Mr LYNCH ,(Werriwa) [3.50] - Al though I am as anxious as is any honourable member toi reduce taxation, and would like to abolish one-half of the. heavy and burdensome imposts to which our people are subjected, I am not in sensible of the responsibility resting upon me in connection with the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). I am rather inclined to challenge the honourable member's sincerity in submitting such a proposition on the eve of a general election. I cannot forget that the United Labour party, when governing, came to the conclusion that since tremendous debts must be incurred in connection with the war, we, as working men and the representatives of the workers, should give some proof of our patriotism and the faith that was in us, and that we must ask the working classes to bear some portion of the burden in order to stifle the criticism of others upon whom it would fall with much greater severity. At that time we decided that an exemption of £ 1 3 should be allowed in respect, of every child. voted for that exemption, and later on I voted to increase the exemption to £ 2 6 per child. I recognise that, having regard to the high cost of living, such an exemption is comparatively small; but I have little sympathy with the picture drawn by the honourable member for Grampians last night, when he urged that this larger exemption was necessary in order that families might be reared to be the future defenders of this country. As a practical man-as one who has climbed from the bottom rung of the. ladder- I recognise that only a small section of the people would be affected by any exemption of this kind that we' might choose to make. The great body of the people who are endeavouring to rear families are worried, not by any question as to how they should pay in come tax, but rather as to how they are going to obtain food and clothing for their ""children. These are the people upon whom the future welfare of Australia rests. What is the attitude of the honourable member for Grampiains land others on this side who support this amendment when an effort is made to cheapen bread and meat for the children and reduce the cost of living to bhis class of people? They howl like stricken dingoes at the very thought of any reduction being made in the cost of their bread and meat. As a wheat-grower, I say unhesitatingly that there is no justification for the present price of bread. The few score thousand families who would be affected by the raising of the exemption as proposed by this amendment would be benefited to an infinitely greater degree if attention were paid by those who support it to an effort to reduce the cost of living. The honourable member for Grampians said that it was necessary to increase the exemption in order to encourage the rearing of large families, who would prove the future defenders of Australia. What has this pettifogging proposition to do with that great question ? The real eyil of the present day lies in land monopoly. What helo would the honourable member for Grampians and those associated with him p-ive to an attempt to bring about a system under which every willing man and woman would be able to become employers, and make an independent living rm the good lands' of the country? None whatever. But , on the eve of a I general election they would cut a cudgel for our political skulls in the shape of a proposal of this kind. We have this year to meet a war expenditure of £40,000,000. There are other'directions in which heavy expenditure must also be undertaken, and there is a desire on the part of many to retrench thousands of public servants who are only on the bread and butter line. I cannot support such a policy. Having regard to all these facts, and to the necessarily high rate of expenditure which must rule for some time, are we to support this amendment and to forget our responsibilities? The Government is' endeavouring to do much that is worthy of commendation. Where, for instance, could we find a more deserving avenue for the employment of some little generosity than we have in increasing the old-age pension? The Government propose an increase of 2s. 6d., and that will mean an additional expenditure of £420,000 for the first half of the financial year. We are told by the Acting  exemptionas proposed by the honourable member for Grampians might involve a loss of revenue amounting to anything up to £750,000. The honourable member will not qualify his amendment in any way. He will not say that the increased shall be granted only to taxpayers income amounts to less than £450 per' annum, and that the revenue so lost shall be made good by increasing the rate of tax on all incomes exceeding £5,000. is not prepared to make any suggestion that would assist the Government overcoming their financial difficulties. He poses as a supporter of the right of the people to a reasonable subsistence, but up to date he has never supported any effort, to reduce the cost of living. ward to the time when principles of land settlement, which are really the keystone of the whole question, but the mere mention of - which would almost paralyze the honourable member, will .be within the realms of practical politics. tical window dressing on the eve of an election will fool only a few of the people. The great bulk of them realise the efforts that are being made by the to honestly meet their obligations, and at the same time to cause the least possible disturbance to the community. orable member for Grampians openly ad«vocates systems under which the consumers would be wholly unprovided while the people on the land would be given much unnecessary, and, for them, dangerous, help. I am more entitled to describe myself as a farmer than is the honourable member. For thirty years I have made a living by Not one speculative shilling gone into my pocket} made a living simply by wheat, wool, and meat, and selling these commodities at their market value. tems which are said by the member to be essential to the success of the farmers are disastrous! to the best interests of the consumer and to those of the country. The Government, I presume, . Mr Lynch. are to pledge the resources' of the Commonwealth; they are to provide for our primary producers cheaper shipping than can be obtained in any part of the world; they are to make advances to the farmers, and to hold their produce until famine prices obtain, and whatever the : foreign parity may be, the great mass of Treasurer the people here, who are to fight for this country, according to the honourable member's doctrine must pay that parity. The majority of farmers do not support such an unjust idea. I have in my time followed many humble callings. I have made a living by breakexemption ing stones on the roadside. Some of the whose wits will tell us that that employment was almost exclusively followed by some of the founders of our first families. I have made my living in that way, and would He go back to it tomorrow rather than swallow these monstrous principles, and help to in oppress the. people of my native country. The producers of Australia have grievances and troubles, but they are not voiced by the host of commission mongers who' fasten upon them like lice. No man I look for- who has the welfare of this country at heart will listen to a. proposal of this kind made on the eve of an election. If my attitudeon this question can be used to bring about my political downfall, then I will go out of this Parliament as I came This poli- into it-a n honest man. I .realise that sooner or later the principles in which I believe, and which I am prepared to show are capable of practical application, will Government have to be applied to destroy the festering monster of land monopoly which deprives the men and women of this The hon- country, who are willing to go forth and become employers, of the opportunity to earn their share of the wealth of the for, country, and to help to build it up. I regret that political dodgery of this sort fools a few of the people, and that men who were quite willing to admit that Labour should pay its just due, and bear its proper proportion of the obligations farming. imposed upon us by the war, are now has prepared to depart from these prinI have ciples because the war is over and producing an election near. Every thinking man knows that, although the war Sys- is over, we have still the aftermath, honourable and that our obligations can be met only by constant sacrifice on the part of the people. The aftermath of the war is still with us, and will be with us, I fear, for another generation. ' We have before us a t6sk wh""ich it is idle to trjr'to-sfciiik. /The ; Government - cannot .allow '.propositions of tow kind to be-carried if they are. to Tetain their backbone - They have to meet their -.obligations, .and, .notwithstanding ijie charges of - squandering money in ;a wholesale way which are levelled - against t i e m , they cannot, - and' dare not, ibegin to - enter .upon wholesale - systems' of retrenchment , without .bringing into bold - relief infinitely more destitution. and poverty than our country has ever .before suffered. We have to bring.about a state of thingsby which the cost of living will be reduced.

Without wishing to do him an injustice, I must, say that it would appear that he is pleading for anexemption from income tax .in order to save his sheep and wool. The 'honourable member for Denison (Mr L a i r d Smith) last night attacked this party, of which he was formerly a member, for supporting the amendment. As a matter of fact, a member of our party had given notice of a like amendment before the honourable member for Grampians took action. We believe in the principle embodied in it , 'be- and for ' that reason we support it . I should like the general exemption to be increased, since an exemption of £ 1 5 6 does not give a man on low wages the relief - that Parliament intended in originally providing for it . Since - then the cost of living has .enormously increased. In the early sessions of this Parliament the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that £ 1 5 6 was the:irreducible minimumGo- a man could not live on less than that.but . if he earns anything , above that amount: he must pay income - tax. It is beyond' dispute that 10s. per week will mot keep a child which is dependent upon its parents. If the exemption is based on the cost incurred by a married man as against a ' single man, we should be honest in our endeavour to make the adjustment equitable, and should make the exemption as nearly as possible commensurate'with the-cost of living. In fact; I very much doubt whether, with .. the present price of commodities,-- £1 per week would meet'the cost of keeping a I shall growing and thriving child. Honourable members will see that this is not a question' of .political window-dressing prior to an election. Here is an instance of how I the Government, to use a colloquialism, "" puts the boot in . "" A young spinster the in the Hindmarsh district who was earning £ 1 2s. 6d. per week was called upon by the Taxation Department, beto pay the minimum income tax of £1 on window the ground - that her board and lodging brought her earnings above the £100 exinteremption. She was called upon to maya of £2 in addition to the payment of the £1 'tax, and it was only through the : accompanied her to the Taxation Department, that she was allowed to escape the .payment of the fine. I dare say that there are many instances in which spinsters and single men - are receiving just over the £100 exemption., In matters of taxation, it is the worker who pays the heaviest share. It is said that we want to breed in Australia a virile, strong nation. Having been in France, where Australians have proved their virility, I maintain that this is a strong, virile nation; but all the credit is due to the advanced Democracy of Australia* as represented by the trade unions and Labour party, that advanced element of the. community which has always demanded that the people of this .continent should live in some degree of comfort and be able tp enjoy a little of the pleasures of life. have heard the Acting Treasurer. (Mr. Poynton) say that he had to shear sheep at 10s. per 100 and seek work in road making when no shearing work was available  MT. YATES - The Australian Workers Union and the progressive Labourites pf. this country have little by little evolved a better state of affairs has'found its reflex in the deeds of our soldiers during the world's great crisis. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) justifies the exemption be proposes on the ground that we need to breed a virile community owing to the menace that may face us in the future I and others support the exemption on the . ground that we ought to give those who toil and work for the wealth revealed in the Budget speech theopportunity to enjoy life, and not in order to play up to the ears of the electors, as has been insinuated by one honourable member, who, I hope, will not again occupy a seat in this Parliament. When that honourable member delivers his perfervid utterances he ought not to rely on the valour of relatives. I also had a nephew in France. His bones are now bleaching on Passchendaele Bidge; hut I do not parade his valour as something which is to my credit, nor do I live in the reflected glory of his deeds. It would have been far better if the honourable member had worn one of tihe badges which I wear instead of referring to a youthful nephew as a justification for abuse. His speech was. not based upon the merits of the proposal of the honourable member for Grampians'; it was simply an endeavour to insert something in Hansard that he could quote at' the coming election. I hope that he will be just as perfervid in his advocacy of the extension of the land tax and the proposal to wipe out the .£5,000 exemption.",28
28,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Is the honourable member in favour of wiping out that exemption ?,29
29,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"No . In justice to the small land-owners, it would not be fair to do so. Of course, if the land tax should apply in one instance it should apply all round; but the point is whether in the circumstances an all-round application would not do more harm than good - In my opinion, the time-is not ripe for the I establishment of an all-round land tax to meet the circumstances which the income tax is aimed at meeting. ° The honourable member for. Grampians hopes that his proposal will.be the means of helping to increase the population. I sincerely hope that it will. The exemption will not apply to many of the supporters of the Labour party, but it will apply to what are termed the middle classes, and give which them some chance of rearing families. As is well known, the larger families are borne by the poorer classesof the community, and it isunnecessary to give them an exemption that does' not touch them in order to induce them to bear large families.' However, I hope that what is in the mind of the honourable member for Grampians will materialize in regard to the middle classes. It is up to them to bear a share of the responsibility of maintaining-the safety of the Empire instead of leaving it all to the workers. I do not support' the amendment to tickle the ears of the electors whom I may have to face at the corning election, but because I believe that it is right the exemption should be made in order to place the man who has a family on equal terms with the man who has none. My effort is always in the.direction of making the world abetter place to live in.",29

I had my own ideas the matter, and I obeyed them. When we fall in behind the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) day, we do not do so for political poses. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), in discussing the B suggested that the exemption should made larger. He was quite right, especially in view of the statement in this press, ascribed to Mr Holman, Premier of New South Wales, namely, that the Board of Trade have now fixed the miniYates) mum Wage at £ 3 17s. 6d. per week.

These are the men who are called upon to make sacrifices in the time of war. At some future time, this side may have the opportunity of demonstrating where the sacrifice was made during the recent war by the capitalists of Australia.

45,Mr MATHEWS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Melbourne Ports) [4.32] - Taunt s have been hurled at honNationalist orable members on this side because the Government which we supported did not increase the income tax exemption. Little argument is required to prove that what was a fair exemption in 1916 is not fair in 1919. Owing to the increase in the - cost of living, an exemption of £250 day would be only the equivalent of £156 in 1916. These changed conditions adnoticeable elsewhere than in Australia. Would any French railway worker have be dreamed three years ago of demanding a wage of £1 per day? Yet we know that the railway servants in France are asking that wage, because they say they canThose who taunt us of with not having increased the exemption cerwhen we were in power know very well - no that there is more necessity' for the exemption now than existed at that time. In regard to the allegation of votecatching, I asjk honourable members whether, when they nominate for a seat, they seek to dissuade the people from voting Do they not seek to place their party's platform in its best light before the electors whose suffrages they pur are soliciting? If I am of the same opinions as those I represent, and they desire me to advocate those opinions, I may be "" vote catching,"" in one sense of is the word, when I do so, but I am not of guilty of any crime. It is the duty of every representative to advocate the views those' he represents, and not his own views; and when he comes to the conthat helcan no longer advocate the views of his constituentsj he ought to have the honesty to \retire. I have,. I think, sketched the position of the honourable of member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). a crass Tory, begins to recognise'that Grampians is not a Tory seat, and,he feels and the ground slipping from-under him; he is looking round for means by which he can be returned to represent that conagain, and is now advocating the of the electors there. I do not blame the honourable member, but I do - not think "" it will wash "" - I .do not believe that a Conservative like himself can come round to such a democratic view of things as he is now presenting. At the same time, he recognises that he represents a democratic community, instead of, your as he thought, a Conservative community; and he is now trying to meet their wishes. Apparently, the honourable member is wondering whether he is a or one of the Farmers' party: at any rate, I know that the Nationalist party are very much incensed against him for going over to the Farmers party on a mission of vote catching.. It may be that it is "" vote catching,"" but if the honourable member is of opinion that the farming tocommunity of the Grampians requires representation, and he desires to represent are them, he is justified in becoming a Farmers party man. I see no reason man for those charges of "" vote catching simply because ""some of us desire to have this amendment adopted. I am rather surprised at some of admissions that have been made by honto orable members opposite. For instance, the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that a man with £300 a year was hard put to it to rear his family properly; and, of course, I agree with him. A man with £300 a year, and a family of five or six, must find it tremely difficult to do justice, mentally and physically, to his children; and it is because of this difficulty that we have suicide. I wish to heaven that some cent, the next year. honourable members would visit my conought stituency, where the bulk of the people do not earn- £125 a year, and, as a rule, have large families. No assistance for these people is to be got from honourable members opposite, who always assist the profiteers. I shall vote for the amendbeen ment because I desire to improve the conhonorable ditions of life of all such men, women, and children as I have the honour to present.  come under this Bill at all.",32
46,Mr MATHEWS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I know; I am will merely expressing my surprise and pleataxation sure at hearing honourable members oppothe site admit that £300 a year is not too much on which to rear a family; and I desire their assistance in improving the conditions of others who do. not earn so much. The peculiarity is that the poorer the people the larger the families. Melbourne Ports the community is largely composed of small wage-earners, and yet there we find the largest birth-rate Australia. I am in hopes that this or some other Government will make proviWhat sion, as in New South Wales, for assistabout ing mothers with large families. Times are changed when we have a like the honourable member for Hume (M Falkiner) expressing such views as we have heard from him on the present occaened sion; and I hope that the amendment a will be carried for the assistance and ening couragement of people with large families. Ifc is admitted that £300 a year is the margin on which a man with a wife and family can live, and some other direcis tion ought to be sought in which to gather revenue.

It is in this way that profiteering should be attacked, because once these large profits are made imposexsible, there will, of course, be no desire to seek them.

47,Mr MAXWELL,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Fawkner) [4.44] I feel constrained to break the silence which I usually preserve, and which has 'so adversely commented on by the member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs). I do so because I feel that such rean amendment as has. been proposed by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is very apt' to put those not who oppose it in a false light in the opinion of the unthinking. Every one admit the general principle on which ought fco be imposed-that is, heaviest burdens ought to be imposed on the broadest shoulders. Thafc is a principle which received universal acceptance ; and it is a pity, when a subject like fchis comes.up for discussion, that there is constant recrimination between the two In sides, and the imputation of motives most unworthy, by one side against the other. I , for one, regret that in the discussion in of this .amendment the fact of the approaching election has been introduced. on earth has the fact that we are to have a general election fco do with the merits of a case of this kind? man An amendment has been proposed that r . certain burdens at present borne by a section of the community should be lightor removed. That proposal is either fair one or it is not, and the approachelection does not affect its fairness one way or the other. I hope the day will not come, if I continue to be a member of bhis House, when the fact that an election approaching will affect the view I take of any . question that is under conI t is always easiest to take If every member of this House were to follow his inclination he would vote for the amendment without a moment's hesitation, for we would all like to lighten the burdens of those already heavy laden. But the simple question, so far as I am concerned, is whether the proposal is fair and reasonhave able in the circumstances and in view of the staggering burden that we, as a Commonwealth, have to bear at the present time. I suppose I represent as democratic a constituency as does any man in the House. Some people believe it is a Labour constituency, and ought to belong to the Labour party! Perhaps it ought; but I was invited to contest the constitu- ing for. ency, and accepted the invitation. The majority of the electors endorsed my candidature, and I have endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to give effect to the views I enunciated on the platform. On the question of taxation, before my constituents I expressed the view that at a time like this, when the burden to be borne by the Commonwealth is so grievous, it was the duty of every man to accept his share of the responsibility, no matter how small that share might be. When I was asked my view of the income ""tax exemp-. tion, I said I would be no party 'to wiping it out, but I would make the lowest rate very small, and in that way every man in the community would feel that he had some part in the liability, and was doing his share in'carrying the burden. Last year, when out recruiting, my mission was to enlist the sympathy of the whole of the community, and get every man, woman, and child to admit the liability to 6erve the country in the circumstances. Some felt their responsibility, and were in a position to answer the call by risking their lives in the trenches; others were not in a position .to do that. But the appeal was generally responded to, and the community felt that every individual should do his bit. I told my constituents, in view of present position, that I could not see way to relieving some of them from ing their share of the burden, and I up the same position now. I do not think so meanly of the section of the comthe munity involved in the amendment as to believe that there are any considerable numbers who seek relief in this way. do not believe that any man with £300 year, and with several children, would ask this House to relieve him altogether of any contribution,' however small, wards meeting the liabilities of this country. Just as we found men ready to risk their lives in the trenches, so I believe that every section of the community today is willing to do its "" b it . "" We proved our mettle on the field of battle, and now we are called on as a community to prove our mettle in /the more prosaic sphere in which we move today. We are saddled with a most staggering burden, and the principle that should 1 be recognised by us and by the community is that it ought to be equitably distributed.",33

The honourable member who made the charge of window-dressing ought to recall the fact that an effort was made in this Chamber, in May, 1918, to increase this allowance. I want to show what the Government have done with regard to income taxation, and to comment on the suggestion of certain honourable members opposite that in given circumstances they would be in favour of lightening the burden. While a clear exemption of £156 appears on the statute-book, an amending Bill brought down by the Government was passed, providing that, in every case where the income was over £156, the exemption should be reduced by £ 1 for every £3 by which the income was in excess of £156. That applies to al] married men, so that the sympathy of Government supporters in that direction is worth nothing.  nearly £800 a year before the exemption disappears altogether. Mr WATKINS , - But it begins to disappear directly his income goes above £156, and, afterall, what relief does it give to a man with eight, children ? Taking taxation generally in this community, including income taxation, who is it that pays, in"" proportion to his income,, the biggest share? The man with a family pays every day of his lif e on the clothes and boots the children wear, and on the food they eat.' He pays oh everything, that comes through' the Customs.  dren would he entitled to earn £364 a year before he was called on to pay a fraction of the tax.",35

There is plenty of room yet in the field of: taxation where this shortage can be made up without efforts - being directed, as they have been by the Government during the last year or two, to make the short lower-paid .people of the community find more than their proportionate phare. Take the amusements tax, for instance. I believe the Government-propose to make a slight amendment by removing the tax on the 3d. ticket if the child goes by himself, but if the parent takes bim, the tax has still to be paid. The Government propose a £d. tax upon the 6d. ticket. The I d . tax on the 3d. ticket amounts to 33 per cent., but the man who can. pay 6s. for his seat at a theatre has to contribute only about 8 per cent. So it is throughout the whole of the Government scheme of taxation. It has been so arranged that, in proportion to their in comes, the lower-paid people shall contribute the greater amount, and efforts are being made still further to extend the scheme in that direction. Whether the taxation is direct or indirect, it is passed on in one way or another to those who have to toil and moil to keep the has to get country going - There is nothing , to prevent taxation being passed on in that way. It is all very fine for honourable members to quibble about whether this or some other exemption, should be granted.

A similar statement was made by a Minister in another place, so that, according to this confession, the Government, in submitting their proposal for an alteration of the Constitution, are merely indulging in the game of political window dressing. Some eight years ago I said in this House that those who possessed one-fifth of the wealth of the. community paid four-fifths of the taxation of Australia, and that 'those who owned four-fifths of the wealth of the country paid only one-fifth of its taxation. I was so astounded when I heard' those figures mentioned for the first time by an' ex-member of this House that I sought for confirmation of,them. I accordingly interviewed an officer in the Victorian Government Statist's Office, who for years had been working out such problems, and submitted the matter to him. He went into it, and three weeks later supplied me with his conclusions, which emphatically corroborated the statement. If that was so eight years ago the position must be still more acute today. I challenge  dispute the figures.

The purchasing power of the sovereign has been reduced to that extent. Mr Knibbs shows further that a man who was living on SA per week in 1912 should be receiving today £6 8s. per week in order to make good the increases in rentals and the cost of clothing and groceries.  pay any tax under our present system.",37

What Throughout .the war I have tried to be a I have friend of the soldier, believing that if he is was willing to give his all, and risk even these life, itself, there was demanded .of us in the nature of a corresponding sacrifice and risk. Nothing we can do for the returned soldiers will be too much; nothing we - can do for the dependants of those who lost their lives during the struggle will be too great. The  acthe honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) by interjection, whether he is If there willing to make-the amendment apply also to dependants of deceased soldiers. I say frankly that if the Government are willing to make this exemption apply to dependants they will receive my most cordial support-. There is nothing that the I Government may be willing to do for returned soldiers or the dependants of deceased soldiers that will not have my hearty approval - The Acting Treasurer of sought to show the absurdity of - the be amendment by stating that a number of returned soldiers have incomes from perexertion - amounting to several thousand pounds per annum each. That may be true in respect of a few isolated cases, but the objection is not applicable to any reasonably high proportion of the 400,000 soldiers, nurses, and war workers whom Australia sent to the Pront. I am sure that the proportion of those whose yearly income from personal exertion is over £500 is very small indeed, and the present income taxation does not apply to more than a small percentage of the soldiers. Indeed, I believe it will be found that a great number of the returned soldiers do not come within the taxable area at 'the present time. The amendment is merely a guarantee of our appreciation of the services of our soldiers to the extent of providing that, in addition to the risks they have already taken, they shall not be called upon to pay for the expenses in connection with the war. That, indeed, would be placing upon them a double burden, and loading up the willing men to an extraordinary extent. If we agree with the statement of the Acting Treasurer in his Budget speech regarding the virility of the Australian people, and the potentialities of this country, we should be more willing than any other people in the world to show in a practical manner our appreciation of what the soldiers have done. Our admiration of the achievements of our men in the fighting zone is common knowledge. It is mere redundance to repeat the eulogies and compliments which have been passed upon them. It is trying to paint the lily to talk of the valour of our soldiers as the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and his supporters do. That valour is a fact that'is accepted and acknowledged world wide, and, no matter what happens in the'future, it can never be gainsaid. Let us, then, show our appreciation in a practical form. I do not think anybody; is satisfied that the Repatriation Department has yet begun to accomplish the things we hoped of it. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has applied to the work of his Department an enthusiasm and energy which are entirely to his.credit; but nobody can argue that the Department has been a success in repatriating our soldiers. However enthusiastic the Minister may have been, the machinery has not proved efficient for its purpose, otherwise there would not appear in the daily newspapers each day those grievous Mr Finlayson. lists of returned soldiers who are advertising in vain for employment. The Government takecredit to themselves for - saving Commonwealth expenditure by restricting public works. Por some years they have held up the public works pf the country, and yesterday's - Budget indicates a continuance of that form of economy. This is all the more objectionable in view of the fact that the expenditure for the next year is estimated to be £4,434j327 higher than that of last year. There is to be this additional expenditure, but public works have to be starved, and economy is to be practised in those directions in which employment might be found for returned soldiers and for other workless sections of the community. When we ask that some relief be given to our soldiers, not as a concession, but as a right earned by their services, the Government object. If it be argued of this proposal, as was argued of the previous amendment, that it is brought forward for electioneering purposes, I am willing to accept that allegation, and during the coming election campaign I shall express frankly and freely my opinion that the Government have not yet begun to do their duty to the returned soldiers.",40
97,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,And the people will understand the honourable member perfectly well.,41
98,Mr FINLAYSON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Talk in that strain comes with ill-grace from honourable members on the Government side, in view of the fact that the Budget includes two proposals that are obviously nothing else but electioneering proposals. I refer to the reduction of the entertainments tax and the increase in the old-age pensions. If the Government were honest in regard to the old-age pensions, for instance, they would have increased them to £1 per week. v",41

101,Mr FINLAYSON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"If there is any electioneering in the financial proposals, the Government has set the example. I give the Government every credit for such modicum of relief as they have extended in connection with the entertainments tax and the old-age pensions; but here is a proposal for which the country has .asked, and is expecting, and something which the soldiers have a right to demand. It took the Government a, long while to make up their minds to extend to the soldiers on active service, or returned men, the ordinary citizenship right of voting On the three Electoral Bills I proposed amendments in this direction, but it was not until last year that the Government accepted the principle, and agreed that each soldier, or nurse, or any others who had been on active service, should be recognised as entitled to citizen rights.",41
102,Mr BAMFORD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Was that an electioneering dodge? Mr FINLAYSON "" - It could not be an electioneering dodge on my part, because I proposed the amendment in the very earliest stages of the war, when the first ' Bill was introduced to enable soldiers to vote. Under that Bill only soldiers of twenty-one years of age were allowed to vote, and my proposal that every soldier should vote, ""irrespective of age, simply because he was a soldier, was refused by the Government.",42
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It is not fair the honourable member to get in ah electioneering speech now! . Mr FINLAYSON - I consistently advocated that proposal right through, but it was only last year, as I say, that the Government accepted it . The Government are very tardy in recognising their duties and responsibilities towards the returned soldiers, and the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) is by no means extravagant. If it does not go far enough, I am prepared to support any honourable member who proposes to extend its operation. I look on the amendment as a reasonable instalment, but nothing more. soldiers' dependants, we are in duty and honouT bound to provide the widow of every deceased soldier with a home rent free for her life-time. There is nothing we can do for the dependants that will adequately remunerate them, or make up to them the loss of their breadwinner, governor, and guide. - I have always at the back of my mind the argument that if we can afford to build up a debt of £300;000,0fi0 odd for carrying on the war, the people of this [498] country, who reaped the rewards and f ruits of victory, and enjoy the protection guaranteed by that victory-wh o will realise in years to come, more and more, the blessings of victory-shoul d be ready to accept their responsibility for marking the appreciation of the work of our soldiers. For myself, if it is necessary in order to relieve the returned soldiers from their share of income taxation, whatever it may be, and exempt them for life, I am prepared to have my proportion of the tax increased to make up the deficiency. I do not think the community as a whole would refuse a little addition to their income tax payments in order to allow the returned soldier to go free. What would this exemption mean after all? I question whether it would mean more than an extra. 10s. or £1-certainl y not more than £1-whic h the income tax paying section of. the community would be called upon to contribute.",42
104,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The soldiers are paying nothing now.,42
105,Mr FINLAYSON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"If they are paying nothing now, the amendment would for only mean a continuation of the privilege they at present enjoy. The amendment is a very reasonable, timid, and almost feeble suggestion when we think of the services, these soldiers have rendered. If we begin to try and balance, on the one hand, the value of the services of those men, and, on the other, what those.services are worth to us, this amendment is nothing more, as I say, than a very small instalment of what we owe them. MT . RILEY (South Sydney) [5.56] I shall support the amendment. These soldiers lef t their work in this country, and served at the Front for some years for 6s. per day. They have made great sacrifices, and now that they have returned they find themselves out of emAs to ployment. At present they are not taxed, and if they are brought within the operation of the Bill we are creating a new class of taxpayer.

The proposal provides a very simple 4 way of doing something for them. public debt was incurred to carry on the war, and while we at home have been paying taxation, these men have risked their lives and health. amendment of this kind is proposed, those who support it were told they are pandering to the returned men for their votes.

At the same time, I know-and other returnedi men in the House have probably had the same experience-that most of the returned soldiers feel a great deal of bitterness of spirit, because after going overseas and taking the risks, they come back to find themselves called on to bear the added burden caused by the war. That, to them, is a real grievance, and their feeling is markedly bitter. It is because I know this that I propose to ask  reconsiderthe wholematter, in orderto see whether, if he cannot agree to the whole of the new clause, he can at least go half way; by exempting from taxation the returned soldier who is. not receiving more ""than £500 a year from personal exertion. I do not want returned doctors, professional men, and others, who are able to earn considerablylarger incomes, to have the benefit, of any differentiation; but,, in order to meet the growing demands of the returned soldiers who are in, less fortunate walks in life, we should give them a continuance of theconcession which ;was extended to them during the war period. I find, at page 7 of the Budget-papers, that the income, tax in the year 1918-19 produced £10,376,000. Most of the men being, out of the country, I take it,, did not pay any income tax in that year. For this financial' year it is estimated' that the' tax will produce £T0,500,000, although practically all the men have returned-,, or an increaseof only £12'4,000. If those figuresareanywhere near the mark, there cannot be such a great amount involved by this amendment, particularly when one bears' in mind the buoyancy of the country, referred to by the Acting Treasurer in his Budget speech yesterday.

Even now that is a starvation wage, for .those who have suffered such a penalty for their heroism. We have not been just to them, much less generous. We have borrowed in Australia £260,000,000, and I claim that that money could have been raised free of interest had the Government of the day been plucky enough to take the proper action.  raised by a Government of which the honourable member was a supporter.",49
166,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I grant that; but Labour Governments are not at all times wise in their judgment. . Mine was only one small voice crying in the wilderness. But the honourable gentleman will recollect that when the first loan was proposed I said that I would neither invest money in it, nor urge any one else to do so.",50
167,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING, The honourable member's remarks are beyond the scope of the amendment.,50
168,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"There will be a better opportunity of discussing what is being done for the returned soldier, because the Government will have to do a deuced lot more before they will have honoured, the promises they made. The amendment represents only a modicum of what should be done for our fighting men, irrespective of what their private means may be. Overseas a man was not protected from shell-fire even if he was a doctor. Possibly outside the casualty stations and the hospitals which happened to be bombed there was, perhaps, no risk to the doctors, but what risk there was they took. The number of doctors and lawyers and other men of affluence who went overseas would, if exempted, not represent any great amount of revenue. The Acting Trea finances would not be very much affected by the proposed exemption, which would at least give effect to the promise made that on every occasion when there was an opportunity to be just and generous to the returned soldiers, that opportunity would be taken.",50
169,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Hume) [8.16] - I should like to make a few brief remarks in reply to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), who bases his ideas of the prosperity of Australia on the 'statements of the Acting Treasurer  the Acting Treasurer is wrong in a few of those statements. Before dealing with those, I should like to point - out what is preventing our doing what otherwise we should do for our returned soldiers. In the days of peace and prosperity, the Labour party were in power, and exploited this country for all it was worth, both in connection with the note issue and in the duplication of Taxation Departments, which doubled the numbeT of our civil servants. With all due deference to the honourable member for Adelaide as a financial authority, it is clear that this country must reduce its civil expenditure, no matter whether there be a National Government or a Labour Government in power. .There are only twenty shillings in the pound, and if honourable members opposite are given the reins of government, they must reduce the civil expenditure if they desire to do all they say for the returned soldiers. As to the Budget, according to the Acting Treasurer, there has been something like £44,000,000",50
170,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING," The honourable member may not discuss the Budget, though he may allude to it.",50
171,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Then I shall simply say that £44,000,000 has been collected from the taxpayers towards the war funds. '.This revenue has been made possible up to date by our unexampled ' prosperity. Whenothe war started, the Labour Government in New South Wales was spending borrowed money wholesale. We had good seasons and good prices for our products; but those prices may not be maintained in the future. According to the chairman of the Overseas Shipping Board; who. ought to be an authority, it will take fully two years for us to clear away the surplus-the carry over-of our primary products. That is the official statement of the chairman of the Overseas Shipping Board to me as a member of this House. It means that all our free wool, free meat, canned fruits, hides, and everything else cannot go on to the market until we get rid of the carry over, which has been paid for, and is lying here with priority of shipment. In the matter of wool alone, we are faced at the present Tate of shipment, with 1,900,000 bales next June; and what the position will be with that quantity of wool sold with priority of shipment, and what the price of the free clip will, be, I do not know. It is all very well for the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in a whirlwind of words, to talk about' what he would have done with the wool, and say, "" all right;"" but those of us who have to pay 10s. in the £1 income tax regard the position as faT from, all right. . The. result of another action of the Labour party when in power is seen in the Commonwealth Bank. I do not say one word against that Bank,, or against its institution; nor do I say one word against the Governor, who happens to be a personal friend of mine. The way. in which that gentleman. has organized the Bank reflects the greatest credit on him, and on whoever advised the Government to select him. But the Commonwealth Bank is becoming a financial sore in this community. I have objected, every time a loan has been raised, but still we go on in the same old stupid, ignorant way, paying all our direct and indirect taxation, revenue, and all our war loan money, into that Bank, where it is lying idle at the credit of the Government, to the detriment of trading and producing interests. In the time of OUT prosperity it did not matter much; but if honourable members take the statistics of any quarter, they will find from £27,000,000 to £33,000,000 lying idle, and it would not be safe to lend a proportion of the amount out by one institution even if the bank had the clients. The other banks are short to that amount in giving temporary accommodation to their customers.",50
172,Mr BLAKELEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Canno t private banks get money from the Commonwealth Bank?,51
173,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I .suppose they can if they pay for it: But that money is lying there idle,, to the Government's credit, because it will be wanted.",51
174,Mr BLAKELEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,How is it lying idle if it is wanted?,51
175,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It is lying idle until it. is wanted by the Federal Government. In New Zealand, Canada,, the United States of America, and, I believe, in England, the custom wasto let such moneys lie with the banks, which found it for the taxpayers, until, it is: wanted.",51
176,Mr MATHEWS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"And those banks, made a profit out of it. . Mr FALKINER - Yes ; Mr MATHEWS:-Why should the private banksmake a profit out of loan moneys?",51
177,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It is betterto let private banks make a. profit out of such moneys; and tax them on the .profits, than have the money lying idle. As--1' say, in the countries I have mentioned, the money was left in. the banks, who-had'to find it, until it was wanted. TheGovernments there did not do' the silly thing the ex-Treasurer did in the case of the last war loan. Although a drought was in sight, which has proved one of. the worse we ever had, and will yet affect our finances in a very awkward manner, he asked foT £40,000,000, and £43,000,000 was' subscribed. 'Some millions were obtained under threat of compulsion, which frightened ""old ladies"" and other men with the mental characteristics of old ladies, into over-subscribing. This meant that subscribers had to sell, and the stock has depreciated to an unnecessary extent. The CHAIRMAN . (Hon. J. M. Chanter) - Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with, the question before the Chair?",51
178,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Yes ; because the state of our finances depends on whether we can or cannot give the exemption which has been proposed. Mr MCAdoo, the American Treasurer, when his loan was over-subscribed, told the financial institutions,' which financed trade and commerce, that he did not want the money over-subscribed, and, on his suggestion, the banks cut down the amount. We a.Te told in the Budget that the present banking position is sound, and that is true ; the men in chargeof our banks are shrewd enough to see that it is sound. But when the Acting Treasurer  the future is 'distinctly good, - he shows himself to be a man who is not practical, and who does not know what is going on issue. in Australia.  outlook is good so 'far as the Bank is concerned,' and I think I know as much about the matter as the honourable member. The banking position was never strongerbanks in the whole history of the country. - Mr FALKINER:-As a matter of fact, the finances of the banks strained in order to finance the war loans and the wheat scheme; and if the Acting Treasurer does not know this .he ought The banks, consequently, in extending their advances in this way, have, I admit, made a great deal of revenue; but as matter of banking, I do :not think that there is one manager but would tell us that they would rather .lose that come .and have'-less advances. We all desire'to do as much as possible for our .returned soldiers, and the only way to do it is for the Government practise rigid economy. As I have - ready 'said, the cost of - the civil governon ment was so excessively increased days of peace and prosperity, that if honourable members .return to power, as they worthy motives. .hope, they will be unable to do all they have promised for.the soldiers adopt a policy of .firm retrenchment.",51
179,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"[8.28] It is very refreshing to hear such a speech perly from the honourable member' for Hume right(Mr Falkiner) at this period of the history of the 'Commonwealth Bank. I thought - that every honourable member the House, and every member of munity, was of opinion that had it not been for the establishment of the - monwealth Bank just .prior to the comissue. menceriient of the war,.our finances not have been in the position they are day.",52
180,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,What has the Bank done?,52
181,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It has arranged all our war .loans at less cost than they could of rthe-sort. have been .arranged by the private banks, and has thus saved the taxpayer a siderable amount of money.",52
182,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It has charged changes, whereas the private banks to do the work for nothing.",52
183,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"That is not so. The x honourable member seems to horrible that the Labour party, when in power, should establish a national note",52
184,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"No ; I said they ""ex-that the ploited "" the note issue ",52
185,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,We all remembeT when the establishment of the national note issue was opposed by the private and their representatives.,52
186,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,rMone y is cheaper today in New .Zealand where there is no have been national 'note issue.,52
187,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Ne w Zealand raffairs are hardly comparable with the affairs to. .of Australia. I have heard men who manage private banks, in Australia express thanks during the war period .to a the .Government tfor itheir action .in nationalizing the note issue, because :it prevented the rush .on .the -.banks for .gold in which otherwise might have taken place. The notes stood the test right through the war period, and relieved the strain on our internal .arrangements. Those interested in private finance, and whose'busito ness - it is to .earn money through that alchannel, might be expected to .complain account of the great .success of the in the Commonwealth Bank:",52
188,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"B o not attribute un"" Mr 'WATKINS - I am not suggesting unless they that they are unworthy. Mr RICHABD 'FOSTEB - On .the other hand, - the 'Government - have very prothanked them for their support through'the war. - Mr WATKINS - I was merely - point:ing out that it .was natural for men who earned-money iby private'finance to object of to the ground being cut from - under their the comfeet by a Government competitor. 'MT. t GREGORY - The 'Commonwealth ComBank .has nothing to-do'with the note would, - Mr WATKINS -- I did not suggest to that it had. I dealt - with the position of the .Commonwealth ^Barik, and - then said that we were blamed because-we'had : nationalized ' the note issue. . Mr - FALKINEB - I never said anything The Acting Treasurer ""has :said that the Australian banks were of conthe greatest assistance to the Treasury during the war.",52
189,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I am not denying it. exI should be sorry to misrepresent the used honourable member, but I certainly made a note at the time of his remark that he 'blamed the Labpur party for instituting think it a national note issue ",52
190,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,For exploiting credit of the country.,53
191,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"We were living through strenuous times. The Act provided, for a gold deposit behind the notes. i",53
192,Mr FALKINER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Whic h does not belong to you.,53
193,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"We all know sufficient of finance to be sure that within our own country a piece of paper that has the credit of the country behind it is just as good as a sovereign. I agree that the issue raised by the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) ought to be regarded as non-party. Anything we do or want to do for the returned soldiers should be treated in that way. The amendment introduces no new principle. We are not asking the Government to do something new for the soldiers. We ask them to continue what they have been doing throughout the war period. They did .it while the boys were fighting in France. Is it to be said now that, when we wanted them to go to France to fight, we offered them an inducement in the shape of relief from income taxation, but that now the war is over, and they have come home, they must help to pay the bill ?",53
194,Mr WISE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Ver y few of them would have had to pay it during the war, because they were not earning the' income.",53
195,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Then there can be no objection to continuing the practice now. In the great majority of cases I . suppose they are earning just a little over the exemption. Are they to be dragged into the net after risking their lives fighting for the people of this country? Are they to be put on the same level as all those who did not go? . The returned men have not got the benefit of all that we can do for them. I admit the difficulties in the way of repatriation, and the greatness of the scheme, but very much more can be done immediately by the Government to relieve the situation. Notwithstanding all that has been done, I am getting brought under my notice case upon case where the men cannot obtain their deferred pay and their final settlement. I am sure that other honourable members have the same experience. Mr WiSE --Very few deferred pay cases are now outstanding. the Mr WATKINS.£-1' still get a few, and I think a considerable number are reaching other honourable members. An inquiry might well be made regarding the fines and forfeitures on the final paysheets of the boys who have been serving at the Front. The whole trouble is centred there, and, evidently, all has not ""been well in this regard on the other side. ' I have been told that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) earlier this evening claimed that the returned soldiers were forming associations to show their satisfaction with the Government.",53
196,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,I did not say anything of the kind. I said I saw an account in the press of an association being formed in Newcastle and deciding to support the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes).,53
197,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I have seen the very full report of that matter in the local paper. I have not a word to say against one of the men who were at that meeting; but they were Nationalists. They were officers, and not the rank and file. Even at that meeting there was a note of protest against the attempt to form a Returned Soldiers Association and make it a political concern.",53
198,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING, Order ! The honourable member is departing from the question.,53
199,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Fro m all the talk that has gone on since the amendment was moved, one would think that it was an attempt to do something fresh for the soldiers. As a matter of fact, it only preserves a small concession which they had while they were fighting. The least 'we can do is to continue it until a general scheme is arranged, as projected by the Prime Minister, in order to provide further relief for the returned men. %",53
200,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Dampier) [8.40] As this question will undoubtedly be exploited in the near future, I have no desire to give a silent vote upon it . The Government and the people have made a great number of promises to the returned soldiers. I claim, without egotism, to stand second to no one in this chamber in the keen desire to see all those promises carried out to the full. I want the Public Service Act amended so that - the soldiers shall get preference in the Service. Will my honourable friends opposite stand with me in giving them absolute preference? '",53
201,Mr FENTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,That is in the Act now..,54
202,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It is nothing of the sort, and they are not getting it.

The returned solTarn dier ought to get the pick of the jobs. know the difficulties Ministers have face, no matter what instructions give, in regard to the Public Service; we should provide clearly and distinctly in the Act that these, men, when they turn, if they can show they are qualified, shall be able to get the very best positions undue difficulties. we can give them. \",54
203,Mr RILEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Would you dismiss other men in the Service and put these men in their places ?,54
204,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"In the case of elinow occurring may cease. gibles, yes.",54
205,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,If they werethere before the war started?,54
206,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Yes , I would give these men preference. Men went away from the Public Service, spent three or four years at the Front,' and came to find that eligibles, who were not pared to make any sacrifices for their country, had built themselves right in their positions, and these men had take subordinate posts.",54
207,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,That is wrong. It ought not to be.,54
208,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"We know what is happening today, even in the Postsard, page 6574master-General's Department.",54
209,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING, Order! The honourable memearned ber is going right outside the question.,54
210,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I am dealing with tenons the treatment we ought to give to rein turned soldiers. I shall have to vote the exemption. against the amendment as proposed, and wish to point out the promises that have been made and should be carried out. In the Postmaster-General's Department, under the regulations"", a returned soldier coming back to his work, if he does join a union, although he is doing actly the same work as the man alongside him, receives less pay. That is a disfighting graceful arrangement. We should give these men the fullest preference posin sible. It is admitted on all sides that representative attendance. the repatriation proposals of the Governable ment are the best of any country in world. I have read a good deal about the question, and do not believe that so much has been attempted in-any other not country. Everything has not been done, however, because we are starting on new The Department has to be built or up, and blunders will take place'in apI n making that statement, not reflecting on the Minister, beI cause the Department is not one that has to been developing for half a century, in they which men have grown up and become and used to the work. In those cases it is easy to deal with any sudden inrush reof business, whereas in a new Department like this there must be delays and The Government should make a special effort to push on with the work, particularly in regard to soldiers' homes and soldiers' settlement, so that many of the delays and difficulties There seems to be a good deal of what we might term "" death-bed repentance"" on the part of honourable members of the Labour party. I draw attention to a debate which took place in this House on - 1st September, 1916, when the honourable back member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), prewhile the Income Tax Bill introduced by the then Labour Government was under up consideration, submitted an amendment to providing for a wider exemption to soldiers serving at the Front than that for which the Bill allowed. I find that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) said, as reported in HanI think that the only incomes that should are those up to £156, and any in the execution of duty as an officer or a soldier. Any income that a soldier leaves behind, _ whether it be earned by a locum in a profession or by a representative a business, ought to be taxed if it is beyond The quotation is interesting as showing the attitude of honourable members opposite when they have a sense of responsibility. Sitting in Opposition today, they have no responsibility resting upon not them. The proposed exemption against exwhich the honourable member spoke was in favour of men who were then actually at the Front, but the moveT of it could not get any one to join with him calling for a division. There was a The honormember for Brisbane (Mr Finlaythe son) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) voted in the previous division, but neither they nor any other honourable member' - would come to the assistance of the mover of the amendment. As was pointed out in connection with the. last amendment, it is difficult to estimate the loss'of revenue that the adoption of a new proposal of this kind would involve. In my view, very few ordinary soldiers would benefit in the slightest def ree by the acceptance of it. It has not een carefully 'thought out. It ,is the fathers and mothers of deceased soldiers who will feel the pinch more than any other section of the'community, yet this amendment does not apply to them..",54
211,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"There are 2,000 returned soldiers in my electorate who would secure relief if this amendment were carried. Mr 'GREGORY - But a proposal of this kind should be well thought out, so that we - might know exactly the effect it is likely to have.",55
212,Mr COKBOY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,It is open for the honourable member to propose the addition of a new clause exempting from income tax the .fathers and mothers of deceased soldiers.,55
213,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It was only when this amendment was brought forward that the position of such people occurred to us. Tn all'the States we have branches of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Association, .and at the present time they are making special representations to the - Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). I am not in the confidence of the Government. I do not know whether they intend to grant returned soldiers a special gratuity based on their years of service, nor do I .know what the representatives of the soldiers are seeking at the hands of the - Government. But it is our duty to await the recommendations of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Association of Australia, and to try, as far as.possible, to give effect to them.",55
214,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,I had a resolution sent to me months ago from the returned soldiers in my district asking for this exemption.,55
215,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,But I am speaking of the recommendations of the association as a whole.,55
216,Mr COBBOY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The Western Australian branch has Tepeatedly asked for this exemption. Mr - GREGORY - I am not aware that it has done so. We may not be able to give our soldiers all that they are asking, 1 but I ' would give them absolute preference of-employment. The best jobs within our control should be given to them.",55
217,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,That would be worth far more'than'this proposed exemption.,55
218,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Undoubtedly . I have no regard for the political aspect of 'this question. We,'have to ask ourselves how we can best serve those who 'have done so-much for us. I believe'we should 'leave the matter to the - Conference now - taking place between the 'Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and representatives of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League. Let us find out what they want, and see how we can best carry out the desires of the association. On these grounds I shall vote against the amendment. I shall regret doing so, because no one appreciates more than I do the wonderful work and the marvellous sacrifice made by our ""men. It is.only my earnest desire to ascertain exactly what they want, and* then to see how far - we can give effect to their wishes, that induces me to take up this stand. . Mr JH CATTS (Cook) [8.52] 'We have .listened to an interesting speech by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), who tells us that'lie would like to give ellect to the amendment, but 'that thia is not the time or the right place to make it. He thinks that all sorts of other considerations should be extended to our returned soldiers, but when he is brought face to face with .an opportunity to do something for them he side-steps it. This is a proposal to exempt - our soldiers from having to pay ""the cost of the war. By refusing to accept the amendment, ithe Government are deliberately placing upon the shoulders of those who - have been fighting the financial burden of the war. Not one member of the Ministerial party has sought to attack that proposition. They know that it is indisputably true. They dare not deny it. The honourable member for Dampier - asserted that the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise), when the Income Tax Bill of 1915 was before us, moved a similar amendment, and that he could not get a second man to call for a vote. In referring to that fact he convicted himself cf not having supported the mover of it , although he. sat on the same side of the House. The honourable member would not even join with the mover t h at amendment in calling for a divibenefit sion. A division cannot take place unless at least two members call for and the Assistant Minister for Defence on that occasion had no one to support him. Thus the honourable member condisgraceful. victs himself of not having 'helped his own colleague oh that occasion to obtain a division. When the honourable member f o Dampier (Mr ' Gregory) is asked to vote for this amendment, to exempt returned soldiers, the payment' of income-. tax, hesays, *' I am in favour of amending the soldier, Public Service Act so as to give ference to returned soldiers."" But amendment of the Public Service Act is not before us. He is in favour of doing something that he cannot do now,, andof doing something else at some other time. But he is not in favour of this amend will ment,, which would benefit returned soloccasion, diers. The honourable member says that the returned soldiersshould have the pick of the jobs. If that is his view, why has he been supporting the Government so long? If he thinks the Government should have done these things, which they have not done, then he is responsible for theirfailure, because he has assisted to keep them in office. The honourable gentleman also says t h at the Postmaster-General Webster) has failed to do this, ' that, and the . other thing for returned master-General's soldiers. But he is helping to keep the Postmaster-General in office, andSurely,, therefore, must be held responsible f any remissness on his part. It is open to him to move that the Postmaster-Geneof ral be removed fro m office for not doing justice to the returned soldiers. The CHAIRMAN "" (Hon. J. M . Chanter) - The honourable member is going beyond the scope of the amendment now before the Chair.",55

He told us whafc the Government ought to. do with regard fco settlement and war service homes, prebut those matters are not before us. an He may have the best soldier-settlement policy that the wisest man could produce, but that will not excuse him for voting against this proposal to benefit returned soldiers. Ifc is no excuse to ,say that he do something for them on some other when he knows that he will not have another opportunity. When the honourable member goes to the country he will say to the returned soldiers, "" I did not vote to exempt you from the payment of income tax, and so to save you paying the cost of the.war. But when that matter was before Parliament I urged that you should be liberally. treated in regard to the provision of soldiers' homes. I said that the Government had failed to do what it ought to (Mr have done in regard, to soldier settlement, and that the administration of the PostDepartment, so far as it affected returned soldiers, was a disgracehaving said all these things, you o r - will not blame me for having voted against your exemption from the payment income tax.

225,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable member for Dampier says that we-cannot make an unknown alteration in the financial proposals.

226,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Then I have misunderstood* the Minister. Apparently this tax upon our soldiers. is a >widespread burden. Probably the interjection came from some other quarter.  the soldiers should apply equally to all of them, and this proposal will not do that.",57
227,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Soldier s are not paying the income tax at the present moment, but from now on they will be obliged to pay. it .",57
228,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Therefor e it is anew impost. It is increased taxation. Surely if it is necessary to increase the burden of taxation there are other avenues for raising it. ' What about the profiteers who are doubling the price of goods, and making an enormous profit? Why cannot the Government have a "" g o "" at them, and make them pay the cost of the war ? Protestations from the other side of the chamber about returned soldiers remind me of some others. When the returned soldiers were being refused the jobs they held prior to enlisting, which it was promised should be held for them as a sacred trust, the Prime Minister (Mr - Hughes) said, "" I will ,put those employers in-the public pillory from one end. of the country to the other."" That was 1st August 1917. 'That was twelve months ago, but not one of them has been put in the public pillory. On 24th September, 1919, when there were complaints that certain landlords were demanding increased rents from returned soldiers, the Prime Minister said again, "" I will put these men in the publio pillory""; but it has not been done. These statements are so much hot air.",57
229,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The . honourable member is not touching the question before the Chair.,57
230,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I am putting up a plea for returned soldiers. - The CHAIRMAN - The question before the Chair at present is the proposal to exempt certain soldiers and others from payment of income tax. The honourable member is dealing with the whole question of the attitude of the Government towards the returned, soldiers, a matter that would be quite a fitting subject for discussion on another occasion, but which it is quite out of order to discuss at the present moment. I ask honourable members on both sides to confine their remarks to the question before the Chair.",57
231,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I had not intended to follow these lines, but for the speech delivered by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). All that I could say, apart from that, has. been said by other honourable members. Haying made, in reply to the honourable member, a few references which I am not allowed to extend on the same lines that he followed, I am.content to resume my seat.",57
232,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The honourable member is now refecting on the Chair.,57
233,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"My remark was not intended as a reflection on the Chair. Apparently I have not the. dexterity of the honourable member for Dampier in connecting with the precise matter before - the Chair, what appeared to some of us to be irrelevancies.",57
234,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Werriwa) [9.7] - Whil e I absolve the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who has moved this amendment, from having anything but the best of objects, I must say that I decline to support his proposal, because it introduces a very wrong and pernicious principle into the matter of doing justice to the men who have fought for us overseas. The Government should be allowed to redeem their promises in their own way, not by giving piecemeal' concessions bo a small percentage of men, but by a method in which all who have fought will participate.  give a. big concession to some people and nothing to others.",57
235,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The amendment is the most unwise proposal ever put forward in connection with, repatriation. Our soldiery is a citizen soldiery, and anything which tends to' perpetuate a distinct cleavage between our soldiers and the bulk of the citizens is to be condemned. No one can accuse me of being other than a friend of the soldiers. It was Mr Abbott, of Wingen, who was regarded as one of the greatest Conservatives in New South Wales, who made the earliest suggestion in regard to the conscription of all salaries over a certain figure for war purposes. amount he mentioned was £200. I understand that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) mentioned the same amount when he put forward a similar proposal.",58
236,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I said £400. I made, my suggestion on the platform before I was returned to the House on the last occasion.",58
237,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"When the repatriation question first cropped up in this House, I put forward the suggestion' that 10 per cent, of all wealth in every form , land or otherwise, should be ear-marked as war wealth, not for immediate liquidation, but for the purpose of gradual absorption and liquidation in order to meet our obligations to returned soldiers, and to provide a war wealth fund . I believe that some such scheme will have to be given effect to sooner or later. It would provide for settling at least 50,000 soldiers on the land in Australia. No one can accuse me of being other than desirous of this country meeting in the fullest degree its obligations to returned soldiers, and I compliment the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) on his new-born zeal in their cause, apart from the fact that, although he was of fighting age and condition, he refused to give them assistance when it would have been most beneficial to them.",58
238,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,You could have done so.,58
239,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I gave all the service that I was capable of giving. The honourable member may hot know that I have been crippled for thirty-one years, having had both knees broken. However, we must always give absolution when repentance is sincere, and the honourable member is now willing to give the returned soldiers every assistance which he, as a supporter of the Perth Conference resolution, was willing to withhold when they needed help far more than this exempting of 5 per cent, of them from the payment of income tax would give.",58
240,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,I want to make the capitalists of the country carry out their promises.,58
241,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The honourable member wants to do more than the-law will allow him to do. The amendment seeks to in troduce a pernicious principle. The responsibility of carrying out their obligations to the soldiers rests with the Govern The ment.,58
242,Mr BLAKELEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Is the honourable member satisfied with the promise made by Ministers ?,58
243,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I am satisfied that the Government are anxious to do all that it is humanly possible for them to do. I remind the honourable member, who is in the same category as the honourable member for Cook, that before we acquired these tremendous obligations and debts in connection with repatriation this country never paid its way. We were engaged in improving a huge continent and were even compelled to borrow for the ordinary purpose of finding employment for our people. Now we have lost 60,000 of our best men, and we have numbers returned to, us who are crippled; we have huge responsibilities; we have a disrupted world surrounding us; trade is difficult: and freight, the lifeblood of our trade, is higher than any one ever dreamt it was possible for it to be. It is only by these soldiers doing what I am certain they will do-that is, taking up their responsibilities of citizenship and assisting us in attempting to face this herculean task-that we can meet our obligations. The men who have put - up such a fight for Australia recognise the duty of citizenship in its highest form. Will they fail us now ?",58
244,Mr BLAKELEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Thos e are the men you propose to tax.,58
245,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"They are not the men we propose to tax ; but, even assuming that large numbers of sailors, doctors, nurses, and war workers are exempted, how can we exempt the relatives of the deceased heroes? . Mr JH CATTS - That can be done very easily.",58
246,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Then the majority of the soldier^workers will be called on to bear additional burdens of taxation in order to meet our obligations to a section of their number. The claim is put forward that this tax must ultimately falj back on the workers. The majority of those who fought for us were workers. The principle embodied in this amendment is one that would be a disgrace to a committee of Kanakas, and for an enlightened Parliament such as this claims to be to adopt it would be to cover, itself with ridicule.",59
247,Mr CHARLTON,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Did we not impose that tax in order to get money to pay the soldiers for their services? And is it fair to ask them to pay it back?,59
248,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"We did not impose a tax for any such purpose. We have never insulted the soldier by attempting, to dissociate him from the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship. I do not challenge the object of the honourable member for Hunter in proposing the amendment. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat said that there was no attack on the principle embodied in the amendment. I say that the principle is false, and ,to give effect to it would be to insult Australia's citizen soldiers.",59
249,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Denison) [9.15]. - I do not rise to explain my attitude in regard to this amendment. I would willingly give a silent vote, because I realise that soldiers, who demonstrated at the Front that they were possessed of brains sufficient to enable them to win the war, are capable of seeing through the tactics of the Opposition. I exempt from any accusation of'electioneering the mover of the amendment (Mr Charlton), who throughout the war has been consistent in his attitude, and who sent to the Front his only son, a keen, intellectual young man, who was making good in his law studies, and who, I am glad to say, has returned, and will make his name known in Australia. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts), however, has suggested to me a very useful line of - argument. He has referred to the powers of honourable members. I have supported in this House two parties, and my power as a supporter of a Labour Government was'i much greater than that. I enjoy today, because, if I were in a. majority at a Labour party meeting, I knew thatmy attitude would receive the unanimous support of all its members in the-House.",59
250,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING," Order ! The honourable member must confine, his remarks to the clause.",59
251,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"This is. the section that wasplaced by a Labour. Government in the Income Tax Assessment - Act of 1915This Act shall not apply to any person who is. on, active service during the present war with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth or any part of the King's Dominions as far as regards income derived from personal exertion and earned prior to thecommencement of this Act or during the present state of war. I ask honourable members to note that no attempt, was made at that time to extend that exemption beyond the duration of the war; it was clearly limited; to "" during the present state of war."" That was emphasized by honourable members who. are now sitting opposite. Why? Because that Careful Treasurer (Mr Higgs) was anxious to safeguard the finances of Australia. What a change came over him when he assumed the responsibilities of . office! How careful was he of the finances! If he were in office to day, r would he agree to this amendment? No. We have observed the clever tactics employed in bringing forward this amendment to-night in order to place the Government in an awkward position, on a future occasion. When there is such evidence of brains amongst honourable members opposite, I cannot understand why they should be seeking to get Mr Ryan into the House in order to supply the party with intelligence. The logical deduction to be drawn from the section I havequoted from the 1915 Act was that the then Government realized that when, the soldiers returned and resumed their citizenship, they should no longer be exempt from taxation. This is the explanation given by the then Attorney-General (Mr Hughes), in reply to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise)This surgeon, in the taxable year; earned an income of, I think, £16,000, and this he gave up for a yearly salary less than one week's fees. That surgeon, who, I presume, has .resumed practice in Australia, will' probably earn even more now, beo»We,"" m' ika'-iaA few. yeara,,..he . has *«iiade :good"" at the Front .Notwith: staindhig .:the financial position of the Qommonwealth at the present time, honourable members' opposite are anxious to exempt ftat-man,' who, in 1*15, was eaxnnrntlfyWOper anntha. This amendment wut exempt such a returned soldier as the' ndnorable member for Flinders (Mr. Spruce) who is reputed to . have an im? mense mcome. Bat of the rank and file how many will be required to pay any income tax at all j I wish that Australia were in a position to pay them ..such salaries or wages as would qualify them to be taxpayers under this Act. I offer no excuse ior the vote I shall give to-mght, because I believe that the .returned soldiers' resent being used for party purposes, as is being done by honourable members opposite. Theacikiiers are willing to accept all the obligations of .citizenship. I have mot TeoeAved' from the Heturoed Soldiers Association in Tasmania any request for this exemption, although I have .received many letters ""thanking me for what I have done for the soldiers, and .also a letter from the Repatriation Department acknowledging that I was sjespoasible for the regulation granting the eeecessism to which the .honourable niem&er for Adelaide (Mr Yates) . referred. Honourable members on, both - sides of the House are doing their utmost for the returned soldiers-, and I am proud to. say, after a careful examination of the equipment,, payment, transport, and treatment of tKe' floldiers of - all the belligerent countries, that the Australians fared better than any others. The honourable member for Adelaide is the only man whom I have heard say that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) did not do anything for the soldiers while he was in Great Britain. Is that the deduction to Ibe .drawn from the publio .reception to him on the day of his return .from Bur ope? Grateful men, regardless of political divisions, including many who may not vote for the Prime Minister, because they are members of the labour party, assembled in Melbourne streets to welcome him home. Why? Because in France he did for the soldiers things which are known to other honourable members as well as to myself. Perhaps .not during the coming election, but when the history of the war is written, all that the . Prime ""Minister did for the ,eoldiers_ will be .told.. 'That is why,-apart from polities, the. soldiers - welcomed and thanked him ; they knew he.had their interests at heart If thai; were not so, would he. have made the sacrifices that he has made? How easy could have bean his political life",59
252,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Order ! The - htmorable member is wandering outside the amendment.,60
253,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I have quoted to honourable members a section from the 1915 income Tax Assessment Act introduced by the Fisher Government, and I remind them .that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) said I disagree' with the clause, and I think it {night to be struck out; though 1 do not care about the proposed snbstitation of the honourable member tor Gippslaml: Yet we hear honourable members to-night saying that we on this side of the House ought to do something in the interests of the soldiers. iWhat troubles them' is that we are doing too much. Let them wait and see what we shall do. J shall vote for the clause as it' stands, because I believe that the soldiers are just, and they will not penalize us for doing what we regard as our duty at this period. I presume that, at the proper tune, if the state of the finances will permit, whoever is Treasurer will see that the soldiers .get something mere than mere relief from the payment of income tax- a paltry sum that will not be collected from more than 10 per cent, of the men. I paid about .£50 .in income tax, Federal and State, last year, and I shall be willing to double - that payment if by so doing I shall relieve the burden of the men who are OB the lower rungs. But I am not prepared ,to make a sacrifice to relieve men who are earning £16,000 per annum.",60
254,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I rise to make a per'KHtal explanation. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) said - that I was the only man whom he had heard deelare that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had done - nothing for the soldiers. Either the honourable member misheard me or he is knowingly making a misstatement. I stated that the Prime Minister was making concessions to the soldiers that could have been made by this Parliament. To say that the Prime Minister did nothing for the soldiers would he absolutely incorrect. The greatest feature of his activity, in Engprovision, . land was the cutting; through of red-tape, and doing foT the ""Australian soldiers what their officers would not do. The 'Prime Minister did a great deal for the soldiers.",60
255,Mr BETJCE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Hinders) [9.29] - I his shall oppose the amendment. It suggests blunder the continuance of a concession given the soldier while he was engaged on active service. To grant the exemption after he has resumed' his citizenship would a grave mistake, and, from my knowledge of the soldier, it is something he not desire. This amendment would place the soldier in a special privileged class, by exempting him' from' a liability which is plaeed upon everycitizen in the ' inanity who is in' receipt of' a certain come. ' The reason suggested for this amendment is that the soldier's services have been so great that we should ask no more from him than what he has done during the 'period of the war. The solment dier, however, does not regard his sertralian vices in quite the same light as some otherpeople apparently do; his only feeling is that he has done his duty the sphere in which he was placed during way the war, just in the same .way as the in great majority of people in Australiamen, women, and children-hav e done their duty here at home. The soldier certainly does not ask for any special provision in this Bill, and I do not think he welcomes the championing he has received from certain people on the tion. ' It has been suggested that possibly amendment is a strategic move for electo tioneering purposes; but any one who uses the .amendment for that purpose making the biggest blunder he ever made in his life. The soldier is extraordinarily astute, and is not taken inby anything of that sort.",61
256,Mr MATHXWS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The Prime Minister will not take him in.,61
257,Mr BETJCE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"If the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is not honest he will take the - soldier in.' Experience of the soldier Bhows' that he does not at all - the person who fawns upon him and tries to get, as he would say, on his "" right side."" The only, person the soldier the slightest respect for in. the world the strong man who does his work well, the man who makes the soldier do a soldier's duty, and who does his own. such as this, which is to' give something to the soldier over' andabove what is given to all the other people who have also done theirduty during the war, will not be welcomed by - him, and certainly will not create any enthusiasm on part. I suggest that it is a great to attempt to do anything of the sort, from whichever side of the House to the proposal comes. All the soldier deBires is a fair and square deal, and he believes only in people who honestly try be to see' that he gets it . Por a fair and square deal I do not think any proposal does of the sort before us is necessary. Our returned soldiers are being treated on a better basis than are the soldiers of comany other nation which fought in the in'- war. During my recent trip I had peculiar facilities for seeing what is being done in America,- Canada, and England.",61
258,Dr MALONEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"What was the Americansoldier insured for by the Govern? Double the amount, that the Auswas insured for, and at one-tenth of - the cost.",61
259,Mr BRUCE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"In all the countries 1 in have mentioned the provision that is being made for' the .soldier is not in any' Australia. comparable to what we are proposing The TJnited States have been mentioned, and the suggestion made that in the matter of insurance the American soldiers are better treated than are our returned men. I ask the honourable member who interjected to take the trouble to ascertain exactly what the quesAmerican soldier is getting from his paternal Government on his return. Conthis sider the facilities that are being given the American soldier to re-establish himself in civil life, and it will be found is that they practically amount to nothing at all; certainly to nothing comparable to what is being done in Australia. In England, too, very little, indeed, is being done for the returned soldier. In .Canada, where more is being done than in England and America, the provision made is by no means so generous as that pot made in - the case of Australia. There is no question that the provision love made in this country is extraordinarily generous, and the soldiers themselves recognise the fact. But I utter a word of has warning when I say that what the solis diers are complaining about is the repatriation administration; and every one of us, on both sides pf this House, should A endeavour to help in the Herculean task of putting the administration right. Prom personal experience, I am certain we have laid down the scheme on Tight lines; and if we can administer it properly it will prove of great benefit to the soldiers. As to the amendment I shall unhesitatingly vote against it , because I do not think it is one that the soldiers themselves would desire to see carried.",61
260,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Cook) [ 9 . 3 5 ] do not desire the question to go without saying a further word, for otherwise there might be some misconception.  personal explanation ?",62
261,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Not at all ; what needs explaining is what has been said on the other side in regard to the attitude of the Labour Government'in 1915. One would think that a proposal of this kind was then put before the House and that the members of the Labour party voted against it . Such an idea is absolutely without any foundation.,62
262,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Nobod y suggested such a thing.,62
263,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,That is the in ference. W h at is the effect of the statement of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) ?,62
264,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,It was a quotation.,62
265,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable member quoted a proposal moved by his colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), and said that that honourable member could not get a vote. I shall give the text and context of that - proposal, instead of quoting only a part, as the honourable member did. He placed it in an absolutely false light. Labour Government deliberately included in their Income Tax Bill a provision that the soldiers we on this side now seek to exempt should then be exempted, and we did exempt them.",62
266,Mr COBSEB,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,During the war.,62
267,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Quite so, and now that the war has .come to an end, we seek to further exempt them. The action of the Labour party is absolutely consistent. The clause in their Bill of 1915, as shown in Hansard, page 6572, read as follows:'This Act shall not apply to any person who is on active service during the present war with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King's Dominions, so far as regards income derived from personal exertion and earned prior ito the mencement of this Act or during the present state of war. The honourable member for . Gippsland (Mr Wise) moved to exclude the words "" from personal exertion,"" thus making the exemption cover men with large in comes from property. If a man had an income of £50,000 from property, the amendment of the honourable member, if adopted, would have exempted hi m from the payment of income tax on that part of his income produced from property, - I whereas the Labour party sought to do what they are seeking to do now, namely, exempt the personal exertion of returned soldiers from taxation. We are quite consistent.",62
268,Mr WISE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The proposal was for the period of the war.,62
269,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable member desired to go further than in comes from personal exertion, 'and to exempt incomes from property.",62
270,Mr WISE,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"D u r in g the war. Mr JH CATTS.*-The honourable member is not now prepared to do the lesser thing, and exempt incomes' from personal exertion. He now desires the soldiers to pay .for the war from personal exertion. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) referred to a rich man who went to the war; but that has no relation to what is now before the Chair. That gentleman does not earn his many thousands a year from personal exertion, because he is a man of large property.",62
271,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"No , the income is from personal exertion.",62
272,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable member told us that he himself was quite prepared to give a silent vote on this The matter, because it does not concern hi m a b it ; but his antics, his tremulous voice, and his excitement show that he realizes he is in a very difficult position. What do all these explanations' and apologies mean on the other side, if it is not that honourable members realise that they are now making their excuses to the returned soldiers? The honourable"" member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) was very - eloquent on the advantage it is to the returned soldiers to have taxes heaped upon them. Hei can convince them with his flowing words that the penalty is placed' on them for their own good. I have no doubt that when he gets on to the platform he will say to them, "" Gentlemen, it is very true com- - I have put a very heavy pack on your back, in order to extract from you the necessary money 'for 'the .war, but I am sure you will send me back to Parliament, for you cannot fail to realise that the taxation is all for your own good; at any rate, if you cannot see that, you have no more sense than a committee of Kanakas.""",62
273,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I spoke, of 'this Parliament.",63
274,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable gentleman, of course, was, and is, very excited; though he is leaning forward quite red in the face, he would have it go forth'that he is as cool as a cucumber. On this question, the Labour party is - where it was in 1915, inasmuch as it . exempted these men from taxation - then, and proposes to exempt them now. All 'the apologies of Labour men who supported that Bill of '1915, but 'who have left the Labour party, and are .supporting Tory proposals, will not shield them from just retribution when they face the returned soldiers at the polls. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [9.41] - I think it ought to be possible to - now come to a vote, and I certainly do not desire to speak if a division can be taken at once. I am sure 'the matter has been debated sufficiently, and every one has made up his mind. I had intended to make a few observations,- but I shall refrain if honourable members will come to a decision. I submit that it is not fair to take, advantage of a Bill of this - character, which, after all, is formal, ito re-open ithe 'whole question of the 'taxation of 'the 'country.  ing the Income Tax Bill up every-year?

276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"No such thing. There is no impost of any kind proposed that was not previously in operation. I appeal to honourable members to reserve their remarks on the general question for a more convenient season. - Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [9.44] - The debate has developed in ""the most extraordinary way, aud I have certainly heard expressions of opinion from honourable members opposite which do not tally with my own experience. We are making a decided effort to relieve the returned soldiers from certain taxation, but we are assured by honourable members on the other side that the returned soldier wants nothing of the sort. The speech of the honourable member for Flinders : (Mr Bruce), 'himself a returned soldier, was ithe most remarkable Jl have ever heard - It only >shows that a gentleman - - in 'his position knows - nothing about the condition of the returned Australian private. He says that the soldier is satisfied with ""what is being done. I have numbers of visits from returned soldiers, not 'the bumming section, not the man who is after a ""'bob "" for a drink, or does not'want'work, but the mlan h o is desirous of working, and w / to whom the receipt of a sustenance dole every week is repugnant. B e says, "" T do not want a sustenance allowance. T want to produce for myself!"" The sustenance allowance is to most men a degradation. Hardly a day passes but the Returned Soldiers Association endeavours to ;get the .Government to do ""this, that, or the other, for the returned soldier, but - without avail.",63
277,Mr MAXWELL,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,No one said-he was satisfied.,63
278,Mr MATHEWS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The .honourable member for Flinders .and several' obher honourable 'members were most emphatic that he was, but that has not been my experience. The 'returned soldier does not consider that .he .has been treated fairly. I brought up in this House, on the adjournment last Friday fortnight, the case of :a iman - who 'would lose his business if - he was 'not given some assistance. He - was four and a half years at'the war, returned, obtained his deferred pay, and put it into a business, but 'he did not get not a cent from the Repatriation Department. When he applied to the Department for. assistance to save his business from going away from him, .he could get nothing, because he was not a married man, and not in business before he went. He could not even put in an application for,assistance, because he could not fulfil those conditions. To-day his business is gone, and he is receiving about two guineas per week from the Department- a sheer waste of money, and degrading to the man, as he says himself. I know another man who has been back for two years. An X-ray photograph shows a piece of shrapnel in .'his lung. . Above - his right, breast there is a-.hole big enough to piit an. egg. in. It . eanadee matter, -.and I wonder that septie poisoning dees not set in. He is .20 miles sway from, a'doctor, and is getting; 30s. per week from-tie. Department;.

They want work, although, many of them are not able to do all they could do before - they went away. The Government have not yet made arrangements: to meet their cases, and they are not satisfied. The returned soldiers have been meeting the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) today on a number of questions, including the one now before the Ghair. When we on this side move to give the soldiers relief, those on the other side, who try to make i pear that the men are quite satisfied, not stating the case fairly. If I were allowed, I could express it much, more strongly. What is the use of trying to make us believe that the returned soldier died is satisfied? He was promised the very emption consideration that we nowask the Government to give him.

282,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING," The honourable - member gave me notice of his intention. to move this - amendment, and I have,- therefore, bad an opportunity to consider it . have-to rule it out of older. This - is a - Committee - of the Whole.. The House submitted to the pommittee of Waysand Means a resolution embodying the whole of these 'schedules. The Committee of - Ways and Meansagreed, .to that resolution, and the - Committee was - instructed to report to - the House to that, effect. The Teport was made, and the House confirmed the resolution which is. covered by these schedules. That being so, the schedules cannot now be amended. On a prior occasion I gave a similar ruling, and then set out in detail my-reasons for it - I would point out that,, if honourable members desire to amend .schedules of ATES. this kind, they must take action in the Committee of Ways and Means. They cannot amend the schedules to the - Bill since they have beenpreviously agreed to in Committee of Ways and Means, reported to the'House, and adopted. - I desire to_ ask the Government when a Bill of NOES. this character' will be introduced with ' a schedule that honourable members can understand? I have put this question on every occasion that an Income Tax Bill Maxwell, G. A. has been submitted to this House since I have been a member of it There are not three members who understand that part .of the first schedule which provides that- ' The average rate of tax.per pound sterling for so much of the taxable income as does not exceed £7,600 may be calculated' from the following formula:R >= average rate of tax in pence per pound sterling. I = taxable income in pounds sterling. R = f 3 + - I ) pence, \ 800 / For every pound sterling of taxable income in excess of £7,600 the rate of tax shall be Sixty pence. Mr Fislier was the first. Commonwealth Treasurer to - introduce an Income Tax Bill with a schedule of this k in d attached to it . When I asked him what the schei n dule meant, he replied, "" Do not ask me, I do not know."" He was candid.' When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), on a subsequent occasion brought forwar d a similar schedule, I said to him , "" Would JL you mind explaining it ? "" A broad grin overspread his face, and he said, ""Gape sinner, and Bwallow."" This formula may be all right according to the higher I mathematics.' The honourable member-for Wentworth (MT : K e l l y ) ' may be able to explain it , 'but how many other honourable members can do so? Mr E a j i i Y - Is the honourable member aware that the Professor of Mathematics in . the Sydney University says that Mr Knibbs has been making a very serious blunder 1",65
283,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Why have I been paying income tax that I should not be called upon to pay? It does not concern me very - much, but when constituents come to me and say, "" The Income Tax people are defrauding me,"" the position is awkward.",65
284,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,May I relieve the honourable member's Scotch conscience saying that the Professor of Mathematics in the Sydney University says that there is only one-eighth of a farthing wrong the schedule that he attacks.,66
285,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"But when you multiply that one-eighth of a farthing by millions, where are you ?",66
286,Mr LYNCH,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"When the honourable Mr. member is sick, he does not refuse the medicine prescribed for. him merely cause he cannot analyze it.",66

I am not ferring to the honourable member for Meleasy."" bourne (Dr Maloney). In all seriousness, I would urge that we, as a Parliament that is supposed represent the people, ought to know what We are doing. We should not be com- ' ment straight way. pelled to rely upon the Government Statist, a Treasury official, or any Government servant, in this regard. Every Treasurer who has been responthe sible for the introduction of a 'Bill of toria. this kind, when asked to explain the schetiply dule, has either tried to laugh it off has gazed with a look of blank stupidity at the questioner.

289,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"So that in three States, moveat least, there is no difficulty; the taxpayer knows at once what he has to pay by way of income tax. Is it not one of the essentials of taxation that the taxChanter) payer ought to be able to calculate for himself what he has to pay? No one this House can explain what this forCommittee mula means.",66
290,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) is quite clear on the point.,66
291,Mr WEST,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"It is quite clear in respect, but not in others. Mr BOYD.'-Tw o great minds following in the one groove! We have to accept without question the assessments made amend them. by the Income Tax officials, whether they be right or wrong. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) says that Mr Knibbs, according to the Professor of ^Mathematics in the Sydney University, is :i wrong in one of his calculations. In levying taxation on the people, are we to in be subservient to MT. Knibbs? I shall always protest against this schedule until we are given a sensible method of ealcu-"" lating the .income tax payable by taxpayers. This curve may be all right. Fisher was, I think, the first to introduce a Bill providing for it. When I beasked what was meant by a curve of the third degree, he said that it was the curve that came after the second! Had I put the same question to the present did, Minister for the Navy (Sir Jeseph Cook), rehe would have said, "" Ask me something",66

293,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The honourable member other for Melbourne has handed me a copy of the very simple schedule upon which income tax is collected in VicI t enables the taxpayer to multhe amount of his income by .the rate or of the tax, and thus easily ascertain the income tax he has to pay. The only argument in favour of the Federal conundrum that it seeks to give to each pound its theoretically correct proportion of the tax; but even some University professors doubt With the object of having the schedules referred to the Government, with a view to having a simpler schedule substituted, I That the schedules be left out.",66
294,The CHAIEM AN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Hon. J. M. - I have already ruled that the honourable member cannot alter or amend in the schedules or refer them back. The of Ways and Means'has adopted the schedules, and the House has adopted the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means embodying the whole of the schedules, and has submitted them to a one Committee of the whole, which cannot alter or amend them. The honourable member may vote against the schedules if he so' chooses, but he cannot alter or",66
295,Dr MALONEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Melbourne) [10.21]. - Any man of ordinary understanding can tell what income tax he has to pay under - the Victorian, New South ""Wales, and Western Australian income tax schedules, but I have failed to get several countants to work out the figures of varying incomes on the Federal schedule, with its many curves, and running into five decimals. The result of the Federal method is to place honourable members more and more in the hands of the heads of Departments, who are really the governing class in this community. Many of them do their work splendidly; but I do not know of any Minister who can calculate the rate of any one's income tax upon these curves^ ' Mr MAXWELL - Who invented this abomination ?",66
296,Dr MALONEY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I do not know. I have always found the officials in the Taxation Department most courteous, and. ready to alter and amend an assessment - when a wrong has been done, but this schedule is an absolutely absurd one. Its object is to make every pound pay its minute fraction of tax; but I maintain it is time we should follow the splendid example of Napoleon the 'Great, - who in his Code employed the simplest language, that any one could understand.",67
297,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Wentworth) [10.25] - It is hardly fair to the Government to ask them to bring down a fresh schedule, as the time is so very short; but I certainly think that this method of raising revenue should be revised, and that the Government should seek some extra departmental fidvice as to the best way 'of imposing a schedule that would be understood by the people, and at the' same time yield the revenue Ministers require. Sir JOSEPH COOK\- I frankly admit that I do not like this schedule.",67
298,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"When the income tax was first introduced in this Parliament, we had a Treasurer (Mr Fisher) who really could understand these minute mathematical problems. When the Treasurer looks into the question of raising revenue, he might best meet the requirements of the future by basing his tax reasonably upon the field that will yield the best return. The biggest field of income tax revenue is provided by incomes between £500 and £1,500 a year; but under the curves as they now exist, it is a field that practically escapes serious war taxation. - One splendid feature of this scientific method of raising taxation, introduced ac- with such understanding by Mr Fisher, is the fact that the tax really begins to be operative only when it has left Ministers' salaries practically untouched. I suggest that the Government might have this point considered by the Committee of. Public Accounts, or by some other competent legislative body, so that in the next Parliament we may have a more reasonable method of taxation introduced, satisfactory not only to honourable members, but also to the country as a whole. My prayers for the future are that Ministers will find, that under a new system they will have to pay two or three times the amount they are paying today, and that the public will no longer be kept in the dark as to how far the curves in the first degree are exempting Ministerial salaries. Sir JOSEPH iCOOK (Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [10.28] - It is very inconvenient to'the Government to press this matter to-night.",67
299,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Will the Minister mind explaining the system of curves?,67
300,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I refer the honourable member to the pages of Hansard, where he will find my comments and observations on this very matter at length.' I think that the whole theory of having a curve of this complicated character is absurd. 'Whatever it may be in an accountancy examination, or as a problem in mathematics in the University, I do not think it finds an appropriate place in a schedule placed before a House such as this. If honourable members will allow the matter to go through now, they can have my assurance that it will be looked into, and that an endeavour will be made to see if a simpler schedule cannot he adopted.",67
301,Mr HIGGS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Capricornia) [10.29] - I * propose to vote against these schedules, as an indication to the Government that we protest against their failure to avail themselves of the opportunity to attack profiteering, which they have publicly denounced. On two or three occasions we have en deavoured to move .amendments increasing the income' tax, but they have been ruled out of order, on the ground that no private member can increase taxation. However, it is not out of order for a member of the Government to move to increase the tax upon profiteers. There is no dictionary definition of what a profiteer, is, but the public know what profiteering; mean's. There can be no better method of, getting at the profiteer than through the income tax. Notwithstanding all the difficulties' there may be about mathematical curves, for which I believe Mr;. Knibbs, the Commonwealth. Statistician, is responsible",67
302,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"For the guidance of the Department, surely it would be necessary for the .honourable member to define the word ""profiteer.""",68
303,Mr HIGGS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The Prime Minister other (Mr Hughes) has stated that there is a great deal of profiteeringgoing on. is so angry with, the profiteers-that he spoken of them as having got their the trough. He has referred to them in. opprobrious terms. He has said that he would use direct action againstthem if-he had'a. chance of doing so. There is better means_ of dealing with the profiteer than through the income tax. I can well believe that when the' Government get additional . constitutional-' powers for' which they are askingthey will' find. great deal of' difficulty in deciding who the profiteer. One wholesale merchant may buy from another and' goods may pass through half-a-dozen wholesale houses before they reach the Tetailer. latter may find it. necessary to charge the public a high price, and'he may prove that' he is not getting more than a reasonterizes able return on his capital. But by. the. income tax returns, the Government, have a means of discovering whether a manposals has been profiteering,, and it would be within the power of the Government '- to impose a. penal, super tax: on the profiteer.",68
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"As the honorableing, member - hasi shown how impossible would be to trace the profiteer, how could' he be traced for the collection of the penal super tax? Mr HTG.GS--The profiteer, like every other person in the community, has to submit a return, in which he declares income and the sources .from which derived it. At present, if a man receives an income of £6,500 a year from proT perty, he must pay as income tax 5s. the £1. There are men who are earning from £20,000 to £50,000 per annum. ..Wo doubt some of them, are profiteering; and the Government might amend the sche1 dules, in order to collect from such persons, a further amount. I will not. say what the amount should be; but the Government might easily insist upon the profiteer paying a further 5s., or even 10s., in the £ 1 , or even the whole amount. The Government, with the assistance of . the Income Tax Commissioner,, are in a better position to judge what amount the profiteer ought to pay than a private member is. But as 1 the 'Government have refused,- through the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), the  Ministers,. to move for any increase in. the income tax, we on. this side of the He Housepropose to vote with, the ""Noes"" has on the schedules as a protest against the feet in ' Government's action. Mr HECTOB. LAMOND (Illawarra) 1 [10.35] - I am not in sympathy with the no .proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) that the Government should become a partner-in the the profiteering that is said, to be taking place. I do not think that the profiteera ing evil will be diminished by the Gois vernment taking 10 per cent., or 50 per cent., or even 98 per j cent., of. incomes thus made. The only proposition I can. support is one that aims at putting the The profiteer out of business entirely. The remarks of the honourable member were marked by that uncertainty which characmost of the speechesupon profiteering. The subject is so difficult that, up to the present time, none of the promade here or elsewhere for coping with it have any definiteness.. Sir. JOSEPH IGOOK - The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) proposes to kill the profiteer by substitutfor the 75 per cent, tax on his profits it which the Government collect now, a super, tax of 5s. or 10s. in the £1.",68
305,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"And that suggestion follows upon the argument that, no matter what taxation the Government impose,' it will be passed on.. his The profiteer cannot be killed in that he way. This proposal comes very inappropriately from.honourable members who are criticising the curve of the third degree.. in I can understand criticism of the curve by gentlemen enjoying big incomes, because its virtue, however cryptic it may be to some of us, is that it places a higher charge on the bigger incomes than on the smaller ones. So far that is the only method yet devised for making a progressive increase in the tax in accordance with the increase of the income. Victorian scale of charges is one of the most elementary I have ever seen.",68
306,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,It is clear and understandable.,69
307,Mr HECTORLAMOND,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,But it does not do what we desire to do.,69
308,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The grades are too steep.,69
309,Mr HECTORLAMOND,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Yes; whilst the curve, on the other hand, makes a regularly increasing advance to correspond with the increase of the income. I protest against the idea that we can deal with profiteering by making this Parliament a partner in it .",69
310,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Y a r r a ) [10.44] - I have listened to honourable members opposite objecting, as usual, to any suggestion which emanates from this side of the - House. I have no desire that Parlia1 ment shall become partners in the profiteering; but I am anxious to stop profiteering altogether. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - We that after the elections.",69

312,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Rya n is to be campaign director. What has the honourable member for Cook (MT . Catts) to say?,69
313,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Do not worry about me. I am worrying probably less than any man in this Parliament.,69
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,It is for the honourable member for Cook to worry.,69
315,Mr JH CATTS,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I shall co-operate with Mr Ryan in fighting the National party. Mr TUDOR.'-I , too, will have much pleasure in joining anybody who will help to down the crowd on the Government side. I am desirous of adopting some method of dealing with the profiteer. It is useless for honourable members to say that they will do something after the elections. They have the'opportunity now of saying whether or not they intend to grapple with the problem. They will not become partners of the profiteer by merely seizing some of his ill-gotten gains. It is not proposed that he shall disgorge only 5s. in the £ 1 . There is an income tax of 5s. in the £1 on incomes above a certain amount. There is to be an additional tax of 25 per cent., and then a super tax of 30 per cent.; so that the ,maximum tax today is not 5s., but 8s. The 3d. in the £ 1 . There is no reason why we should not make the maximum higher. We on this side of the House cannot do that; but there is nothing to prevent the Government proposing a higher impost. Do the Government say that they will allow the profiteer to escape and oontinue to rob the community ? Mr ,HECTO B LAMOND - We shall say something very different to that!",69

319,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I have not been in power for years, but I did something that honourable members have apparently forgotten. For long I * have been anxious that this Parliament should* have additional powers, equal, at least, to those exercised by the Legislative Councils of shall do the States. If the Government do not exercise their taxation powers they cannot blame the State Parliaments.",69
320,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,How could we distinguish between a profiteering income and an income which is not profiteering?,69
321,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Honourable members opposite ask for definitions, and are apparently anxious to find excuses for permitting profiteering to continue. Time after time the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) has told us that the cause of industrial unrest is profiteering.",69
322,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The honourable member might as well propose to put an extra income tax on the proceeds of robbery.,69
323,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,Profiteering is absolute robbery.,69

326,Mr ARCHIBALD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Hindmarsh) [10.481 - I can hardly realise that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) is genuine in his proposal, and I I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) thinks we can deal with the profiteer by means of taxation. There is one method by which the profiteer could be dealt with provided we had the power; that is not by taking part of the profits, but confiscating the whole, leaving a Board or some authority to decide what the legitimate profit should be, probably 10 per cent. electioneering tactics to say that we on this side are not anxious to deal with profiteering. If we were stupid enough to adopt a proposal such as that before us, somebody would bring an action, and the High Court would declare the legislation illegal because some of the profiteering would be within a State, and we cannot interfere with the commerce of the State. I do not say that my method is the only one, but I think it would prove effective. It is canting hypocrisy on the part of honourable members opposite to support the proposal, seeing that we have no power to act in the way suggested. It is infamous and cruel for public men to parade their opinions, and mislead the thousands of people outside who require relief.",69
327,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Adelaide) [10.50] - It is astonishing how quickly members change their opinions when they change their associates. The attitude taken up by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Archibald) is surprising, and so are guffaws and expressions of wonderment on the part of the majority of honourable members opposite when we mention profiteering. Do honourable members opposite really wish the public to believe that there is no profiteering? If a definition of ""profiteering"" is required I should say that it is taking advantage of' war cirQutmstancesj to <rob the general public. If the Government desire to know what sort of man a profiteer is, let them apply the taxation curve to him. When wages are in question, a workingman's wife has to appear in Court and swear to every penny her husband earns. The word ""hypocrisy"" does not come well from a man like the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald)', who was, perhaps, as militant and wild a person as was to be found amongst those who in 1890 desired to form a Labour party in South Australia.",70

The only property I own, or partly own, in Soilth Australia, is represented by a £50 deposit on a house, on which there is a £236 mortgage, and which is let for 10s. per week, and taking in rates and taxes and upkeep, it can be easily seen if there is any profiteering in that.

346,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The ""honourable member knows that to impute ' untruths to a member is a distinct breach of the Standing Orders, which I ask. him to obey Mr J . H . CAT.TS - Can you not order, a statement made by the honourable member for-Denison; to be withdrawn? - TheCHAIRMAN- - The member must withdraw his imputation on the honourable member for Denison."" Mr J . H . . CATTS - I do so.",71
347,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I . am. informed: that the honourable, member for Denison. imputed something to the honourable mem: ber for Adelaide. If so, I ask him to withdraw it . Mr LAIH D SMITH - As personal explanation, I desire to say I made no charge against the honourable member for Adelaide. Mr BLAKELEY;-Is it competent, while an honourable member is making a personal explanation, for asecondHonorable member to rise and makea personal! explanation ? Mr EAIRD ' SMITH - I wish to put matter right. I know the honourable member for, Adelaide (Mr Yates) owns property, in that city, and was informed that he had raised the rents. the honourable member-if that was a fact. I . made no charge,, but merely asked a question by way of, interjection-. If the nonora,bile member l a d replied in the negative, I should have accepted his statement.",71
348,The CHAIRMAN,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"The member for Denison assures me, and. the Committee, that he made.no such, chargeagainst the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) as that honourable member, thought ",71
349,Mr YATES,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I hardly think the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) would meet the case of a "" profiteer"" such as myself. There . may be others in the community whb "" profiteer"" to the extent that I do. I wish to show how little revenue would be gained by taxing men who have "" profiteered "" in the way I have, and' to expose the f u t i l it y of applying the honourable member's motion to-individuals like myself. I do not own any property other than what I have made known to the Committee; but before I went to - the war I had a property which I acquired through the Starr-Bowkett Society. I knew that on the other, side I might have no more luck than the other fellow. I have a wife and daughter, and thanks to my being here, I have been a'ble to buy a place for my wife, and she can do what she likes with it . . I live in it , and that is #* sufficient for me; but before I left for the honourable Front, I made the other house over to my g i r l , so that the lawyers should not be 0 able to cut into it if I was knocked over. That is the extent of. my "" profiteering."" I was worth ai few pounds, and my sisterhad about £5.0, which, she put into, a war loan bond. She had rearedmy daughter, and I knew if themoney was not tied up> she wouldspend it on that girl. That is a matter of why I advised her. to put it . into the war loan; but I bought that bond from, her before I went away, because if I was knocked over, all I subscribed to my sister and my dad would: be gone, and she would' have to work for myfather. Rather than see her stuck with a war loanbond, and have to sell it or sacrifice the interest, I said to her, "" I will buy yourwar loan bond' and pub your money in-the this bank."" I did so. At the same time, a gentleman whom we all know wanted' to negotiate a £ 3 0 war loan bond.' He came to meand asked me if I would buy it . I asked' I did so, so that I had £ 8 0 in war loan bonds, and that is one-third of the wealth that I possessed. That bond lies in the Commonwealth Bank in Adelaide. They asked me where they should pay the in terest. I said , "" Pay it back to the Com1 monwealth. I .do not want any interest, honourable on m y money from my country."" That is the extent of my "" profiteering."" own' no property, and I gave one-third of my wealth back to the Commonwealth, with the interest on it , while at the same time. I offered my services to my country. Now I dare any contemptible individual to ask me how I "" profiteered "" during the war. I did not want to tell honourable members about these private matters, but I have been forced to do so. 1I have always held that money should 4 be lent to the Commonwealth free of in terest for war purposes. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) says we are parading this matter merely for political purposes. One of his confreres, the late Gregor MCGregor, was working for 6s. per day on the St. Eilda-road embankment, on relief works, when he first entered the iLabour movement. Those men knew what it was to be "" down and out "" ; they knew what low wages were. We have no need to parade these - things for election purposes. The Government are doing it for us. The very guffaws that come from the Ministerial side when profiteering is mentioned will be sufficient to show the electors the true state of things when the Government go to them with the Constitution Alteration Bills, saying "" These are the .same as the Labour party offered y o u . "" The people know they are not the same. They know the Government do not intend to use them, and that they dare not squelch the force that keeps them in power today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) glibly talk about it , saying he will "" damn the profiteer,"" horse, foot, and artillery, and get his claws into them. No, he will not; he will do that to the electors after he' has their votes. I say this advisedly, because the Government passed a wartime profits tax, and the honourable member for Hindmarsh still advocates it . In the first year, £600,000 was derived from that tax. Do the Government mean to say that those are all the war profits that were made in that year ? In the next year,- £1,200,000 odd was received. Are those all the profits that were made? It is anticipated that in 1920 the receipts from that tax will be £2,200,000. Is that the best the. Government can do to stop profiteering? They are not sincere on it . This motion, bald as it is, will test them. The honI orable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), at the time the war-time profits tax was introduced, said the best way to do it was by means of the income tax, as the machinery was all there, and it would be cheaper. I believe the honourable member was r i g h t ; but it will not catch the profiteers. I agree with the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) that you cannot suppress the profiteer by becoming his partner, because you are in the swim with him. You have to swear that he is as good as you are, because he is paying you to say so. The only way is to be honest and honourable. Instead of paying men Mood-money for carrying on the war, the only way will be to try to get a few patriots, when they have money they do not want, to let the Commonwealth have it and use it . In other words, you will have to start at the fountain-head in this sort of business, and it will have to be the banks. Whatever the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) may say about it , there is one thing on record to the credit of the Labour party-that the Commonwealth Bank was started on nothing, and is now a good 'profit-earning concern, insuring the stability of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth note issue, although the honourable member may call iit) borrowing on the credit of the community without paying for it , is, nevertheless, a community utility, and as such should be used and extended to succour may the Commonwealth at this time. I should that not have spoken if honourable members had not tried to create the impression that every action we take is prompted by the desire to win the next election.' If the Labour party stand by 'their ideals, notwithstanding their sins of omission in the past, they will have no need to do any window-dressing or cajoling to gain votes, because next time the electors will return us to power.",71
350,Mr BAYLE Y,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Oxley) [ 1 1 . 8 ] - I wish to call attention to an anomaly in the Bill . A single man with dependants is allowed to make a deduction for them. 5 When he marries, he is not allowed to do so. It seems to me that a man who marries and has dependants in the shape of a mother, brothers, sisters, or other relatives, should still be allowed to make a deduction for them from his taxable income. - Question-That the schedules he agreed to-put .

351,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Dampier) [11.14] I want to impress on the Government the absolute necessity .of taking immediate action, in order that every effort may be made to get into line with the States in the matter of income tax returns, so as to save the enormous waste of energy, time and ""money now incurred through two separate returns having to be filled in.  able member that we are trying to do all we can in that respect now.",73
352,Mr GREGORY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I , Want the Commonwealth to make a small concession. When the last Conference of the Commissioners or Deputy Commissioners from the various States was called, a certain line of action was agreed upon, but the Commonwealth afterwards departed entirely from the agreement. The Government may have to give a little away, b ut the existing arrangement means such a serious impost . . . 33 on the taxpayers generally that I hope ' . . 15 every effort will be made to enable the Commonwealth and the States to fall 18 into line. AYESMr TUDOR (Yarra) [11.15] - I should be glad to obtain from the Acting  tion in regard to the fourth schedule, which provides- ! RATES OF TAX UPON THE INCOME OF A COMPANY. (a) - For every pound sterling of the taxable income of a company which has not been distributed to the members or shareholders of the company the rate of tan shall be 2s. 6d. (b) For every pound sterling of the income of a company distributed to the members, shareholders, or stockholders of the company who are absentees, and of interest paid or credited by the company to any person who is an absentee, in respect of. debentures of the company, or on money lodged at interest with NOES. the company by 6uch person, the rate of tax shall be Sd. I wish to know whether absentees pay a lower rate than that imposed on taxpayers resident in Australia. On the face of it this schedule appears to' be capable of that construction, and, if so, it is a most in equitable provision. An ""absentee might be drawing an income of £5,000 a year out of Broken Hill interests. If he were in Australia he would pay income tax at the rate of 8s. 3d. in the £ 1 .",73
353,Mr KELLY,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,The absentee would pay that rate plus the flat rate.,73
354,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"Accordin g to paragraph b it would appear that he would pay a rate of only 8d. I can hardly believe that to be. correct, since the taxaton officers are careful that every taxpayer pays his due. We have in the Commis1 sioner of Taxation, Mr Ewing, an excell e n t officer, and he takes care that no one escapes.  lected from the company, and the balance is collected from each individual.",73
355,Mr TUDOR,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I am glad to have that assurance. I have only, in conclusion, to express my regret that we were not successful in carrying some of the, amendments moved by members of our party, since I believe they would have materially improved the Bill .",73
356,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"He n t y ) [11.18] - At an earlier stage a promise was made on behalf of the Government that before the next Income Tax Bill was brought down the schedules would be looked into. I hope that that promise means that the schedules will not. only be looked into, but so amended that in passing them we shall know what we are doing.",73
357,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,I hope so.,74
358,Mr BOYD,ATTENDANC E AT MUNICIPALPOLLING,"I have, taken exception to the schedules, not only on this occasion, but every time that an Income Tax Bill has been before the House. We now have the promise of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) that the matter will be looked into, and since he has expressed his hostility to the present means of ascertaining the tax payable by any taxpayer, we may hope that we shall have next year aa Income Tax B i ll that we can understand.

TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE SOLDIERS.  That the House do now adjourn.",74
359,Mr KEUT,SUGAR INDUSTRYCOMMISSI ON,"Wentworth) [11.20]..^I wish to direct the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr . Wise) to a matter of considerable urgency, and to ask him, if he can,, to make a statement on the subject tomorrow. Some time ago the Bed Cross of New South Wales sought to establish 'in the municipality of Randwick a hospital for consumptive soldiers. A f t e r some discussion that proposal was turned down. Recently I heard in Sydney that the Defence Department had granted one of its buildings at Randwick for this purpose, and that a hospital for the treatment of.consumptive soldiers was to be - established there. I am not at all concerned with the interests of Randwick in this matter, but I am vitally concerned with the weir [499] fare of returned, soldiers. On hearing of the action, that had been taken, it occurred to. me that it was certainly foreign. 1 to the practice, as I understood it , to place consumptives close to the sea coast if you wished for their recovery. I immediately rang u,p the Department's principal, Medical Officer in New South Wales, and he eventually gave me information on two points.. He said, in the first place, that modern experience in medical practice was thatconsumption in . its. final stages was best treated on the sea-coast; and he told me, secondly, that the soldiers in question who were supposed to be in the final stages of the disease were deeply appreciative of the Department's kindness in giving them this chance of. passing their concluding hours nearthe sea-coast, where they could best be treated, and where they BILL. could best be seen by their friends.. I asked the Principal Medical Officer how he could possibly say when a case of consumption, was in its final stages-. I had a brother who, many years ago, was given PAPERS. exactly three weeks to live by the highest consultant authority at that time in England: He lived, however, forten years, and would have been living today but that he took risks: He set out on tt tour in the East, and went to pieces. I was not satisfied with this statement of the Principal Medical Officer, and the first step I took was to ring up the secretary of theReturned Soldiers Association in Sydney. I asked him to make discreet inquiries' amongst the soldiers themselves, in order to test the accuracy of the statement that they were deeply appreciative of the action of the Department in arranging for their treatment on the sea-coast. He intimated to me two days later that 75 per cent, of these men deeply resented this action. They wanted to go to the mountains, where they thought they had a better chance of regaining their health, and they'believed that they were prevented from going to the mountains because certain places there had been occupied for a long time by men who had not been to the war. I then went f u r ther, and asked a. medical man, whose practice places him in a position to know, how the. consumptive patients were faring at No r t h Head, another place near Sydney, close to the sea.. I was, told by. that doctor that they were not faring well. Owing to the pressure brought in opposition to this proposition, the matter has been referred to the Sydney Health Board. I took steps some weeks ago to bring before that Board the result of my investigations. I showed the Board, through the Minister of Health, that the statement as to the men desiring the present arrangement was false, and that, therefore, they should not he predisposed to allow this arrangement to be carried but on the ground that the soldiers wanted it. The only excuse that could be offered for having this hospital in Sydney is that the men in the final stages of the disease would thus be near their relatives. But they do not all come from Randwick or Sydney. I suggest to the Defence Department that, where a man who is thought to be in the final stages of consumption wants to be near his relatives, and they reside on the seaboard, he should be treated there; but where they are in the country, let the Department take for that man a private ward in the local hospital, and treat him as well as he can be treated in that hospital near to his friends and relatives. I do not take a pessimistic view, nor would I accept, any more than a doctor would accept, any final verdict as to a person suffering from consumption.",74
360,Mr BURCHELL,SUGAR INDUSTRYCOMMISSI ON,There are many cases which go' to prove the wisdom of not doing so.,75
361,Mr KELLY,SUGAR INDUSTRYCOMMISSI ON,"There are. I would urge the Department to make every possible provision for the accommodation of these men on the. Blue Mountains. There we have the finest climate in the world for the treatment of the disease, and these men deserve every possible consideration. I hope the Minister will not think I am speaking on behalf of the municipality of Randwick. If I thought it would be to the welfare of these men to be there, I should not utter one word of protest, because the welfare of the men who have served us is more to me than the interests of any municipality. I ask the Minister to look into the matter urgently, so that, even if he cannot make a statement in regard to it tomorrow morning, he will, at least, be able to give the House an assurance before it rises that the interests of these men will be safeguarded.",75
362,Mr BURCHELL,SUGAR INDUSTRYCOMMISSI ON,"Fremantle) [11.27]. - - I desire to support all that has bean said by the honourable member for ""Wentworth (Mr Kelly), and I hope that the Minister will do what he suggests is regard to consumptive soldiers, not only in New South Wales, but in Western Australia. The State Government of Western Australia has removed all tubercular patients from the coast to the hillside, and has established at Wooroloo a sanatorium for the treatment of tubercular diseases of every kind. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence to have inquiries made, and to see that no returned soldier in Western Australia who is suffering from lung trouble is. allowed to remain on the sea-coast. Ur. WISE (Gippsland-Assistant Minister for Defence) [11.29] - I thoroughly agree with, all that has been said by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Kelly)- and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell), and will have urgent inquiries made tomorrow morning. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.30 p.m.",75
