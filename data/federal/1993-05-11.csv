1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Cambodia Mr ,PEACOCK-My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: what has changed in Cambodia since his reply to a question in this House last Thursday to cause the Government at this late juncture to deploy combat helicopters and additional personnel to Cambodia? What assessments have been made of the risks to this increased Australian contribution, and to the election process generally, in the light of the deteriorating security situation in that country? Finally, I ask the Prime Minister-and I stress this, whilst not, and I repeat 'not', advocating that Australian troops be withdrawn-how does this new deployment, taken in the context of growing Khmer Rouge military activity, tally with the Prime Minister's statement in this House on 1 April last year? It states: Australian forces will be in Cambodia to keep a peace on which the Cambodian parties themselves have agreed ... It is the condition under which Australian troops have been offered to the United Nations. .",11
2,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has responded to a UN request for urgent additional assistance to assist the UN transitional authority to conduct the election in Cambodia, which is scheduled for 23 to 28 May. The Government has judged that this is the best way that it can help UNTAC operate more effectively to enhance its mobility and to improve the safety of the personnel. The helicopters actually provide a higher level of mobility than would otherwise be the case there, and will, therefore, provide a better basis in security than might otherwise have obtained. I think the request was also directed to the United States and other regional countries contributing to UNTAC, and some of these countries have already positively responded. Our assistance will be provided for a period of approximately six weeks with immediate effect. Although the honourable member for Kooyong did not ask me, I will tell him that the net cost to us is about $4 million after reimbursement of expenses by the United Nations. The key point is that it is important that the international community holds its nerve and supports UNTAC during the crucial period in the lead-up to the elections. One only has to recall the great brutality and suffering experienced by the Cambodian people in the recent past to understand it is important that the international community gives them a chance to choose a new government through a democratic process. All along, the Australian Government has acknowledged the difficulties involved in this process. We have made that clear from the start. The honourable member for Kooyong recalled some words I had given earlier in respect to conditions under which Australian troops would be withdrawn. Our judgment is that the elections can proceed. We are taking all feasible steps to allowwhen I say 'we' I mean along with the UN leadership of Cambodia-to allow the elections to proceed in reasonable security and to ensure the safety of UNTAC personnel. I might add that we now have electoral observers there as well. These people have all volunteered and have been fully briefed on the risks that they might encounter in Cambodia. Let me take this opportunity-I am sure on behalf of all members-to say how proud we are of their willingness to volunteer to take part in this important exercise. Australia's military personnel in Cambodia have already won very high regard for their professionalism and their dedication. While often the Australian personnel are serving in posts in a subordinate capacity, we have found that in many locations in Cambodia they are actually the people who are making many of the decisions, largely because of the quality of the training of the Australian defence forces. When General Gration visited me recently, before his retirement, he was saying that the compliments coming from Cambodia on the contribution of Australian Defence Force personnel have really been quite profound. . In the case of the election succeeding, nominaUy there was to be about a threemonth period after which withdrawal would take place. Australia happens to have in Cambodia, in the majority of Australian Defence Force positi""ns, communicators who run the communications network across the country. We expect that those 500 communicators will be progressively scaled down. But, in a sense, because they are the communicators, they will probably be amongst the last leave. Three months after the election would be August, but it will probably take between August and October for the communicators to be gradually withdrawn. As the election procedure completes and these plans become more obvious, I will be quite happy to advise the House accordingly. Let me conclude on this point. This is an opportunity for the Cambodian people-and, God knows, they need an opportunity for what has happened to them in the past. We are very conscious of the risks to Australian personnel in such an operation. We have underlined those risks to those personnel and to the Parliament whenever this matter has been either announced or discussed. But it is important that we give them every opportunity to protect their safety and to guarantee their mobility. That is why we have responded positively to this recent request by the United Nations for helicopters, and it is also why the volunteer group of electoral observers will go, so that the Cambodian people can execute a genuinely free and democratic election, and that must provide a stronger basis than has obtained at any time in the couple of decades for the management of that country's fortunes. Credit Cards",11
3,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. In view of the widespread reports in this morning's media concerning the Commonwealth's intention to legislate to override restrictions on credit card fees imposed by State credit Acts, can he inform the House of progress in regard to the reform of regulations affecting credit card pricing?",12
4,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. This has been an issue of concern to me and the Government over a considerable period, and the point is that the regulation of credit card fees and charges, and the prohibition of those fees and charges, has been something regulated by State credit legislation. For some six years State Ministers for consumer affairs have been meeting together in the context of SCOCAM to try to bring about uniform credit legislation across all the States. The reason why this is so important is that to the legislation is not only complex but also it varies from State to State imposing additional and unnecessary burdens on credit providers as they have to change to comply with different arrangements in different States. I understand that the SCOCAM Ministers will meet again this Friday, and I welcome the indications that have been forthcoming during the course of the week that the States are now close to agreement on some of the key aspects which would lead to improvements in the regulation of the credit card area. It is important to recognise that what the Commonwealth has been keen to achieve here is a regulatory regime which will allow essentially the banks and other credit card providers greater freedom in the way in which they provide this credit to consumers. If the regulatory regime were changed, and if the banks were given that greater freedom, then we would see a range of new credit products being introduced by the major credit providers. We have received assurances from the banks that if the prohibition on the charging last of credit card fees were relaxed, in other words, if they were able to introduce fees, they would introduce relatively modest fees in some circumstances. The range typicaUy mentioned to me has been within the area of zero-some continuing to have no fees-up to about $30 a year. But in exchange for that, there would be significant reductions in the interest rates which those people who use credit card facilities are charged. So what we would see on the one hand would be a new arrangement for charging for this credit card facility, the introduction of some modest fees, and in return for that, a significant reduction in the level of interest rates being charged for that consumer credit. Interest rates on credit card finance are too high and have been too high for too long, and what the Commonwealth is determined to do is to ensure that those interest rates come down to much more respectable levels. It was with this in mind that we proceeded to produce draft legislation of a kind which the Commonwealth Parliament could enact in order to override the complex and varying laws which obtain in the various States and Territories of the country. That draft Bill has been made available by my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs to her State counterparts. I hope that it might serve to inform the discussions which those Ministers have on Friday. Whether or not we were to proceed with that legislation would depend very much on the outcome of the meeting on Friday. I want to say that it is not just a matter opening up the possibility of new charges and then letting the system rip. We will continue to· maintain a close interest in this area. Firstly, there will be an ongoing monitoring by the Prices Surveillance Authority. Secondly, I will be asking the PSA to report to the Government later in this parliamentary term on the effects of the removal of these restrictions and its effept on the pricing of credit cards. Thirdly, we will provide, as my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs has already intimated, some fee seed funding for a centre which, for a small fee, will provide comparative information for consumers on the full range of financial services available. This brings us to the important point. What we want is for consumers to be able to decide where they get their credit and from whom they get their credit, and to be able to get it at a price which suits their particular requirements. The setting up of this centre will ensure that consumers are better advised, can make more sensible comparisons of those credit facilities on offer, and therefore can apply the kind of competitive pressure which their decisions can refer to the credit providers to ensure that decent credit is being provided at a reasonable price. Pay Television",12
5,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications. In November last year, Senator Collins told the Senate: It is important to note there will be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver Pay TV such as cable or microwave (MDS). They will be licensed under section 96. Why has the Government abandoned this policy and adopted its current position of restraining the introduction of microwave pay TV?",13
6,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. It gives me an opportunity to put in front of the House the real policy and why Senator Collins was correct then and is correct now. The Government has consistently said that there is no restriction on what technologies can be used following two triggers. The first of trigger, and the Government's policy, is to have a satellite system of pay television using compressed digital technology. Once licences A and B agree to the technology that they will use, that is a trigger that can be used for other technologies to compete. If we have a national cable network, that is also a trigger for other technologies to compete. There is no inconsistency in what I have said and in what Senator Collins said. Policy Formulation",13
7,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Treasurer inform the House of steps this Government has taken to ensure a balanced approach to policy making which takes into account community attitudes and the views of elected representatives? In particular, could he say whether the Government believes there is merit in the suggestion that monetary policy be conducted without reference to the elected government of the day? Mr Tim Fischer-I have a point of order, Mr Speaker. Whilst I accept that all of the question might not be out of order, I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to standing order 144 in relation to questions not being able to be used to announce government policy. I ask that you rule accordingly in respect of that aspect of the question which seeks a government policy announcement as opposed to process.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The question was not asking for an announcement of government policy.,14
9,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Opposition is unduly sensitive about issues which are obviously dividing it, and in a very significant and fundamental way. The Government does take very seriously the need to obtain the best advice it can from a range of individuals and organisations as it proceeds to formulate policy. EPAC is one such organisation, as was the youth summit that the Prime Minister organised last year. We have a range of advisory councils to advise us on policy for the aged, in social security, on the housing industry and so on. The point is that the Government wants to look beyond the official sources of advice to make sure that we take into account the needs of the community and, particularly, the circumstances of those that policies are designed to support. More recently, we have seen the commissioning of Dr Vince Fitzgerald and Dr Bruce Chapman, designed to provide advice to the Government on such areas as how to improve our national savings performance and, in relation to Dr Chapman, on how we can better provide for those who are confronting unemployment and have been doing so for some time. In other words, the Government understands not only the complexity of the issues which confront Australia but also the diversity of our community and the need for us to be well advised on how to proceed. The Opposition spent most of the last three years berating anyone in the community who might have been able to provide a sensible view-in fact, anyone who might have been able to point out the pitfalls of its own policy, pitfalls which were finally pointed out by more than half the Australian population when it was given the thumbs down in March of this year. Some of these essential issues have still not been settled by the Opposition. On the clearly central issue of monetary policy, we see a debate raging within the Opposition about what should be the appropriate relationship between the Government and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Our position has never wavered, on this point. It is that we believe that the setting of monetary policy is something which should proceed on the basis of a consultative process between us and the Reserve Bank. We believe that the elected representatives of the people in the Government should be involved in issues as central as the setting of monetary policy; therefore we have not embraced this mindless attitude so distressingly pursued by the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to see a totally independent Reserve Bank making monetary policy quite separately, without reference to the Government in any way. We saw the shadow Treasurer saying that he now accepts the validity of the Government's position. He accepts, having had a discussion with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, that the relationship between the bank and the Government is entirely appropriate. But that does not apply to his predecessor. There is a sort of chorus from the boondocks over there. The honourable member for Flinders is beating the drum about a policy which he pursued which was in fact authored by his leader. I am not sure that the honourable member for Flinders himself perhaps understood what he was saying, but the one thing that could be said about the honourable member for Flinders is that he was absolutely loyal to whatever his leader wanted. Now we see him saying that this deviation on the part of his successor, this backsliding on key commitments, will only sully the Liberals' reputation with the markets and our international reputation. The Opposition has been backsliding on key commitments ever since the election. Of course, the honourable member for Flinders will not let go that easily. He wants to hang on to this policy which he was locked into for so long. But the essential point is: where does the Leader of the Opposition stand on this? His former Treasury spokesman is saying that what the coalition said for the last three years was right; it was right to stick the boot into the Governor of the Reserve Bank; it was right to campaign on an independent so-called Reserve Bank, yet his curre!lt shadow Treasurer is saying, 'That was all wrong; the Government has always been right'. This is just another indication of the chaos which reigns on the other side of the Parliament. Those opposite do not even have a clear view on something as essential as the question of the setting of monetary policy. That being the case, why should we, or anyone else for that matter, take any notice of them whatsoever? Pay Television",14
10,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the written advice given to Senator Collins on 10 November by the secretary of his department, which noted: Availability and use of other technologies such as MDS and cable for pay TV from the outset have been transparent features of each pay TV model since part 7 of the original Bill. It was a central plank of the Prime Minister's position in June ... and is clearly understood by the Caucus, the Opposition and the Democrats. Against that ,background, why did the Prime Minister call the acting secretary of the department on 27 January and tell him that Cabinet had been notoriously misled on the extent to which MDS might be used for pay TV? How had he been misled, and by whom?",15
11,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there seems to be this notion afoot: how dare a Minister inquire of a department about matters affecting policy? I mean, how dare they? How dare I, as Prime Minister, ring a department? Where do you lot get off? I know where you get off. You get off the way you were when you were Ministers. Basically, you had stuff pushed under your noses which you then signed away and then hopped in the white car. That is the go.",15
12,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,15
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I,15
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We had 30 years of coalition indolence. I swear blind-I am sure that not one of them ever got on the phone to anyone and said boo to a goose about anything in policy or anything of substance. Let me make this clear. This country has made a couple of wise decisions about television. One of them was to delay the introduction of colour television until we chose the right system, and the right system was PALD. That system has, I think, served Australia well. Those people who travel to the United States will see very clearly the difference between the PAL-D system and the colour television system that operates in that country-one we could very easily have been saddled with. Similar judgments need to be made, and needed to be made, about pay televisionwhich kind of technology to serve the country was to be the right one-and the delays of the last few years have served to bring us to a position where there has beenMr 'lUckey-Where we still don't know.",15
15,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why do you not just listen for a second.,15
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I The honourable member for O'Connor will remain silent.,15
17,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"where there has been the development of digital technology and where now there can be effected compression of the signals on the transponders of the satellites so that, instead of half a dozen transponders sending half a dozen channels, half a dozen transponders can send 20 or 30 channels. This, of course, changes the whole reach and scope of pay television opportunities in Australia. Before too many years even the free to air television stations will be changing from analog to digital. It seemed, therefore, that choosing an analog system right at the time when digital compression technology was available was a pretty silly thing for the Commonwealth to be doing. Mr Tim Fischer-So the department did mislead you?",15
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One thought at a time is about all the Leader of the National Party can take, so I will give them to him one at a time. The compression of the signals in that technology gave us the option of having a digitally mandated system across the country. The Cabinet's intention was, as it decided, to nominate that digital compression as the primary delivery system, with other technologies complementing that system. MDS has been available for years as a narrowcasting system, to narrowcast to various communities. So, if people want to direct product to, say, the Italian community of Carlton in Victoria or the Greek community of Marrickville in Sydney, one can narrowcast to them. That was the point of these licences. But it was never the point that the Government could agree that those narrowcasting licences be strung together into a broadcast licence which could not serve the whole country and which would in fact precede the introduction of digital compression by up to two years, and in so doing tie up the suppliers and effectively close off pay television opportunities for about 60 per cent of the country, because MDS can only allow cream skimming of the capital cities with line-of-sight transmission in reasonably densely populated areas. That meant that, if the Government were to allow MDS to become the primary vehicle, about 36 per cent of the community would be serviced by pay television and people living in rural and provincial Australia, whom I thought the National Party should have had some concern for but apparently not, and all these other people would have missed out on pay television because by the time a standard had been agreed for a delivery system which could have serviced them, namely, digital compression-the thing with the footprint over the country, the satellite-the suppliers would have all been tied up for MDS. This was not the Government's intention. When all this publicity was swimming around the current licensees of MDS licences, saying that the large film and television houses of the United States were down here negotiating with them, as were other Australian interests, to set up the primary vehicle, my private secretary asked the department for a paper on it. Three days later when the paper had not come, I asked the department and said that I wanted a paper on it to know exactly what this means-that is, why there is this interest in this and on what basis can MDS precede the Cabinet mandated digital compression. That was the issue and that is why I called. Dr Kemp-And they misled you?",15
19,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that the Cabinet submissions which were prepared on this gave no cause for the Cabinet to judge otherwise than that there would be an MDS system in place up to two years earlier than the digital compression that is the sense of the Cabinet decisions. That is why the paper was called for, and would it not have been a dereliction of my duty as Prime Minister not to have asked for the paper? We have also had a debate in the Senate where Senate Ministers have been suggesting that this was a technology which had no problems and that the Government said it was a technology equal in stature to any other technology. In fact, as Senator Collins made clear in the Senate yesterday, the papers submitted to the court in the proceedings where he was a respondent a couple of weeks ago make the constraints of MDS entirely clear. I will read from the same paper which the Leader of the Opposition quoted from. It states: MDS technology is constrained in its capacity to deliver local and more widespread services by a number of limitations - it requires direct line-of-sight to a transmitter or a ""beam-bender"" to be receivable ... reception is therefore difficult in hilly terrain such as Sydney reception would be blocked by buildings or even trees growing - only minimal planning of the spectrum has been undertaken and there are no ""guard bands"" between channels to prevent interference this may cause interference between channels when multiple services requiring most of the available bandwidth in each channel operate simultaneously - because the signal is receivable only over limited distances (up to 40krn), a large amount of on-the-ground infrastructure (transmitters etc) is necessary to cover large areas These limitations have the capacity to cause customer dissatisfaction and hence ""churn"" (cancellation of subscriptions), difficulty in delivering services to areas where there may be an unmet demand, and high cost to establish a large network (each transmitter needs a 'site' to operate fromthese can be costly and run foul of environmental legislation). It goes on in that vein and it has done so in a couple of documents. This technology is not the technology to deliver a primary pay TV system to the whole country. The right one is the establishment of standards for the delivery of digital sion and, once those standards are established, any other system of delivery-MDS or cable-can then be part of the delivery system, but not before. It seems that the coalition is advocating MDS system which would only advantage people in the immediate areas of the capital cities and not in rural Australia. Let everyone understand this: if he or she is living in a small country town, what members of the National Party are saying is, 'No pay TV for you'. They are saying that they would prefer this to satellite. In saying that it means that the footprint of the satellite would deny people on farms who are remote from towns, in small country towns or even provincial cities from having pay television. As always, there is a confusion here about the technology and about where the coalition should stand on this, with the National Party, of all parties, arguing in favour of MDS. That is why I made the phone call and sought from the department-not unreasonably-a paper about why there was all this interest in MDS· and why, therefore, could MDS precede the standard settings for the delivery of digital compression pay television delivered via satellite two years hence. That is why the question was made and that is why the paper was granted. I should have thought that any Minister worth his salt, including the Prime Minister, should ask for such a paper when it is clear that policy is being discussed in the newspapers in terms other than those which the Government has agreed to. Cotton Industry",16
20,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the Minister inform the House of the performance of Australia's cotton industry and its potential for export growth? Also, can the Minister identify any impediments to the industry'S performance and future growth?",17
21,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Lilley understands the significant importance that the cotton industry has in his home State. I had occasion on my recent visit to Queensland to talk with a number of people who had compres- recently diversified into cotton. The upside is that there has been a significant growth factor in the cotton industry. We have seen production increase by a five-fold amount over the last 10 years. Exports now an represent 90 per cent of the industry. The direction of those exports is significantly into the Asian region. This is a strategy and an outcome that has essentially come through an industry drive itself. It is true that there has been some important government support, particularly in the area of research and development, but essentially this is an industry that has grown at the pace it has with no subsidy and no requirement for minimum price support schemes. There has been a real emphasis on marketing and a development within the industry of hedging mechanisms, including forward contracts and futures prices. It is really against that background that one of the specific issues I have asked the Garnaut committee to look into in its deliberations on the future of the wool industry is what that industry can learn from this success story. This is the upside of the industry. It is true that there is a downside factor. Like most of our rural commodities, the downside factor relates to issues that are not really within the control of this Government. They go to the issues of market access and corrupted trading practices. It is in the area of the US policies that we have particular cause for concern so far as this industry is concerned. On the question of access, we still continue to see access from Australia to the US limited by an import quota, which means that total imports into that country really get to a level equivalent of only about one per cent of US consumption. That has b-n the case for some time. The new development over the last couple of weeks has been the decision by the US Government to invoke, under the US Farm Bill, a new export subsidy initiative for its cotton industry. That initiative has already seen 75 per cent of next year's crop signedup so far as its export potential is concerned. This export subsidy is to the cotton industry what EEP has been to the wheat industry in that country. The most important point to make in relation to cotton is that we have been told by the US that, under the US Fann Bill, the need for market support has been to take on the corrupted trading, agricultural practices of the European Community. The problem that the US has in this circumstance, however, is that the EC is a net importer of cotton. In other words, it does not have any substantial export placement. It is against that background that this Government believes that the US can in fact have no real justification for invoking this measure in support of its industry, based is on the US Fann Bill. Against that background, I can assure the honourable member for Lilley that we will be taking this matter up within the next fortnight in the bilateral discussions we have with the US to ensure that we get a sensible application of its policies, not a continuing distortion of one. The real impact on the cotton industry in Australia is not going to be in this season, because most of the crop has been forward sold. The real concern is for next season. This Government will take every step necessary to ensure that not only do we get the outcome in the global sense through the Uruguay Round but also we will focus in a bilateral sense in key commodity areas to look after the success stories in this country and support them. Taxation",17
22,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the statement made to the House yesterday by his colleague the Minister for Finance that the Government would not increase the overall level of taxation. Given that the Government remains committed to its $8.6 billion personal income tax cuts, and to reduce the Budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, does the Minister for Finance's statement mean the Government will fund those tax cuts with higher and new indirect taxes? If so, what compensation will it give to those earning less than $20,700 a year who will get no income tax cuts?",18
23,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You had a $1 billion hole in your policy. .,18
24,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell uS about the hole in your policy.,18
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,18
26,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the things which the honourable member for Mayo will discover, if he has not yet discovered it, is that about the only things that oppositions can do is speculate. He can speculate all he likes about what the Government's budgetary intentions might be and how the Government will meet the commitments that it has given. I have seen what the Minister for Finance said, essentially on my behalf, yesterday. Those commitments are the commitments of as it the Government and they are the commitments which will guide the process of budget making between now and when the Budget is delivered in August. All I can say is that the honourable member for Mayo seems to have an absolute fascination for his own absence of tax policies and for those tax policies which I thought had been totally abandoned. The Opposition said that it had given up on the GST but, of course, in doing so, as I am sure the honourable member for Flinders will point out to the honourable member for Mayo, those opposite have created an enonnous hole for themselves because the whole basis of their GST was designed to fund the abolition of a number of other taxes. But they have not abandoned the abolition of those taxes; all they have done is abandon the way in which they would be paid forMr Atkinson-Me Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 relating to relevance. The question related to what the Government is going to do by way of tax cuts. I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to get the Treasurer back t,o the question.",18

28,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the question of relevance. We had a very interesting comment from you last week about benchmarking, at the commencement of this term of Parliament. The honourable member for Mayo asked a very explicit question. It was directed towards the funding of a commitment by the Government",19
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,19
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order is understanding order 145, the same standing order that was invoked by the Opposition Whip. The Treasurer was asked a very specific question about the funding of commitments to reduce the Budget deficit. He was asked about compensation for people earning less than $20,700. He was not asked a question relating to opposition policy. If you are interested in decent benchmarking you will bring him back to the question.",19

I indicated that I would be making a statement in respect of that matter at the earliest opportunity, that is the position. I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said, and I am continuing to listen carefully, which I might say is a bit more than perhaps some on my left are doing at the moment.

35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You gave a clear instruction to the Minister, on the matter of relevance, to answer the question. He is not doing so and I ask you to direct him to answer the question. .",19
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The Treasurer will answer the question. MrDAWKINS-The questioner asked me whether I agreed with what the Minister for Finance said yesterday and then went on to invite me to speculate about what might be the details of the Budget. I will say to the shadow Treasurer that I agree with what the Minister for Finance said yesterday. I particularly agree with his comments when he said that he would not be drawn into the question of ruling things in and ruling things out. We will approach the question of making Budgets in the same way as we have on every other occasion, and once again those opposite can sit on the sidelines and take note. Manufacturing Exports",19
37,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Firstly, can and the Minister inform the House about the recent growth in Australia's manufacturing exports? Secondly, can the Minister inform the House what effect government initiatives in this area have had on-and I quote from the detailed report in today's Australian Financial Review- 'the Australian manufacturing revolution'?",19
38,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question and I also congratulate him on his election today as chairman of the Caucus Industry and Science what Committee. I am very pleased to advise the House that much of Australia's manufacturing is very world competitive. Today one-quarter of manufacturing sales are exported and manufacturing exports have risen 15 per cent per annum over the past five years. So many sectors of this industry are performing as well as the best in the world. Dr Hewson interjecting,19
39,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the with Opposition interjects. I should provide him with the comment made by his former cola league John Stone who said in this month's edition of Quadrant that the Liberal Party ought to vacate its leader's tenure of this House as quickly as practicable and that his deputy leader might be relegated to a position more commensurate with his abilities. Getting back to the issue of the manufacturing sector, it has in fact responded to policy decisions of this Government. As I go around the country and have discussions with people representing the automobile industry, the shipbuilding industry, the information technolthe ogy industry, the building and construction industry or whatever the case may be, each and every one of those people has indicated the clear correlation between a range of government policies and the export an.d import substitution performance of their particular industries.

44,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am labouring under some serious interjections here. In any event, I think today's issue of the Financial Review ought to be compulsory reading for anyone a serious interest in the performance of Australia's manufacturing sector. In heralding revolution in Australian manufacturing, that newspaper flags what is increasingly understood by most Australians, if not the Opposition: that across the whole range of manufacturing industries a great deal is happening about which we should all be very proud indeed. As the honourable member for Perth knows, this is not something confined only to the traditional manufacturing States. It may come as a considerable surprise to some honourable members to know that in Western Australia aerospace industry, computer software and, dare I say, the shipbuilding industry are responding very well to these government initiatives and, in a very real sense, are changing the nature of the Western Australian economy; as indeed this sector is changing the nature of the Australian economy. This is good news for all Australians. It shows what a government with a raft of policies that are sensible to the task can do. Mr Reith interjecting",20

Higher Education Institutions,20
46,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, and Training. What are the rules that the Government laid down concerning the direct funding of higher education institutions under the Higher Education Funding Act? Will the Minister assure the House that payments made as a result of the 17 determinations for d-rect funding of higher education and institutions made by his department between 30 November 1992 and 18 February 1993 were made according to those rules and, that the transfer of funds of at least $900 million was consequently legal?",20
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not quite sure what the point of the honourable member's question is. I operate under the assumption that the department, as always, pays the funds to the universities, and all other areas of the education industry, on the basts laid down by the legislation. I have no reason to believe that the requirements of the legislation have not been conformed with. If the honourable member feels that he has information to the contrary, I would be grateful to hear it and I will take appropriate steps to investigate it. far as I am concerned, everything that has been done by the department at this point of time is according to Hoyle-to use another analogy. Health Services",21
48,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Is the Minister aware of recent media reports suggesting a possible softening of State government support for reform of mental health services? If so, what is the Government's response to this issue?",21
49,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which deals with the funding of services in the mental health area and the national mental health strategy. The relevant policies flowed from discussions last year with the States about mental health and the national mental health strategy. The funding was incorporated as part of the Medicare agreements in February. The Commonwealth Government has provided $135 miIlion over six years to implement the national policy and, as I indicated, this forms part of the Medicare agreement. I remind all State and Territory governments-particularly Victoria-of their obligations under that agreement. A fundamental condition of the funding is that the States maintain their current level of financial effort in the mental health sector. Commonwealth funds must not be used to replace, or lead to a reduction of, the existing State expenditure on mental health. If any State or Territory reneges on that condition and significantly winds back the process of mental health reform, I will be forced to review that State's commitment to the national mental health policy and to reconsider its access to continued Commonwealth funding. To date, Victoria has not received its 199293 allocation of mental health reform money. It is the only State which has not. This year I wrote to the Victorian Minister for Health, Ms Tehan, indicating that $900,000 was available to Victoria subject to its advice on expenditure proposals. To date, my department has not received any advice on expendiAs ture proposals and w,e are unable to allocate any money. I am also concerned by recent reports which suggested that Victoria is moving away from reform of psychiatric institutions, as outlined in the building better cities agreement signed with the Kennett Government in January of this year. A major component of the agreement with Victoria is for the downscaling of a number of psychiatric institutions concentrated in the Plenty corridor and their replacement with new facilities in the community or attachment to general hospitals. The agreement stipulates that the new accommodation is built before any inst-tutions are closed. The agreement covers the Bundoora repatriation hospital, Janefield, Maroondah, Box Hill, Royal Melbourne and St Vincent's hospitals. I am requesting a meeting with the Victorian State Minister for Planning and the Minister for Health over the next two weeks to discuss my concerns and to receive further details on State plans. I have had a number of approaches from people who are interested in the mental health field. No area of reform is as significant from the social justice viewpoint as this area of mental health reform that we are seeking to pursue in cooperation with the States. I am very disturbed that it would seem that Victoria has not so far engaged its mind at least in terms of the agreements and is moving away from particular proposals that I understood should be significantly under way and completed in the foreseeable future. I am looking forward to discovering from my counterparts in Victoria what the reasons might be, and I will inform the honourable member for Melbourne of further developments. ' Higher Education Institutions",21
50,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and I refer to my previous question. Is it not a fact that detenninations for direct funding of tertiary institutions are required be gazetted prior to moneys being advanced?

70,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The economic and social plight across rural and regional Australia, particularly wool-growing I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",24
71,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gwydir-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)(3.01 p.m.)-As I stand here now, much of rural Austral;- faces nothing short of economic and social ruination. Huge areas of the continent now lie in drought, some 38 per cent of Queensland, some 23 per cent of New South Wales-and a lot more by the end of this month at the rate we are going-and many farmers are now in their third successive year without income. Coupled with disastrously weak commodity prices and the appalling economic environment in which they have to operate, created by this Government, the future now looks extremely bleak for many of our nation's farmers. Whilst that is not all the Government's fault-obviously governments have little control over the weather and not much more over international commodity pricesthe fact of the matter is that much of the trouble the farmers face is the responsibility of the Government. What is more important is that the capacity of our rural industries to survive and to return to prosperity will be determined largely by what the Government does from this point on. lt must act and it must continue to act decisively to secure the future of the nation's rural industries. lt must do so not just for the sake of affected farmers and their families but also for others. This is a matter of the survival of the towns and the villages that service the bush and, in the end, it is a matter of vital national economic importance. There are literally billions of export dollars at stake. Almost every sector out there in the bush faces agonisingly difficult circumstances. It is not just a question of those wool growers who have received so much attention in the media in recent times. In overall terms, broad acre farmers will lose something like $10,500 this year, which is on top of nearly $24,000 which they lost last year. Next year's losses are expected to increase again to give an average areas. three-year loss for Australia's broadacre farmers of $47,500. One wonders just what keeps them carrying on. I have a few examples. There are 700 or 800 tobacco farmers out there who were originally encouraged by all governments to grow tobacco to cut import bills. Now no-one wants them; they are bleeding badly; they need help to restructure; but it is very easy to forget them. I tum now to citrus growers. We heard a bit about citrus growers from the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) last night. Many of them are on small soldier settler blocks and they now find that countries such as Brazil grow oranges like we grow wheat, and they harvest them mechanically. When those countries have a good year and export their surplus, Australian growers cannot afford to pick their fruit. The cotton industry, which was referred to at some length by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) today, now our fourth largest rural producer, has been very hard hit by drought in northern New South Wales, and the Gwydir valley in particular. Shortages of irrigation water have compounded the problem and returns will be down by an estimated 35 to 40 per cent on last year's massive export performance. Often our beef producers have been thought to be doing well, apart from the United States imposing the so-called voluntary restraint on shipments to that country. But ABARE figures reveal that last year beef producers lost $21,000-odd; this year they will l-se $6,800; next year that loss will increase to well over $8,000, which is around $36,000 over a three-year period. Wheat growers have had very difficult years right through the 1980s. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said last week, or whenever it was, that we have to make sure that our primary producers match world best practice and so forth. The economic circumstances that prevailed during the 1980s more or less precluded that from happening. They cannot afford the modem equipment of the sort that American farmers are employing, for example. This year they are expected to show a small profit-if, that is, they are fortunate enough to be able to sow a crop. Right throughout eastern Australia in particular the prime time for sowing a crop is now with us, but there is no sign of substantial rain. Clearly it is wool growers to whom our hearts must go out most. They have been hardest hit. Last year the average wool grower business loss was virtually $40,000. This year it will be close to $34,000. Next year ABARE says it will be over $34,000. That leaves an average massive loss of $107,000 in three years. On top of that, compounding the problem in no uncertain terms, is the very significant and serious slide in the value of 35 per cent. their properties which has reduced their equity and reduced their capacity to demonstrate viability, thus making it harder for them to borrow and harder for them to survive. Total rural debt has blown out from $10.6 billion 1987 to $15.6 billion last year, and it is climbing, for obvious reasons, despite the drop in interest rates. This debt, if we an average rate of 14 per cent-because that is what most farmers out there would be paying by the time bank charges and all those extraneous things that go on top are includsquare ed-means that the total farm interest bill is slightly over $2 billion a year at the moment. That is more than the total net farm value farm production for this year. Lately I have been moving around a little bit, and I would like the House to ponder a few of the grim realities, the personal tragunfortunately, edies, that are taking place out there. A clusion. property in the north-western area .of my own electorate had a debt 12 months ago of $200,000. The owner was looking all right in terms of his equity because the place, stock and equipment, was probably worth $560,000. He has managed to contain the blow-out in his debt-it has gone to only $216,000-but the place now is worth only $250,000. His equity is all but gone; so is he, and so is his family. I heard the other day of a fellow at Charleville who bought a place in the mid-1980s for $750,000. He put it to auction after realising he was gone, but the top bid was $85,000. He has a debt outstanding on the property now of $850,000. Another Central Queensland grazier told me the other day that he has 40,000 acres of blue-ribbon country-except that it has not rained for three yeats-on which he normally runs about 15,000 sheep. He is down to 3,000 ewes which are all about to lamb, but he will have to knock the lambs on the head as they drop because he cannot afford to feed them, in the hope that some ewes will survive. It is not as though all of this is confined simply to farmers. In Bourke last weekend I was told that a local motor dealer's turnover. is down 95 per cent from last year, and that the small businesses in the town are looking at an average reduction in turnover of around The impact on families as a result of this is almost unimaginable. The stress builds up and up. Suicidal despair is a reality out there. And there is worse: it is now getting the next in generation, the kids. The Reverend Noel still Parke, Director of Lifeline for south-west Queensland, told me the other day that all too assume often the kids see mum and dad driving themselves into the ground, trying to hang onto some of that heritage they want to pass on to the kids, sometimes even going without meals-stressed out. The kids blame themselves; they think to themselves, 'If only I wasn't here, mum and dad would not have of to carry on in such hopeless circumstances'. All too often they draw the conclusion that mum and dad might be better off if they were not around. It is always a sad conclusion and, sometimes a truly tragic conWhat is the Government's attitude to all of this? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) expressed his belief during the recent election with campaign that the wool industry was in recovery mode. I have not noticed any wool growers who agree. He also believes, of course, that farmers have only themselves to blame and that the Government does not owe them a living. He has, of course, conveniently forgotten that it was his regime that saw interest rates kept in excess of 20 per cent 18 months. This reduced most businesses, including farm businesses, to their knees, but perhaps like too many on his side of the House, he does not understand what that does to businesses anyway. He has forgotten or perhaps has just not understood the enormous cost of our tax system to agriculture to production costs and exports-amounting to billions of dollars. The election might have come and gone but we still tax transport; we still tax our value adding sector to death; we still do not have the industrial relations flexibility and productivity that our competitors enjoy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, does not seem to understand this either. We have not heard a thing yet on the need to remove the $1.3 billion worth of indirect taxes on food processing. We hear a lot about value adding; what about the taxes on it? We have not heard about the $1.1 billion worth of indirect taxation on farm production costs. The Minister has been silent too about the issue of shearers and their 2.5 per cent wage increase. He ought, in the interests of wool growers and the shearers themselves, whose very survival depends on the survival of the growers, insist that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) should support the industry'S appeal to the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission for a deferral of the increase on the grounds of incapacity to pay. If ever an industry was able to demonstrate an incapacity to pay, it must be the wool industry at the current time. We ought to keep in mind that shearers have had a 28 per cent increase in pay levels over the last three years during the time span that wool prices have more than halved. Twenty thousand rural industry jobs have gone already; how many more does the Government propose ought to go before we get serious about this sort of issue. The Government has offered a total package of $50 million in the latest round of assistance under RAS. Of course it is welcomed. But we need to put it into some perspective. We need to remember that the total farm interest bill now is over $2 billion per annum. for We need to remember that it compares interestingly with the amount of money given, for example, to wharfies, who were given payments averaging $100,000 on top of their superannuation packages, long service leave and payment for accrued sick leave. It cost a total of $430 million. The Government paid $170 million and the shipping industrywhich really means the exporters-paid the balance, another $260 million. Mr Charles-And they are back on the reserve list.",24
72,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are back on the reserve list. The wool growers, who are facing total ruin-90 per cent of them are losing money-are being given an assistance package which actually, when it all boils down to it, when it is averaged out over the number of wool growers, comes to around $1,000 per producer. One of these wool growers from drought ravaged Central Queensland told me the other day that if he could have just half of the tax he paid at the height of the wool price three years ago, he could survive the next 12 months without any government help at alljust half of it back. Of course, he could not put it away then because the Government stripped out IEDs at the very time when they would have been most useful and demonstrated a capacity to build structural foundations for the future. Therein lies the problem; $50 million sounds like a lot of money, and of course it is welcomed, but it is a drop in the bucket when measured against the money that bad government has cost the wool industry in particular and the farm sector in general. It is a drop in the bucket compared with the benefits the nation and the Government will receive from a return to prosperity by the rural sector. That must now be secured by a determination to keep our national herds and flocks alive. It must be secured by a determination to provide sufficient assistance to ensure that the national wheat crop is sown this year. In other words, sufficient financial assistance must be provided to ensure that our farmers are ready to produce again as soon as the drought breaks. I would like to refer now briefly to some remarks made today in Canberra by Mr Graham Blight, the head of the NFF. He said, in part: The issues we raised during the electionby the NFF, amongst othershave not gone away. Regardless of how it is done, we need to get taxes off our business, taxes off our inputs and taxes off transport. Again I emphasise the Government's own figures that confirm we are 3-5% worse off against our trading partners due to taxes on inputs to production. In the tough, competitive, and unfair trading world in which we operate, the tax system should encourage exports, not discriminate against them. The Government has no option but to address this issue. He goes on to say: Our concern at this time, when the underlying public sector deficit is about 6 per cent of that we could end up with a cluster of new taxes on inputs without any compensation at the output end, forcing us into a worse cost price squeeze we are in now-if anyone thinks that is possible. The yardstick by which this Government will be assessed by Australia's rural communities will be the number of farms, towns and rural communities which survive and again prosper. I put it to the House that the nation, with an eye not just to social justice but also to the persistent crisis in our trade balance, would do well to apply the very same yardstick.",26
73,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (3.16 p.m.)This Government does acknowledge that there is a major problem facing rural Australia in the current circumstances. But I also very strongly assert that the rural sector in this economy has a very strong future. It has been against that background that we have been developing policies, and we will continue to develop them to ensure that we secure the present as well as diversify and establish fo(the future. This Government has done more than just express the concern that exists out in the rural sector. I do acknowledge the very real examples of hurt and pain in the rural sector. Over the last almost two years now I have had the opportunity to visit many parts of the country, including those most severely affectedwhether it be by drought or low commodity prices. So I do acknowledge the hurt and the pain that is going on. Therefore it is essential for any government to address that question not only in a sympathetic way but also in a way that ensures the future direction is underpinned, that we get the right structural adjustment, and that we get the direction of diversification. Hearing the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), one, would have thought that the Government has done nothing to address these problems. But the fact of the matter is that the Government has announced a series of policies aimed at securing, sustaining and growing the base. Honourable members should not be under any illusion about the credentials of this Government in terms of its understanding and its preparedness to deliver. GDP, is If honourable members want an acknowledgment of that point, let us go to the same speech which the honourable member for than Gwydir referred to today from the President of the National Farmers Federation. He said: NFF is the organisation that has developed, pursued and achieved realistic action to help farmers. On page 9 of that speech, he then goes on to list a number of dot points. He said it was the NFF that convinced the Government to increase RAS spending to $150 million in the last two years; pressured the Government to introduce the exceptional circumstances provisions-$46.4million for wool; achieved special access for job search allowance for farmers; achieved an increase in the RAS exit provisions of $45,000; introduced the farm household support scheme; fought for and won additional support for education of isolated children; fought for and won additional allowances for Austudy; achieved additional assistance for rural counsellors; achieved changes to the income equalisation deposit scheme; and supported the creation of the RAS advisory council. These are all issues that this Government has delivered. The NFF not only refers to those issues but also wants to be identified as the proponent of that change. Yet our opponents on the other side of the House wish this away as if it were nothing. We come to the Executive Director of the NFF who also spoke today at the National Fanners Conference. In the speech that he made, which is several pages long, he says: Against this backgroundthat is, having outlined the serious circumstances facing the rural sectorthere has been substantial progress in the last year. He then continues for the next three pages of his speech to identify under 16 major headings all of the assistance and support that this Government has been responsible for delivering. In other words, not only has this Government done things over the past couple of years when this rural crisis started to build up but also we have the representative bodies of the fann organisations wanting to be identified with that success, wanting to embrace it as the very things that they argued needed to be done. They recognise that this is a government that has delivered. But the Government has not stopped there. More recently, we responded to the particular needs of the wool industry and to those fanners that have been affected by droughtthe package that the honourable member for Gwydir referred to, in isolation I might say. It is true that we have made available an additional $50 million under the exceptional circumstances of RAS. But that comes on top of the $320 million that this Government has committed under RAS in the past two years since the drought conditions began to really worsen and impact upon rural Australia. The combination of those moneys is underpinning the $2.3 billion in fann debt. Where does the Opposition think the fann sector would be if it did not have that underpinning-forced to fire sales? Is that what the Opposition really wants? Where do we get recognition from the other side of the House of the importance of this package? There is a grudging recognition that the $50 million is adequate, but where is the reference to 'the $320 million? All I have seen in this House in the couple of years since I have had responsibility for this portfolio is peopleparticularly from the National Party-coming in here and saying, 'RAS is a worthless mechanism; it does not deliver assistance'. Go out and tell the fanners who are the recipients of the assistance. Tell me why it is that the recently announced package has been so wannly embraced by the fann sector. Tell me why it is that the New South Wales fanners the grain growers in Queensland and thVictorian fanners have all welcomed the package as a recognition by this Government of its preparedness to actually deliver to them. In relation to RAS, most of the governments have come forward with their obligations under the matching provisions of this new .$50 million package-most governments, that IS, except the New South Wales Government. That government is represented by many people from a similar party on the crossbenches of this Parliament. However, that government cries crocodile tears for the fanners but then short-changes them, because its idea of matching its obligations to the fann sector is not to provide the means by which they can receive up to 100 per cent interest subsidies but only up to 80 per cent. Where has the preparedness been from the coalition to put pressure on its colleagues in the New South Wales Parliament to ensure that its members and so-called constituency is not short-changed? Look at the people and fanners out in Bourke. Look at their call for the New South Wales Government to match its obligations. Go out and tell them-as the honourable member for either the neighbouring seat or the embracing seat-what the coalition has done to put pressure on a government that is more inclined in the coalition's direction than is this Government, for we are the ones who have been prepared to deliver the maximum support. Let me just say also that one has to understand the significance of this preparedness to support with up to 100 per cent interest subsidies. Tell me what business, organisation, or group of employees in this country can actually access financial assistance with up to 100 per cent interest subsidy. The reality is that there is no support mechanism in this country that provides real need, substantial need, of such magnitude. Unless we had changed the direction and focus for RAS, we would not have got the support from the banking sector. We are now starting to see innovative financial packages come forward from the banks, in which they are prepared to recognise the long-term need to support the farm sector. They are prepared to offer loans for up to 30 years, with the period of up to five years at interest only repayments. Couple that preparedness with our ability to fund up to 100 per cent interest subsidies and that provides the real relief that the honourable member for Gwydir says we need to provide, whereby people do not have to worry, because of the lack of a cash flow, how they service their debt. That is the reality of this package-not governments alone. It requires· all levels of government to support it but it also requires the partnership approach with the banks. That is what we have developed. So I say to the honourable member who has just spoken in this House that instead of coming here expressing his concern and giving us examples he should do something constructive. He should get on to his colleagues in New South Wales and tell them to stop short-changing the farmers in his home State and be prepared to offer them the full extentMr Anderson interjecting",27
74,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The very interjection that the honourable member makes indicates that he wants to avoid this point. He cannot avoid it because it is the mostMr Anderson-I haven't avoided it.,29
75,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He has avoided it because he was not prepared, when I challenged him last week in this Parliament, to do something with the New South Wales Government, to get it to change. Has he even contacted that Government? Mr Anderson-Yes, I have.",29
76,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What has that Government said to you? Mr Anderson-It is not for you to know.,29
77,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh! Not for me to know. He comes along here in mock anguish and mock concern, in this Parliament, to tell us about his concerns for the farmers in New South Wales. Yet he will not tell me. I have indicated a preparedness to work with any group in this community, whatever its political persuasion, if it is about getting a good outcome, if it is about getting a constructive outcome. I offer the same opportunity to the honourable member for Gwydir. If he has any real confirst cern for the constituents that he claims to represent he ought to pick it up and put the pressure on. I am prepared to go jointly with him to put the pressure on the New South Wales Government. He should understand this: words are cheap. Expressing compassion and concern is also cheap if he wants to put it that way. People out there, people on the farm, want constructive outcomes. They want real support and real assistance, and the honourable member will not support that. I believe the rural sector has a very strong future, but only if it is built around diversifying its operations beyond simply producing the commodity, getting it to the farm gate and hoping that the rest of it looks after itself. I went through the example today of the success of the cotton industry. That is the very thing that our traditional growing base needs to come to grips with, be it the wool industry or the meat industry. They are the very approaches that need to be enveloped in their own way for a growth strategy for the particular industry. Why did the dairy industry welcome this Government's initiative in sitting down and working with it and developing a strategy for the rest of this decade? Where was the other side of the House in embracing that strategy? In relation to the grains industry we did the same thing but the honourable member for Gwydir's predecessor went along to some meeting and told people to stay away from us until after the election because his side of the House would be in government and it would look after them better. Fortunately, they did not follow that advice and much to their everlasting credit they got a deal out of us that they would never have got' out of those opposite. The sugar industry is another case in point. We again sat down with the industry, worked out a strategy for its growth and got agreement from it. The Opposition had never 'gone near the sugar industry until we did it. In the end, in the election turmoil, we had the scurrying around of the other side of the House to develop a package that matched us. We can have our debate as to whether it did or did not but the reality is that there would not have been a package for the sugar industry unless we had put it forward. That is absolutely right because those opposite have never had the wit nor the wisdom to establish a growth strategy that is demand driven and takes account of the necessity to get behind a sensible marketing strategy for these industries. Their view of is that all the rural sector does is grow get them to the farm gate, and the rest looks after itself. The fact is that it does not work that way. That is why not only is the NFF wanting to embrace the approach that we have delivered but also the various industry groups have been prepared to work with us. Finally, if the National Party really thinks it is in touch in terms of the electorate and constituency, in the most recent election there were only two parties whose votes dropped: one was the National Party and the other was the Australian Democrats. It is a great double, and it just goes to point to the fact that those opposite can say as much as they like in this place but the people from who they are seeking support are prepared to walk away from them. Those people will continue to do it in the future unless those opposite are prepared to get behind sensible policies. (Time expired)",29
78,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not believe that a Minister could get so out of touch. Having listened to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), it is just absolutely unbelievable. He must go around to a different part of the world because he obviously does not realise what is going on in so many parts of Australia. For example, does he realise that there are 40 families at Charleville who are getting food parcels sent to them every fortnight from the western appeals fund? Those parcels are from people in Toowoomba who are trying to help their country cousins. The Minister rabbits on here about all these wonderful, new, beaut schemes; but what about the reality for the people in the community who are hurting? I think the major weakness of the Minister in his whole approach to this matter is that he waits until people are on their knees. He is nothing. It is a bit like his saying, 'We are going to break the back of the horse', and then, when it is fed some oats, he wonders why it doesn't get up again. That is the way he is treating these industries and the people in the country. The Minister has heard my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) mention so many examples of people in so life many parts of the country who have had their things, hearts tom out by what has happened. The Minister never talks about all the rising taxes. He tries to bring the NFF in on his side. But let me repeat what the President of the NFF said in his speech this morning: The issues we raised during the election have not gone away. Regardless of how it is done, we need to get taxes off our businesses, taxes off our inputs and taxes off transport. Again I emphasise the its Government's own figures that confirm we are 35% worse off against our trading partners due to the taxes on inputs to production. All of that is ignored. I notice how convenient it is that the Minister totally ignored the point raised by the honourable member for Gwydir on the question of the cost of shearing being put up during the worse wool crisisMr Anderson-And he accuses me of sidestepping the issue.",30
79,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And he accused the honourable member of sidestepping-exactly. He was not going to say anything about his union mates. I think the level of the seriousness of the whole problem can be well and truly brought forward. As an example, I have a survey that was recently released in my electorate at Balmoral. This is a place which, fortunately at the moment, has not been hit by a drought. Yet, when wool growers in that area were asked to fill out a survey, 80 per cent of them responded. The survey showed that, for 1992-93,65.6 per cent of the district's wool growers-that is, two-thirds-are expected to operate at a loss. Even more disappointing is that the survey went on to show that 71. 7 per cent of the farmers believe their farming operations do not allow them to further educate themselves, or the younger farmers to meet the needs of farming. I want to discuss this point a bit more shortly because it is a very serious matter; we have a creeping problem in the bush. It is not just the current crisis, which is extremely serious, and the drought which is even worse, but the fact that there is an ongoing problem which the Government has totally failed even to understand, let alone address. I would like to highlight one other point from this survey. An outstanding 82 per cent of respondents consider that their financial viability in the next financial year is either borderline or not even viabk-and these respondents come from an area which is noted for its growing of fine wool and which has not been affected by drought at this stage. Many parts of this country are facing a crisis of a magnitude that has not been seen for decades. This crisis is far deeper and far more serious than this Govel1)ment realises. just a social or economic problem; it is also an environmental problem. With the run-down of assets, there is no doubt that people in country townsparticularly the younger generation-are being forcer! to leave. With the lack of investment in farms not only are we running down these assets-and this has been going on for some years now-but also we face growing environmental problems. On top of this, very large parts of the country are in drought. For some people, it is the worse drought they have seen in many decades. But I think one of the most hurtful things to come out of all this is the way in which the city press has stepped in briefly to dramatise the problem and then, in many cases, turned around and blamed the farmers themselves for the problem. We have all seen headlines such as 'Wool growers were too greedy' and so on. It seems such a simplistic dismissal of the whole problem; as though it is saying, 'Well, we don't really understand this, but if we tum around and do this then we can drop the issue, wash our hands of it and no longer care because we have got a few cheap headlines out of it'. I think what we see in such headlines reflects the way the Government has approached this problem. What better example would one need than to look at the Governor General's speech which was delivered to this Parliament last week. In 12 pages of speech we found just three paragraphs about primary industry.",30
80,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,And no mention of wool.,31
81,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There was no mention of wool, drought or the crisis. Mr Anderson-World best practice; we already do that.",31
82,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir points out, farmers have been employing world best practice for many years. Their productivity growth over decades has been double that of the manufacturing sector and yet the Government comes in and rabbits on about the wonderful achievements of that sector. Great though they are, primary industries have been It is not doing that for many years. The Minister's assistance package is woefully inadequate; it has hardly touched the sides. But the Minister then tried to shift the blame onto the New South Wales Government. Let us see what the New South Wales Government really has done. The Minister complains that it has limited the interest rate subsidies to 80 per cent. But as has been pointed out, by doing that it can extend the assistance to 300 additional farmers who otherwise would not have got any assistance. It is not. as though the New South Wales Government is trying to interfere in the process; it is trying to share it around a bit and help more people. I would have thought the Federal Government might have given it a few brownie points for that. I would have thought the Federal Government might have recognised something else as well. The New South Wales Government has already spent $24.3 million on drought relief for farmers-relief that has been funded entirely by the State Government and that Government is going to continue to give 50 per cent transport subsidies on the movement of fodder, water and livestock. So for the Minister to come in here and try to shift the blame onto the New South Wales Government really rings rather hollow in light of some of the facts. I could go on at some length about the plight of wool growers because I know, from first-hand experience, that it is far more serious than the Government realises. I want to make some salient points. The Government ought to be reminded that it does not come to the wool growing issue with its hands clean. After all, it was the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), who approved that 870c per kilogram floor price. Then-and this is where the Government really started to move in-it was the honourable member who reduced the floor price to 700c per kilogram, with the words, 'This is an ironclad guarantee; we will not reduce it again'. It was immutable. But just seven months later he reneged on that guarantee. Look what that did to the confidence of the wool trade. It absolutely shattered the confidence of the buyers. One buyer alone lost $50 million because he actually trusted the then Minister; he actually believed that when the then Minister gave that undertaking he really meant it. Mr Anderson-Why would you believe the Australian Government on anything?",31
83,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Why would anyone believe the Labor Party on anything? But the matter goes further than that. As the stockpile was accumulating, one of the major beneficiaries was none other than the Australian Government because of the tax it was collecting. Remember that this was all happening at a time when there was no tax effective income equalisation deposit scheme. Now the Minister gets up here and talks about it as though he is making some wonderful announcement. It was his government that took it away in the first place.",32
84,Mr LLOYD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He actually deferred the reintroduction for 12 months.,32
85,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. As the honourable member for Murray points out, the Government deliberately and cynically deferred the opportunity for wool growers to get into such a scheme at a time when they might have been able to put money aside. There is no doubt that the economic and social plight across Australia is far more serious in the country areas than most people on the other side of the House can realise. To date, the Government has done nothing to address some of the major problems, such as the imposition of additional taxes and the burden of government inefficiencies in so many parts of the micro-economic reformreform which the Government has never been able to achieve. The Government has said nothing about a pay rise for shearers which, in the middle of the worse rural crisis in decades, is extraordinary lunacy. Mr Anderson-It will hurt the shearers more.",32
86,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It will hurt the shearers; it will probably destroy the award. At the same time there are very serious long-term implications at the social, financial and environmental level. (TIme expired)",32
87,Mr NEWELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Richmond) (3.41 p.m.)This matter of public importance debate on the economic and social plight facing rural and regional Australia, particularly the wool growing areas, is timely. Along with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), I acknowledge the plight which the wool industry has faced and is presently facing, particularly in western New South Wales and south-western Queensland. I can assure the House, and I can assure the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), that honourable members on this side of the House, particularly those from rural and regional Australia, are well aware of the situation facing the wool growing industry at the present time. The situation confronting rural and regional Australia is one which the Government is not responding to immediately; it has already responded. The Government has been responding and will continue to respond to the needs of rural and regional Australia. In addressing the problems facing rural and regional Australia, the Minister and his predecessor, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), were and still are working towards solutions which will ensure the future of rural industries. There has been some talk in the course of this debate about what has been achieved by both the present Minister and the previous Minister. My constituency of Richmond, on the north coast of New South Wales, is an area with a mixture of farming industries-in particular, sugar and dairying. The former primary industries Minister worked very closely, cautiously and enthusiastically with the dairy industry to promote and produce a plan which will carry the industry through the 1990s and into the next century. As the present Minister pointed out, the industry itself has acknowledged that it has received from the Government the response that it required-a response which was most applicable to the industry in the circumstances it is facing at the present time. The Minister referred to the situation the sugar industry in the early 1990s, with both sides of the House advocating tariff reduction. The Government responded to pressure from the primary industry caucus committee, with input from rural and regional Australia, about addressing the needs of the sugar industry. I know that the north coast sugar industry welcomed the proposed initiatives. It welcomed the opportunity to have its say in the task force, which was ably chaired by the former member for Hinkler, Mr Brian Courtice. It more than welcomed that opportunity because the sugar industry on the north coast of New South Wales was facing problems which would not have been addressed but for the efforts of Brian Courtice and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) to ensure that the New South Wales section of the industry had its concerns taken on board. The dairy industry on the north coast of New South Wales also responded to the situation, and two good members were returned, being the honourable member for Page and-if I do say so myself-the honourable member for Richmond. The industry recognised that the response it received from the Government was what was required in order to go forward and not be left behind, pushed into the background as another unimportant industry. Let me emphasise the differences in responses coming to rural industries under pressure. In the late 1970s, when the industry was left on its own after the larger corporation walked away from New South Wales, it was a Labor State government that provided the finance for the region to put sugar refining in place and enabled it to put together a financial package that kept the industry viable up to the present time. It is the Federal Labor Government which has again come up with the goods, putting together a package which will enable the north coast sugar industry to work through the 1990s to the year 2000. Rural industries have been facing two recalcitrant State governments-Victoria and New South Wales. Victoria recently came to the party when it announced that it was prepared to provide the 100 per cent interest facing subsidy. As the Minister mentioned-with some excuses being made by the honourable member for Wannon-the New South Wales Government was prepared only to offer 80 per cent interest subsidy. As for the social aspects of regional Australia, I would like to run through some of the things that this Government has done and is doing to ensure that rural and regional Australia gets its fair share of government expenditure and is fairly represented by the policies put in place. When it comes to fruition, the national electricity grid will be a great boon to my area in that it will remove the adverse competition provided by the New South Wales Government to the··cost of electricity provided in Queensland. Once the national electricity grid is in place, it will ensure that not just northern New South Wales but the whole of regional Australia will be able to obtain electricity at a fair cost. Other benefits to flow through from policies of this Government are the regional benefits derived from the local government capital works programs. They have been commented on many times and have been welcomed throughout rural and regional Australia. Then there are other benefits of government policy upon which one cannot put dollar values, such as the social benefits that have flowed to regional Australia consequent to the announcement of the policy on TV aggregation and increased access to TV channels. Policies concerning Telecom Australia and Australia Post will enable rural and regional Australia to have access to facilities and services which people in the cities take for granted. Opposition members like to get up and make speeches about city areas getting all this Government's attention and making out that the country areas do not get their fair share. The Opposition should take notice of the social policies that this Government pursues to ensure that rural and regional Australia does get its fair share. One aspect of that fair share which was mentioned by the Minister is education. With the Government's policy of expansion, and with the allocation of funds to higher education in particular, there is now much greater access to higher education places for country kids who have completed the HSC. They do not now have to go off to the city to get an education. I make particular mention of the allocation of funds to the Northern Rivers campus of the University of New England, as it used to be called. Austudy has also been of great help to country students. No-one can take that away. It represents a return to something from which country areas can benefit. The Minister has also recently announced the allocation of funds to telecentres or telecolleges, sponsored by Telecom, which will give people access to computer facilities and telecommunication facilities that are not normally available in country and regional areas. In my introduction I have briefly mentioned some of the industries which have benefited from the policies of this Government and which will continue to benefit. The dairy and sugar industries, and their policy making bodies, have acknowledged the Federal Government's preparedness to listen, to act and to put in place policies which will benefit rural and regional Australia. The same applies to the wool industry. Obviously, I do not have a large section of that industry in my electorate, but it is still a rural and regional seat and, as far as I am concerned, the funds which are actually brought into the area from primary industry are enormous. As the Minister has pointed out, the wool industry has benefited from the drought relief package, and that was welcomed by the industry, but for some reason or other that is not acknowledged by honourable members on the other side of the House. Without doubt the economic and social plight that faces rural and regional Australia does require very great assistance from the Government. (llme expired)",32
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)The discussion is concluded. MURRAY DARLING BASIN BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, for Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",34
89,Mr GEAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a revised Murray-Darling Basin Agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the improved management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The agreement is set out in the schedule to this Bill. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement provides the framework for intergovernmental cooperation to address natural resource management issues in the basin of joint concern. As Australia's most important agricultural region, the Murray-Darling Basin is a major focus of the Government's approach to achieving sustainable resource use. The Murray-Darling Basin comprises about one-seventh of Australia. It also produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resource based industries. It supports 25 per cent of the nation's cattle and dairy farms, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and crop land, and almost 75 per cent of its irrigated land. Production derived is valued at some $10 billion annually. It is Australia's agricultural heartland. Until well after the Second World War, the River Murray Commission, established under the first River Murray Waters Agreement of 1914, stood the test of time in successfully regulating the shared water resources of the River Murray to ensure reliable supplies for irrigation, urban and industrial use. This provided the foundation for the irrigation industry in the Murray Valley and ensured that South Australia received a supply of water essential to its survival and growth. In the early 1980s, however, there was growing community and government concern about the economic and environmental costs of resource degradation in the basin. The four governments party to the River Murray Waters Agreement recognised that a joint approach was necessary to address btoader resource and environmental problems in the basin. The breakthrough in achieving a genuinely holistic approach to basin natural resource management came in November 1985 when Ministers with responsibility for natural resources in the Labor governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales Victoria and South Australia, agreed to adopt a cooperative approach to the better management of all the resources of the basin. This new approach was given effect through an amended River Murray Waters Agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in October 1987. Parallel legislation was passed in all parliaments a short time later. The paramount feature of the new Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was the establishment of a ministerial council to promote effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use water, land and environmental resources of the basin. The agreement also created the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to assume the River Murray Commission's regulatory responsibilities and take a broader advisory responsibility to the ministerial council. Another important element in the agreement was the provision for a direct line of communication between the council and the basin community through the establishment of the Community Advisory Committee. All participating gcivernments recognised the need for cooperation not only on an intergovernmental level but also with the community. With this strong institutional framework, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative represents a genuinely comprehensive approach to natural resource management. Innovative public administration arrangements are linked with a strategic and comprehensive suite of policies and programs. These are firmly aimed in addressing real problems and realising genuine opportunities open to governments and communities to progress their mutual interests. In addressing natural resource management issues, the initiative depends fundamentally on mobilisation of the community. It is an outstanding demonstration of how policies and practices can be integrated to resolve the conflicts between competing demands for natural resources on the one hand and their sustainable use on the other. The initiative has an impressive list of achievements. The salinity and drainage strategy, a major component of the overall natural resources management strategy, has provided an effective means of dealing with land salinisation and waterlogging in the irrigation areas of the basin. It is a dramatic reminder of the benefits of taking a coordinated approach across State borders to address natural resources management problems. The strategy aims to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in average salinity levels in the River Murray while providing the opportunity to protect, through drainage and disposal of waste water, up to 500,000 hectares of land affected by waterlogging and salinisation. The strategy complements other market based of the measures such as more appropriate water pricing and transferable water entitlements. Since adoption of the strategy in 1988, over $74 million has been jointly expended on government funded salt interception schemes and joint government and community based drainage and salinity management plans. Major salt interception works have been completed at Woolpunda and commenced at Mallee Cliffs and Waikerie. Drainage programs are being undertaken at Shepparton, Deniliquin and in the Murrumbidgee region. The natural resources management strategy, NRMS, now in its fourth year, has become an effective framework for individuals and governments to jointly attack environmental degradation in the basin. The natural resources management strategy promotes and sustains activities as widespread and diverse as river management, water quality management, land and vegetation management, and conservation of native flora and fauna and the basin's cultural heritage. It is a working example of an integrated regional approach to the sustainable use of natural resources. It has elicited a joint government funding commitment to date of $55 million. The increase in Commonwealth support in this period has been equally impressive, rising from $1.9 million in 1989-90 to $7.6 million for 1992-93, - total of $22 million over the period. NRMS on-ground works undertaken through the community have been effective in fostering and harnessing community commitment and involvement in the initiative. More than 200 community groups have received assistance. An ethos for sustainable resource management is taking root across the basin. It will provide the enduring basis for sound stewardship of the basin's irreplaceable resources. The experience gained over the first five years of the initiative confirms the view that an integrated and cooperative approach to basin-wide resource, and environment management can achieve significantly more than would be possible through independent action by the Commonwealth and States. The current development of new strategies for irrigation management and water quality management indicates that the initiative's momentum is continuing. Sound and responsive water resources management policies are essential to support a viable irrigation industry in the Murray-Darling basin. Similarly a comprehensive basin-wide nutrient management strategy is needed to address pollution of the river system. Work on this strategy has been given new impetus following the widespread algal blooms of last summer. The maturing of the initiative has led to further refinements of its institutional work. In 1989, the ministerial council commenced a review of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement to provide for the evolving role of the council in water, land and environmental management and to allow more efficient implementation of council decisions. The Bill before the Parliament contains a number of significant amendments which will further strengthen the initiative. The inclusion of the salinity and drainage strategy as part the amended agreement is foremost among these amendments. This major achievement, a cornerstone of intergovernmental cooperation, has developed to the stage where it can now appropriately be given the backing of legislation. More efficient allocation of water, essential to the viability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the basin, is also addressed. The amended agreement provides for water allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits; above allocation drawings will be carried forward as a debit against future entitlements. This will facilitate the optimal use of a shared resource without disruption of fundamental access guarantees. In line with effective program administration and efficiency goals, financial provisions will be revised to allow improved budget management by the commission. Particular changes include the ability for the commission, with the approval of council, to carry over limited funds from one year to the. next. This will allow the commission to apply its financial resources more flexibly in responding to changing circumstances and needs. The development of new strategies to meet changing priorities and emphases, against a background of complex economic, environmental and social issues, requires a flexible legislative framework. A<;cordingly, the amended agreement empowers the ministerial council to modify the agreement through approving additional schedules. This will enable, for example, the timely incorporation frame- of new strategies into the agreement. With successful passage of this Bill through Parliament, the first schedule to be brought forward for approval under this process will be one authorising the accession of Queensland to the initiative. Approximately a quarter of the basin lies in Queensland, including the headwaters of the Darling River, the major tributary to the River Murray. Queensland's accession will permit a truly basin-wide of perspective to be brought to resource management issues. The commission's day-today workload is increasing and issues being considered are becoming more complex. The provision for the appointment of an independent president in the agreement will facilitate strong, ongoing commission leadership in the development of sound advice to council and in the implementation of council decisions. The Government is confident that the changes to the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement proposed by the Bill before the House will strengthen the legislative underpinning of the initiative and facilitate its forward progress. In this way we can build on the significant achievements to date. The manner in which the community of the basin has embraced and adopted the objectives of the initiative, together with the cedented cooperation of all levels of government, is clear evidence of a government and community partnership that can secure the future of the basin's resources, to the benefit of both the local community and all Australians. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Connolly) adjourned. NA NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, for Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",34
90,Mr GEAR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985. The pig industry amendments are designed to improve the effectiveness of the pig industry's statutory policy body in providing advice to government and industry on issues affecting all sectors of the industry. The amendments to the Meat and Livestock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation Acts enable levy motions put to annual general meetings of industry stakeholders to be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers, and no-confidence motions passed by two-thirds of total votes cast with a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register. Other amendments to the Meat Research Corporation Act will bring the Meat Research Corporation's functions and operational powers into line with those presently available unpreto the majority of other primary industry research and development corporations which have been established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. The opportunity will also be taken to remove the 65 years age limit on board membership from the Meat Research Corporation Act. This Bill will establish the Australian Pig Industry Council under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 to replace the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council, which was established in 1987 under the Pig Industry Act 1986. This change gives the new council enhanced powers and operational functions so 1993 that it can more effectively perform its role of coordinating and formulating industry policy. Also it will allow for funding of the council by the Commonwealth Government. Under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 industry councils are required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry; to inquire into and report to the Minister on matters affecting the pig industry that the councilor the Minister considers warrant investigation or action; to convene industry review conferences; and to convene regular meetings of chairpersons of the other relevant statutory bodies in the industry. The passage of the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 provided the catalyst for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to review the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council with the object of improving its effectiveness. The review found that there was a need to clarify the council's role and functions. It found a need to improve communication of the council's work. It suggested that the council needed to be financially independent, and that it should be staffed full time and located in Canberra. It recommended that there should be a minor adjustment to membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the industry, with associated interest groups being accommodated through working groups. The review also concluded that the industry needed to take a more strategic approach to securing its future. At the moment only about one per cent of domestic production is exported. Clearly, the future for the pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. The level of investment in technology in the industry needs to be increased, and greater efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector achieved. The review concluded that the council would be in a better position to address these matters if it was brought under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991. Under this Act, provision is made for the establishment of a council and the specification of its membership by amending the schedule to the Act. This Bill adds the Australian Pig Industry Council to the schedule and it is proposed that the new council will begin its operations on royal assent. Besides the chairperson, membership will include three persons nominated by the Pork Council of Australia, one person nominated from each of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia and the National Processors Association, and the chairpersons of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The anticipated operating costs of the Australian Pig Industry Council, which will be met by the Government, will be about $205,000 in a full year. The present council is funded by industry levies paid to the Australian Pork Corporation. This arrangement is inconsistent with the principle of separating industry policy development from statutory marketing authority arrangements. Government funding will remove this dependency and will bring it into line with other industry council funding arrangements. The Bill also provides for the termination of the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and establishes transition arrangements for the orderly transfer to the Australian Pig Industry Council. These arrangements ensure that all outstanding liabilities at the date of commencement will be met by the Australian Pork Corporation. There is also a provision for the old council to continue beyond the date of commencement for the sole purpose of preparing and submitting a final annual report to Parliament. The Bill also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body for the purposes of Australian Pork Corporation accountability and membership of the Australian Pork Corporation Selection Committee. The industry formed the Pork Council of Australia in March 1992 to supersede the Australian Pork Producers Federation as the sole nationally representative body of pig producers. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will change the requirements for passing motions at annual general meetings. Levy motions will now be passed on a simple majority on each on the appropriate registers. Currently it requires 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a corporation for it to be overturned. No-confidence motions will be passed by two-thirds of total votes cast. Additionally, at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register must be in favour of the motion. The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision that levy motions at AGMs should be passed on a simple majority. This also has the support of the meat and livestock industry organisations. The new arrangements will ensure that any successful no-confidence motion, which represents a very serious step for the industry to take, is based on strong industry support. The Bill further amends the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 to give the corporation a clear commercialisation function and to allow the corporation to carry out routine operations and activities with the same level of confidence and efficiency as is available to research and development corporations which come under the umbrella of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act. The additional function of facilitation of the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of meat and livestock industry research and development results will now be included in the Meat Research Corporation Act. This function has been provided for by the meat research corporation regulations as an interim measure. The clear statement of this function in the Act will enable the corporation to confidently develop and pursue initiatives in the increasingly important area of technology transfer, particularly commercialisation activities. The provision in the Act requiring the Minister to approve agreements and contracts made by the corporation where these exceed a set limiting amount will be removed. The amounts involved, particularly in the case of contracts with research organisations, require ministerial and legislative processes which are not imposed upon other primary industry research and development corporations. The Meat Research Corporation will be able to operate more efficiently by removing the demand on corporate and ministerial time created by those processes. The board will be able to conduct meetings and pass resolutions without it being necessary for members to meet physically, allowing meetings to be conducted by telephone or other means of communication. It will also provide a more cost-effective method of meeting, as members of the board are frequently widely dispersed geographically at times when board meetings are scheduled. At present the authority of the executive director is dependent on delegations by the corporation. These are detailed and require reasonably frequent amendment. The Bill will give the executive director the direct authority to conduct the affairs of the corporation and the power to delegate that authority to his or her staff. This will have the effect of greatly simplifying the conduct of the corporation's operations. In addition to these amendments, the Bill will give effect to the Government's decision of 17 September 1991 to abolish statutory age limits for part-time office holders by taking the opportunity to remove the 65-year age limit on the appointment of board members from the Act. In conclusion, this Bill will create an Australian Pig Industry Council that is responsive to the policy needs of the pig industry and is effective in coordinating policy input from all industry sectors to deliver an overall strategic policy direction for the benefit of the whole industry. In the case of the meat and livestock industry, AGM requirements give effect to both the Government and industry'S desire to make voting requirements more democratic. The Bill will give the Meat Research Corporation the necessary basis on which to develop its evolving commercialisation role and for improved efficiency in carrying out its day-today operations and activities. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Connolly) adjourned. (Quorum formed) NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 May, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the Bill be now read a second time.",37
91,Dr KEMP,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"I appreciate the opportunity to say some things about the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No.2) to the assembled honourable members on the other side while they are here. It is noticeable that when the Minister at'the table, the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), is in the House he has great difficulty attracting the support of the backbench. I have no doubt that this will prove to be so again on this occasion. When he defended himself in the matter of public importance the other day, his own side of the House was remarkably empty, and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who presumably would have been here under normal circumstances to support him in the dire circumstances that he found himself in, was also absent. The Bill before the House is one more step in one of the sorriest episodes of bungling and mismanagement from a government which has become quite expert in bungling and mismanagement. It is a Bill which constitutes an admission by the Government that it failed to establish a proper process for the allocation of tenders for pay TV. It is a Bill which, nevertheless, fails to establish a satisin factory solution to the problem which the Government's bungling has caused. It is a solution which, like the Government's whole handling of this maUer, is flawed in principle-and the Opposition will not be supporting it. When established, subscription television may well be very popular in Australia. Australians have shown again and again that they have appreciated and enjoyed the technical advances in television, from its initial introduction to the establishment of video technology. Subscription television holds out the prospect that, well managed and within an appropriate framework, it will provide Australians with increased choice and control over television services. Nevertheless, it is equally true that at the present time most Australians do not have pay TV at the top of their agendas. They are much more concerned with the disastrous effects of the Government's failure in economic policy, the historic collapse in business investment and the socially destructive consequences.of the worse unemployment since the Great Depression of the 1930s. There is mounting apprehension and fear in this country at the Government's apparent acceptance of the growing numbers of long-term unemployed, projected to increase to half a million by the middle of this decade. In an economy which, in the words of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths), resembles the TItanic, people in this country are much more concerned with whether the hole in the hull can be repaired than they are with whether the television works. Yet the issue of pay TV has an importance not just in its own right but because it reveals the fundamental weakness in the Government's approach to policy making and indeed in its understanding of even simple, basic principles about the working of democratic and accountable government. The actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Collins, not to mention the Minister for Communications, have been flawed and incompetent in a practical sense that they have created chaos and damaged Australia's standing in an international industry. More than that, they have been in direct conflict with basic principles of responsible government which in the past have been the great strength of our system of government, based as it is on the system of government at Westminster. Finally, they have ignored a basic principle of legislation in a free society-that the law will not impose retrospective penalties on citizens, for this is what the legislation before the House today does and this is why the Opposition will oppose it. The reason we have this legislation before us today is that on 19 January the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, signed a determination establishing a process for tenders for licences to operate subscription television. This process was intended to implement the concept of a price based allocation of licences. This concept is one which the Opposition supports. A price based system breaks away from the approach used in the past which is sometimes called a 'beauty contest'. That procedure required the establishment of a whole range of characteristics and qualities in tenderers before a tender was accepted. Its inevitable effect was to give a huge advantage in licence applications to existing players in the industry and to make it exceedingly difficult for new players to enter. It was a process which easily gave rise to the suspicion that the media mates of the Government were being given favoured treatment. It was a process which failed, despite all this, to give any ironclad assurance that the successful applicants would nevertheless be viable; hence the decision to establish a new approach. This approach opened the door to new players. In principle it would give them time to raise the necessary finance and establish the necessary basis for a competitive service and broaden the basis of the industry. The key responsibility on the Government in implementing this new approach was to establish a process which worked, which did not open the door to speculative bidding and which would not excessively delay the establishment of a subscription television service in Australia-a process which clearly, on its face, protected and advanced the public interest. The Government failed that test. It established a process in which bidders for a licence worth perhaps $200 million could submit a bid for nothing more than a $500 application fee. It established a process in which bidders could submit multiple reducing bids, so that if their first bid was unsuccessful they could have second and subsequent bids for lower amounts considered with very little restraint, if any, on the numbers of such bids built into the process. Members of the public would find it impossible· to understand how any person of common sense could have established this process at the start. Every person who buys a home at auction knows that he is liable for a deposit, which is usually 10 per cent of the final price, as a test of good faith. If this is required of a person buying a $100,000 house, how much more is a substantial deposit required of someone bidding for a licence worth possibly over $200 million? It is even more difficult to understand how this could have occurred when it is recognised, as everyone does recognise, that it is nonnal procedure in tenders of this kind to establish such a requirement for a successful and substantial deposit. Yet, when Senator Collins signed his detennination on 19 January, he did nol notice the absence of such a requirement. He did not ask about it. Why? It was because, he said, he wanted to keep at ann's length-that was his phrase-from the process. He did not want to be seen to be interfering in the process recommended by officers of his department. He said he was fearful that, if he did anything, he might be accused of acting to help the Government's media mates. The stupidity-and it is nothing less-of that attitude of Senator Collins, if indeed that was his attitude, is blindingly obvious. He could not avoid involvement because if the process which he approved-apparently without reading it-were demonstrated to be deficient, he could come under very strong pressure to remedy it. In his own account, his failure to act at the time has forced him to act later. So much for remaining at ann's length! He is not only now not acting at ann's length; he is proposing to introduce retrospective legislation which is obnoxious in principle and which changes the rules of the game for all subsequent tenderers. Having floated delicately around the initial decision like a fairy, he has now crashed through the tender process like a Northern Territory buffalo, creating chaos all around him. Senator Collins has acted in a state of fearful trepidation, not to say panic, throughout this whole sorry process, doubtless because he knew of the very keen, but not entirely predictable interest of the Prime Minister in the development of pay TV. His trepidation is now painfully obvious and the obvious conclusion is that, if his own account of his actions is correct, he was indeed acting in a state of fear and panictoo fearful, it seems, even to read the initial tenns of the tender process. He has acted with extraordinary and unjustifiable haste .once the process has come under criticism. Throughout he has shown a staggering lack of understanding of the role of a Minister in our system of government and of the proper relationship of a Minister to his department. The simple principle on which our whole system of government is based is that a Minister is responsible and accountable for his administration of his department. A Public Service department is not an independent statutory authority which has a high degree of autonomy from a Minister. Section 64 of the Constitution provides that Ministers are appointed by the Governor General to administer the departments of state. The officials of the department are there to advise the Minister. If they give him good advice, the Minister gets the credit; if they give him bad advice and the Minister is unwise enough to accept it, the Minister takes the blame. The Minister cannot absolve himself from blame, as Senator Collins has attempted to do in this case, by saying that, while he signed the determination, he did not read the attached rules for the tender process. Members of this House will recall the famous occasion in the last Government when the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories sought to evade responsibility for a total1y unsatisfactory kit on the environment distributed by her department by saying that she had approved the cover, but not the contents. Obviously Senator Co11ins has been learning rapidly about how government is conducted by his colleagues but he has learnt the wrong principles. He cannot avoid responsibility by saying that he approved the cover note-the determination but not the contents, the tender guidelines. He cannot get away from his responsibility in this matter by this sort of subterfuge. It did not help the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and it does not help him. It is evident, however, that Senator Collins is determined to overturn the entire principle. of ministerial responsibility. His first reaction has been to blame officials in his department. Ms Christine Goode, a senior officer in this matter, has stood aside. Last week it was reported that officers of the staff of Senator Collins were briefing the press that Ms Goode had stood aside for health reasons, and we were left with the inevitable suspicion that Ms Goode was to be the scapegoat for the Minister's blunders. Now we have another public statement that she has stood aside by mutual agreement. But today the Minister in the Senate, when pressed by very direct questions from Senator Alston, failed to answer the question of who initiated the process which led to Ms Goode standing aside. That question remains unanswered and, as a consequence, our suspicions in this matter remain unsatisfied. Senator Collins has a clear responsibility under the Constitution to administer his department. But it is not he apparentlyalthough I concede there is some ambiguity in the press release issued on this matterwho has established the independent inquiry into this matter. He announced it but it appears to be an inquiry established by his departmental head who has been kind enough to advise Senator Collins of the terms of reference for this inquiry. However, the Minister is apparently perfect1y happy with the situation. He is treating his department in this case as if it were an independent authority and not one of the major departments of state. It is the Minister's own responsibility, surely, if he is dissatisfied with the performance of his department or its officers, to inquire into its operation. What is the logic of establishing this independent inquiry? Apparently his inquiring into the administration and functioning of his own department would be inconsistent with the myth that he is attempting to weave: that he runs the whole show in a hands off, laissez faire manner. If it is inconsistent with that, he should take action when he is dissatisfied with the performance of his officials. The terms of the independent inquiry require an answer to the question, and I will read the question from the terms of reference: Was the advice [in relation to the non-inclusion in the draft determination of deposit requirements] sufficient to alert the Minister to the fact that he was adopting a process, which did not involve deposit requirements, by signing the Determination? Let us contemplate the possibility that the answer to this question is yes, because the process which the Minister established is certainly one which, in the ordinary course of events, would hold an attraction to the officers in the department to establish with the inquiry that they had acted properly and that they had given the Minister the advice that it was their obligation to provide. So we have to contemplate the possibility that the answer to this question may be yes, that advice sufficient to alert the Minister was offered. If the answer to that question is yes, it seems that the Prime Minister has no option but to sack the Minister, for he has consistently denied that this is the case. The process that the Minister has set up is one which establishes a conflict between himself and the officers of his department, each trying to establish that right and proper behaviour is on their side. That seems a most extraordinary process to have established in a system of responsible government. I do not reflect in any way at all on the integrity independent inquiry the Minister has established, but the question that I have asked is alone sufficient to show that it is not a suitable process to establish the facts that need to be established. The Opposition has consistently supported a full Senate inquiry, and this remains the appropriate form of investigation into the fiasco which has just occurred. Reference to the Senate inquiry brings me to the Minister for Communications, who is at the table. It is quite clear that the Minister is being sidelined as far as possible in this whole sorry process. It appears that he was not informed until some hours later about the terms of the inquiry. He was unable to answer questions about the terms of reference of the inquiry when these were well known to the media. I presume-the Minister may care to answer this at some point-that he was not thought important enough to be informed of them, even though he is the Minister for Communications. But I daresay that his senior Minister has drawn certain conclusions, as has the Prime Minister probably, about the capacity of this Minister in this matter, because he was sent in by the Government to heroically defend the Minister for Tran:;;port and Communications, Senator Collins. He has stumbled and fallen so many times in this chamber in his effort to defend his Minister that his future has been placed under question even though he has only been in the portfolio for a relatively short time. It is clear that the officials department will not be looking to the Minister for Communications to ensure that natural justice is accorded to them before they are scapegoated for his failures. The reason for the sidelining of the Minister for Communications is obvious to all honourable members: he has been unable to respond to even the most straightforward question. Unlike Senator Collins, who has admitted that there was no legal reason for the Government not to have included a five per cent deposit in the original terms of reference, the Minister for Communications has not yet been able to bring himself to make a clear statement on this matter. His grasp of his portfolio is apparently too weak to make him feel comof the fortable admitting anything. So far he has contrived to mislead the House into believing that there was some reason why a deposit requirement could not have been inserted in the tender conditions, even though Senator Collins has admitted that there was no such reason. The continual assertions by the Minister for Communications that this is not the case are simply not supported by the Hansard record. There is no clear statement by the Minister in Hansard that it was legitimate to have included a five per cent deposit requirement in the initial tender conditions. The Minister has consistently contrived to mislead the House into the belief that it was somehow or other improper and illegal for such a condition to have been placed in the initial conditions for the tender. We saw precisely the same problem in Question Time today with this Minister. When asked to explain the change in the Government's policy in relation to microwave technology for pay TV, and when confronted __ with a direct quotation from Senator Collins last November, before the change, that microwave technology would have equal chance with satellite technology, the Minister attempted to suggest that there had actually been no change-that the statements by Senator Collins then were perfectly consistent with Senator Collins's statements now and the Prime Minister's statements now and that there was no inconsistency, even though in the everyone reading the documents could see that there was a striking and manifest inconsistency. The reason for that inconsistency was that there has been a massive change of policy brought about by the direct intervention of the Prime Minister in this matter. The Minister for Communications finds it exceedingly difficult to admit what to everybody else is undeniable. In the words of Gilbert and Sullivan, so far as the Minister for Communications is concerned, 'and all is right as right can be'. He was not surprised by the size of the winning bids in this process. Even though the whole of the television and international industry were surprised, the Minister for Communications was not surprised because, through his special insight into the industry, he took a different view as to the value of these licences. What basis he had for that different view was and remains a mystery-it has never been explained. Let me give the Minister a tip. If he persists in this approach he not only will make himself more and more ridiculous but also will continue, as he has already done, to find himself more and more contradicting senior Ministers of the Government who can see the absurdity of attempting to deny the undeniable, even if the facts are somewhat uncomfortable. I come to the Opposition's conclusions on the amendments the Government has placed before the House in the present Bill. These amendments seek to insert into the Act a provision that, if the tenderers for licence A and licence B are unsuccessful, the tenderer who thereby has the opportunity to be assessed for the licence-the next in line-will be required to provide a deposit of five per cent of the amount bid by that tenderer within three days Of being given that opportunity. Obviously, this is not a condition which applied when the tenderers entered into the process established by the Government. It is not a condition which applied to the original highest bidders; it is a new condition which is to apply only to later bidders. It is a very clear detriment to the later bidders. Indeed, it is probably intended that it will force a number of them out of the process or, at least, the withdrawal of a number of bids. It means that no other bidder will have the same opportunities as the initial winning bidders to establish the financial position which would enable them to obtain the final award of the licence. This is clearly unjust. It is a retrospective change to the legal situation governing the process and; as such, it is in clear breach of the principle against retrospective legislation. It is an action which, despite all the denials of the Government, has undoubtedly served to weaken the standing of the successful bidders in the marketplace. When I say that I am in no way overlooking some of the interesting features of the existing bidders. It is the case that the chainnan of one of the successful companies in the tendering process, and to whom the Minister referred in his statement announcing the so-called winning bids, has stated publicly that he was not the chainnan of that company. Therefore, I take it that the Minister believes he has been misled in this process. The fact is that the process has been established. It was set up on particular rules and the tenderers were given a specific and defined opportunity to establish themselves as the providers of subscription pay television services by satellite. Despite all its protestations, nobody in the industry doubts that the Government has-by the panicky way in which it has responded to these eventsserved to weaken the position of the successful tenderers in the marketplace. The Minister did it in his joint press release with Senator Collins, who has dragged the Minister unwittingly into this fiasco. The legislatipn that the Government is putting before the House is premature. While delays are possible, it is not at all certain that excessive delays will occur. The tenders can be withdrawn at any time and the existing process may well move more rapidly than the number of bids, which the Minister does not know and which apparently cannot be finally revealed or established. Nevertheless, the Minister has acted on the basis of the public statement that there will be undue delays in the process. But this is not at all certain. There is some flexibility in the process, yet the Government has decided to change the process midstream without giving it a chance to work. We have here a government which has acted in a way that has created chaos at the establishment of an important industry. The Government has not been prepared to defend its initial actions. The Government has established an inquiry into its own conduct, and it is making Australia a laughing stock in the international industry. What is the pressure on the Government? What is the Government afraid of? What are these Ministers afraid of? Perhaps they are afraid of the Prime Minister who, in Question Time today, condemned Ministers who signed papers put up before them without carefully reading them. Who was he referring to? To me it sounded suspiciously like he might ha-e been referring to Senator Collins, and Senator Collins must be deeply worried that the Prime Minister holds such Ministers in contempt. Every member of this House and the public have an anticipation that, because the administration of the communications portfolio in this Government has been so dramatically mishandled, we will see changes in the administration of that portfolio in the not too distant future. I cannot remember a government which has got off to such an atrocious start as this Government. I have to say that it is no surprise to the Opposition that this is the case, because we observed the policy-less campaign that the Government conducted against us and the campaign of lies and misrepresentation it took to the people. We knew it was a government without substance and every action that has occurred since the election has confirmed that judgment. The Opposition opposes this legislation.",39
92,Mr ELLIOTT,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Parramatta) (4.48 p.m.)When the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) started out on his address to the House today he said that pay TV was not at the top of the national agenda and that it was not an issue to which the majority of Australians devoted a lot 'of attention. It is interesting to note, after listening to the honourable member and reflecting on the 3D-minute diatribe we have just heard, that the Opposition has brought almost everything into this debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No.2), which seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act, from the economy to issues going way beyond the Bill. It reinforces the fact that during Question Time in this parliamentary session more questions have been asked of the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) about pay TV than have been asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about any issue or, indeed, asked of any other Minister about the economy and all of the things that the Opposition says are the top political agenda items. That highlights the fact that the Opposition really does not have policies on any of those issues. Its policies relating to pay TV have certainly been confusing. At this stage, rather than recognise amendments which might be useful to correct a potential problem in relation to pay TV to ensure it is introduced at the earliest possible time through a fair and sensible process, the Opposition is creating as much mischief as it can through more Senate inquiries. I would have thought that, as a result of the past Senate inquiries llbout pay TV and all the other inquiries we have had, the suggestion that we now need another Senate inquiry into aspects of pay TV is the very way to ensure that there is no action. I suspect that what the honourable member for Goldstein was all about today was ensuring that further delays can be put in the way of the process of getting a sensible pay TV regime. The amendments that are actually before the House relate to the requirement for a five per cent deposit. The amendment proposes that the Broadcasting Services Act be amended to relate to other than the initial bids; that in relation to further announcements about bids there be a five per cent non-refundabledeposit in respect of the subsequent allocation and that that be a process that overcomes the difficulty that may occur-we cannot say it definitely will occur-if the bids that have been announced so far cannot meet the financial commitments within the time frame after they have been assessed by the ABA and the Trade Practices Commission. That really brings us back to the point of what we are trying to achieve in relation to pay TV. What are the reasons we want to ensure a pay TV arrangement that is viable, affordable to all Australians who want it and that represents an opportunity to have the best. technology that the current discussion about pay TV can create? In much of the public debate about pay TV over the last few weeks, those issues have largely been forgotten. The question of how we get the best technology has not received much attention. The question of how we ensure an affordable pay TV regime, a comprehensive coverage of the pay TV network and issues like that do not seem to figure too much in the Opposition's approach to this issue. Rather, those opposite just want to focus on the narrow perspective relating to the tender arrangements for pay TV. The Government has made it clear that there is a potential deficiency in the tender process that was adopted. This is a measure that is designed to correct it, should the proposals that have already been announced as the highest bidders fail to comply with their financial terms. I would have thought appropriate thing to do would be to wait until the inquiry that the Minister for Transport Communications (Senator Collins) referred to yesterday in the Senate, to be chaired by the former Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce, had been completed. That inquiry will look at the actions of the Departwhen ment of Transport and Communications on these issues, and how it referred advice about the tender process to the Minister for Transport and Communications. The Opposition should let that inquiry proceed rather than, it has, pass judgment before the inquiry has taken place. Instead of that we have this lengthy and quite confusing proposal from the shadow Minister. I must say that he was sticking very closely to the script and that was probably wise on the one hand. Nevertheless, he failed to recognise that we have consistently adopted in this area a bidding process, a price based process, which is designed to remove the sorts of allegations we were constantly accused of in the ment, that we were somehow going to have pay TV handed over to a few players; there was not going to be any opportunity for new players; there was going to be a process which did not allow new entrants to come into the market. When the Government originally adopted the pay TV regime, with the two licences A and B, it was made very clear that licence A would preclude existing media players and existing telecommunications companies from being involved. Licence A was going to allow new players to be part of the media industry in Australia. Licence B was going to give the opportunity to existing players to be part of pay TV. Why were the two arrangements there? There were two fundamental reasons: first of all, the agreed understanding that it was desirable to encourage new players into media provision in Australia and, secondly, a recognition of the large scale investment that went with pay TV, the development of technology that that required and the fact that only certain people had the expertise to provide the programming for pay TV as well as the free to air television services. All those things come together because the the Government is not only concerned to provide the best pay TV mechanism but also conand cerned that we do not have a loss of the quality and content of production within the free to air television services. What we know at this stage, irrespective of the discussion that has gone on in this place today, is that pay TV starts up, there is not going to be the technology that provides it right across the country. It is not going to be delivered to all of the nation from the outset. We have to ensure that we get as comprehensive a pay as TV service as possible. How do we do that? First of all, we recognise that digital technology is the best way of trying to ensure that, using the satellite, the compressed technology process offers the technology advantage and the most modem mechanism to try to ensure that pay TV is delivered to as many Australian households as wish to buy it. Secondly, we want to ensure that where the opportunity might exist for new technologies to develop in the future, the mechanisms that we have in last Parlia- place allow that to occur. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) referred to discussion tod-y about technology and so on. Through all those discussions, it was basically recognised that if we adopt an inferior technology at this stage which is redundant within twelve months because of the rapid pace of technological change in this area we would be doing a great disservice to the industry and to the consumer of pay television. In respect of MDS, the microwave technology, it was felt all the way through that process, based on all the briefings and advice that were provided, that clearly it was more in the narrow cast sort of role that the Prime Minister referred to today in Question Time. The idea that you can cobble together some sort of comprehensive pay television service using MDS technology no one could responsibly suggest is feasible. It is not the right way to go. We would be saying to consumers that they should have second rate pay TV technology today. They should spend the money buying that particular service now and within 12 months, maybe 18 months, they would have a technology that was redundant. I do not think that would be very sensible, either in terms of industry development or what the consumer is trying to get from pay TV. The Government made clear in announcements last year that it was going to ensure that we use the digital technology with the capacity for cable development that one hopes is not too far down the track. All those things, I think, were designed to ensure we had a pay TV arrangement which was technologically driven, which was positive in - erms of technological development, and which, at the same time, offered the important provisions that our pay TV arrangements are designed to achieve. We wanted to ensure that the role of the ABC in the television media was not marginalised in this process. We wanted to give the ABC, as we have done by giving it two channels, the opportunity to participate in the latest in television technology. It has certainly been a lea?er, both in t-e discussions about pay TV and m technological change in these areas. - e. did that in two ways: first of all, by glvmg the ABC two channels and ensuring it had that right. Also, the Government allocated $12.5 million to encourage its participation pay TV. . - e Opposition consistently made clear that It did not see that as part of the objective Government. It did not see the ABC as particularly important in this whole process. F?rthermore, t-e Opposition's proposal in Flghtback, leadmg up to the last election to cut $50 million out of the ABC's budget - as concerned to try to marginalise the ABC even more than pay TV had the potential to do. I do not know if that is the Oppositions's - urrent policy. Who knows what its policy is ill respect of the ABC today. But one thing is for. sure, it has consistently been against trymg to encourage the development of technological change that allowed the ABC to be part of it. .If th-re is going to be a comprehensive diSCUSSIOn on pay TV, it is worth talking about programming issues. In all the debates t?at occurred last year about pay TV, opposition members consistently said they did not care about having any provisions that related to Australian content, or about using pay TV to be a more comprehensive addition to the production of. Austra-is 's television programs, be they mOVies, more comprehensive news services or more comprehensive sporting coverage. They were not seen as important thresholds by the Opposition. Clearly, one of the great attributes of pay TV in the development that we undertake is the industry development potential it offers to Aus-ralia as an exporter of this expertise and services to our region. The Opposition said that it was not interested. in any of those things. The market driven forces on the other side basically said, 'We are not interested in encouraging industry plans and all there should be in this whole process is just a price based process and nothing else'. None of the other criteria that the Government had talked thr-ugh a-d industry was keen to see supported m vanous ways mattered to the Opposition. All that mattered was a process where the price based mechanism was part of the consideration. The Government-I think quite rightly-did adopt a process which said, 'Yes, we want in new players. No, we are not going to pander to anybody despite all the hysteria and conspiracy theories that are run in different parts by the media and by the Opposition on these of issues. No, there is not going to be any favoured arrangement. Yes, we are going to hav- a price based process, encourage Austrahan content, further the industry potential of pay television, and encourage technological development to produce the best pay TV regime'. These will be clear priorities in what we try to do. At the end of that process the tender arrangement that will be adopted will be subject to those sorts of things being worked out on th- way. The Australian Broadcasting Authonty and the Trade Practices Commission would have a clear role: looking at the bids in order to ensure that they met the fundamental requirements on the various issues I have been talking about. We have reached the point with this amendment where bids have been lodged. It is clear from media reports that there is certainly the potential for multiple bids to be raised that can create delays. It is also clear from the reports on these issues that, with the bids have been talked about, there· is potential for further delays in the investigation of each of those multiple bid arrangements, and a protracted delay could occur as a result of that process. The Government has made the decision that there is going to be a threshold level for the follow-on bids from the first round of successful bidders to ensure that we get pay TV at a reasonably early opportunity, and to ensure that there is not a protracted delay with each potential bid. It is not the prerogative the Parliament to say what bids are there at this stage. If we set up a regime that needs some amendment, I think it is better to say that there may be a potential deficiency there. The Parliament will have to deal with that so that we can get pay TV reasonably early and have a regime that assesses the further bids responsibly, and that does have a financial threshold of a five per cent non-refundable deposit. That deposit does relate to financial viability. It also means that an unfavourable report from the Trade Practices Commission will not jeopardise that deposit. I think that is entirely consistent with the process that was being talked about last year. In no sense can that be said to be pandering to any other player in the media. No-one knows what other bids might be influenced in any sense by this process. We are not concerned about that. We are concerned to ensure that there is not a protracted delay. It was certainly not the intention of the original proposal nor of the bidding process to delay the assessment unnecessarily in a way that when the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Trade Practices Commission complete the matter they then find that the financial resources are not available to meet the bid requirements. In the original proposal there is the 30-day requirement to ensure that viability. That is something the two highest bids have to meet. All of the conjecture about the process undoubtedly cannot be helping, but we have to ask ourselves: where did this conjecture start? Who created that sense of confusion? Senator Alston has produced statements day after day on these issues. He is trying to muddy the that waters in order to make it as difficult as possible to reach a pay TV arrangement that can be sustained. That has not been something that has been driven by the Government. Having recognised a potential delay process because of the bidding process arrangements that were determined at the outset, in my view it is incumbent on the Government to say, 'Yes, we are going to act to amend that particular part of the bidding process and the Broadcasting Act so that we will have a price based structure'. It will not be something that of is driven by other factors of wanting to give a particular bidder any advantage. We are not trying to chart a course that is advantageous to one player. We recognise that we have still got licence A and licence B. Licence A will be there for a new player to come in which, hopefully, will be a new and positive infusion to the media industry in Australia. Licence B, a price based structure, is a free go for all media players and other entrants to that part. At the end of that process-it will not take too long because of the amendment that is being discussed in the Parliament today-we then come back and get a pay TV arrangement that ensures the early introduction of pay TV, but not with an inferior technology that covers only a small portion of the country and not with an arrangement which says that we are going to adopt any technology that might exist before we can get the compressed digital technology into place. We will then allow the pay TV industry to develop in a positive and a constructive way. Pay TV is a big investment. We are not just dealing with the cost of the licence. It is a big investment in industry terms, in production terms, and in content. All those things mean that it is more important to get the process right rather than be bound to say that we are going to allow a process regardless of whether a potential deficiency has been identified. We are going to have the good sense to amend the Act to ensure that we can overcome that deficiency. I think the Government is entirely accurate in moving to amend the law in this way and have a bidding process which is· still price based but which at the same time ensures that there are not protracted delays because of multiple bids or other provisions which might have occurred which diminish the opportunity to have pay TV introduced in Australia in a sensible way as soon as is possible.",45
93,Mr COSTELLO,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Higgins) (5.08 p.m.)Let us be frank about the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No.2). It comes before the House today because of monumental government incompetence. It is before .the House to try to rectify a system that has gone completely wrong over the last 11 days. In all of the points that were made in the speech by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), there was not one reference as to why this Parliament ought to be debating this Bill or why this Bill has been brought on as being necessary. There has been no reference as to why the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No.2), which finally cleared the Parliament in 1992, has to be amended so early on in its life. There is expression of m-a culpa, no expression of guilt. The Government does not say, 'We mucked it up; we did it wrong. We did it wrong for this reason or that reason, and that is why we need this amending Bill'. It is just a complete disregard of the facts. There is a complete inability on the Government's part to take responsibility for its own policy, its own actions, and its own administration. Let us also be frank and honest about one other thing: it is not as if the Government has not had time to get its house in order. We can go to North America and watch pay TV; we can go to Europe and watch pay TV; we can go to much of Asia and watch pay TV; but we cannot watch pay TV in Australia because it has been under a ban for nearly a decade here. For nearly a decade whilst the Government has had pay TV under a ban, it has had every opportunity to try to get a sensible and coherent policy in place, and it has failed. When the Government finally thought that there was legislation in place in 1992 which would permit the sensible introduction of pay TV into Australia, it has had to come back here and amend its own legislation in circumstances which are grubby and shabby and ought never to be allowed by this House. We have had so many twists and turns on pay TV over the last decade that the Government stands absolutely condemned. The latest manifestation of its pay TV policy occurred in 1992. This was the period when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) decided that he wanted to show himself a man of vision. He called up the Sunday program and did an interview with Laurie Oakes. He announced that pay TV was finally to come to Australia. The press ran on Sunday and Monday with what a great man of vision, adventurism and action the Prime Minister would prove to be over pay TV. Yet the sordid and sorry saga ever since indicates how he lacks vision, he lacks the ability to run a coherent policy, and he lacks the ability to ruIi a government that has basic common sense and reasonable standards of administration in the way in which it goes about its business. After the Prime Minister announced his grand vision for pay TV on the Sunday no program, we then saw factional warfare break out. What would be the cross-media ownership limits between television and pay television? Would they be 45 per cent or 35 per cent? What would the foreign ownership requirements be in relation to the pay TV satellite operation? Who would be allowed to tender and on what terms? Throughout the first week of June 1992 the Prime Minister's bold plan became enmeshed and mired in factional warfare, horse trading, favours and the buying of interest groups until it became virtually unrecognisable. Then at about 2 a.m. on Thursday, 4 June in a meeting with Senator Schacht and other factional leaders the most modem manifestation of the pay TV policy came about. I can remember how the public became aware of that 2 a.m. meeting when Australia's pay TV future was decided, because Senator Schacht appeared on the AM radio program that morning and he described to us how the Labor Party comes to considered decisions on pay TV and broadcasting policy. The interviewer asked: Exactly how did this policy emerge; where did this version three that we know about come from? Senator Schacht said: . .. during the discussion towards the end of yesterday morning, hethat is, the Prime Ministerjust suddenly said, 'Look, stop the discussion here. Will you people cop a model like this; that the licence, 1 to 4, has no players at all . .. ABC, commercial networks, telecommunications companies, newspapers and so on? So you get a new player under those rules; they get the first And then five and six transponders, which are a smaller capacity ... Senator Schacht continued: He said to myself and, I think, probably to John Langmorethe honourable member for Fraser might have even been present at that 2 a.m. meeting as well- . In almost a dare he said ... 'I dare you to take that up'. He almost said, 'I double dog dare you to take this one up'. Senator Schacht said: And there was a pause from myself and I said: you're on. That is the way the Labor Party decided its pay TV policy-in a factional meeting at 2 a.m. with the Prime Minister daring the factional representatives, and the factional representatives replying, 'You're on'. I will tell those opposite something, 'You're off'. Their policy stinks. It has been so mismanaged that it has all the hallmarks of a factional deal at 2 a.m., with incompetent people having no idea what they were supposed to be doing and so messing up the policy that the Government is here today trying to salvage some credibility out of what is an absolute policy disaster. Who could forget 4 June when the Prime Minister was asked about his various pay TV policies and backflips and he said, 'I've done more backflips than Greg Louganis'. He told the House that Greg Louganis had won a gold medal doing backflips. The Prime Minister probably had in mind that he would be awarded a gold medal, a Legion d'Honneur or one of those honours that he so craves as a result. But the Prime Minister's backflips, a la Greg Louganis, turned into a great bellyflop. He came down with a lot of backflips, a few pikes and several twists and landed flat on his belly. The fact is that in this Bill the Government is making an open admission of the failure of government policy. On 30 April this year the tenders closed in relation to licences A and B that were to be awarded under this mishmash, hopeless, first pathetic, incompetent, useless pay TV policy which those opposite put together after so many twists and turns. On 1 May-only 10 licence. days ago-the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) was absolutely exultant about the outcome of the tender process; the same tender process that we are now being asked to change. He said, 'Why wouldn't I be happy? I can go into Ralph Willis and say, ""Here's $389 million to help you with your budget""'. That indicates the basic driving force behind this pay TV allocation: it is all about trying to get money to balance Ralph's budget. The Minister said, 'Look what a great success I've been. I've got $389 million from two companies that nobody has ever heard of in relation to these pay TV licences'. He hailed that as a great success; a success which some 10 days later has to be changed completely. In the days that followed it turned out that one of the directors of Hi Vision-one of the successful tenderers-,-had jumped bail in the Philippines and was a well-known producer of X-rated videos. The company had $100 in paid up capital and had no business experience, yet it was bidding hundreds of millions of dollars for this pay TV licence. In relation to UCOM, the nominated chairman claimed that he had never been the chairman. He did not know how he had come to be named on the bid as the chairman of the company. So we had this unravelling of a policy that was cobb-ed together in the first place. The tenders Were greeted with great exultation but, as the facts dribbled out, it began to become apparent what had actually happened under the policy. It appears that not only did these companies bid these extraordinary amounts, but also there were multiple bids. The reason for this was that to get into the tender the tenderers had to pay only $500. There is a fair expectation that these multiple bids are collapsible bids, entered into in the expectation that the bid could be collapsed to reduce the price until the lowest price necessary was reached in order to beat those who were seasoned campaigners in the area of pay television. So we come to the House today with a Bill to insert what should always have been in the tender conditions: a requirement for a five per cent non-refundable deposit. But this requirement was not in the tender conditions drawn by the department and not in the tender conditions approved by the Minister. So having not put this requirement in the original tender conditions, the Government now says that, even though the tender has closed, it will insert a condition to apply to everybody other than the two companies who have actually won the tender process. The Government says it will change the rules mid-game. It will make one condition for the rest which will not apply to the two companies which nominated the highest price. Anybody who has been involved in tendering for anything knows that certain conditions are laid down, everybody comes in on an equal basis, they factor the conditions into their price and they tender. Can anybody name a building company or any other commercial enterprise which has changed the terms and conditions of a tender midstream? If any company tried to do this it would be up in court before one could say David Beddall. But because it is the Government's incompetence, it wants to try to introduce a legislative mechanism to change the bids midstream. It is not fair, it is not right and it is not in accordance with commercial practice. This situation has arisen only as a result of the Government's incompetence and the Opposition will not be a party to that kind of practice. Has the Government thought about the commercial implications of such a practice? Next time the Federal Government calls a tender, what are the tenderers supposed to think: that they are putting their bid in on the terms and conditions as they stand, or should they be anticipating change and taking that into account? Perhaps they should be thinking that, while they are competing on one set of terms and conditions, subsequent or lower tenderers may be competing on another. Does the Government have any idea of what this will do to government business and government relations in any future tender processes? Does it have any idea how this will pull government tender offers into disrepute? Has it any idea of the seriousness of engaging in a midstream change such as the one it is proposing? Does the Government come in here and say, 'Yes, we take responsibility. We mucked it up', and say that that forms the basis of this particular legislation? No, it does not. There is an absolute unwillingness on its part to face the facts, to admit responsibility, and to stick with bona fide commercial practices. The defences that have been put forward in this House are pathetic. The Minister for Communications said that there was no provision for a five per cent non-refundable deposit in the original determination because his legal advice was that such a provision would not be in accordance with the Act. However, when the same legal advice was produced, he could point to no sentence, no paragraph, no page of that advice that indicated that it would have been wrong to have had that condition included in the first place. The Minister was later belled by his own senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who that very night appeared on the Lateline program and said, 'Look at the advice. It's absolutely clear that there was no legal reason why we could not have included a deposit in the original terms of tender'. We had Minister Beddall in this place incompetently relying on legal advice which did not say what he maintained it said, and we had him being overruled by his senior Minister in the course of that 24-hour period. Senator Collins, who was responsible for the terms and conditions of tender, said, 'Well, I initialled the determination that set out the terms and conditions of the tender but you can't expect me to know that there was no requirement in there for· a five per cent deposit. So don't hold me responsible. If anybody is going to take the chop, it has to be somebody in the department'. If that is Senator Collins's position, and if that is right, what does he think is the point of requiring a Minister to sign a determination? If the Minister has no responsibility to actually read a determination, or to check its terms and conditions, why would the Minister sign it? If it is all the department's fault, if it is the control of the department, why does it go to the Minister for signature? I will tell honourable members why it goes to the Minister for signature. It is because the Minister is supposed to be responsible. The Minister is supposed to know what is in a determination and he is supposed to correct it if it is wrong. Senator Collins takes what is now known in this House as the 'Ros Kelly defence'. That is the defence of saying, 'I endorsed the cover but not the contents'. Senator Collins says that the only reason these things go to Ministers is so that they can sign the outside cover; that does not mean that the Minister is actually approving, checking or even perusing the terms and conditions of the determination. The Ros Kelly defence is and always has been an inadequate defence. It is not acceptable under a system of ministerial responsibility, and it is not acceptable for Senator Collins to employ it. Minister Beddall took the defence of asserting claims and arguments in the face of the facts. His defence was to say that black was white; to say, 'A legal opinion that did not say what I said it did, does say it and absolves me. I might have been present on that particular day, but in reality I wasn't'. It is the. 'I did the act but I am not guilty' type of defence. There has never been a weaker performance in this House than that of Minister Beddall when attempting to justify the position he took. Contrast that with the stance taken by the US Attorney-General, Ms Janet Reno. She earned a great deal of respect after the Waco disaster because she stood up and said, 'The buck stops here'. She took responsibility. She knew what the. obligation of a Minister was. But Minister Beddall is no Janet Reno, that is for sure. He does not understand the meaning of ministerial responsibility. There has been a lot of talk in this country recently about our constitutional arrangements. The real problem with our constitutional arrangements does not lie at the level of the head of state; it lies at the level of Ministers. How can Ministers be made accountable for their actions? How can they be made accountable for their negligence and all in incompetence? How does the public get the kind of service that it requires from departments? Under the Westminster system, it gets that service by making the Minister responsible and accountable to the Parliament. If the Parliament, divided on party lines, will not make the Minister responsible, the public must look to a Prime Minister who insists on standards-a Prime Minister who says, 'I do not find this conduct good enough'. That is why every ministerial failure is a failure by the Prime Minister of the day-and this is a failure by this Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister will not assert standards of responsibility for his Ministers, then their failures become his failures. It becomes his incompetence, his negligence, his responsibility. In relation to this debacle, the Opposition is saying that Ministers ought to be taking responsibility. The Government should not sideline public servants in the departments and say that it is their responsibility. They do not go around in cars, collecting the salaries that Ministers do. They are not called 'Minister'. They do not answer questions in the House. They are not the people who are responsible in elections. They are not the people who sit in Cabinet. They are not the people reporting to the Prime Minister. The people who do those things are the Ministers. These two Ministers have failed the basic test of competence; they have failed in their responsibilities-and now the Prime Minister will not make them accountable. The Prime Minister should be making those Ministers accountable for their incompetence and for their actions-rather than coming back into this House, trying to change terms and conditions of a tender long after the event, applying them to some of the tenderers and not others, and trying to pick up an error that should never have been made in the first place but which cannot now be properly rectified in accordance with commercial practice. This legislation should be opposed.  Deputy Speaker, this debate has been a total anticlimax. To review the first two weeks of this Parliament, the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) are the two government Ministers who have received the most questions. Here the Government is introducing an amendment to legislation to rectify a potential problem. One would have thought that would have provoked a full-scale attack by the Opposition. What did we get from the shadow Minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who represents Senator Alston in this chamber? It was a pathetic response. If he was a terror in academia, he is certainly a damp squib in this ParliamentMr Elliott-A diatribe!  a fire in his belly, I would hate to be here when he had none because no audio system would pick it up. What does the shadow Minister say about the pay TV issue? He says that pay TV is not a national issue; that it not important. He is the shadow Minister for ensuring that Australia and Australian industries have access to the latest technology, but he is saying, 'We can do without this technology'. What a hypocrite! Mr Elliott-And he wants to be leader!  my friend the honourable member for Parramatta points out. When did the Opposition outline its policy on pay TV? Did we hear one comment about where its policy differed from ours? As my friend the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, there was a great deal of consideration on the matter of pay TV. One of the Government's major concerns was to ensure that the established players did not get a jump start, although it certainly wanted them in the race. I wonder what the Opposition's comments would have been if the favourites-Packer, Channel 9, Telecom and the other TV station bid-had got up? We would have been listening to a debate about how this Government, in an arms-length process that I would not believe to be possible, favours its mates. That is what the attack would have been. One of the considerations in this instance was to ensure that all players had an opportunity to put in a bid. One of the easiest things to do is to put hurdles in their way. As the Minister for Communications has said, we were successful in our desire to get a fulsome number of tenderers, active players, into the arena, although it may have a potential deficiency. I do not think the Opposition has any criticism of that. That is what this legislation is designed to rectify. I draw the House's attention to the remarks that the shadow Minister, Senator Alston, made in the Meet the Press program on Sunday night. I was pleased to listen to him. He said that small industry players had told him that they would be able to set up a pay TV system for a fraction of the cost suggested by network applicants. He said that the American networks miscalculated their bids when vying for pay TV licences in the United States. He then said: It may well be the case here that these licences are is worth much more than the major players were - repared to bid.. Smaller players will say the networks are gomg· for a Rolls Royce system costing $300 million. This is the policy of the Opposition; this is exactly what we have done. As the Minister has said, we are rectifying what could be perceived as a potential problem-and so we should. Many claims have been made by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), one being that it has been a sordid saga. The actions of the Government ought to be sup, ported and, if they cannot be supported, at least the Opposition should put up its alternatives. What alternatives did it put up? What amendments is it moving to this legislation? In what way does the Opposition want the Government to change its course of action? All it does is raise a protest flag of totally opposing these amendments when the shadow Minister in Meet the Press on Sunday endorsed the Government's action. That was pointed out by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Question Time. Opposition members are hypocrites. We have instituted an inquiry into the role of the Department of Transport and Communications. The honourable member for Goldstein says, 'This is terrible. We should not have such an inquiry. It should be conducted by a Senate committee'. Let me remind the honourable member that he is a member of the House of Representatives. It would be nice if, for once, shadow ministers in the House of Representatives stood up for their own chamber and its processes rather than act as errand boys for the Senate. This inquiry is being conducted by Professor Pearce, a professor of law at the Australian National University and a former Commonwealth Ombudsman. I find it objectionable in the extreme that the shadow Ministers in the Opposition should suggest that there is something sordid about a former ombudsman of the Commonwealth agreeing to undertake this inquiry. How dare they reflect on his integrity. Do they really believe that Professor Pearce would accept the brief to conduct such an inquiry if he felt that the terms of reference were inappropriate or not comprehensive enough? Of course he would not. It is outrageous that they use the forms of this House to attack such a learned person. We can understand the frustration of opposition members when it comes to dealing with legislation in the communications and broadcasting area. If we want to reflect on the 30 years that they were in government, their sole achievement was to introduce TV in 1956. What a sorry record. Compare that with what the Labor Government has done. We have seen the introduction of aggregation and the benefits it has brought, the introduction of FM radio licences, the introduction of a second carrier and the merger of OTC and Telecom. Now we are seeing the introduction of pay TV. But the troglodyte shadow Minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein, says Australians should not have it; it is not of important national interest. What a disgrace he is to his shadow ministry, let alone representing the shadow Minister for communications in this chamber. I am quite happy to read into Hansard the terms of reference of the inquiry. However, it is most appropriate that when the department looked at PM radio licences, the third mobile licence and the introduction of the second carrier, a deposit was required. Here we have an instance where it was not required. As Senator Alston says, that approach is quite appropriate if we want to get players other than the established players into the bidding process. The department had every right to let the Minister know, and that is why we are having the inquiry. Unfortunately, neither of the members of the Opposition who spoke in this debate has any idea of what it is like to be a Minister. They would not know what it is like to handle the paper load. On such a fundamental and important issue, most reasonable people would expect the department to advise the Minister. That is why we are having the inquiry. I conclude on this point. The Government has acted-and it ought to be congratulated by the Opposition-to remove what may be a potential problem. Here is the legislation and here are the amendments. In contributing to this debate, not one opposition member was able to outline in this chamber what the Opposition's policy was or is, whether they have changed it or whether the shadow Minister speaking on Meet the Press is stating it all. If he is, those opposite have no objection. They have not said in what way they want the Government to change its approach. If they did, they would have moved amendments, but they have failed to do that. I say to all honourable members of this House that this legislation should be supported, and I commend these amendments to the House. Mt BEDDALL (Rankin-Minister for Communications) (5.38 p.m.)-in reply-I will not delay the House unduly, but I do wish to say that I am disappointed that the Opposition will not be supporting this amendment. I hope that by the time the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No.2) reaches the Senate that view will change. The Government has clearly stated that it has identified a deficiency in the process, and this deficiency is being rectified by legislation. I ask the House to support the legislation. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Message from Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr BeddaJl) read a third time. NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 May, on motion by Mr Lindsay: That the Bill be now read a second time.  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is a straightforward Bill of a general administrative nature. It amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate measures previously tabled in the House as customs tariff proposals. This Bill is just a multitude of customs Bills which I have seen passed through the House in recent years. Indeed, in the three years that I have had responsibility as the shadow Minister for the Australian Customs Service, some 16 Bills amending customs Acts have been introduced and debated in this place. The piecemeal way in which the Government has approached customs legislation reflects its whole approach to industry policy. The Government's administration of customs legislation has been haphazard, to say the very least. Customs legislation is the mechanism by which government implements much of its industry policy. Industry measures which fall within the Australian Customs Service jurisdiction include tariffs, bounties, quotas, and excise. The livelihood of many Australian businesses is dependent on the customs service and its accurate provision of information. It is of great concern therefore that a situaAustralian tion such as the Midford Paramount case was allowed to occur. The Australian Customs Service's poor handling of this case led to the sale of the business, the loss of jobs, the loss of more than $20 million in revenue to business and to the Commonwealth. In the same way, the numerous amendments to the customs legislation and, indeed, the very complexity of the original Acts can make it difficult for other businesses to operate effectively. Of course, if for some reason these businesses do happen to get it wrong, the customs service imposes very heavy penalties. Let me give the House an idea of what business has to contend with. In 1987, the Government introduced the Customs Tariff Act incorporating the Customs Act of 1901. 1993 This is a very substantial document of some 550 pages. But not content with this, in t-e subsequent two years, the Government made seven amendments to that piece of legislation, adding a further 777 pages, and many more amendments have followed. My point is that we have a very cumbersome bundle of customs legislation. Its complexity leads to mistakes and anomalies both within government and in the private sector. I remind the House that the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991, which amends all previous amendments to correct an anomaly in respect of the tariff rate, for instance, on wheelchairs, was something which the coalition had warned the Government about in the early stages of discussion on the original Bill but on which the Government failed to act. I also recall the presentation of a customs Bill to the House and the presentation of amendments to that same Bill once it had reached the Senate. The Minister in charge of customs, Senator Schacht, last week announced a comprehensive review of the Australian Customs Service. According to the Minister, the review is to be wide ranging and will comprise a more. strategic review of the organisation than other recent investigations. I further understand that the review will examine issues of accountability and responsibility as well as customs relationship with other government and private sector bodies. The coalition supports the review of the Customs Service. In fact, we welcome it as being long overdue. However, I will be interested to note whether the terms of reference live up to the substance of the Minister's announcement. The coalition will be watching the conduct of the outcome of the review very carefully. Further, I put Minister on notice that we will be doing everything in our power to ensure the impleself-sufficient. mentation of those recommendations that will deliver a more effective, efficient and better target of customs services. I challenge the Minister to go one step further. In the light of the length and complexity of the customs legislation, given that it is used in the commercial world and that monetary penalties are applied in case of error, the Minister should also commission full review and a rewrite of the customs legislation. The new legislation should clear, concise, and written in plain English. should also be more streamlined and simple than the current Acts. Before I move to the substance of this Bill, I would like to make one final comment on the passage of customs legislation through the House. In the past, we have seen customs legislation frequently introduced into the House and debated within a week. This clearly compromises the principles of democfire racy and of open and accountable governpassed ment. It also places considerable pressure the business community, customs brokers, and the coalition when scrutinising the Bills. Perhaps the new Minister will give us his assurance that we will not see a repeat of situation over the term of this Parliament. I now tum to the provisions of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. As I mentioned at the outset, this Bill incorporates into customs tariff proposals which have been previously tabled in this House. The Bill provides for the reduction in excise duty gasoline used in aircraft, known as avgas and, secondly, an increase in excise duty on tobacco and tobacco products. The price of avgas will fall by a total of 2.1c per litre as a consequence of this Bill. This is in accordance with the Government's commitment to reduce excise of providing services funded by that duty falls. The 2.1c a litre reduction is the conseThere quence of two separate measures. Firstly, per litre fall reflects the cost savings made government as a result of its 1990 decision transfer Commonwealth owned aerodromes to on full local ownership and to encourage aeroto the dromes being funded by the Commonwealth to become commercially viable and eventually This is the second of a threestage program. The completion of the third stage will generate another 1c per litre reduction in the price of avgas, bringing the total savings to the aviation industry to 3c per litre. The rema1ning O.lc per litre reduction is the result of cost savings achieved by the Civil Aviation Authority following the removal of rescue and fire fighting services from the a secondary capital city airports. In 1991, the Civil Aviation Authority decided, after a be comprehensive review of and consultation It with the aviation industry, local authorities, and the Federal Airports Corporation, to remove rescue and fire fighting services from secondary airports. These airports include Archerfield in Brisbane, Bankstown in Sydney, Essendon and Moorabbin in Melbourne, Parafield in Adelaide and J andakot in Perth. It was agreed that the savings to the Civil Aviation Authority from the removal of the fighting and rescue services would be on to the aviation industry in the form on of lower excise rates for Avgas. The second element of the Bill is to increase the excise on tobacco and tobacco products by $5 per kilogram, raising the price this from $52.50 to $57.50. This measure was announced by the Government in the 1992 Budget and, according to the Budget statements, it is designed to address, in part, the legislation social costs of smoking. The coalition welcomes this measure. We have long been concerned about the health on costs of smoking as well as the additional burden that smoking related diseases places on the health system. This proposal will add $80 million to government revenue in this financial year, and $100 million in subsequent years. As I mentioned earlier, this is essentially a housekeeping Bill which the coalition duty as the cost will not oppose.",49
94,Mr KATTER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Kennedy) (5.48 p.m.)are two aspects to the Excise Tariff a 2c Amendment Bill and, whilst I desperately to want to speak on the second part of the Bill, to I really cannot stand up without speaking also the first part of the Bill. If ever we wanted see what people like Alexis de Tocqueville referred to as the tyranny of the majority, it is applied here in Australia in all its vicious intent. Sixty per cent of the people living in Sydney go to work of a morning on commuter transportation systems, as they do in Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide. According to a Federal Government report on railways in Australia, the annual losses on rail are $4,000 million, and I quote verbatim: More than half of these losses are attributable the losses on the commuter systems in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. So we have a figure of $2,000 million a year being paid to subsidise people to go to work in the three major cities which contain about half of Australia's population. The other half of we poor mugs who do not live in Sydney, Brisbane or Melbourne and who have to go to work of a morning-there is no commuter transportation in Queensland outside Brisbane; there might be some odd examples, but there is no commuter system outside Brisbane-pay around 50 per cent, I think is the latest figure, on our car by way of tariffs and by way of sales tax, and when we fill up with fuel we pay pretty close to around 100 per cent tax on our fuel. So, if you like, we pay a tax of 75 per cent when we go to work of a morning. We pay a tax on the cost of getting there at 75 per cent, whilst the people in the cities are subsidised to the tune of 50 per cent. That is the tyranny of the majority in operation. . However, it does not end there. At times I fly into the airport at Mount Isa. Under our government in Queensland, we had a fully operational control tower almost every hour of the week for the whole week. Now we do not have any control tower whatsoever. It had previously been decided that it was dangerous to land aeroplanes in Mount Isa and that a control tower was needed, but now this Government has decided that it is not dangerous to land in Mount Isa. In fact, it has been decided that it is so safe to land an aeroplane in Mount Isa that the fire tender has also been removed. So, if we have an accident, if a plane crashes, we hope someone will be looking-although there are no full-time staff at the airport, so I do not know who will be looking-and will race to the telephone to phone the fire brigade, which is nearly seven miles away. It is also to be hoped that the fire brigade officers will all be awake and can get out there quickly before everyone in the aeroplane is incinerated. Compare that situation with the facilities available in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne where there are control towers, fire tenders and people hanging out of every post in sight of the airport in case anything goes wrong. I am not denying that to the people in Sydney to and Melbourne-in fact I applaud those facilities-but how come they can have those facilities when we have had ours removed by this Government? If those on the Government side want to know why the people of Mount Isa removed their member of parliament, they need look no further than the airport. But that is not the end of the story. We used to have three airlines operating· into Mount Isa; now we have only two. Australian Airlines, the government carrier, at this point of time does not exist there. That is the thanks we got. We founded that airline. Qantas was founded by money raised in the shire of Cloncurry which comes within, I think, three miles of this airport. Mr Lindsay-And Townsville ",56
95,Mr KATTER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"We were the people who founded that airline; now we do not have the service. I take the interjection from the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and agree with him very strongly. He is also suffering from the same sort of tyranny of the majority that is operating in this country. Australian Airlines and Ansett each have half of a monopoly, but still we do not get the services. A couple of years ago the cost of airline flights was published in TIme magazine. The fare from Austin to San Francisco, right across the US continent, was $290. I checked the fare from Cairns to Brisbane for the same time and the return trip cost $700. So it was $290 versus $700. If people land at the airport at Cairns, they pay for the landing. If people land at the airport in Brisbane, the Government pays. So those people living in North Queensland have the user pays principle applied to them whilst the people in cities have the taxpayers pay for them. For the Government to come in here and applaud itself for cutting back a couple of cents on aviation fuel is an exercise in arch hypocrisy. More important still is the situation in Mareeba. Constantly, this Government has applied macro policies but not taken any notice whatsoever of the micro implications of the decision which has been taken. That can be clearly seen with tobacco. I know many of the people here will say tobacco is unhealthy and that we are trying to stamp it out. All right, if we are trying to stamp it if it is so dangerous, for heaven's sake ban the thing, but do not slowly torture to death the people of Mareeba, as the Government is doing at the present moment. Mareeba, a town of 12,000 people, has only one industrytobacco. Forty per cent or $20 million less will be coming into that community than the $50 million which was coming in three years ago. I do not know how that money can be replaced. The economists say that it is 30 jobs for every $1 million. That is 600 jobs which have gone up in smoke in Mareeba. We are persecuting the smokers. It is almost as though all the smokers in Australia are being treated like lepers. People with AIDS are not treated that way, but people that smoke most certainly are. I leave it to honourable members to decide which is the most dangerous of the diseases and which needs to be quarantined-and I quote the late Professor Fred Hollows as my authority in that respect. I come back to smoking. People say they can grow something else. For a number of years I was Minister for Northern Development in the Queensland Government. We had two officers permanently employed, along with at least half a dozen officers from the DPI, putting in experimental crops. For a number of reasons which I will not bore the House with, it was found to be almost impossible. We went into mangos, which looked like a viable alternative. The mango industry is hopelessly oversupplied. We cannot secure overseas markets, and the industry is collapsing completely. We went into rice. The Queensland Government increased the cost of water from about $6 a megalitre to $29 a megalitre. To put that in perspective, California is producing $20 billion worth of agriculture a year and moving its water, which costs $3.90 a megalitre, 300 kilometres whereas this water in Queensland, which is moved 30 kilometres, is $29 a megalitre. How in heaven's name can we compete? The rice industry could not; it has now closed down. We started a coffee industry and it collapsed; we started a tea industry and it collapsed. At that price we cannot afford to water sugar cane, so the sugar industry up out, there has stopped dead in its tracks as well. For 13 years we have tried to find an alternative. Believe me, up there the growers have gone broke over and over again trying to produce alternative crops. So once again we stand in this place destroying jobs, destroying communities over some very high-flying principle with extremely unspecific results at the end of it, and with 80 per cent of the Australian people saying that this is wrong. The Government is already getting $2.728 billion a year out of the tobacco industry from a total of some $4.628 billion. The Government is already getting 60 per cent of the income from tobacco. The milking cow is still being milked. I mix with people who smoke and drink. They are mostly working-class people. I do not think smoking or drinking is the hallmark of the yuppies or upper classes in Australia, so this is a tax which discriminates against the average Australian workingman. This is the person paying the penalty for a government which is hungry and desperate for money and which does not care how many jobs or how many communities it destroys in its ruthless pursuit. If the Government is serious about the health angle, let it ban tobacco. But no, it is not serious about the health angle. It is not banning tobacco, although it is continuing with high-flying principles, macro-economic principles, macro-philosophic principles, that completely ignore the fact that there are people out there suffering as a result of those decisions. Once again today another nail has been put in the coffin of another Queensland community, and let it be upon the heads of those honourable members in this House who are passing this legislation.",57
96,Mr LIEBERMAN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"My electorate in Victoria, Indi, has all the tobacco growers in that State within its boundaries, so honourable members can imagine that this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill inspires a pretty good, adrenaline pumping feeling. Most of the tobacco is grown in the area of Myrtleford, which is in the Ovens valley. It is a rich, productive area. In round figures, 2,000 to 3,000 people are directly employed in the production of the tobacco crop in Victoria which goes towards the total Australian crop. The value of the tobacco crop in Indi until last year was some $30 million, which is a very substantial amount of money to be injected into the economy of both Victoria and Australia. Tobacco growing in Victoria, and I am sure in Mareeba, is a family pursuit. I have visited many tobacco growers. It is a pleasure to meet them. They are very hard working people. More than 50 per cent of them would have an ethnic background. They come from Italy and other parts of Europe. I have a vivid recollection of when I was first elected as the State member for Benambra of being a guest of an Italian family and of going into the sorting shed. There were mother and father, grandmother and grandfather and childrenall going down in height, almost gradedworking away together as a team grading their tobacco crop. It was a great pleasure to see those people working so industriously and to see them get on and become real contributors to the community. Mr Lindsay-Many migrant families have done that.",58
97,Mr LIEBERMAN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Many migrant families, yes indeed. I talk about these people with duction. some fondness and consider them my friends. I must tell the House with great regret that this legislation, which is brought in with the support of my party as well-so I am not ducking from it-will in fact have a very adverse impact on the economy of the area of Myrtleford in Victoria and will have a very serious effect on those families. I would say briefly that the history of tobacco growing in Victoria is that the Victorian Parliament has legislated in support of that industry. In fact, through the legislative process tobacco cannot be grown in Victoria without a quota. It is obvious, but it ought to be said in the context of the debate about health, that tobacco growing is a legal industry. It is an aspect of primary production which has the endorsement of the parliaments of Australia. Of course, for many years it has very been a source of taxation to go towards the services of the State and the nation. More recently it has become not only a means of raising revenue to pay for the services of government, both State and Federal, but also it has been seen to be a way in which the health of the community can be improved, that is, by increasing the cost of tobacco through excises that discourage people from smoking and therefore eventually benefit the community by improving the health of the community. That is fine. That has to be on the table as part of the debate and those of my constituents involved in the tobacco industry accept that. They are very mature and responsible Australians. They understand the debate even though it hurts them. The problem, of course, for the constituents that I represent is that the legislation, along with all the other State legislation adding taxes and excises to the sale of tobacco, in fact now means that $2.7 billion-nearly $3 billion-is going to be raised by the States and the Commonwealth by way of excise on this industry. That comes at a time-and this legislation in fact makes it worse-when the consumption of tobacco in Australia is falling. The demand is falling and there are changes in the wind regarding the amount of imported tobacco that can be used in Australian proI am told that the value of the Victorian crop this year is likely to be reduced by about 40 per cent. So there will be a very substantial and dramatic reduction in the incomes of these families due to government policies. I would like to say that this legislation, whilst important in itself and whilst attempting to achieve a better, healthier Australia and environment, has forgotten some other victims. It is forgetting the plight of the families on the farms in the tobacco industry in my electorate, and also in Mareeba in the electorate of my friend the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). I want to put on the record, as I am sure all members of parliament from all sides should, that when this sort of legislation is introduced there ought to be more of an impact study done on its full implications. If we want to move one way and say that a lawful industry encouraged and fostered by parliaments is to have a major change and an imposition placed on it that will diminish the potential of these people to sell their crops which they have been encouraged to grow and which have provided many jobs and many services for Australians through the revenue and taxes that they pay and their enterprise and their investment, then surely to God, if the Parliament is going to do its job properly, it ought to be coming up with some way in which the transition from tobacco production into other areas can be encouraged. I must tell the House that there is none at all. I know that the honourable member for Kennedy has worked very hard and will continue to work very' hard-and I will work with him as well-to find a solution. I have been calling on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to come forward with a package that will enable the people in the industry who wish to get out and to adjust into other activities-hopefully in primary production-to do that with dignity, so that they are not treated as second-rate citizens. They are the forgotten people, the victims of this whole debate. It is totally unfair to them and their families that that should be the case. Apart from the further impact, we already have too much unemployment in Australia-heaven forbid!-and I guess in my electorate it will be 11 per cent or 12 per cent; 30 per cent for young people. It will get worse because with this massive reduction in income from the annual crop obviously there will be less income in the community and therefore more hardship as a result. I am not ducking for cover. Obviously my party's support for the legislation will guarantee that the legislation goes through, but I that I have a duty as the local member for the tobacco industry in that area and virtually for the State of Victoria to make a plea to the Parliament and to members from all sides of the House to work with me and with the honourable member for Kennedy to have the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-I know he is preoccupied with wool and other things-address the issue and help this industry and sit down with these people to develop a plan, a package, so that we can make a transition. Mr Lindsay-What are you suggestingalternative crops?",59
98,Mr LIEBERMAN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"There are alternative crops. Certainly in my area mint oil is being produced. I might add that it is replacing imported oil-which is a great thing. But that is small and it takes time, lead time. We are also trying to grow nuts, and we are doing pretty well. I heard the other day that some nuts from New Zealand were coming into Australia at a lower price, so the growers get belted over the ear because they are trying. I honestly think that the solution is for the governments of Queensland, Victoria and the Commonwealth to be brought together and asked to sit down with the tobacco growers and work out a dignified approach, so that the smaller grower who now cannot be viable can perhaps be provided with the means by which that family can sell its quota and consolidate with the bigger farmer who, with diversification, may be able to carry on. The other idea I have is that we are presently importing about 57 per cent of tobacco leaf which is blended with the Australian produced product. As a result of Industry Commission inquiries and tariff policies it is intended that the tobacco industry will no longer be 'protected' and that the overseas leaf can flow in unhindered in the next three or four years. Personally I think that if people are going to choose to continue to smokeand that is on their heads until the next century, and I think probably by the middle of the next century the penny will have dropped, but in the meantime I do not see it disappearing-the governments can easily say, feel 'Why don't we change our attitude on tariff reduction in this area and say to the manufacturers, ""Buy more Australian produced leaf while this phase of education persuading people not to smoke is resolved""? At least they will be smoking Australian tobacco and not imported tobacco'. What is the benefit in our sending dollars offshore in a situation like this? It is not analogous to the nonnal tariff reduction debate. What I am saying is that we can have a situation where we can restrict imported tobacco and use more Australian tobacco as part of a compensation package to help these good people in Queensland and Victoria to adjust while this whole matter is resolved. So I make that plea. I am obviously not going to call a division on this Bill because the parties support it; that would be a futile act. My contribution is to lay it on the line I have and ask everybody to join together in a spirit of goodwill and help these people, because they deserve help. I can tell honourable members that they would respond very well. I can see in 10 years time many of them continuing to invest and work hard, but in other primary production pursuits, which I think would be a marvellous thing for them.",60
99,Mr LINDSAY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (6.09 p.m.)-in reply-First of all, I thank three honourable members: the honourable member  member for Kennedy (Mr KaUer) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Liebennan) for their contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. I note that the honourable member for Forrest made some general observations on customs legislation and that he further observed that there was too much customs legislation and that it was too cumbersome. I am sure the honourable member will be pleased to know that the Australian Law Refonn Commission has reviewed customs laws and drafted a discussion paper, including a draft Bill. This subsequent consolidating legislation is due to be considered by the Government with a view to having it introduced into the Parliament, possibly in early 1994. Nevertheless, I appreciate the sentiments of the honourable member for Forrest in his constructive contribution this evening. With respect to the observations by the honourable member for Kennedy on commuter transportation and air transport in regional Australia, most honourable members who represent regional electorates would understand very clearly the difficulties being experienced by Australian citizens with road and air transport. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is a money Bill which deals with an increase in the excise. I make the following point to the honourable member for Kennedy: in the last Federal election the endorsed policy of the National Party and the Liberal Party pledged that tobacco excise would increase by 25 per as cent-not 10 per cent as in this Bill. Indeed, the Australian Medical Association hammered the Opposition to increase the excise on tobacco by 40 per cent. Fightback also pledged that automatic indexation of the excise would be abolished. Indeed, - Son of Fightback' states: The Liberal and National parties will increase the excise on tobacco by 25 per cent. The medical community is strongly in favour of such action and has been campaigning for it for some time. Indeed, the Australian Medical Association, in its 1990 pre-Budget submission to EPACMr KaUer-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: there is a misrepresentation here. It was only 15 per cent, not 25 per cent.",61
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Snow)Order! The honourable member will have other opportunities to raise misrepresentations.,61
101,Mr LINDSAY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I again remind the honourable member for Kennedy that the policy says 25 per cent. He will not get away with attempts to suggest that it is 15 per cent. In the supplementary papers to Fightback the Opposition parties stated: Indeed, the Australian Medical Association, in its 1990 pre-budget submission to EPAC called for an increase in tobacco excise on health grounds stating that: "". . . indirect taxes on tobacco [should] be increased with a view to an increase in prices, at the retailleve- of about 40 per cent"". Peak health bodies including the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria and the National Heart Foundation have endorsed the call for an increase in the excise levied on tobacco as a means of reducing the level of tobacco-related disease in the community. That was the endorsed National Party policy at the last Federal election, and the media became very much aware of that. The Australian Financial Review of 22 November 1991 said that under a coalition government tobacco tax would rise by 25 per cent. The honourable member for Kennedy's own leader, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), in an article in the Canberra Times of 24 November 1991, is quoted as stating that 'he believed the package was both fair and responsible in relation to tobacco'. Who does the honourable member for Kennedy speak for? Does he speak for the National Party or for himself to try to gain some individual advantage over his colleagues on his side of the House, who support a package in connection with their endorsed policy? A media release issued by the Leader of the National Party oil 21 to 22 May 1992 is headed 'Tobacco Excise will go up 25 % under a Coalition Government'. And so it goes on. I commend an article published on 16 September 1992 in the Australian on Mr Remzi Mulla and other tobacco growers living in the Mareeba district. That article outlines their attitude to the Opposition's policy to increase the excise. I take objection to the remarks made by the honourable member for Kennedy this evening. The Opposition's policy is to increase the excise by 25 per cent. The Opposition's bedfellow, the AMA, is seeking an increase of 40 per cent. Mr Katter-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I do not mean to cause trouble or delay the House but when we are misrepresented here it is our right to be able to say that we have been misrepresented.",61
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member can raise problems of being misrepresented on another occasion. He can ask to make a personal explanation at another stage. Mr KaUer- Mr Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, you have not listened to my misrepresentation.",62
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order. Mr KaUer-I am entitled to say that I have been misrepresented and then you consider the proposition that I put up.,62
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member is entitled to say that at another stage. The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,62
105,Mr LINDSAY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Not only were tobacco growers in the Mareeba district appalled at the National Party policy on this important issue but, according to an article published on 8 March 1993 in the Sydney Morning Herald, a leading Sydney newspaper, the shares in WD & HO Wills fell 15 per cent over a three-week period ending 8 March 1993. This was in response to the Opposition's policy to increase the excise by 25 per cent. The article states: Shares in WD & HO Wills have fallen 15 per cent over the past three weeks on fears of cigarette price hikes after the Federal election, despite expectations of a strong result when the group reports its full year earnings this week. It is fundamentally important that when honourable members come into this chamber they should not seek to avoid the published endorsed policies of their parties on these issues; they should acknowledge them in the chamber. If honourable members have a different point of view they should be fearless in coming forward and saying that they disagree with that policy, as I and many other honourable members have in this chamber on a number of issues over the years. Mr Rob Hulls, the predecessor of the present honourable member for Kennedy, gave a speech in this chamber on 7 May last year. He spoke up for tobacco growers in the Mareeba area and called on the Government to take necessary measures to ensure that their economic livelihood would not be adversely affected by any of these issues. I congratulate, and note for the record, the former member for Kennedy on his efforts in this regard. He should be saluted and congratulated not only by the current honourable member for Kennedy but certainly by honourable members on this side of the House for the excellent work that he did on behalf of the tobacco industry. What is the present excise duty on tobacco? On 18 August 1992 it was $52.50 per kilogram. The excise duty on tobacco as at 19 August 1992 was $57.50 per kilogram-an increase of $5 per kilogram or approximately 10 per cent under this legislation. The excise duty on tobacco on 2 February 1993 was $57.67 per kilogram-an increase of 17c due to an automatic indexation provided by section 6A of the Excise Tariff Act of 1921. What effect would a 25 per cent increase have on the excise? An increase of 25 per cent on the excise duty on tobacco at $52.50 a kilogram would result in a price of approximately $65.60 per kilogram-a rise which Treasury has estimated would add about 0.3 per cent to Australia's inflation rate. Under the coalition's policy an increase of 25 per cent in the tobacco excise would add 0.3 per cent to the inflation rate. Under the AMA, a 40 per cent increase would lead to an increase of 0.48 per cent in the inflation rate. I appreciate and respect the sentiments that the honourable member for Indi expressed, but I think it would be fair to add that the Kennett Government, along with most State governments in Australia, has increased its taxes on tobacco. That is recognised by most reasonable people. The fact is that out of all the political parties in Australia, guess which one is coming in on the hypocritical approach-the Queensland National Party. In the last Queensland election, it was Mr Borbidge who attempted to gain political mileage for the Queensland National Party by trying to politicise the excise on tobacco issue by promising not to increase cigarette levies during its first term in office. We all know the outcome of the last Queensland State election where the people clearly did not buy a bar of Mr Borbidge's assertion that in government his party would not increase cigarette levies during its first term in I believe that the response by the shadow Minister in this debate, the honourable member for Forrest, was quite responsible and the contribution by the honourable member for Indi was also responsible and I respect what he has said-with the qualifications that I have made-but I enjoin the honourable member for Kennedy not to come into this chamber seeking to misrepresent the situation so far as his party's policy is concerned and not to advance his own personal policy in this area without acknowledging the policy of his party on this issue. This is an important issue and I know that the concerns that have been raised by the honourable member for Indi-for example, the impact on the tobacco industry-are issues which I think any honourable member representing tobacco growers would be concerned with. I know that there is a need to have consultations with tobacco growers in Australia. That should be occurring as soon as practical-not only on a federal level, but also on a State level-to ensure that alternative crops and economies are looked at with respect to the region. The point should also be made that the impact of the consumption of tobacco on the health bill of this country is a huge impost on the Australian taxpayer. Those statistics are well known to most people. That is why both sides of politics have recognised tnat there has to be legislative action with respect to encouraging people to decrease the incidence of smoking in our community. This legislation is designed ultimately to improve the health of the Australian community. The comments made by the honourable member for Kennedy are simply self-seeking. I also enjoin the honourable member for Kennedy not to become a political ambulance chaser in this chamber. It is important to deal with the issues as they affect us from a national perspective. There is always a time and a place to advance the cause of the people in our electorates and to speak up for them, which is one of the many reasons why we are elected to this place. I close by reminding the honourable member for Kennedy that this legislation will not office. spell the end of the tobacco growers at Mareeba. Indeed, it will have a minimal impact on their incomes according to the statistics that I have just ann,ounced in the chamber. Again, I thank the honourable member for Forrest and the honourable member for Indi for their contributions and also thank the honourable member for Kennedy for some of the comments he made. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, could I please have my negative vote recorded?",62

108,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES," Mr Speaker, as this is the first occasion I have had the chance to address the House whilst you have been in the chair may I begin, as others have, by congratulating you on attaining this very high office. I look forward to impartial, balanced judgments coming from the Chair in copious quantities in the future. Mr O'Keefe-That can be understood with the honourable Speaker.",64
109,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Well, we all hope. Tonight, we are speaking on a very important piece of legislation which, in a sense, pioneers the control or regulation of the road transport industry in Australia. Before I commence on the detail of the Bill, I make the obvious point that this legislation is being guillotined through the House, as a result of a motion that was put by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) yesterday on the basis that the Bills before the House were all urgent. Members of both the Opposition and the Government are being denied the full opportunity to address their concerns in debate here in the House because the Government has not been able to properly manage its affairs so that we would not have to guillotine these Bills. It is only the third time in the history of the Parliament that legislation has been guillotined in the first sitting fortnight of a parliamentary session. It is quite an extraordinary thing. The ludicrous nature of that guillotine is highlighted in the Bills that we are debating tonight. This Bill will ultimately not be enacted, if my memory serves me right, until the beginning of July 1995. One questions why it is necessary to push through this Bill tonight in the form of a guillotine. I do not think it is fair, nor is it necessary, to be putting up this type of legislation in the guise of urgent legislation, requiring the guillotine to be implemented. As a result of that, I will not be speaking for my full half hour. No doubt, everyone will breathe a sigh of relief to hear that but the reason for that, apart from relieving the boredom in the House, is to give other members on my side of the House the opportunity to speak on this Bill; in particular the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) who was the shadow Minister for land transport prior to the last federal election and who had a great deal of interest in the Bill which is before the House. The Bill is all about establishing uniform registration charges for heavy vehicles across Australia; heavy vehicles being those 4.5 tonnes or heavier. As I mentioned in the first few moments of my remarks, this is a pioneering piece of legislation. In a sense it is a little bit like a Government today trying to establish a uniform gauge national rail system, a system of railway lines around Australia with the same width from one end of the country to the other. Those who take an interest in transport would know that one of the saddest aspects of railway life in Australia is that State governments have all chosen to build railway lines with different gauges. It is impossible to get on a train in Cairns and ride on the same gauge track all the way through Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth because all the gauges change as State boundaries are crossed. This is an attempt to overcome the same sorts of problems that occur when it comes to the road transport industry. This is the first in a series of Bills which, no doubt, will be presented to the House over the months ahead which are the consequence of the efforts of the National Road Transport Commission, based in Melbourne, which was established I think in January of last year. This body has dealt with some very difficult issues which, for many years, governments have not been able to come to grips with. It has put forward practical solutions to very real and important problems of the transport industry. To that extent it deserves to be congratulated for coming forth with solutions which, whilst not endorsed by every State in Australia, I think will ultimately be agreed to by every State in Australia when the final date comes. This particular legislation deals with registration charges. It is quite instructive to look at the different charges for registering heavy vehicles around Australia. One would think that this would not be the case. One would think that Australia,' 92 years after Federation, would have an interstate road transport industry where trucks were able to drive from one end of the country to the other without crossing boundaries and finding different rules and different requirements. But at this stage that is still the case. When a heavy vehicle is registered in Australia, the registration charges are determined on a State by State basis, and there are some very substantial differences in the cost of registering heavy vehicles. If we can take as a median a six-axle semitrailer, that is, a prime mover with a bogey drive and a tri-axle trailer, which is the most common heavy vehicle most of us would see on our highways today, to register that vehicle in Queensland would cost $3,280; the same vehicle registered in New South Wales would cost on average $5,870 and up to $8,650. In the Northern Territory the cost of registering the same six-axle semitrailer is $430. It oosts over $8,000 in New South Wales down to $430 in the Northern Territory. In fact, it costs about the same to register a semitrailer in the Northern Territory as it does to register in New South Wales the box trailer that is hooked on to the Toyota Corolla to take it down to the tip once a week. There are some very substantial inconsistencies in the costs of registration throughout the States of Australia. What does this mean in practical tenns? Vehicles that would ordinarily be home based in New South Wales go to another State and have their registration recorded in that State where it costs a lot less. Then they go back to their home State and ply up and down the roads of that home State, having paid their registration fees in another State. This leads to the States where these trucks nonnally do their business not getting the full benefit of the revenues that registration would provide. States like New South Wales have been missing out on people registering in their State whilst the trucks are still driving in the State and doing all the damage to the roads in the process. There is a lot of sense in trying to establish a unifonn registration fee right across Australia. This is what this legislation is designed to achieve.· As proposed in this legislation the same sixaxle semi-trailer that I spoke of a few moments ago will cost a unifonn charge of $4,000 to register right around Australia. For some States it will cost a little bit more to register that vehicle; in other States it will cost a little less. It is part of the process of trying to make Australia's road transport industry a national industry rather than a State by State industry. If this legislation is complemented with legislation which will follow in the future, it will be seen that it is not just registration charges that we are talking about. It will cover things such as inspection criteria for registration of vehicles, load limits and driver times. Eventually, we will have a system in Australia whereby once a vehicle is registered, be it in Queensland, New South Wales or the Northern Territory, the same rules will apply. The same costs will apply to the registration of the vehicle. The same driver requirements will apply right around Australia for the person who drives the truck. There is indeed considerable merit in this fonn of legislation. For that this side of the House gives credit to the National Road Transport Commission, for the work it has done, and to the ATAC meetings, which are meetings of all Federal and State Ministers for transport who have ultimately borne the responsibility for seeing these recommendations translate themselves into legislation. There is a need now, as this legislation is before the House, to follow with other items of legislation. For example, legislation for consistent inspection standards around Australia for all heavy vehicles needs to be brought into this House as soon as possible. If we do not do that, the criteria for registering a vehicle will be easier in some States than in others even though the cost of registering a vehicle will be the same in each State. At present it is possible to register a vehicle in a particular State with a cursory inspection at the time· of its registration. For the rest of that heavy vehicle's life no further physical inspection takes place. So, until the vehicle finally falls apart and disintegrates, long as the owner keeps on filling in the Jorms and paying his money, technically he can continue to keep on driving that vehicle up and down the highways of Australia. As a follow-on from this legislation, we need to introduce consistent inspection standards as quickly as possible so that each State has similar criteria for the registration of vehicles. Then we will not find people with vehicles of a low standard going to another State to have them registered because that State has low standards of inspection. I think that, coupled with the moves that have already been undertaken to establish a standard licensing system throughout Australia-an Australian licence, which now is working its way across the land; and also things such as the regulation of load limits so that a person driving a heavy vehicle from Brisbane to Melbourne does not find as he crosses State borders that the load that was legal in one State is suddenly illegal on the other side of the border-will make operating a heavy vehicle around Australia so much easier. This will do away with a lot of the bureaucratic problems and a lot of the additional costs imposed by these differing forms of regulation from State to State. So there is a series of Bills that we need brought into this place following on from this Bill which will lead to the establishment of a national road transport industry with national registration charges, national inspection charges, national licensing, national regulations, and so forth. In the process of that being carried out, there are some very difficult decisions to be made by individual States. I take my hat off to the various States which have undertaken what in many cases have been quite difficult political decisions to align themselves with this particular legislation. However, there are some States that have expressed concerns, and I think those concerns are quite valid. For example, New South Wales has expressed a concern that the implementation of this legislation in that State will see it lose about $76 million of revenue each year. Whilst there is argument as to the accuracy of this figure-some would argue that it will as be less, and the New South Wales people will argue that the $76 million is correct-there is no doubt at all that some States run the risk of losing considerable amounts of money as a result of the implementation of this legislation. I think, therefore, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to ensure that, after the first 12 months of this legislation being in place, a review of the revenues of individual States is undertaken to ensure that no State is financially disadvantaged as a consequence of the implementation of this uniform legislation. If that is done, I think the concerns of States such as New South Wales can be allayed. I know the Commonwealth has undertaken to look into this possibility and to try to make up for the shortfall in revenues that New South Wales may experience, but there is no doubt in my mind that the fairest way to approach this matter with the States, given the cooperation of most of them, is to say, 'When we have implemented this legislation, after 12 months it will be reviewed. If you are out of pocket by any significant amount of money, we will compensate you one way or another'. If we agree to do this, I think the States will be willing to cooperate further in other aspects of uniformity when it comes to the national road transport industry. But when we also talk about cuts in revenue for particular States, it is worthwhile raising another important aspect of road transport in Australia, and that is the decline in road funding that this Government has imposed on the States and on motorists generally. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), who is at the table, is looking stunned-indeed, shockedat the thought that this Government could possibly have reduced road funding over the last 10 years. Shocked though he may be, I can assure him that that is the case. This Government has cut road funding in real tenns by about 25 per cent over the last 10 years. This position will become worse as the funding that was put into the system as a result of One Nation will expire, I think, at the end of this financial year. We are going to see a significant decline in actual dollars road funding over the next 12 months under this Government's administration of Australia. I think that is one of the saddest things that we can say today because this Government, although it has been cutting road funding, and intends to cut it further at the end of this financial year, has not been at all loath to increase the amount of fuel excise that motorists and the national road transport industry pay at the petrol bowsers. It is interesting to note that when the Government came into power in March 1983 fuel excise was 6c a litre-that is the tax that is paid every time a motorist puts a litre of fuel in the tank. Today that tax is 26c a litre, and it is going up on a six-monthly basis. Today this Government gets in excess of $7 billion in taxes from the petrol bowsers. At the present time it returns only about $2.1 billion towards road improvements around the country. That $2.1 billion will drop once again, if my memory serves me correctly, to around $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion at the beginning of the next financial year. So, while this Government is ripping off the motorist more than at any other time in the history of this country, it is also reducing the funds it is expending on roads. While I am mentioning the subject of roads, I will not fail to take the opportunity to press the cause of the upgrading of the Federal Highway between Canberra and the Hume Highway, which of course is the last link in the network of roads that the Federal Government has responsibility for in this part of the world. Mr O'Keefe-Whose electorate is that in?",64
110,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"It happens to be in the electorate of a very effective member of parliament who for quite some time has been championing the cause for the upgrading of the Federal Highway. That very effective member of parliament will look forward to the day when the Parliamentary Secretary and his ministerial colleague will come down to the Federal Highway to cut the ribbon on our new, four-lane highway between Canberra and Goulburn, because it is the last leg of the improvement of the Federal Highway in this part of southern New South Wales. Indeed, it of is something that the Government should do. I know the Government is very much aware of it and I place on record my urging of the Government to get on with the job because I think it needs to be dont<. I ask honourable members to note that this winter there will be a number of fatalities on that road for the simple reason that it is a narrow road with a lot of traffic which usually gets very busy at the worse time of the year for motorists to be driving-that is, winter time, when all the snow traffic is driving up and down it. This Government has made rather a meal of ripping off the motorists over the last 10 years and it has been ripping off the road transport industry generally. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon, who will be speaking in a couple of minutes time, will be making the point, as he did during the last election campaign, that the average heavy vehicle in Australia is taxed to the tune of around $44,000 a year, with some heavy vehicles being taxed over $60,000 a year. The Government taxes the fuel that those heavy vehicles put in their tanks; it taxes the cost of the tyres that are used on those trucks to the tune of 20 per cent through sales taxes; and of course the purchase price of the vehicle itself is taxed at 20 per cent. A company that employs a few people also pays payroll tax. At the last federal election the coalition was proposing to rid the heavy vehicle industry of those taxes and to save it, on average, $44,000 on every heavy vehicle in the country. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon was leading and championing that cause prior to the last election. One of the saddest aspects of our failure to win the election is our inability to implement these savings for the heavy vehicle transport industry. This would have advantaged not only those people in the heavy vehicle industry but also people in rural Australia who depend so much on heavy vehicles to provide them with their goods and services. All of these people would have benefited from a massive reduction in the cost of operating trucks around this country, which would have been reflected in the retail price of all goods and services in country areas. Unfortunately, those people do not have that benefit which the coalition was offering and which the shadow Minister was championing prior to the last election. Indeed, this Government now offers the prospect of another tax on fuel. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is carrying in his briefcase a brief which says that he will whack a five per cent tax on all energy sources in Australia-including fuel, electricity, gas and so forth. So over the next few months, as this Government tries to grapple with its economic mismanagement, we can look forward to yet another tax being placed on the heavy transport industry in Australia. This is one of the sorriest sagas of this Government. Those opposite whacked up fuel excise from 6c per litre to 26c per litre and they are about to put another five per cent tax on the cost of fuel, not just for heavy vehicles but all road transport. The sum total of this Government's mismanagement of our national transport industry is that the Government has taxed it to within an inch of its life. The Government has taken away funds which should be going to building up our road infrastructure and, as a result, Australia does not have as efficient a transport system as it ought, nor as competitive a transport system as it deserves. We all suffer as a consequence of that. Whilst I draw honourable members' attention to the fact that this Government has done the heavy vehicle industry a disservice over the last few years by taxing it to within an inch of its life and cutting road funding in real terms-and in actual dollar terms in the next few months-the Opposition will be supporting this legislation. It does represent material gain for our national transport industry. It is a step in the right direction. As my colleague the honourable member for Wannon will no doubt elaborate, it will be of considerable benefit to all road users throughout Australia and is of a pioneering nature for our transport industry. The Opposition will join with the Government to support this Bill, both here and in the Senate. As I mentioned earlier tonight, we look forward to seeing further legislation brought into this House which will overcome a number of the other anomalies which exist in the heavy vehicle industry in Australia.",67
111,Mr HAWKER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Wannon) (8.23 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Speaker. I take this opportunity-my first-to congratulate you on your election to the position of Speaker and I trust that you will carry out all of those high intentions that we heard you enunciate. We look forward to seeing i them put into operation. I would like to support the words of my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). As he has pointed out, this amendment to the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act is another small step forward. It takes up some of the work that the National Road Transport Commission has been doing quietly but very effectively over some time. I will return to that subject in more detail later. I would like to talk about transport reform in general because I think this area has been well documented and has been the subject of many inquiries. Those inquiries have generally put forward similar sorts of recommendations, all of them pointing out that in transport we have a vital industry which is involved in just about every aspect of Australian commerce and yet there are major savings to be made in the way the industry operates. Those savings would translate into a major increase in our gross national product of something in the order of $6 billion-a not insignificant sum. The previous Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), used to take every opportunity to talk about the importance of these savings. However, he always had difficulty in translating his words into action. Mr Wakelin-He was a disaster.",68
112,Mr HAWKER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"As my colleague points out, he really was a bit of a disaster-a nice fellow, but he never really achieved much. Had those savings been made and had transport costs been brought down to the level of world best practice, there is no doubt that the balance of payments problems we are facing today would be lessened considerably. Unfortunately, the coalition is not in government to implement those reforms. But there is no question that had we been given the opportunity by the electors on 13 March, as my colleague the honourable member for Hume has pointed out, we would have made very major savings in the whole transport area. I would now like to talk about some of the details of the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 and then return to some of the important issues which flow from it. There is no question that a move towards uniform charging would have some major benefits for the whole road transport industry and would also create general savings. But we have to remember that this is only one part of the direction in which transport reform has to be taken. The other part involves uniform regulation. It is really a nonsense to have a situation a country like Australia-after all, we are one nation-where people can load up a truck in South Australia and be perfectly legal, cross the border into Victoria and unless they buy a permit they are no longer legal, and cross the border into New South Wales where they have to buy another permit. This is not only costly for the operator, but also costly to administer and enforce. All of this adds quite significantly to the cost of our transport which, because it is an intermediate input, is added to the cost to the final consumer. The Government talks about transport reform, but it still has an awful long way to go. The uniform regulation challenge still has not been addressed properly. Bearing in mind that this Government has now been in power for 10 years and that several reports have been delivered to it on the importance of these reforms, one has to say that the Government's report card is a bit grim. In fact, by any measure-not only on the question of these reforms but also on the question of taxing road users-one would have to mark it as a fail.",69
113,Mr SLIPPER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,An unmitigated disaster.,69
114,Mr HAWKER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"That is probably not a bad way of putting it. We also have to look at the recommendations of the National Road Transport Commission which has had a very difficult job and I think has performed commendably given the constraints the Government has placed upon it. In fact, it went beyond those constraints when it highlighted just how much the Government has been overtaxing road transport. The NRTC has come forward with a road user charge-a registration fee-which, as my colleague the honourable member for Hume pointed out, is around $4,000 for a six-axle articulated semi and an 18c per litre notional fuel charge. I say 'notional' because that is all it is; it is a farce. The Government has never had the wit, the guts or anything else to actually say, 'Well, if we are going to have a road user charge then we'll spend it on roads'. So we have the absolute nonsense whereby the Government is now saying that it is bringing in a road user charge-a registration fee-which of course will go to the in States; and a fuel tax, which of course will not go to roads, but straight into Consolidated Revenue. As I have already pointed out, transport is an intermediate cost to business and, therefore, this is another way of taxing business inputs. The Commonwealth Government is presently charging over 26c a litre fuel tax, and only about 6c of that is being put back into roads. That is an appalling record. If we look at the way in which the Government has increased fuel taxes since it came to office, we will see that the situation is really quite amazing. It has increased fuel taxes by over 150 per cent and at the same time in real terms has decreased the money going into roads. There was a one-off increase in spending after the February economic statement, but that will shortly be running out. On present Forward Estimates, it is likely that the amount of money going into roads will fall in dollar terms. Surely, any member of the Government who bothered to go outside the capital cities and take a trip around country areas would see what a sad state our roads are in and realise, if he bothered to do his homework and talk to engineers about the matter, that it is not just a matter of the roads deteriorating; if rehabilitation is not carried out in a timely fashion, the cost of rejuvenating roads and bringing them back to standard will at least double. In other words, it is false economy to continue to run down road assets because, in the long run, it will cost the nation a lot more than addressing the problem in a timely fashion. I remind honourable members of what my colleague the honourable member for Hume pointed out. In the move towards uniform charging there is real concern in some States that there may be an imbalance of revenuein other words, a concern that some States might get less revenue from road charges than they are now. The coalition, to its credit, before the last election came to an agreement with the States that, should we be elected, we would review uniform charges after 12 months of operation to ascertain whether a State had been disadvantaged. We also said that we would compensate those States that could demonstrate such a disadvantage. It is time that the Government followed our lead and started to deal with this issue in a. sensible fashion. I remind the House of the stupidity of the situation that existed when the former Minister for Land Transport used to sit here and sling off at the Minister for Roads in New South Wales as though it was all some sort of game. The matter is too serious for that.",69
115,Mr SLIPPER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,They are not interested in the bush.,70
116,Mr HAWKER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"They certainly are not. This is too serious an issue to be allowed to continue to languish in the silly politics that some members of the Australian Labor Party seem to think is more important than good government. The overtaxing of transport is a serious issue. We have seen analyses done time and time again-even by the National Road Transport Commission itself-to show that road transport in particular is overtaxed. Today, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Graham Blight, raised this point in his speech to the National Farmers Federation when he said: Australia's transport system is too costly because it is overtaxed. He went on to point out the obvious: That places a huge impediment on our export industries, most of which operate in inland Australia, producing minerals and agricultural products. This issue is particularly important because Australia is such a large country. I wish some members opposite would realise that. He continued: When we are much more costly than the United States, Canada or New Zealand in transport, then something has to be done about it. Hear, hear! When one considers the problem we have with the balance of payments, one would have thought that common sense might have crept in here: that the Government would realise that, if we keep taxing the input costs of our exports, chances are they will be less competitive and we will have greater difficulty in selling them on the world market. If we look at the whole issue-I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), who is at the table, has always been rather keen on this issue-it is not just road transport that is overtaxed; it is also rail. The coalition's policies at the last election meant the removal of an amazing $258 million a year in taxes from rail transport. Just think about that. It was not just road transport; we were taking it from rail transport as well. That figure represents the removal of only two taxes, one of which is fuel tax and the other payroll tax. The Government has to ask itself why it is taxing business input costs, making them less competitive with overseas competitors. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary of a report which was released in December last year by the Bureau of Industry Economics. The report, International performance indicators: road freight, highlighted how greatly the Labor Party's high taxing of road transport disadvantages Australia. It suggested that the coalition's policy was the one that should have been pursued. The report showed that total taxes and charges on road transport are up to four times those in the United States and around 50 per cent higher than taxes and charges in Canada. In addition, the report showed that truck prices in Australia are 20 per cent higher than in the United States because of tariffs, sales tax and stamp duty. The report detailed the many ways in which Australian transport is disadvantaged-hence, the users of road transport are disadvantaged-as against some of our major competitors. A more recent survey shows just how serious a matter the overtaxing of transport really is. That survey was conducted by the Metal Trades Industry Association, and it showed that, after company tax, road transport is the major cost impost on industries in the metal trades area. The survey further showed that transport costs rose as a percentage of total costs between 1990-91 and 1991-92. In other words, the reforms that the Government was supposed to be achieving came to nought because one major industry association was able to demonstrate that transport was becoming a greater cost component in its members' _ operations rather than a lesser cost. That shows that the Government has to act with an even greater sense of urgency to deal with the massive taxes and additional costs involved in transport because this nation cannot continue to payout for such a costly system-worse than that, a system which need not be so costly. Since the Government has already started to pinch some of the coalition's policies, perhaps it should pinch our policies on transport, because getting the cost of transport down is too important a matter to have to wait for us to do it after the next election. I suggest that the Government go the whole way and stop taxing transport. Clearly, it is a very inefficient way of raising revenue. It makes our exporters and all our businesses less competitive with corresponding sectors in other countries. The coalition is not opposing this Bill but points out that the legislation represents only a small part of the reform that is needed. It is not just a question of uniform charges; it is a question of uniform regulations and removing taxes on industry and users. These taxes tax inputs, not the end users. I conclude by warning the Government against adopting the measures that the honourable member for Hume suggested it is considering, namely, a five per cent energy tax. If this Government is considering such a tax, it should have a long, hard look at it. I have already pointed out how some of our major competitors in the United States and Canada-countries with similar distances over which businesses have to transport their goods-have considerably lower costs, lower taxes and charges on transport. For us to be going the other way is a form of economic madness. As the coalition has pointed out in the past, if the Government wants to address the environmental concerns that people have, there are much more direct ways of doing it than by disadvantaging transport users, particularly people who live in country areas and are totally dependent upon transport for nearly everything they do. That is a very important point that people from a city based government sometimes fail to appreciate. I remind the Government that there are a lot of Australians who do not live in the city and who are totally dependent on transport for just about everything they do.",70
117,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.40 p.m.)-in reply- Mr Speaker, this is my first opportunity to place on the public record my personal congratulations to you on your election to the high office of Speaker. As a member of the class of 1984 it is a matter of some pride to us to see a number of our colleagues progressing in this place. I thank the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) for their contributions to the debate on the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill. I thought we were going fairly well until we wandered off into a couple of areas. One of the great things about our democracy is that it is in Parliament where we make these claims, and it is in the Parliament where we correct them. Let me put on the record a few things about this Bill that were outlined in the second reading debate. As both opposition spokesmen have accepted, this is a piece of landmark legislation, as were a number of other major reforms in transport and communications in this country. This appears to be a fairly innocuous Bill that simply sets up a range of road transport charges to operate in the Australian Capital Territory. At the 1990 Premiers Conference the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the State Premiers agreed that they would exchange powers. That was the first time since Federation that the parties had agreed to a number of uniform approaches on road transport. One approach was to adopt a set of uniform road transport regulations and operating procedures to cover, in the first instance, heavy vehicle industry in this country. The honourable member for Hume raised the question of urgency. He wonders why the legislation has to be passed through the Parliament quickly, rather than perhaps our coming back later or having the legislation on the table. There are three very good reasons for that and the honourable member for Hume knows them very well, which makes me wonder why he would even raise the question. The first reason is that when we reached that agreement with the States to have a uniform process and establish the National Road Transport Commission, the Federal Government agreed that we would place the first set of legislation on the table; we would set the example, and we would do it in the form of a Bill to cover the ACT. That Bill would have an implementation date of 1 July 1995 which seems a long time, but it is just a little over two years from now. Each of the States has agreed to take this uniform legislation, to develop its own legislation and its own operating regulations, to educate the officers in its bureaucracies as well as the industry, and enact that legislation in its own parliaments and have it all done and in place, ready the to be administered right across Australia by 1 July 1995. Mr Speaker, as you well know, that is a very tight timetable for the parliaments across Australia. Considering many of the governments from 1901 to 1983, it is a dramatically rapid timetable. We need to get on with this. We need to set the example. We need to have it in place. Most fundamentally, we are honouring the undertaking given at the Premiers Conference. At that conference the very words agreed to between the six State Premiers and the Prime Minister were that we would do this as soon as possible. Here we are doing it in the first parliamentary sitting following the re-election of the Keating Government. Mr Hawker-Who was the Prime Minister?",71
118,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Mr Hawke was the Prime Minister who reached the agreement; Mr Keating is the Prime Minister who undertook the to carry through those reforms, and he is the Prime Minister who is leading the Government that is making this happen super fast. The honourable member for Hume knows very well that it is necessary to do it now, to do it quickly and to set the example in the lie national capital, and that is what we are doing. We agree with what the honourable member for Hume is saying. If we were less gracious, we could put it another way and we could say that the honourable member agrees that we know that this must lead on to uniformity of speed restrictions, uniformity of weights and measures, uniformity of driving hours and uniformity of registration charges. We agree with the honourable member for Hume that it is a crazy situation where a road transport operator in Sydney registers his fleet in Queensland because the maintenance charges are cheaper there, the qualifying standards are cheaper, or the registration charges are cheaper. We know that is silly, and so this set of uniform regulations is intended to set a national standard and take those inefficiencies out of the industry. The industry agrees that it is necessary and that we need to do it quickly. We also agree with the honourable member that there has been a necessity for that same process of uniformity to apply to inspection standards. It is not very sensible that a person has to go through a process of having a heavy vehicle pass road worthy tests and meet the costs of its being roadworthy in one State when in another State it is not required, and therefore there can be a decline in standards. The operators in the industry, the State governments and the Commonwealth Government agree with the benefits of the legislation. A couple of the States are questioning the charging regime because in some States the operators will pay a little more than they have been. In New South Wales the operators will pay less than they have been paying. That averaging principle is one that will be applied across the nation to remove those various anomalies. Mr Sharp-Are you going to compensate New South Wales?",72
119,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"As I understand it, the operators in New South Wales will actually pay less than they have been paying in the past. Mr Sharp-What about the Government?",73
120,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"In the first instance, the Government will have a decline in the revenue that it is receiving from registration. It - is not happy about it and it is negotiating the Federal Government about a package to address that. These things are in there, and we understand that they have to be worked through. But the example has to be set here tonight, and I am glad that the Opposition has agreed to supp ,rt the legislation. It would be lovely to finish the debate and say, 'It is great that we have total consenthe sus in the Parliament here tonight', but the Opposition could not help itself. It went for the hoary issue of road funding. We can take this issue back as far as we like; let us take it back to the election of Labor in 1983. Any time members opposite talk about this Government cutting back road funding, we always finish the equation at 1983. One of our first measures in Government was to not only get the economy moving again",73
121,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"It is good to see the former Minister, the honourable member for Shortland, in the chamber. He has been responsible for much of this reform over time. In order to redress the massive deficiency in road funding across the nation that existed in 1983, and to stimulate the economy, the former Minister was responsible for the upgrading of the national road funding program and lifting the base dramatically. Ever since, the Opposition has said, 'You cut road funding, but you took this massive surge'. It has done it again tonight. The Opposition has come in here tonight and referred several times to 'the one-off boost in road funding from One Nation'. Of course there was a boost in road funding in One Nation, not only to tackle the infrastructure but to get the economy moving again. No-one ever said it was anything other than 'a one-off boost in road funding'. Now the Opposition is saying-because we are-going back to where we were; and we never said we would do anything else- 'You are cutting road funds'. What is more, the Opposition is wandering around to the State Premiers who, it knows very well, asked us to give them, instead of specified road funding grants that must be spent on roads, untied funds. The Opposition knows very well that the Premiers said to us, with 'Hey, listen, we are capable of making some decisions in our States. Why don't you untie the road funds? Why don't you just give us the money you would have given us that must be spent on roads? Why don't you just give it to us untied and let us make our own decisions?'. The Opposition is saying that this there was part of the whole process to get out of States agreement on uniform road transport regulations, a national rail corporation, national environment standards, national business standards and the whole Premiers Conference package; and, in order to get it, we said, 'Well, okay, you can be responsible for this money'. So we have untied the funds and said that, as from 30 June this year, those funds are no longer road funds as such; they are just untied funds to the States. Now the States are saying, 'Hey, you have cut our road funds. Look what you gave us last time for roads. Do not worry about the $350 million extra that you are giving us by way of untied grants; you have not given us as much for roads'. The Opposition is going around telling the States to run this line. is going to get the Opposition nowhere. The States are going to be accountable for the funds and, if they do not want to spend the funds on roads, they can be made accountable. That takes me to the other issue. I thought we were going along nicely but then the honourable member for Wannon, for whom I have a great regard-as I do the honourable member for Hume, of course-could not help himself member for Gwydir.",73
122,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Of course. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) is a lovely bloke, too, but he has not spoken in the debate, so I do not have to say anything about him. The honourable member for Wannon could not help himself with this drivel that only 6c a litre of petrol tax goes back in road funds. No matter how long the Opposition runs this matter, it is never going to go unchallenged. Of the federal excise, the specific amount paid back via federal road funding is 6c a litre. There is no question about that. We have never said anything different. But the Opposition never wants to talk about the untied funds which go to the States and which are spent on roads. These funds are federal grants. The Opposition never wants to talk about the money from the Federal Government that helps the States with their hospital budgets and all their other budgets that finance ambulances, hospitals and pollution control. The Opposition never wants to talk about all the funds that go to help the States with the various costs of roads in Australia. In fact, the Bureau of Transport Economics, when it looked at the national expenditure on roads, the effects of motor vehicle accidents and the whole box and dice, assessed the cost at something in the vicinity of $10 billion per annum, which is more than the whole of the petrol tax collected in this country. The bottom line is that the Opposition, every time it comes in here and talks that drivel about only 6c a litre of petrol tax getting spent on roads, is going to get the same answer back again. I wish it had not demeaned itself by That raising that matter in here again tonight. Again, it is lovely in the parliament that the Opposition can put that argument and we get the opportunity to just flesh it out a little further. It has gone on tonight with all this drivel about the plans it had for Australia in cutting the cost of transport with the great proposal to scrap fuel excise and replace it with a GST. I am glad the Opposition dropped the policy. There has been talk about ships and the TItanic. If the Opposition had stuck with the GST it would have actually been building a TItanic to have another go at the iceberg. That is what it would have been doing. The bottom line is that the Opposition was going to impose a GST on fuel, which it never talks about now. The very reason that the honourable member for Wannon is now on the back bench is that he was one of the few people on the front bench honest enough to admit that the Opposition had a plan to introduce road user charges for the industry. The industry knew it, the Opposition knew it, and we knew it. The bottom line is that the Opposition was going to have its own form of special charge on road transport. The Opposition was just not going to call it.a petrol tax. It was an absolutely deceitful policy. The honourable member was honest enough to admit it-he has never been anything different. He was honest about it and he was out there with his colleagues-especially the Nationals-wandering around country Australia saying, 'We are going to abolish the petrol tax, we are going to cut transport charges'. They went on with all this drivel. Finally the people woke up. That is why the Opposition is there and we are here. This Bill is landmark legislation. Legislation that brings the whole six States and the Territories of the Commonwealth together after 90 years is not introduced in the Federal Parliament without there being a landmark effort. I want to place on record my personal thanks and pay a tribute to three members of the government in particular, apart from former Prime Minister Hawke and the present Prime Minister, for their commitment in carrying through these reforms. First of all, I commend the honourable member for Short transport Minister when we were elected in 1983. He was the gentleman who in fact led us through this national road reform which has enabled us to develop a sensible and national structure of priorities for national road funding. I commend him for the role that he played. Mr Sharp-He should still be there.",74
123,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Absolutely. I secondly place on record my commendation of the work done by our former land transport Minister, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He had the duty and the task at the Premiers Conference of getting the States to agree. They sat down and the Prime Minister said, 'We are going to do this'. Then the honourable member for Charlton had to go off and get the six State transport Ministers to actually agree and to prepare and complete it in a form that could be carri-d through this Parliament tonight. I pay - lm credit for having done that and for haVIng worked through those negotiations, not only on a national road transport corporation and all that is associated with that, but also on enormous reform of the national rail corporation and a standard gauge railway, for the first - time in this country. He was also involved in a number of other heavy duty reforms in tran-port in his part of the portfolio. So to the honourable member for Charlton, I also place on record commendation. I am glad to see the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) in the chamber tonight becau-e he chaired the Government's Caucus working group on land transport and also played a strong role in working on and massaging these reforms through the process of not only the Commonwealth Parliament but also the State legislatures. Mr Speaker, as you well recognise, that is a dramatic reform and one that we can be proud of. The Federal Government is setting the example for the rest of Australia. I feel very proud to be here at the table tonight commending the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr O'Keefe) read a third time. NA NA 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 May, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
124,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Whilst we are in a spirit of, I guess one could say, good-natured banter across the table I must say to the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) that, in common with his colleagues, he is determined to defend a refusal to reform in the area of taxes on business inputs. I find this very disturbing. We have just heard another attempt to justify taxes on transportation in this country which are excessively high. I want to make the the general observation, because I cannot help it in the current climate, that one of the problems that industry faces in this country, particularly exacerbated by the distances involved, is that we do tax input costs and they do have a quite serious effect on our international competitiveness. I think particularly of the closure of the Edgell plant at Cowra last year, and the research which established that the transport costs for raw materials into that factory, and then transport costs from factory back out to markets, in this country were approximately double what they are in the UK and the United States of America. Yet we see no attempt at all, as we have seen in sever-l instances and heard in several debates in thIS House since the resumption of parliament, to come to grip-; with some of those important issues which, despite the fact that the election has passed, remain and stilI confront us. They still need addressing if we are to be not only competitive internationally on export markets with our products but also able to compete in terms of import replacement with more efficient nations who export to this countryfor example, New Zealand. I now turn my attention to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment BilI 1993. I again note the very serious plight of the Australian wool industry and those players in it, including many people who are not themselves wool growers. This is indeed a crisis which extends well beyond mere wool growers and their families. It applies to those that they employ-or perhaps no longer employ but would like to be able to employit applies to shearers, and it applies to people in country towns. In fact, entire rural communities face nothing short of economic and social devastation if current disastrous prices prevail in the wool industry. Business losses for the average wool grower over the last three years, according to ABARE's figures, total some $103,000, and next year's picture is anything but cause for joy. The current stockpile of 3.9 million bales has barely shifted in the last nine months, and it overhangs the industry in a very unfortunate way. The wool pipeline throughout the trade is full, and in fact more than full in the sense that there are stockpiles other than the official stockpile developing. Wool is being held on farms in woolsheds, for example; it is being held in brokers' or buyers' sheds around the country, and in various other forms at other points in the pipeline. Wool has lost market share to cotton and synthetics, declining from some 10 per cent of the total market share for fibre in 1950-51 to just 4.4 per cent of an admittedly much larger market in 1991-92. During the years of the reserve price scheme, particularly towards the end, the relative security of the industry and the prices that farmers felt they would receive for their product encouraged production. In fact, the Australian sheep population hit a high of 173 million in 1990. Given the improved productivity of the industry, and the higher fleece weights on average that those sheep were providing, the production levels soared to unprecedented levels. That equation has come off, and by last year the total sheep numbers had fallen to 151 million. I suspect a great number of decisions are being made out there at the moment which will bring that figure down very rapidly.",75
125,Mr COBB,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Drought.,76
126,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"There are farmers who are voluntarily, in the face of encroaching drought and low prices, choosing not to join, to off-load or not to breed, whatever the case may be. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) just mentioned, in addition there are many people who have no choice, who are contracting their numbers because drought is leaving them with no option. Earlier today in the House I referred to a Central Queensland grower who normally runs 15,000 sheep but who is now down to 3,000. He cannot afford to feed them during the winter, so he has adopted the policy that he will leave them be, those that survive survive and, well, nothing can be done about those that do not. That is obviously a tragic situation. So, while the drought continues, that harsh medicine continues to work its way through the Australian sheep flock. The forecast total production figure for greasy wool this year is 851 million kilograms. Next year that is anticipated to come down to 805 million, which is still above the long-term average, but I suspect that is still optimistic for the reasons I have just mentioned. Some estimates put it as low as 700 million kilograms. This does provide further scope for wool to be sold from the stockpile without any necessarily depressing effect on sales through the auction system. We plainly believe that the Government could have done more for the wool industry in this hour of very critical need. For example, it would have been a great thing to have seen an encouraging response to the calls from the Wool Council of Australia for a 12month waiving of the 4.5 per cent debt repayment component of the wool tax, but the Government has chosen to leave it where it is. This is unfortunate in the sense that abolishing this component of the wool tax was perhaps the single measure that it could have taken to help all wool growers, and I think particularly of those who for various reasons have managed to keep themselves in sound financial condition. This was a mechanism which would have aided them in the sense that it could have helped to keep them out of that category where they may need assistance in 12 months time. Mr Bruce Scott-And get some money into regional areas.",76
127,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"And get some money into regional areas, which is also critically important, in some of those hard-hit rural towns that the honourable member for Maranoa is obviously referring to. That assistance would have been worth about $26 a bale, which means around $2,600 to the average wool grower. Those average wool growers out there would have found that $50 a week, if you like-which is not much on the surface of it-would have been very welcome when it came to putting food on the kitchen table. The Government could also have taken the opportunity with this Bill to slacken the strings with which it controls the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. It could have given the AWRC increased flexibility to go out and market wool from the stockpile, rather than waiting for buyers to come for it on, for example, the basis of long-tenn credit arrangements which are presently precluded by the arrangements pertaining to the repayment of the schedule. It could have removed the transparency in the Australian Wool - Realisation Commission's operations so that buyers would not know how much the commission was selling or at what price and, by virtue of these two factors, what their competitors were up to. The Government could have given the commission its blessing, told it to go forth into the world and come back with new markets, innovative trade deals, new uses for wool, but it did not. Above all, the Government had the opportunity to send a clear signal to the market that there would be absolutely no chance of a fire sale of stockpiled wool. To achieve that, all it had to do was to abandon the debt repayment schedule. To that end, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""while not opposing the extension of the repayment schedule for the wool debt, the House is of the opinion that the retention in legislation of any time limit sends the wrong signals to an uncertain wool market"". The Government has chosen to extend the repayment deadline by one year; thus, of course, acknowledging the problem-which is welcome-but all it has done is put off the problem for another year. It has risked giving us a market pick-up, if you like, a burst in confidence, only to find that we run into a bigger degree of uncertainty 12 months down the road. Now, the market indicator has moved up in recent days-and that is very welcome. Let us hope it is a sign of better things to come. But there remains a real danger that the schedule will continue to interfere, deferred as it is, both now and, more seriously, create a real problem further down the road. The coalition, in recognising this failing of the Government, has moved an amendment to effectively abolish the debt reduction schedule. In the end it is all about market confidence. There is a critical need to understand that confidence is the key to investment and in a nation where confidence is lacking, it is no surprise to find that investment is lacking, and the wool market, of course, is no different. The irony of it is that the sooner we can . restore confidence, the sooner prices are likely to recover and the more quickly the debt can be repaid. No one denies the need to repay the debt. Growers have a vested interest in the rapid repayment of the debt because they are stuck with the costs of servicing the debt and paying for the stockpiling of wool. This question of confidence is an important one and it sometimes seems to me that there is a shortage of people on the other side of the House who understand the need for stability, for a secure economic environment, a predictable economic environment. as the key to confidence. It was highlighted for me towards the end of last year-and I recount the episode because it actually relates to the wool industry-when the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) moved a motion in this place which was to the effect that employers who broke the conditions of awards ought to find that they face stiffer penalties. There was no mention, I might add, in that resolution of penalties for employees broke awards-only employers. It was related to the Troubleshooters case in the shearers dispute in Queensland. Mr Bruce Scott-Around Charleville.",77
128,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes. We have touched Government on this issue today. Again I say to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that one of the things he could do for the industry at the moment, and particularto ly for shearers, is to go in there and fight case in relation to the 2.5 per cent increase for shearers which the industry cannot afford to pay at the moment. Wool growers' have been halved over the last three years while shearers' incomes have risen by 28 per cent. That is a constructive thing that could done which I would suggest would be welwhich comed by the vast bulk of shearers, let alone wool growers. It is the one area where there could be scope for some cost cutting in the interests of the survival of the industry and all the players in it, including shearers. But I will come back to the story I was telling. While we were talking about the need to ensure that wool growers survive so that there are jobs there, not just for the growers but for shearers as well when this crisis is over, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made one of his notable interjections. He called out across the chamber that the honourable member for Gwydir would not know anything about running a it small business, and then interestingly added that there are more small businessmen on that side of the House than there are over here. thought that was an interesting challenge. suggested to whoever was in the Chair at time that we take some silence and that honourable member for Kalgoorlie be invited to name every small businessman on that side of the House. It is my belief that someone who has not run one through the ups and downs of a few tough times does not undergather stand the need for confidence. The interesting thing is honourable member Kalgoorlie a couple of minutes and he could not come up with one. His only response was to say, 'Well, I used to run one'. We know there are some nowfor example, the Minister for Industry, Techwho nology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths). He now is a small businessman,as 'recent press reports indicate, so we will watch for some great insights from him into this whole question of the need for confidence as the key to investment. But hopefully the will recognise the need to take an absolutely firm position here, to send an absolutely strong message that there will be no fire sale; there will be no situation allowed arise in which the market can be put in a the situation where it speculates on what is about to happen in the future. Under those circumstances we hope that the Government will incomes support us in our amendment. I would like to draw to the attention of be honourable members several other things should be done, and done urgently. The Government's gesture-and it is more than a gesture-in making $50 million available for interest rate subsidies under the exceptional of circumstances provision of RAS are welcome. Growers appreciate that; people on the land appreciate that and they welcome it. But I point out that it must be seen in the context of, I think, two things: the need to decide as a nation, if you like, that we are going to ensure the survival of the rural sector in general through this current dreadful crisis, and the wool industry in particular. We must make that national determination. We must simply resolve that that is the way is going to be, and in that context we must now note that Australia's farm debt has burgeoned out to a staggering $15.6 billion I and interest payments on that debt now I amount to something of the order of $12 the billion a yeara truly frightening figure. the Again I say to the Minister that the new interest rate subsidies under RAS are welcome; there is no question about that. If they reach every wool grower-and 90 per cent of them would need them in the sense that I they could be painted as unviable at the moment-the subsidies would be worth that we gave the $1,000 a farmer. Today the Minister accused me of avoiding the New South Wales issue, namely, that Government's decision to pay interest rate subsidies up to only 80 per cent, not the 100 per cent possible under the exceptional circumstances provision. The Minister ignores the fact that New South Wales has already put $23.4 million of its own money into drought assistance without a cent of Commonwealth assistance. Mr Crean-Rubbish.",78
129,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"In relation to drought assistance that is fact-and continues to provide 50 per cent subsidies on the transport of fodder, water and livestock. That has made a great difference in ensuring the survival of New South Wales flock and herds. Furthermore, New South Wales will offer the 80 per cent maximum on both old and new debt, which just happens to be better than the likely offering from at least one of the Labor State Governments, which I understand intends not to offer 100 per cent interest rate subsidies old debt, and it will allow the New South Wales Government to target more growers than would otherwise be the case. I think they deserve acknowledgment for that. Certainly New South Wales farmer representatives do acknowledge that. The Minister also conveniently ignores the fact that it was his Government which removed drought from the natural disaster relieve arrangements and so is in part responsible for the crisis in many areas of the country now affected by drought. There is a broad acceptance that drought is a recurring theme in this country. It is something that - rural Australians have to be prepared to confront and to plan for, although how one does that in the economic environment in which farmers have been operating for the last few years is utterly beyond me. It is worth observing in any case that the severity of the current drought simply puts it into a category which no farmer could possibly hope to plan for. The Minister also talks about helping farmers meet world best practice. It needs to be noted that the Australian farm sector is amongst the most productive in the world and that our productivity improvements in recent years have shown the rest of the Australian community what productivity improvements are all about. They have a record of which they can be extremely proud. It is time that we focused on one of the real issues in the farm sector, namely, that lack of profitability is the major thing that will hold back our ability to increase productivity in the future. Just 10 days ago we talked to farmers in the St George area of the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). We were told that grain farmers in that area are using equipment that is technologically years out of date. Those farmers just cannot afford to update. It is not a question of will, skill or capacity for work; it is a question of profitability. That is an issue that we cannot run away from. The Minister accuses me of sidestepping issues, yet he continues to sidestep the fact that taxes on farming inputs amount to a three to five per cent penalty in our competitiveness on on foreign markets. That issue will not go away. It is an issue that the Government must confront, as I said at the beginning, not simply in international trade competitiveness but our capacity to hold at bay imports from places like New Zealand. No business can consistently afford to give its competitors that sort of advantage. The fact is that the coalition would have removed this burden. Mr Crean-And you would have whacked 15 per cent on everything people bought.",79
130,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Not on business costs, as the Minister well knows. Mr Crean-Now you can't fund it because you have dropped the GST.",79
131,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,The problem remains. Mr Crean-Answer the question.,79
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Jenkins)Order! The Minister will cease interjecting.,79
133,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Is the Minister mounting a justification for continuing to tax our exports? Is that the position? It is not! So the Minister acknowledges that we ought to stop taxing inputs. Mr Crean-We should minimise it, which is what we have done.",79
134,Mr ANDERSON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the Minister. The Government can minimise it a lot more yet. Based on Treasury's figures, farm sector inputs are taxed at over $1 billion. The problem remains, and we will watch to see what the Government does about it. Another $1.3 billion is levied in the food processing sector. We hear a great deal from the Minister about value adding, and we support him in that. It is certainly an important area that needs further development and expansion in this country. However, we still have taxes on that sector which bind its international competitiveness and we still have a long way to go in industrial relations flexibility. It needs to be remembered that when we talk on a per farm basis-and I acknowledge that these are generalisations-Treasury estimated that around $8,000 per Australian farm in cost inputs resulted from nonrebatable tax costs on production. I will back the benefit of removing that against the Government's bit here and bit there approach to addressing the problem after the horse has largely bolted. We thank the Government for the assistance that is there. We plead with the Government to ensure that the assistance is ongoing in sufficient quantities to ensure the survival of the farm sector, because that is critical not just for the players in it but for the nation. We welcome the Minister's commitment to that, but we cannot avoid getting the structural issues addressed in this country to ensure a long-term, fully competitive environment for the farm sector in which to operate. I commend my amendment to the House.",79
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Thckey-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,80
136,Mr SNOW,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I urge the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) not to accept this amendment to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill. It would be a grave mistake for the Minister to accept this amendment because it would do exactly the opposite of what the Opposition claims. The amendment, in part, reads: ... the House is of the opinion that the retention in legislation of any time limit sends the wrong signals to an uncertain wool market. If anything would send the wrong signals to an uncertain wool market, it would be the acceptance of this amendment. The Opposition appears to be tacitly approving the fact that the industry owns the debt and the wool stockpile. If this amendment were passed, it would affect the pressure on the industry to face up to the problem of acquitting the stockpile and its debt. The Opposition says that it is not about transferring the stockpile debt to the taxpayers, but that is what would happen. If the amendment were passed, the cost of the debt would increase, the cost of keeping the stockpile would increase, which would mean more cost to the fanners. The wool would be much harder to sell. It is quite clear that sales from the stockpile would have a negative impact on grower prices. It would also have an undesirably longer term impact on grower returns and mean a drop in the adjustment pressures on the industry. Eden-Monaro is a strong wool-growing, fishing and dairy area. Representatives of all those industries say to me, 'We have to have the right price signals at the right time'. This amendment will do exactly the opposite. I am sure the Liberal Party sees it and I think the National Party members see it as well. The National Party members are great agrarian socialists, and I like them for that reason. They certainly try to look after their industry. But sometimes they do not have the courage to take some of the hard decisions. Very often it has been a Labor government that has taken the hard decisions one way or another, whether it has been in the wheat, wool, fishing, timber or any other industry. If the amendment were passed, it would reduce the pressures on farmers to reduce wool production. People do not want that; they want the truth. They want to see the facts. They want the price signals early and immediately. If this amendment were passed, it would also increase the period of potential risk which is underwritten by Australian taxpayers through the Government guarantee, which is $2.28 billion. Does the Opposition want the Australian taxpayers to take that over? That would be approximately one-fortieth of the Government's expenditure per year. The Opposition says it is not asking the taxpayers to do that. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. If the amendment were passed, it would also prolong the period of uncertainty in the industry both from the grower perspective and, very importantly, from the processor perspective. The Opposition has also argued about the changes in the tax system. It has called on the Government to do more. It has suggested a 12-month waiving, for instance, of the debt repayment, but that would back load the debt within the remaining years of the repayment. Wool growers and taxpayers will not want that. Alternatively, the passing of the amendment may mean a substantial increase in tax, and certainly taxpayers would reject that. If one looks at the cost per individual taxpayer and divides $10 million into $2.28 billion, one will see that it is a substantial burden on any taxpayer. Surely, they would write that off. The debt could be allowed to increase, but that would be intolerable. In time of recession, every government in the world is trying to get away from allowing its debts to increase. Another alternative would be to abolish the wool tax. We cannot afford to allow the industry debt to stay at that $2.28 billion; can we allow the possibility of increasing sales to replace tax revenue. We must look at the wool industry in true perspective in the international fibre market. The wool industry represents five per cent of the international - fibre market. We are kidding ourselves if we assume we can sell more wool on the international market just by saying we want to. It is very likely that abolishing the wool tax would not allow industry liabilities to be fully covered. The Opposition has called for lower wages for shearers. That certainly will not be a solution to any problem. Shearers have a legitimate right to pursue higher wages. There are problems at the moment, and I support the idea of work pennits for New Zealanders to meet some of the competition. I believe that by the end of this year the Labour Party will be re-elected in New Zealand and that some sense will be put back into the New Zealand industrial relations laws. It is very important that that happens because shearers are grossly underpaid. It is ridiculous if people are prepared to come here and get 80c for shearing a sheep when the rate should be $1.20 or $1.30. I hope that a Labor government in New Zealand would realise that it is ridiculous and change the system. I lived in the electorate of Mallee for many years, for most of my childhood and for much of my adulthood, having had a business in the Wimmera. I know how fanners think. The wise heads were saying only a few years ago to most of us who have substantial wool industry components, 'Because of the high wool prices, we just cannot keep going the way we are. It will tell against us in the end'. That is exactly what happened. We turnedand I say 'we' because we in this Parliament must share the responsibility-a minimum reserve price scheme into a price propping mechanism. I am prepared to share the blame, but there were wise heads around in the rural industries who were saying, 'We are making a mistake going this way'. Those wise heads know from experience; there have been six crises. Sir William Vines recalled going through those crises and he said that the current crisis was the second nor worse. All six crises have been bad, but people have learned from those crises. We should have learned and should not have made the mistakes with the reserve price plan. We might still have it if it were a true reserve minimum price mechanism. There was no real recognition that wool had a low proportion of sales relative to total sales throughout the world. We acted as if we could produce and then find the market. What a fallacy! We made a mistake. Let us admit it now and let us not do it again. We should not take that attitude. We need to produce for the market and not try to market what we have produced. If the market will not buy, then we are in trouble-and that is exactly what happened. Japan and other countries rebelled against the price. Large buyer groups collapsed-for instance, in the USSR-and we had problems with sales to China. To some extent, China was buying from Argentina. Now there is a recession in the Northern Hemisphere. These are all problems which we must face, accept and work around. We will not do it by sending the wrong price signals to Australia's farmers and shoving responsibility onto Australia's taxpayers. There can be a strong wool industry. Wool is still a great fibre and compares more than favourably with any human made fibre that I know of. Fortunately, ideas are now coming forward about using wool for insulation and the manufacture of warm weather fabrics. Our increasing international markets are in Asia and Japan. These countries are buying more and more from us and have reasonable growth rates compared with countries in the Northern Hemisphere where the recession is having a greater effect. Most of us believe that Japan will come out of its recession soon and some eastern European countries are getting their acts together. I believe these countries will be buying. We are getting more wool into manufacturing and that needs to continue. Eventually the Commonwealth of Independent States will get its act together and will want wool. So there is hope and promise. The Government was supported by responsible people in the industry, and what it is doing is right. It is interesting that local organisations in Eden-Monaro, and probably in other areas throughout Australia, supported the measures that were being taken by the Government the day after they were taken. As the Minister said earlier today, there be hurt and pain. There is hurt and pain. The National Farmers Federation and other organisations have claimed that the rural adjustment scheme is the way to go and that is what they have been suggesting to the Government. I must agree with a comment made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) when he said that our farmers have some of the world's best practices. It is true that their practices com. pare more than favourably with farmers anywhere in the world. They will come out of this crisis, but we will not do it by sending them the wrong price signals. Whether it is the dairy, fishing, timber or wool industry, they all say, 'We want to know where we stand and where we are'. This amendment does not do that. I strongly urge the Government not to accept the amendment and I certainly support the Bill.",80
137,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (9.38 p.m.)May I begin by saying that it is a great pity that, notwithstanding the brevity of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill, this very important matter is limited by guillotine. We had some words to say about that yesterday, but it does not alter the fact that many honourable members wish to be able to put forward their views on this matter on behalf of the people who have recently restated their faith in them during the election. Before the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) leaves the chamber, he might like to hear a few comments I have to make regarding his contribution. I was interested to hear him say that the Labor Party is the one party which takes the hard decisions. Yes, the hard decisions on our constituency. It is not for it to take the hard decisions on its constituency-the labour market-in these difficult times. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro went on and told us that pastoralists and graziers must grin and bear it because these wool are hard financial times, we have a world recession and a few other things to boot. He said that the community of people who service that industry should be able to maintain their daily lifestyles, even if that requires will substantial further indebtedness on behalf of the wool grower. I have never been able to understand the logic of that. I do not want to see people in poverty, but certainly when a person can no longer afford to pay for the single item of shearing his sheep from his revenue it would appear to be time that the people who shear those sheep should at least do it at last year's price, if not cheaper. I was told years ago that in Iceland there is a very simple policy for setting wages-they are tied to the price of fish. I am not being facetious; it is simply that the economy survives on fish, and when fish prices fall, apparently wages fall. Maybe we are going to have to look at some of those situations, because the simple fact is that the workers in the industry are not getting the work that they used to get. I have had shearers, good friends of mine, ring me over the last couple of years complaining bitterly of the disruption to their income stream. As prices have fallen, and consequently the relative costs of shearing increase, farmers are doing it themselves. Even on my property my manager now crutches the sheep. He is not too pleased about it, I would think, though I am not saying he has complained-but the simple fact is that he knows that we have to do those sorts of things. A job that used to earn some quite substantial sums for shearers in the district is now done in-house, and around my property farmers are clubbing together to shear their sheep. The market prevails in the end, but it is a bit silly when maybe, if shearers were allowed by the award system to be a bit more competitive, the situation could be improved. We saw an outrageous example in Queensland when they locked a bloke up because he wanted to work on Saturday. Can a bigger crime be imagined than a man wanting to work on Saturday, and having people willing to work with him? They locked him up. They talk about neanderthal man; that is a neanderthal law. Yet it is supported wholeheartedly by the AWU in that State. This Bill extends the debt repayment schedule by one year, from seven to eight years. We know the reason for that. The industry at the moment is suffering from that stockpile which, I think we would all agree in this House, was accumulated very unwisely. Of course, most of us would take the blame for that. I think even we in this Parliament to believe in fairies. The other factor which has added to that is the international recession, and the fact that all around the world at the moment where woollen goods are consumed, people are just pulling last year's jumper out of the drawer, or staying with last year's suit. Demand has dropped considerably, and that has been added to by a major fall in buyer confidence. I do not think anyone would dispute the fact that buying, marketing or processing wool is a pretty hazardous profession, because the lag in the pipeline is considerable. It takes quite a long time between lodging a bid-honourable members will recall the auction here in Parliament House just a year or so ago-and seeing a product actually manufactured. During that time, various investors are taking the risk of the value of that wool not falling. There have no doubt been big paper losses in the last. six months, as those who bought six or twelve months ago have seen the value of their stocks on hand depreciated by the fall in the greasy market here in Australia. That loss of confidence is added to by the fact that these wool buyers not only have to make judgments as to the production capacity of Australian wool growers, both in terms of too much and too little, because they have to have a continuous supply; they are now, because of the stockpile and its circumstances, being called on to bet against the whim of politicians. They have to gamble about what might be done in this place. They have told me time and time again they are prepared to gamble on the known uncertainties in their industry, but they find politicians very hard to work out. They have found this Government even worse because it actually made a promise. It told them, 'Don't you worry about that; 700c is it'. It is going to take quite a lot to get that confidence back. We know, for a start, that the mere announcement of this extension of one year in the stockpile has appeared to have had an effect on the market. It has come up a little because at least some believe that the Government at this point of time is dinkum and that they can get in some wool and try to get it through the system in tended the extra year that has been provided. I think they now anticipate minimal sales from the stockpile this year, but in about six months time they are going to lose their nerve again. That is why the Opposition has come up and said the Government has either got to tell them there is no debt repayment schedule, or they are going to be betting every six months on how much the Government is going to unload to try to catch up. They will gamble. The gambling factor has got to the point where there has never really been a futures market since the wool market has been deregulated and the AWC's role discontinued. The biggest gamblers in the world, the ones that have gambled millions on the turns and fluctuations in commodity markets, will not touch it with a forty-foot pole. It is too uncertain, the uncertainty factor being the whim of politicians. Consequently, the Government has to take very seriously the recommendation of the Opposition, which is that the Government should announce to the industry that it is there until it comes and buys the stuff at a reasonable price. Otherwise, and I do not quote this as party policy, the Government does that for, say, three years and announces at this point in time, or shortly, an exact schedule as to how that stockpile will be disposed of bale by bale, stencil by stencil. That would put certainty back into the market. It might terrify a lot of people, but they would at least know when certain quantities and types of wool were coming from the stockpile to the market. I could not envisage this commencing within three years, but producers would also be able to take some account of that arrangement. That is not my recommendation; I stand with the amendment proposed by the Opposition. I do point out that that is the only alternative. By one means or another we have got to put some confidence in the market that extends past six months. Unfortunately, notwithstanding that I as a wool grower and on behalf of many wool growers am grateful that the Government has at least extended the scheme for one year .and put that 18c or whatever it is of confidence back into the market, it is all going to be collapsing in about October when many wool growers in my electorate, being spring shearers, are going to find themselves trying to sell their wool. That is the first thing that we have to understand. Whilst I have the opportunity, I would like to look at some of the other things that have been mentioned. The most desirable option is being able to sell the stockpile with honour and at a price that is reasonable. There have been more snake oil remedies proposed to achieve that than one could throw a stick at. It is a pity because from time to time we hear some remedies that are plainly foolish. The one that annoys me more than any is the idea that we can just give our wool to certain countries in the world that are in very bad financial circumstances and hope that would not offend our cash paying customers. Quite clearly it would, and considering the desperation of some of those countries for hard currency we would probably find them reselling the wool. The other idea is barter. That is over simplified in many cases. For instance, we could probably buy oil from some countries if they could get it out of the ground, but they know very well that if they could get it out of the ground they could sell it for hard currency. So they do not want to barter oil for wool. Possibly there are some opportunities for farming groups to get together and possibly barter for fertiliser. I would like to make a couple of suggestions to the Government which I was planning to introduce about this time. In the circumstances it is not time for politics but for solutions. I believe that one suggestion that has been overlooked-it is certainly not one that would dispose of the stockpile but would make a contribution-is to examine the tourist industry in eastern Europe. I have visited other there on one occasion and I was impressed with a lot of the tourist opportunities. It appears to me that if we could sell some wool for roubles in these eastern European countries by way of the normal trade-I do not suggest this for government, I think it is an initiative that has got to be taken by farmer organisations or someone else, maybe with some assistance from government-we could then finance at least the internal travel of Australian tourists. I cannot see why we could not finance American tourists with those same roubles if we had some tourist offices operating there. It is not a huge prospect but I believe it is bigger than some people think. The tourist market is looking for new frontiers and I do not think there is any doubt that eastern Europe offers some of those frontiers. The other thing that struck me was the foundation of Australian National Wool Day that you and I participated in, Mr Deputy Speaker, as well as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). I hope that next year he will be able to convince the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he was rather foolish not to have attended and taken the spot that the Minister got. The simple fact is that that started after I read some CSIRO information on its invention of a suitable wool filling for a doona, remembering that wool has a tendency to felt, and it really needed some change. CSIRO found the solution and we had an excellent product. I investigated why Australians were not buying more doonas, and we gave that maximum publicity through this Parliament. In my research I found that the Japanese use 10 million doonas a year of which a very small number would be woollen. On a visit to the doona manufacturer I said, 'How are sales going in Japan?'. He said, 'We are getting a few but we have a little problem. The marketing system is such that our $200 doona becomes a $500 doona in Japan'. That has nothing to do with the freight, as we know. I have looked at that problem because it seems, as with many things in Japan, that we complain about non-tariff barriers in that country. But it seems that the greatest non-tariff barrier is its own marketing system. When we confront the Japanese and say, 'Why can't I come here and start a grocer shop or a retail outlet?', they say, 'You can'. There is really no law preventing that. I recommend to the Minister that, with products such as this, including our beef and all the other items that get so highly costed by the time they get to the consumer in Japan, it is possibly time to look at establishing-I guess at some cost to government-some on - consignment type retail premises that would provide a space for Australian manufacturers and producers to sell products that could be retailed directly from Australia to Japanese consumers, and maybe to other parts of the world, as a showcase. We would carry some of the costs of wages and rent, but hopefully some of that amount would be recouped from the markup. Again I think it is an opportunity, when the retailer up the road complains, once we have demonstrated what price that doona should be, to ask, 'How many do you want?'. They may be small suggestions but they are at least practical, and the Government might take some notice of them. I wish to comment on other aspects of the Government's recently announced policy which relates to the additional $50 million of RAS subsidy and interest subsidy. I would like to add to what was said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Eden Monaro, and the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson), that we must be grateful for everything that can be provided to the industry at present. Nevertheless, it is too little. The Minister in another comment today mentioned $300 million that already goes inMr Crean-Three hundred and twenty.",82
138,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Three hundred and twenty over three years. Mr Crean-Over two.,85
139,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Why cannot the Minister say by the year? One of the things that annoy me most about this Government is that there are big headlines referring to hundreds of millions of bucks and then in the fine print it says, 'Over the next five, 10,20 or 25 years'. If the Government tried to do this in business, consumer protection would lock it up. The simple fact is that drought assistance is $210 million in one year. In the first year of drought, Malcolm Fraser gave farmers $400 million. Who was the beneficiary? It was this Government. Malcolm Fraser kept the industry afloat and, as soon as it rained, those opposite were able to reap the benefits in improved economic activity. Surely the message is: 'You can spend the money on our productive sector and create some real jobs or you can payout on the dole'. The Government has the choice. In the end, all Australians suffer in these situations. I have never been overexcited with the RAS approach. Interest subsidies are better than some of the loans they make. The situation that occurs most in my electorate is this: if a farmer is considered viable the banks will not give him any money as they say he does not need it. If he is considered not viable the banks will not give him any money eitherhe does not get it either way. I do not know why we ever needed a bureaucratic bank. If we wanted to go down that road years ago we should have given government guarantees under some successful system and backed it with a government. fund. Nevertheless, we have got there. The biggest problem facing the industry was that, at the most critical possible time, the Government threw out the income equalisation deposit, the one means by which a farmer could account for, and make provision for, the only certainties of agriculture, cyclical and seasonal downturn. It is just ridiculous to find farmers in the situation, as they will be, coming out of the current tragedy where we have had the two joined together, seasonal and cyclical downturn. It will rain, maybe wool prices will pick up and other things will come good, but for every dollar the farmers need to pay off the bank they will have to earn three because the tax man will have his hand out for two. It is an impossible situation. In the good times the farmers have got to be able to take the benefit of an lED type system. I put it to the MinisterMr Crean interjecting",85
140,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,The Minister reinstated it when they did not have one penny to put in it and you had the greatest tax rake-offMr Crean-Give us a bit of credit.,86
141,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"You put it back, but you put it back when it was no good. You took it out at the very critical timeMr Crean-Do you want us to knock it off again?",86
142,Mr TUCKEY,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I certainly do not. What I am saying is that, if those opposite used a bit of sense and looked at it, they will see that is the long-term solution to all these problems. If it were put together properly, some of the more silly aspects of it put away, and it were just accepted as part of the industry structure, people could use that and the Government could do away with RAS over time, drought relief-the lot. Even those in debt could use it by offsetting it against debt. I ask the Government to look further at this system, make it the issue but set it in concrete so that we do not get somebody like Senator Walsh getting a chip on his shoulder about some St Georges Terrace or Collins Street farmer and chucking the baby out with the bathwater.",86
143,Mr MCLACHLAN,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to contribute to the debate on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill because I feel very strongly that there are some things that need to be said that have not been said already. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to refer to some remarks that you made in a previous life about 23 minutes ago as the honourable member for Eden Monaro. You seemed to indicate that the Opposition's amendment was about not repaying the debt. That is a complete nonsense. We are not saying that we should not repay the debt, but that we should repay the debt and that the schedule for doing so should not be announced to the world. We do not go to the buyers who, as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said so aptly, love to play the market, and tell them what our debt is, tell them what the lender is demanding of us, so that when we are on the edge, or when they think we are going to get close to the edge, they can start to play the market and pull out of it. If it were not for a factor such as that, this particular Bill would not be necessary and we would not have it in the House. There are other factors, including a world recession. If one asks those people around the world who process wool, they will say that there is a public debt repayment schedule for all the world to see-not only in general, but in detail-and that next year we were to repay $400 million, the year after that $500 million it and the year after that $550 million. If that had not been there, we would not be in a position where those people were able to play the market-and not only play the market and hang off it now, but also do so even more in the future. The purpose of the amendment which says that we did not want the extension of the repayment schedule for the wool debt to be retained in legislation, involved its publication. It was not about the schedule; it was about not telling the world. I think the Minister understands that point very well and I hope that as time goes on he will do something about it. We have two very serious problems: one is the current supply, which is over and above demand; and the other is the stockpile. I have just come from the NFF annual meeting and of magnitude. around those tables at that dinner I have seen the saddest faces in the history of wool growing and they have good reason to be 1\vo and a half weeks ago we had the lowest real prices in the history of wool growing this country. In the 19th century the lowest price probably in 1894 when people could glean seven pence per pound if they happened to growing wool in the eastern States. If they happened to be growing the slightly rougher stuff in my State, it was about five pence pound. In 1989-90 terms, that equated to about SOOc per kilogram. By 1931 in the middle of the Depression it was kilogram, which equated to 350c per kilogram in 1989-90 terms. In 1970 it was worse than that. The price had got down to 331c per kilogram in those terms. At the end of April this year the market indicator was 381c clean, which is equivalent of about 26Sc a kilogram greasytonne. which equates to those other figures. In other words, it was 28 per cent or so less than the middle of the Great Depression in 1931 and a lower price in real terms than ever before in the history of growing wool. The reserve price scheme commenced in 1974 at about 250c per kilogram. It wandered along for a while, going up a bit at a time taking into account world inflation. By it had got to 460c. By 1987 it had got 87Oc-a price wrongly pushed by - and agreed to by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), and it broke the wool industry. That will go down in history and in the economic textbooks as cartel situation beyond parallel which was absolute disaster. I want to take up a point which was raised by the honourable member for O'Connor taken up by the Minister for Primary Indusscheme, tries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table. Over the last few years, from about be made. 1985 onwards, something of the order of $2 billion has been paid by wool growers in personal income tax. It is hard to work because the figures are mixed up with other enterprises, but it is approximately that order It is no good saying that the Government has had extra income from the reserve price sad. scheme when the price itself was above the reserve price. But when the reserve price got in well above the actual price, as it did in 198990 and 1990-91, then we had the bank lendwas ing the money to the wool corporation, the wool corporation paying the money to the be grower, the grower making a profit because it was topping up the grower's proceeds, and the grower paying tax to the Government. We per now say, not without merit, that the grower should repay that debt. Who is the only net beneficiary of that scheme? It is the Federal 16c per Government; no-one else. If one wants to take a rather extraneous analogy, one could take the example of the citrus industry. This industry averages about $200 per tonne for oranges-that is not so at the moment, but that is the average. We will the invent a scheme and pay growers $400 per We will go to the bank and borrow $100 million. We will do that for a few years in and, after a while, we will have so much . citrus concentrate that nobody can store it. We will then say, 'The scheme is over. Now you have to pay back the $100 million'. Who is the only net beneficiary of that sort of scheme? It is only the Treasury because it and picked up the personal income tax from a 1984 scheme that took that money around the to mulberry bush from the bank to the grower the industry and into the Treasury. In the last two years of that scheme, by my calculations, the Federal Government picked up between $500 million and $750 million in personal income tax from the growers. I say a to the Minister at the table: it is no good an boasting about the money he is handing back; that scheme created the money, not the price of wool because the price of wool had to be and topped up. So his largesse comes from the otherwise he would not have had the money to dispense. I think that point needs to As I said, there are two problems in this industry: one is the current stockpile and the out other is the current oversupply. 1\vo years ago in this House and all around the hustings I pleaded with the industry and the Minister to get a stock slaughtering scheme going. Finally, under duress, he did just that. At stage he said he was quite happy to allocate $100 million to it. But in the end-I understand because the people did not like it-that scheme was brought to a halt. It was brought to a halt when the land was very dry and sheep could have been bought off the land and put under the ground for very little money when people were overstocked. But in the event, 11 million sheep disappeared for one reason or another. We could have got rid of another 20 million. This Minister has been going around the country saying that we have too much supply and that we will have to reduce it. We gave the Government a commercial method of doing that whereby the sheep could have been bought and put under the ground in the most humane way. Although the animal liberationists kicked up about it, there was not too much trouble at the time because there was a war going on in the Middle East which was slightly more important. But what happened? The Minister ran out of courage and cancelled the scheme. About 100 million kilograms of wool would not have been produced, but for those guys opposite running out of guts just under the middle of the rib cage. We have a current oversupply problem-one which could have been fixed. But it was a bit hard to handle the reasons I have just outlined. We now hear comments from the experts in the trade-and some of them are experts. Mr Drysdale, the chairman of the wool corporation, says that we have to raise less sheep. Some of the Queenslanders-rightly or' wrongly-say that we have to have quotas. But they are unworkable, they always have been and they always will be. There is no point in going ahead with that because, if there are quotas on sheep, people will finish up putting more wool in the shed and so on. Nobody has ever come at that scheme with any real enthusiasm once the difficulties of have been understood . Now even the Minister is saying that we must grow less wool. There are people around the world who say that we must bum the stockpile. That is obviously not a tenable alternative. But I have to say that I know why one Bernard Florin carne out from France and said that: he wanted to make us think about our obligation if we did bum it. There would be no storage costs-it might be expensive to bum it, but let us leave that aside-but there would be an interest factor to meet. On today's rate, if that interest factor were put together it might amount to something like $145 million. In times past, the value of the woolclip has increased by $2.3 billion in one year. So $140 million as an offset to a rise in the wool price is nothing. I do not raise that point to advocate the burning of the stockpile, but we might have to get rid of some of it at an early discount. I think the honourable member for O'Connor-with whom I disagree slightly on this matter-said that he was against selling it to the old Soviet Union and other places. I suggest that, if we can get rid of two million bales of this wool, we will not have to worry about the other two million-the market will take care of it. I know of many good judges who think that is the case. In other words, the shadow of the stockpile overhanging the market is the two million bales on the top end, not the two million at the bottom end. We have got rid of the bottom end a couple of times in the past. On the last occasion we got rid of two million bales in a year. The for shadow of the stockpile is that part of the stockpile that goes from two million to four million bales. If this were a totally commercial operation, the commercial operator would undertake to move two million bales at a discount-as much as possible into non-traditional areas. By 'non-traditional', I am excluding the USSR by dint of the fact that any number of roubles cannot match an American dollar, and including those areas to which we have not looked before. If we lose some money doing that, I believe that it will be picked up in the long term with the sale of the last million or it million and a half bales. That is a very important point. That is why the Frenchman to whom I referred-who, I can assure honourable members, is not an unwise Frenchmancame to this country and urged us to look at the costs being incurred now, and then look at what might happen to the whole of the industry once the shadow of the stockpile has disappeared. There are a number of ideas floating around-as there always are in desperate circumstances. I have already mentioned the quota scheme. There are those who still insist that there might be a reserve price scheme. We had a good reserve price scheme but, human nature being what it is, we got rid of it by ramping the price. If a new reserve price scheme is introduced, someone will have to finance it. But nobody will finance it: not the Government, not the growers, and not the banks. We might as well forget impossibilities, because the fact of the matter is that that is not going to happen. If by any remote chance it were to happen, the tragedy would be that in X years time, when our children have forgotten the lessons of today, somebody would probably start to ramp the price again-in which case we would be back where we started. I repeat that with this amendment there is no intention not to repay the debt. But the Government must act in this matter. I know that it has people looking at it-commercial people and so on with all sorts of viewpoints-but the Government must act in a slightly more commercial way. It might have to not take chances but have more flexibility. If it is too rigid in this matter then the market will read it, and it will continue to read it because the market is quite wise about these things. I believe that it will be possible to a couple of million bales at a discount and pick up that money later on. It is extremely important to understand that the stockpile is currently our worse enemy. The problem is the size of the stockpile rather than the stockpile as a whole, and it is the two million bales on the top which is so desperately inhibiting. I would like to return to what the honourable member for O'Connor was saying earlier about the lED scheme. When wool raised $2 billion in personal tax, some of which was provided to the Treasury by the reserve price scheme itself, and by nothing else, we did not have an lED scheme. Senator Peter Walsh and the Treasurer at the time, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), removed an excellent lED scheme. Although that lED scheme started with low interest rates, they moved up a bit and it became remotely possible for people to abuse it. Had the lED scheme stayed in place, and had Senator Walsh not had a log on his shoulder about it, there would be a lot fewer people in trouble in this country. The money that is now offered with great munificence by the Minister would not be his to offer because it would have been in the lED scheme and redeemed, in the normal course of events, on an annual basis as people got into trouble. It is extraordinarily important for people to understand that lED schemes of the future must be conservative, must preserve the value of the investment and inflation, and not be open to abuse. They must be schemes that take into account the good years for depositing and the bad years for redemption. Of course, tax should only be paid during that redemption. I remind the Minister of two major points. The first is in regard to the stockpile. Half of it must go, and it must go quickly. If it goes at a discount, too bad; we will pick it up down the track. In regard to the Bill under consideration, to announce the schedule is financial and commercial madness. The Opposition is not interested in abolishing the repayment of these moneys by wool growers, but we are interested in stopping the madness of announcing our vulnerability to the world. sell I ask the Minister to take some notice of those remarks.",86
144,Mr COBB,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I begin my remarks by reminding the House of the dire state in which the rural industry in general finds itself, and the wool industry in particular. We have heard the figures that have been floated around to the effect that the average wool grower in Australia last year, this year and next year-over that three-year period-will lose $108,000. The grave situation that the wool industry finds itself in goes beyond money figures. Heartbreak and anguish is being suffered out there by familiescertainly that is so in my electorate. Parents are trying to educate their children. The bills are mounting each day. Many families cannot pay those bills and that is putting great stress on them. Debts and overdrafts are increasing and often cannot be serviced. Families are pulling their children out of secondary education. Farmers are trying to shear their own flocks. Tl1at reminds me of the madness of shearers' wages going up by 2112 per cent, totally ignoring the capacity to pay criterion. I do not deny shearers their money; in fact, it is about the hardest job left these days since the abolition of plunge dipping and the cutting of sugar cane by hand. The average shearer probably takes home only $25,000 a year and the more busy ones probably only $40,000. It is a very skilled and hard job, but they will put themselves out of a job if they ask for further wage rises. I regret to say we have a growing number of cases of farms being sold up. Equity falls for all the surrounding farms when that happens. There is a large section of the eastern seaboard experiencing drought, which makes for a particularly desperate situation in my electorate. I have an area from Bourke north up to Enngonia, east across to Weilmoringle and Goodooga and down towards Brewarrina, and then another area across to Wanaaring. The drought moves south every day. South-western Queensland has been ravaged by drought for some time. It is affecting wool growing as well as the cattle industry. Last Saturday, I was in Bourke with the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). We visited two properties: one of 55,()()() acres with primarily red soil and another, just opposite that property, of 35,000 acres with black soil. Neither had had useful rain since March-April 1990. To drive over both was like driving around the moon. There was not even one dead blade of grass on either property. One property was down from ll,()()() sheep to 5,000 sheep and the other property was down from 7,000 or 8,000 sheep to 2,000 sheep. One wonders what will happen to those remaining sheep this winter. The year before last one farmer lost $120,000. Last year he lost $90,000. This year he will have a good year-he has tightened up his operation-and he will lose about $30,000. Those sorts of figures have been off a 200-bale clip. Both farms have off-farm income. Three out of the four husbands and wives are working. Even that is not helping, because one of the farmers lost $40,000 on his off-farm income this year as a result of the rural recession impacting on small business in country towns. One farmer and his wife had to sell off some flats in Sydney in which they had some money invested. They have nothing to look forward to, apart from what they make off their farm. I mention that so that honourable members will know what is happening out there. The whole western division of New South Wales is largely limited to growing wool, and nothing else. So they do not have anywhere to go in situations like this. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill that we are debating here tonight merely changes one figure in the present Act. It extends the repayment schedule out from seven years to eight years; in other words, it gives a one-year extension for paying off the debt. When the reserve price scheme was abandoned, the debt was $2.7 billion. Today, it has been reduced down to $2.26 billion, largely as a result of being able to sell off 539,()()() bales in the first year and collecting nine per cent tax from growers. That allowed a $412 million reduction. This year we have a 4.5 per cent tax for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and we will probably sell a bit over 100,000 bales. The realisation committee probably could have got away without selling any wool in 1993-94, but the schedule at present has a requirement for the first year, 1991-92, to sell $20 million worth of wool. As I have just explained, it well exceeded that. This financial year it had to sell $300 million worth of wool. It has not achieved anything like that, but it had a big carry over from the first year. There is already $118 million put aside for next year's payments schedule. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been requiring a $500-$550 million repayment schedule out to 1997-98. That has now been extended out a further year. We believe that the deferral should have been left open-ended at this stage because, if prices remain down, we will only have to come back into this place and defer again and have this debate again. ABARE is predicting 5lOc a kilogram next selling season. Even though there will be a pretty big offering of wool in the first half of the selling season, there are some indications that that may come off. I hope it does. If it does, I guess the Minister will get away with what he is proposing. I do hope he is right for everybody's sake. It is interesting to look at the situation. presume we are going to vote unanimously on this tonight. I do not believe we are voting on it with full information before us of all the possible options. Consider the situation we have today. We have 3.9 million bales sitting there. It costs somewhere between $50 and $60 a bale each year to store this wool. We are looking at a $200-$240 million cost to growers every year to maintain the stockpile and service the debt. If we were not deferring the $400 million repayment next year, and assuming we had to find the money for all of that, we would have had to sell something like 450,000 bales from the stockpile if it brought about 500c a kilogram. That would have meant that the stockpile would have been reduced from 3.9 million bales to something less than 3.5 million bales. We would have had less overhang on the market. We would have reduced the debt from $2.26 billion down to $1.86 billion, and the saving in interest to growers borrowing the money at 7.3 per cent-which I believe the commission is at this stage-would have been of the order of $30 million a year. That is not just for year, but it goes on to the next year, and the year after that, and so on. I believe we should have had a proper debate on these figures. I think these figures should have been issued by the Minister's office, and the commission's office for that matter, in newspapers such as Country Life in Queensland, the Land in New South Wales, the Stock and Journal in the southern States and so on so that growers know what is going on and they could have some proper input into the debate. The growers have not had proper input into the debate in the last few years since we got into this mess, and we seem to be back on square one as far as that is concerned. The figures I have just given raise this question: does the price rise high' enough to offset the substantial costs of the deferral? There is a cost of $30 million a year in interest and there will be less overhang in the stockpile. Putting it another way, would the selling of an extra 450,000 bales depress the market more than· the costs incurred in not selling the wool? On the evidence available, I the answer to those questions at this stage is that nobody knows. That is part of the problem. It might be good politics to do what we are doing tonight, but I am not totally convinced that it is good policy for the growers. Twelve months ago we started to get into dreadful trouble with selling off the stockpile and servicing the debt because overseas economies became more recessed than they were-particularly in Japan and the European Community which buys much of our wool. China had largely dropped out of the market, and Russia, which was buying something like 100 million kilograms, dropped out totally. The wool pipeline filled up and demand fell off. There was still a tremendous amount of wool coming onto the market as well as the stockpile sitting there. Sales fell away, prices fell away, and last week we saw prices going down to 381c a kilogram on the market indicator. It is back over 400c today, but it is still at record low levels. If we take into account the building assets and the stockpile assets and weigh that up that against the debt, the figure comes out at virtually zero. It has fallen by about $780 million from last year. While all that is happening, we still have at least four million bales or 700 million kilograms walking around on sheep's backs, about to be taken off for the new season. So we are still producing too much wool, even though that figure is falling because of market signals and because of the horrific drought of which I spoke earlier. Stockpile sales at the moment have slowed almost to nothing. Only a few bales are sold each week, and this year we will probably sell less out of the stockpile than we would nonnally sell in a week through the auction system. I do not deny that the Government has put a lot of money into the wool industry since the problem arose of the collapse of the reserve price scheme. Something like $300 million was being paid in supplementary payments; $22.5 million in interest subsidies; $14 million going into research; and $30 million originally, but now down to $20 million, going into wool promotion. I will talk more about that later. There has been a pickup in the public purse, in a sense, of $270 million with the CIS bad debts. We may get that back eventually. I would hope so. When the State money is included, there is something like $65 million, in round figures, as a result of the Minister's recently announced package. By my calculations, there is something like $68 million just from the Government guaranteeing the borrowings. The commission is borrowing at the moment at about 7.3 per cent, and I would think it would be paying about 3 per cent more, conservatively, if the Government guarantee were not there. Three per cent on $2.26 billion comes out at about $68 million in round figures. Offsetting this is the high interest rates the Government inflicted on wool growers over the last half decade or so. For many years the rate was over 20 per cent. It is still very high indeed, particularly in real tenns and when compared with the rates of our overseas trading partners. We had the high artificial taxes that growers were paying. We had the gutting of the income equalisation deposits scheme, and we had the maintenance of the high input tax costs which the shadow Minister spoke about so eloquently earlier. So growers, in a sense, are only getting back part of what they have had to payout unfairly. I believe much more could be done. We should be debating tonight other measures rather than just shifting the repayment schedule by 12 months. We should be perhaps rearranging the schedule more than we have. We could perhaps be talking about deferring the 4.5 per cent tax for one year. That would be a windfall of about $26 or $27 a bale to the growers. But we really do not have the figures to debate that properly. We could be talking more about the need to amalgamate the AWC, the Wool Research and Development Corporation and the AWRC, even though that will obviously be a matter for the industry review that has been set up by the Minister. I would like to see some more commitment from the Government to continue the $20 million wool promotion. That needs to be expanded so that there can be some certainty in the industry in that area at least. We need more unifonnity across the Australian States and more flexible viability criteria for the RAS grants. That is badly needed. Above all else, we need fann household support, I believe, to be given as a grant instead of a loan. I know that is sadly needed in areas of my electorate. I would like to see the assets test abolished and only an income test for Austudy, for the age pension and for any other educational grants for rural families. I would also like to see severe drought reinstated into the national disaster scheme so that assistance could be triggered more easily to those affected. I would like to see a more vigorous debate on the aggressive marketing of the stockpile. that There has been a lot spoken about that in very vague tenns. There are many stockpiles. There is not only the official stockpile, there is the stockpile in the shearing sheds; the stockpile in the wool stores, and wool being pulled off the market; there is the stockpile overseas-the tops pipeline is full; and there is the biggest stockpile of all, the one wandering around on the sheep's back about to come off very soon. I would like to see the Minister's office and the commission's office putting out a bit of information so we can have some proper debate on exchanging wool for bartered goods on credit schemes, and on wool for equity swaps. Quite frankly, I look at wool for equity swaps with somewhat of a jaundiced eye. I have not been convinced, on what I have seen, that it is any advantage to the grower to be owning half a dozen or so woollen mills in Russia when the Russians cannot even pay for the last lot of wool they bought. Probably half of those mills should be bulldozed down. I am not satisfied on how quarantine the wool. Who assesses whether these mills are worth having equity in? All these sorts of questions need to discussed more seriously rather· than just being vaguely talked about, as people seem to be getting no assistance from those .at the top who have the ability to have some input into these matters. I believe there needs to be greater input also into new uses for getting wool as well as new users for wool, in such things as wool blends, batts, et cetera. How we go about this is also a fruitful area for debate. Probably the cheapest way of going about it would be to call tenders on the various types of wool in the stockpile now. Who knows what might come in? If we do not like the tenders, we do not have to ahead with them. That would cost the comguillotine. mission and the growers nothing. We could easily find out. It may well be that the wool price has fallen so low that if we went an extra 50c lower we could offload half a million or million bales of this wool into some sort of new use, but we do not know that. We certainly do not want the market to fall another 50c, but perhaps, if we could offload some of this wool from the stockpile at a lower price, get rid of it into new uses which will not affect the market price, that would benefit growers best of all. While it is sitting there, it is ticking away at $50 or $60 a year, and it goes on for many more years we are going to get deterioration factors in the quality of the wool. These things need to be much more At seriously looked at than they have been date. I hope that when the review is looking at this industry it will also look at innovations for marketing wool and perhaps even in classing wool. I have heard stories in recent months of very innovative measures which suck the wool off the floor as it is shorn, even separating the bellies from the fleece, and putting it straight into containers. It is classed. at all. It goes to Italy where the Italians are producing the best tops out of wool that they have ever produced. I think we need to see a change perhaps the way we handle wool. I have worked in we few sheds around the traps and I have spent a lot of time withbumt-up hands classing wool. This Bill really is a cultural shock. be There are some innovations that should be looked at. I hope the Minister will take some do. We of these things on board. The industry is in dire straits. It needs government assistance, not the least because government has been largely responsible for the industry into the state that it is in. I hope the Minister will acknowledge that.",89
145,Mr HAWKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I join this debate as a wool grower and also as the representative of the premier wool growing area in Australia. I, too, must complain that the Australian Wool Realisation Commisgo sion Amendment Bill is being debated under I think it is absolutely remarkable that, just four days after the Parliament resumed, the Government introduced the guillotine. It is just absolutely incredible, and it makes us wonder what sense of priorities a the Government has. To have to debate an industry as important as the wool industry under the duress of a guillotine is a gross insult to the wool growers of Australia. This debate is taking place at a time when wool has been probably at its lowest price this century. In fact, I think the honourable memthe ber for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) argued quite convincingly that it may have even been the if lowest in 100 years. It has been down below 390c a kilogram. It is slightly above that now, but there is certainly not a lot of confidence. that price, it is still a loss for wool growers. to Wool growers will not be making a living at that price. This is not the first year of loss for many of them. They are facing the prospect of at least three years of losses and, I would suggest, very serious losses. There is also the impact this will have in country towns and so on. I not think that is very serious and something that the Government just has not appreciated the not magnitude of. A lot of it has remained fairly invisible. The Government has seen the tip of this the iceberg. I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has seen in the drought ravaged areas in Queensland. It a is nothing short of a crisis. The stress and duress on the individuals in those areas have to be seen to be believed. But another crisis has been growing slowly beneath the surface. A lack of reinvestment in the industry and a lack of reinvestment, I would suggest, in the whole structure of the community is having an effect at an economic level in that it is restraining future productivimillions ty growth. The communities themselves are being run down. Young people are having to leave communities in order to get work and an education. There will also be an effect on the environment. I get really cranky when I see superficial and rather supercilious headlines in the city press. They try to dramatise the problem by compressing it into a matter of weeks, and then in many cases they turn around and say, 'It is all the fault of the wool growers themselves because they were greedy'. That is really a gross oversimplification. However, because of the short attention span of some people in the city press, they feel they can blow in, get a bit of a story, and then say, 'Well, it. is all the farmers' fault anyway', and wash their hands and walk away. I believe that is insulting and shows a gross lack of understanding of just how serious the problem is and how seriously the Government and the community will have to look at the whole problem. The problem affects many people besides wool growers. I return to why I believe the Government has a far greater responsibility for the current crisis than it is currently prepared to accept. I believe the Government cannot wash its hands of this matter. Looking at the history of the current crisis to see where the Government was involved-admittedly with the benefit of hindsight-we can identify the decision of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), to change the wool legislation back in 1987 as where it all started to go very wrong. It is worth reminding the Government that it approved the 870c a kilogram floor. Admittedly, it was not only the Government that approved the price, but it put its stamp of approval on it. The Government's involvement then became very much more direct. It was entirely the Government's decision to drop the floor price to 700c, and it was only done with an ironclad, immutable guarantee that that was the lowest the floor price would go and that the next time it changed it would move up. It took only seven months for the Government to break that promise. Buyers lost tens of of dollars as a result of that broken promise. One buyer alone claims to have lost $50 million. Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Government is accused of shattering the confidence of buyers in the wool industry, thereby quite dramatically exacerbating some of the problems that subsequently evolved from that loss of confidence experienced by the buying trade? A number of other factors have already been debated tonight, but I would like to remind honourable members of some of them. The income equalisation deposit scheme was gutted by the Government at the very time that it should have been there to help wool growers to put money aside when they could afford to put it aside so that they would not have the chronic problem or crisis that they now face. Subsequently, we saw the high interest rate policy that the Government quite deliberately pursued which exacerbated the problems that many wool growers faced. As the honourable member for Barker highlighted, the Government ignored the opportunity. In the middle of 1991 it had a window of opportunity that comes only once in a while to reduce the size of the flock in order to reduce overproduction. The Government has a far greater responsibility for some of the problems than it is currently prepared to admit. I raise in the form of questions some other issues which have not been addressed tonight. The Government has not really given a definitive answer on the question of the stockpile: who is responsible for it and who owns it? Who actually owns the stockpile? The Government should give a very definitive answer as to who is actually responsible for the debt. It is really time for those answers. In light of a comment made in 1991 by the Auditor-General, I raise the question of equity. This matter has not been focused upon to date but is something the Government ought to think about. The people now growing wool are not necessarily those who were growing wool at the time of the accumulation of the stockpile; nor are they the ones who are now paying the tax. These people are not necessarily able to leave, as many who were growing wool did when prices were better. It is interesting to note the opinion of the Auditor-General. He said: The individual wool grower is not responsible for the $2.7 billion debt nor the 4.7-or-so That 4.7 million goes back to June 1991. To date, that very interesting point raised by the Auditor-General has not been properly responded to. Another point I would like to bring out tonight is the accumulation of the stockpile. I remind honourable members that growers initially put in $1.8 billion and then the old Australian Wool Corporation incurred a further $2.9 billion in debt. As I have said, the growers paying for this today are not the same growers who were involved three or four years ago. I am not suggesting that the Govel'JUllent should forgive the debt-I do not want to be misrepresented there-but I do think there are a lot of loose ends. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, another factor which the Government has so far been very reluctant to admit is that, as the stockpile was being accumulated, the Government was one of the major beneficiaries. The honourable member for Barker suggested that somewhere between $500 million and $750 million in additional personal income tax was collected by the Government as that wool was being put into the stockpile. In other words, the debt was being raised so that the wool growers could then pay off a lot of it in tax. That point ought to be responded to, particularly as the income equalisation deposit system was not in place, as I said, and it was not possible for growers to put money aside for a later time. To cover a few loose ends, there are further questions I want to ask the Government. I refer to the actual tax being paid by wool growers for the reserve price scheme at a time when the stockpile was being accumulated. Between the beginning and end of June 1990 there was a transition period when 2.75 million bales of wool were accumulated at 870c. After June 1990, 1.97 million bales were accumulated at 700c floor. The interesting point is that for the financial year 1989-90 the tax that was paid by wool growers for the reserve price scheme was levied at a rate of 4.15 per cent. From 1 July to 4 October, the tax was raised to 14.5 per cent. For the remainder of the financial year 1990-91, the tax for the reserve price scheme was 21.15 per cent. It is unlikely that any of that tax will million bales. ever be revolved. , That raises some very major questions about equity. In other words, growers were effectively being taxed at two rates during that year. Honourable members can imagine the outcry if a government decided unilaterally to run two levels of personal income tax for two separate groups of people. I think that is something that the Government has never really addressed and never really answered. This is another question that really ought to be dealt with, instead of being left in the too hard basket. There are some very long-term implications in what is happening in rural Australia today. I mentioned the problem of the younger generation having to migrate. Those who are still in the country have problems trying to educate their children, particularly if they have to go away for tertiary education, and many of them have no choice. We still have an Austudy system that heavily discriminates against farming people. How on earth the Government can administer an assets test in the current economic climate is beyond me. I will give the House one simple example. Three weeks ago there was a property offered for sale, about 800 acres, in my electorate in what is generally termed good, high rainfall, wool growing country. The agent got up to sell it. It was in three blocks. He put the first block up. He said, 'Well, I'm not going to try to fool anyone. I'm starting the price at $350 an acre'. That sort of land was probably selling at around $800 an acre four or five years ago. He said 'I will offer it at $350'. There was not a bid. He went to the second block and he said, 'Well, the same thing. I'm not going to muck around. I will start at $300'. There was not a single bid. He went to the third block and he started at $250-and still nota bid. I really do ask the Government how it is going to administer an assets test in that situation, where clearly the farmer was trying to get out, could not even get a bid on the property and probably will still be denied Austudy because of some valuation made at a different time. The second longer term implication which also ought to be very disturbing is the fact that there is insufficient reinvestment into rural areas, particularly in this case in woolgrowing areas, where the productivity of the land is going to start to decline because there has not been sufficient capital investment. Of course, linked to this is the fact that the environment is likely to suffer. I think that honourable members would be aware that the greatest environmental issue facing this country is still land degradation. Obviously farmers have to be at the forefront of combating this land degradation. If they cannot afford to, then who else is going to do it? So there are some very serious wider implications and I would have to say that to date, the Government's response has been pretty woeful. I believe that the amendment moved by the Opposition is a very sensible one. Already we have seen the Government change twice the rules for the operation of the stockpile for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. I guess any shrewd buyer would say, 'Well, if they've changed it twice in a couple of years, when are they going to change it again?'. Obviously, while the Government continues to have this highly visible repayment schedule, every time the buyers can see the prospect of an overhang on the market because the realisation commission has to meet another debt schedule deadline, then clearly the pressure will come on again. I think it makes an awful lot of sense to have a look at operating this scheme in a much more commercial manner; not advertising to the world what the deadlines are going to be for the repayment schedules. If the Government wants a precedent, if it looks at the history of the old Australian Wool Commission back in 1971, it will see that it was a question of commercial confidence that the then commission went into the market without the buyers knowing the rate of depletion of its assets. It managed to turn a market around at a time when, had it been forced to advertise exactly the state of its finances, there is no question it would have failed, and failed dismally. I think that is something that ought to be looked at because, clearly, while the Government continues to advertise to the world the restrictions on the realisation commission, then it will repeatedly run into this sort of problem over the next couple of years. I think this amendment makes a lot of sense. It is one which the Government ought to take on board. In conclusion, there is no doubt that the all wool industry is facing the worse crisis this century. There is obviously a major problem with the stockpile and there is a current oversupply situation, which we hope will change as the rest of the world comes out of its recession. There is also no doubt that the Government has a lot of blood on its hands. It has played a critical role in the current crisis. It locked the door on growers when they should have had the chance to use income equalisation deposits and it has not faced up to the fact that it has played a major role in this current crisis. I believe that the Government's response to date has been totally inadequate. It is going to have to look at doing a lot more; otherwise it will find that the cost in social terms, as well as economic terms and, of course, in environmental terms will be very much greater than it could possibly have dreamt and may well prove to be far greater than had it acted earlier to assist those who are probably facing the biggest crisis of their lives.",93
146,Mr KATTER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"In speaking to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill tonight it is very hard for a person from North Queensland not to make reference to the sugar industry, which has been the backbone of the Queensland economy for over a century. It brings over $1,000 million into the economy of Queensland and creates tens of thousands of jobs in the State of Queensland. Of course, a quarter of that industry is in the Kennedy electorate. Most importantly, when the beef industry collapsed I went to Sir Joseph MCAvoy, the legendary and very courageous leader of the sugar industry and one of the leading figures in agriculture in Australia for many years. He is a man with 40 years of wisdom behind him in the sugar industry-and his father behind him, and his grandfather behind him. His son was the vice-president of the Queensland Canegrowers Council last year. Sir Joseph said that, in spite of the fact the situation looked totally hopeless time, every single cent that was borrowed prop up the sugar industry in its worse crisis was paid back, as well as every single cent interest. He said that the same applied to wool industry. He said, 'Every single cent that was borrowed when it was in· its crisis in 1968, 1969 and 1970 was paid back; not only the principal, but also the interest'. If able members think that the situation in wool growing industry looks hopeless, lot of honourable members have said tonight that wool is at its lowest real price ever, cannot really say that I get the feeling the coalface that things are as bad as in 69. Maybe the drought was more violent those years and the coupling event was disastrously worse than it is now. Out of a whole generation of people, could not think of one single family out of or 80 families involved in sheep production that survived in the Julia Creek-MCKinlay shire. Some did survive, but I could not name a single one. The situation then in Australia - was that wages were exploding through the roof-but that is not the case today; in fact real wages are going down-and were coming on at 100 miles per hour. We had never seen synthetics before, and they were blasting wool off the face of the earth the time. We had also had 14 years of a drought covering a fair proportion of Queensof land. So for me there was no future in woolwhich it was a crazy business to be in. I remember negotiating the sale of 20,000 head of sheep. At that time. I had a contract for pet meat and some fellow who I considered very foolish bought these 20,000 female sheep for $1 a head. His son got for at least a week because anyone who was buying sheep had to be very soft in the head. Three years later those sheep had lambs, so 31/2 years later he had 40,000 sheep and they went for $17 a head. I realised that people who had seen the prices come and go could make great fortunes by simply realising not only that what goes up must come down but also that what goes down will, when supply and demand is operating, come up. It does not stand up for us to run away that terrified with our tails between our legs, at the grovelling and giving the wool away to to whoever is prepared to take it off us at the present moment. It does not stand up in the of light of history not only in the wool industry the but also in the beef industry. Every single time the giant industries of wool, wheat, sugar and beef are at the bottom of the price trough, we can look back and refer to their history. I honourcarry that history with me because those the industries really are at the heart of underand a standing agriculture in Australia. When sugar was at its absolute base price I of $58 a tonne, within six years the price had from doubled and within 61/2 years the price had 1968risen by 500 per cent. So if people can hang in on and have faith, the industries come through. I also refer to meat. In 1975 the average price of a bullock was $97, and I within four years it was $300. If we had 70 wiped those industries out it would have been a catastrophically bad decision for Australia and for those industries. The people who had the faith to hold on most certainly did well at the end of the day. Let me refer to wool. In 1971 the price went down to 61c a kilogram. Again, within three years the price had risen synthetics to over 180c a kilogram. So in each of those three industries which were in the same situation that wool is in at today, the price rebounded at a great rate over few short years. If we were to take the sort stupid action that is being proceeded with, is really a liquidation of a fair proportion of the entire industry because that is the implication of the Government's policies, we would see vast and terrible tragedy befall us. I make no apologies for being on the committee in Queensland that sacked the head drunk of the QIDC, which was like a State bank. We sacked him because he said that one-third of the sugar industry had to go. He explained to us, because we knew nothing about it and he was a super expert on the sugar industry, that beet sugar coming in from Europe would destroy the Australian industry. He said that this was a whole new phenomenon and that we were in a different ball game from any we had ever been in before. He said that there was no future in the sugar industry and we had to realise that one-third of it had to be written off. So we sacked him. If we had listened to him and written off one-third of the sugar industry in Queensland, the next year when the price doubled-and it has gone to historic heights in the past decade-there would have been one-third less production in the sugar industry. So it is with some degree of conceit-we were a very clever government-that I say we rescued one-third of the industry. But that is not what is taking place in the wool industry. Under the Government's policy with every successive year each wool grower . in Central and North Queensland, including the mid-western areas of North Queensland, will, on average, go into debt by a further $70,000. Simply offering them more debt is absolutely no solution to their problems. The industry leader in Queensland, Mr Noel Kennedy, has said that we must move to single desk seller arrangements. I was on the beef industry committee which went all over Australia to try to come up with some sort of beef marketing scheme, and I can remember the phrases. Everyone told us it was impossible and it could not be done. My electorate includes the dairying industry. The bankers have told me that all of the people have positive bank accounts and that no-one in dairying in the tablelands area is in trouble. This year the tobacco industry will take a 40 per cent drop in income thanks to the actions. of the Federal Government and the Queensland State Government. Until this stupid action was taken by those governments the banks said that every tobacco grower was really doing well. These people have controlled marketing; they have statutory marketing authorities. When I was in the Queensland Parliament I was constantly reminded that it was the ALP that introduced statutory marketing, and the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, used to tell us that all the time. The ALP may have instituted those things but it was most certainly the National Party that brought them to fruition, and it is the ALP that is demolishing all of those giant arms of the industry which enable us to aggressively market. Each industry has thousands of growers. When I did economics the lecturers at university told me it was an oligopolous situation. If we have half a dozen buyers controlling the marketplace, that is called an oligopolous situation-and supply and demand certainly does not determine the price. I do not know a great deal about the wool industry but I am told that ITO controls 30 per cent of the marketplace. The Parliamentary Library provided me with figures showing that Australia and New Zealand produce over 80 per cent of the world's traded wool. So if ITO does not buy from us, I would really have some difficulty in saying where the hell it will get its wool from. My own family was in retailing, and we sold clothing. If we had suddenly started trying to sell icecreams we would have found that not a lot of customers would have come to our shop. If people are in the business of selling a particular commodity they stick at selling that commodity-that is what they are good at and that is their business. These people are in wool because that is their commodity, that is their business. They will not suddenly change next year because we make the price here less than half the price it was some four or five years ago-and that is what we are doing now. So I have to stand very solidly behind Mr Kennedy and say that his remarks are prescient. Every industry that has gone down that road has shown terrific resilience despite the manipulation of world markets by a few brokers that dominate the world scene in almost every single commodity. There is only way that we can answer that processor waste line where it tucks in at the processor level. For example, we have 10,000 beef producers and effectively six or seven meat processors in Queensland, so there is certainly no free supply and demand system that determines price. We saw an example of that very recently in that industry, and I venture to say that that is the situation with almost every rural commodity. The only way to deal with it is to fight fire with fire. So if they have four buyers, we will have one buyer. That is about the only way we can come to grips with the situation. If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) thinks that I am describing everything very bleakly, I would ask him to please talk to someone who lived through the problems of the wool industry in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and likewise in the sugar and beef industries. The historical records clearly indicate that the price and the demand will come back. The tragedy is that, when wool came back, unfortunately half of the growers and the families who lived in those areas were no longer there. They were replaced with people who produced cattle, which were only worth half the value of wool to the Australian economy. We saw the population of all of our towns drop clean in half and, of course, after this crash, there will be virtually no towns left at all. When sheep are replaced with cattle, all of the shearers are taken out of the areas. Wool is very labour intensive, which cattle most certainly are not, and we see the deplOlition of these towns because all of the people are moving to the cities where infrastructure has to be purchased for them. I say to the Minister with great vehemence-with no reflection upon him, because he most certainly was not in the saddle-that his illustrious leader, the Prime Minister, Keating), must take the blame for what has occurred in the wool industry. I can clearly remember the statements he made. I was driving my motor car and I heard the Prime Minister on the radio. He said, 'The price of wool is too high. We are going to have to address this problem'. That was a clear-cut, flashing neon light to every buyer of wool in the world that the price was going to be reduced. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you own a service station and you put up a huge sign out the front saying, 'Petrol will be 20 per cent cheaper next week', do you really think that people are going to buy petrol off you this week? Let us be honest-they will make do and fill their tanks up next week when petrol will be 20 per cent cheaper. But when competing against somebody else, it is all the more important to buy wool at the cheapest possible price. If those buyers had bought wool then and the price had been undercut the next week by the Government, their bosses would have said to them, 'The Prime Minister said the price of wool was going to go down and you completely ignored that statement, went in and bought wool at this high price. You're going to be sacked.' So the Prime Minister said-as clearly as anyone could have stated it-that the price of wool was going to go down. I cannot let the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) off the hook-everyone speaks nicely about him-because he most certainly made similar noises. I thought that he would disown the statement and put confidence back into the market, but he did just the opposite. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has said in this place, 'He was dead right'. Not only did the Government destroy the market then, but it pulled exactly the same stunt nine months further down the track. What confidence was left was completely removed from the industry. Most importantly, the Government put up a sign at the service station which said that the price of petrol was going to be 20 per cent cheaper next week. We did it during the election campaign. We told the voters that we were going to give (Mr them petrol at coalition prices. The consumption of petrol dropped very significantly in Mount Isa for two or three days before the election and exploded when we gave them petrol at the cheaper price. I have seen it in action. I plead with the Minister to realise that in every single case where the Minister has stood his ground, had confidence in and stood behind his Australian industry, this country has been richly rewarded. Human misery, suffering and pain are sweeping throughout the nation. Through his blundering stupidity the leader of this country, the Prime Minister, made a statement that affected the price of wool. When he made that statement, we were earning almost $6,000 million a year from wool. Within 18 months of his making that statement, we were earning below $4,000 million and 2112 years later we were earning under $3,500 million. The Prime Minister's stupidity has cost this country $2,500 million a year and it could go on for a number of years yet. I would plead with the Minister not to listen to his advisers down here and to look at the statutory market, which is what every successful government and Minister in Australian history has done. Without a statutory market we will go through the terrible traumas that we are going through in the wool industry now, .and with it we will have the same success stories of the sugar, tobacco and dairying industries of north Queensland, all of which operate under that system. I plead with the Minister to seriously look at these problems. If he does so, he could carve a very important place for himself in Australian history.",96
147,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I must declare my interest in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill: firstly, as a wool grower and, secondly, as the member for Maranoa representing probably 50 per cent of Queensland's woolclip. These growers are suffering severe c4""ought, as are many in the electorate of Kennedy. They are suffering the double whammy of a collapse of the commodity price and the severe drought which is exacerbating the problem. This is creating an enormous human tragedy such as we have not seen before. I certainly have not seen such a tragedy in my lifetime and I do not believe the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has either. At this point, I must thank the Minister for coming to Queensland recently and looking at the drought first hand. I guess it was the pleading of one of my constituents, Margaret Greer, at the rally in Charleville struck a cord with the Minister and got him to Queensland to look at the severity of the situation. I am appalled to find that this legislation, affecting the great wool industry and its value to the Australian economy, is allowed only two hours for debate at a time when the industry is confronted with its darkest hour in over 30-odd years. I was newly married back in the 1969-71 wool slump so I remember quite well the situation that confronted the wool industry at its darkest hour then. I know that the wool industry will come again in this nation. What it needs now is a sympathetic ear; an ear that understands the industry. It needs some assistance to get through the situation it is confronted with today. If I could draw a simple analogy: the effect of removing the reserve price for wool was like removing tariffs overnight from the textile, clothing and footwear industry or the motor car industry of this nation. If that were done to those industries, the Minister and I both know that the industries would be decimated because they could not survive without some form of protection as the tariffs are quite correctly phased down. That is what the Government has done to the wool industry and it needs some assistance right now. We all acknowledge that the industry needs some assistance right now and that it needs some adjustment in both the marketing and the selling approaches. It certainly needs industrial relations reform. The shearing industry is so regulated that the sheep that the Minister saw on Friday afternoon on Margaret and Tom Greer's property, even though they were dying, could not be shorn. So firm and fixed are the regulations in the industrial relations scene in the shearing industry in Queensland that the shearers would be forced to go home; otherwise they would be penalised, as would be Tom and Margaret Greer. We need changes not only in the selling and marketing of wool and the approach that we take from the growers' angle, but also in the industrial relations scene. I believe the shearing industry would welcome reforms in that area as would the wool industry and the which finally growers themselves. I know there is limited time left tonight for debate on this Bill, but we must certainly pause while discussing this Bill tonight to acknowledge the great contribution that the wool industry has made to this nation and, specifically, the great contribution that the merino has made to this nation. In the last 10 years, this humble animal has contributed almost $30 billion in export wealth to this nation. It will contribute in the future because Henzell, M. so much of the landmass of this country can only sustain sheep at a profitable level and can only sustain those regional economies that are so dependent on the wool industries. I am talking about the shearers, the shed hands, the railway workers, the truck drivers and the storekeepers. Unless we get behind this industry in its darkest hour, we will eliminate whole communities, because the land where these sheep are being run can only be sustained by a wool industry.. The interesting thing about the wool industry is that we often lose sight of wh-re this commodity ends up. It is one pf the industries where we do better than any other nation in this world. The wool from the Australian merino and from places like Jundah end up on the high fashion streets of the world. I think we have got to get behind it in its hour of greatest need. It is on the Government's head and there is not enough being done.",100

151,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"In my speech last week I said that one of the challenges we face as parliamentarians is to instil greater confidence in the political process in an effort to improve the poor standing in which we are often held. I made the point that recently in Western Australia the view of politicians and their integrity had been severely dented by the newly elected State Government, the Court Government. That occurred with the announcement of the closure of the Midland Westrail railway workshops in my electorate, throwing 750 people out of work. I wish to elaborate on the closure of the workshops this evening. At the recent February State election the Court Government was elected with an express commitment of further investment in the Midland workshops and a commitment to reequip. I quote from the Liberal Party policy at that State election: To re-equip Midland Workshops, which employs 850; To guarantee the long-term future of the workshops; To ""co-locate"" an institute of heavy engineering at the workshops; To invite the private sector to ""co-locate"" at workshops site to make them into a world-class facility. That platform was presented to the people by the then coalition shadow transport spokesman, Mr Eric Charlton. Three weeks ago the same Mr Charlton, as Minister for Transport, announced the closure of the workshops. Since then he has refused to attend and speak to a meeting of sacked workers in Midland at the Midland town hall last Thursday. That decision was a bad decision for Midland, a bad decision for Western Australia and a bad decision for Australia. It was also a dishonest decision, a dishonest betrayal. During both the recent State and federal election campaigns, coalition candidates, some of whom campaigned personally at the workshops, never once had the decency or the honesty to indicate to workshop employees that a Court Government would contemplate the closure of the workshops. To close the workshops will be a grave mistake both for Midland and for Western Australia. At precisely the time when the shire of Swan and other local groups are working hard to enhance Midland as a regional centre, the closure of the workshops will be a damaging blow to Midland's regional and economic status. At the same time as announcing the closure of the workshops, the Court Government announced its decision that Western Australia would not take an equity position in the National Rail Corporation. I have been endeavouring, through efforts with the Minister for Transport (Senator Collins), to ensure that the Midland railway workshops receive a fair share of National Rail Corporation work. The Court Government has put paid to that and, at the same time, it has effectively put paid to the benefits to come from Western Australia playing a full and effective part in the National Rail Corporation. I quote from debate in the Western Australian State Parliament on 2 December 1992: ... It is important to acknowledge that Western Australia is ideally placed to enjoy great benefits from the National Rail Corporation. If we can produce a transport organisation that will encourage the use of Fremantle as a container terminal, we the could build traffic on that interstate line much faster than if we were to leave it as it is, where freight forwarders must negotiate with two or three different companies to get their product from Fremantle to Sydney. Western Australia has an opportunity to find this niche and enjoy the benefits of an improved interstate transport system. I agree with that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was said by the current Deputy Premier of Western Australia in the coalition Government, Mr Cowan. That is another betrayal. There are some interesting quotes in this area. On Thursday of last week, a thousand workers attended the Midland town hall, the meeting which the Minister for Transport refused to attend. On the following day, the West Australian carried a report on the State Minister for Labour Relations, Mr KierathMr Evans-Owned by WA Inc?",102
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Cowan will cease interjecting.,103
153,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"The West Australian of Friday, 7 May, commenting on the closure of the workshops, said: Mr Kierath said the Government had been humane and compassionate to announce its plans so early. ""Having done that we don't want that generosity tested ... That is a very humane approach. In the Midland Reporter of 11 May 1993, the comments of a person who took the benefit the coalition's commitment at the State election, the current Liberal member for Swan Hills in the State Parliament, Mrs June van Klashorst, were reported as follows: . .. Admitting the government had broken its promise not to close the workshops Mrs van Klashorst said she had not known of Cabinet's decision until union officials turned up on doorstep the day it was announced. She had not read the Westrail report upon Cabinet had based its decision but promised to help workers ""pick up the pieces"". I hope that she helps workers pick up the pieces with the same sensitivity that the Minister for Transport has done. (Time pired) Midland Railway Workshops",103
154,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It is amazing that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) prior to coming here and prior to being adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was secretary of the Labor Party in Western Australia and adviser to the then Premier, Peter Dowding, threw away $400 million in the PICL issue on just one try. That $400 million could have gone towards keeping those people in the Midland railway workshops in jobs. If the honourable member had spent a little bit more time in the electorate he now represents and talked to the Commissioner of Railways, Mr Gill, whom his Labor friends appointed some years ago, he would have found that Mr Gill has been recommending the closure of those workshops for years and years, and under a Labor Government. Do those opposite know what his reason was? It was the only way he could save Westrail, because Westrail was being gobbled up by road transport. Mr Gill, by that action, could at least save the general rail system and the jobs of people in other places. The honourable member might also have bothered to tell of the work that is going to be transferred out of Midland to regional centres-the work that will be created in Merredin, Geraldton and places like that, because the rail workers are going to do the work at a price. But of all the people to speak in this place, the honourable member stands branded with of a thousand million of wasted money in Western Australia. He was up to his neck in it. In fact, it all went to crooks. We can talk de about his Victorian mates, but they were simply stupid. When they got into the situation that the honourable member is defending, de they sold the trams. When that money ran out, they sold the buses. When that money ran her out, they sold the railway rolling stock. Yet he says that is better than the judgment that which has been made by the Government in Western Australia to save all. the other jobs in Westrail. There are more Westrail railway lines and workers in my electorate than in the one the honourable member represents. Their exjobs are now much more secure according to the Commissioner of Railways. It is okay for politicians to have a view as to what they might do with the Midland workshops. It is only when they became Ministers-as members of this Government would well know-and they consulted the expert, the Labor Party appointed Commissioner of Railways and said to him, 'What is needed to who just save this rail network?'Ms Crawford interjecting",103
155,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Those opposite would sell the trams and everything else. Then they would keep the jobs and it would all collapse. That is how smart they are and that is what the honourable member for Perth is trying to do. I remind the House that he was very silent about that accusation. One thousand million dollars went to the entrepreneurs of Western Australia-the crooks. They all got it in their insurance policies because they donated to the Labor Party. That was the premium: $800 million for Holmes a Court, $400 million or $500 million to Laurie Connell and we can go on. The honourable member knows about that. There is no need to talk about it. He talked about Western Australia's involvement in the National Rail Freight Corporation. It would get some nice dividends out of that. The Government is yet to resolve properly the union problems of Victoria and New South Wales in this regard. Western Australia is the only segment of that rail network which returns a profit. Why would the Government sell it out? The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is going to buy into this in a minute. His electorate adjoins Merredin. He wants to go back and tell the workers in Merredin that he thinks it is a good idea that they be involved in the national rail network. The railway workers of Western Australia did not want that connection; they did not want to be sold out in this way. But things will be done about Midland. Jobs will be created in Midland. In fact, I had an approach from a businessman just the other day who would like to go into part of the Midland workshops and take on 180 of the blokes there. The difference is he will return a profit and those men will have real jobs. They will not be bringing down the rest of the network and letting road transport take over entirely from the rail network in Western Australia. That was what was happening because of the $20 million, $40 million, you name it, that was being lost at the Midland workshops. The railways of Western Australia could not carry it and the honourable member's policy of saying that that workshop should have been kept would have done one thing: it would have wiped out everyone's job, just as the Labor Party's policies in Victoria have done. (Time expired) Midland Railway Workshops",104
156,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," I was in my office when I heard this tirade and I felt I must intervene. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is a fine one to talk. In his tenn on the Carnarvon Shire Council, the honourable member knows, as does no-one else, that were it not for the statute of limitations he would probably be debarred from this Parliament. The honourable member's behaviour on the Carnarvon Shire Council, with a history of rort after rortMr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is a substantive motion required for a member to make the allegations which the honourable member has just made. They are not true and I will bet him $1,000 that he cannot produce any of that evidence in this place. Mr Campb-ll interjecting Mr Thckey-You do not even have to take it outside, you drongo.",104
157,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will be careful in what he says. If he wishes to make allegations under substantive motion he knows the procedure of the House.,104
158,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I will give a little history. The Western Australian railway is, by Australian standards, efficient. It makes a profit and it does so precisely because of the management of a Labor government. It was a Labor government which led to the shedding of 2,600 jobs in Westrail which set it apart from the rest of Australia. The honourable member for O'Connor is, as usual, wrong. Australian National, in its freight capacity, has also consistently turned in a profit. The situation with the Midland railway is ideology out of control. Rather than negotiate to make the Midland railway even more efficient and rather than allowing Midland railway to go out and compete with the private sector, the Liberal Party took the ideological course and closed it down. This is the history of the Liberal Party; the party which was in power for all those years which saw Westrail making loss after loss. It is a tribute to the unions that this railway actually makes a profit. I now tum to WA Inc. Here the honourable member shows his total ignorance or in fact his fabrication. The accumulated deficit in Western Australia is the result of Charlie Court's Dampier pipeline. The losses from WA Inc. amount to something like $450 million. Senator Crichton-Browne, one of the very few Liberals in Western Australia who knows anything about the economy and money, is on record as having said, 'You will never hear a peep out of me about the so called WA Inc. because in my view the Government would be the last to know and, under the circumstances, any government would do the same. If it happens again they will do it all over again'. So what happens? The Albany cannery is short of dough and in goes half a million dollars from the State Liberal Party. If the honourable member understands and were honest about the history of this, he would understand that. But of course he is not interested in being honest or objective; all he wants to do is continue his diatribe of scurrilous lies and innuendoes. This is the man who once bet",104
159,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will withdraw that remark.,105
160,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,Which particular one?,105
161,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I think you understand which one.,105
162,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am happy to withdraw the word 'lies', but I will leave the others because they ,He not unparliamentary. I am sure the implication is still there. This is the man who once made a bet with a group of cockies in Geraldton in his electorate. He said, 'Campbell will vote for the decontrolling of domestic wheat sales'. He pulled out his cheque book, slapped it on the table and said, 'I've got a thousand bucks here; I'll bet you all a thousand bucks'. He was met by three cockies who pulled out their cheque books. I can tell honourable members that I did not vote for that legislation at all. But of course the honourable member for O'Connor never paid his bets. Mr Thckey-You went to England instead.",105
163,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I did not, I was in the Parliament and I abstained from voting, as I abstained from voting on the ATSIC legislation-contrary to the honourable member's fraud. The fact is that in Western Australia the Government was faced with this problem: over a long weekend it was faced with a bank that was a guaranteed investment saying, 'If you don't bail us out we are not going to open on Monday'. If the Government did nothing it was up for $100 million. Mr Costello-What did the royal commission say?",105
164,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"The royal commission was one of the most fraudulent commissions ever seen. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The allegation that the royal commission was fraudulent ought to be withdrawn and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie knows that.",105
165,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is in order.,105
166,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,One of the reasons I love the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is that he has not one shred of ideology in his body. What he wants to vote for is what he thinks will get him the reins of power. I take my hat off to him; he is one of the few people in the Liberal Party who have even a glimmer of that. He should not come in here and try to protect a royal commission such as the WA royal commission. Next he will be defending the Royal Commission into. Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Mr Costello-I wouldn't go that far.,105
167,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,I am grateful that the honourable member has some sense of honour. (1lme expired) Australian Labor Party,105
168,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Quite frankly, I am particularly pleased that the proceedings of the Parliament are not being broadcast at this time of night because the people of Australia would have been subjected to the diatribe of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). The absolute nonsense uttered by this honourable member over the last five minutes is quite beyond belief. How anyone could stand up in this Parliament and defend the economic decisions of the late, unlamented Western Australian Labor Government is amazing; as is the fact that he had the hide and the audacity to justify in some way the fact that so much money belonging to the Western Australian taxpayers disappeared. There has been a royal commission to decide how it disappeared-where it went to, whether it was inadvertent, or whether it was deliberate. But the fact is that Western Australia is simply one example of the way in which the Labor Party has mismanaged the economies of this nation. One has only to move east to the State of South Australia. One can see the mess that the Labor Government made of the situation with the bank and we find that the State of South Australia is also bankrupt. If we go across to Victoria, we find that new Victorian Government has considered it necessary to bring in some stringent economic measures. But Ministers and members of this Government get up in this Parliament to try to stop the Victorian Government bringing in the stringent measures that are necessary because of 10 years of economic waste, mismanagement and very irresponsible government in Victoria. When Victorian Labor Treasurers brought down their budgets they seemed to think they had a blank cheque. They seemed to forget that the Victorian people had in fact put them there. There was no honesty, accountability or respect for the finances of the people of Victoria. The simple fact of the matter is that Victorian taxpayers are paying now for those 10 years of Labor, and they will be paying for them for 20 or 30 years. The reason there has had to be redundancies in Victoria, that there have been retrenchments, that schools have closed and that the people of Victoria are going to have to accept a reduced standard of living is that the Government of Victoria was so irresponsible in its management prior to the election that put the Kennett Government into office. They were put into office by the people of Victoria because a job had to be done. The people of Victoria had had a gutful of the way in which the Labor Party in that State had treated them with absolute contempt. When one looks at the decaying, rust-bucket States of southern Australia, we find that the Prime Minister is talking about bailing them out in an attempt to repair the damage done by many years of Labor government. There is one common thread running through Australia. We are a federation, we have six States, we have a federal government and we have had Labor governments in various parts of the Commonwealth. No matter where we live, we simply cannot trust the Labor Party with our money. I rarely quote Malcolm Fraser-I have some views on the lost opportunities under the Fraser Government-but during the 1983 election campaign Malcolm Fraser said, 'You should put your money under the bed', or something similar. the He knew that, once the Labor Party was let loose in the treasuries, the finances would disappear. One only has to look at what is happening in Queensland to see that it is going down the same path as the three bankrupt StatesWestern Australia, South Australia and Victoria-where economic measures have had to be taken to offset the result of many years of Labor government. The Queensland Labor Government inherited the results of many years of sound economic management by conservative and coalition governments. That is the only reason the Queensland Government is not yet in the same position as those three States. But Premier Goss is heading down the same old Labor road-spend, 'spend, spend, spend. It is a tragedy and it is a disgrace. Labor governments will never understand: we cannot trust them with our money. (TIme expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.

169,Mr HAWKER,PAPERS,"I join this debate as a wool grower and also as the representative of the premier wool growing area in Australia. I, too, must complain that the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill is being debated under guillotine. I think it is absolutely remarkable that, just four days after the Parliament resumed, the Government introduced the guillotine. It is just absolutely incredible, and it makes us wonder what sense of priorities the Government has. To have to debate an industry as important as the wool industry under the duress of a guillotine is a gross insult to the wool growers of Australia. This debate is taking place at a time when wool has been probably at its lowest price this century. In fact, I think the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) argued quite convincingly that it may have even been the lowest in 100 years. It has been down below 390c a kilogram. It is slightly abOve that now, but there is certainly not a lot of confidence. At that price, it is still a loss for wool growers. Wool growers will not be making a living at that price. This is not the first year of loss for many of them. They are facing the prospect of at least three years of losses and, I would suggest, very serious losses. There is also the impact this will have in country towns and so on. I think that is very serious and something that the Government just has not appreciated the magnitude of. A lot of it has remained fairly invisible. The Government has seen the tip of the iceberg. I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has seen the drought ravaged areas in Queensland. It is nothing short of a crisis. The stress and duress on the individuals in those areas have to be seen to be believed. But another crisis has been growing slowly beneath the surface. A lack of reinvestment in the industry and a lack of reinvestment, I 11 May 1993, a major error occurred at page in the first column, last paragraph commencing and consequently, it will appear in the would suggest, in the whole structure of the community is having an effect at an economic level in that it is restraining future productivity growth. The communities themselves are being run down. Young people are having to leave communities in order to get work and an education. There will also be an effect on the environment. I get really cranky when I see superficial and rather supercilious headlines in the city press. They try to dramatise the problem by compressing it into a matter of weeks, and then in many cases they turn around and say, 'It is all the fault of the wool growers themselves because they were greedy'. That is really a gross oversimplification. However, because of the short attention span of some people in the city press, they feel they can blow in, get a bit of a story, and then say, 'Well, it is all the farmers' fault anyway', and wash their hands and walk away. I believe that is insulting and shows a gross lack of understanding of just how serious the problem is and how seriously the Government and the community will have to look at the whole problem. The problem affects many people besides wool growers. I return to why I believe the Government has a far greater responsibility for the current crisis than it is currently prepared to accept. I believe the Government cannot wash its hands of this matter. Looking at the history of the current crisis to see where the Government was involved-admittedly with the benefit of hindsight-we can identify the decision of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), to change the wool legislation back in 1987 as where it all started to go very wrong. It is worth reminding the Government that it approved the 870c a kilogram floor. Admittedly, it was not only the Government that approved the price, but it put its stamp of approval on it. came very much more direct. It was entirely the Govenul:ent's decision to drop the floor price to 700c, and it was only done with an ironclad, immutable guarantee that that was the lowest the floor price would go and that the next time it changed it would move up. It took only seven months for the Government to break that promise. Buyers lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of that broken promise. One buyer alone claims to have lost $50 million. Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Government is accused of shattering the confidence of buyers in the wool industry, thereby quite dramatically exacerbating some of the problems that subsequently evolved from that loss of confidence experienced by the buying trade? A number of other factors have already been debated tonight, but I would like to remind honourable members of some of them. The income equalisation deposit scheme was gutted by the Government at the very time that it should have been there to help wool growers to put money aside when they could afford to put it aside so that they would not have the chronic problem or crisis that they now face. Subsequently, we saw the high interest rate policy that the Government quite deliberately pursued which exacerbated the problems that many wool growers faced. As the honourable member for Barker highlighted, the Government ignored the opportunity. In the middle of 1991 it had a window of opportunity that comes only once in a while to reduce the size of the flock in order to reduce overproduction. The Government has a far greater responsibility for some of the problems than it is currently prepared to admit. I raise in the form of questions some other issues which have not been addressed tonight. The Government has not really given a definitive answer on the question of the stockpile: who is responsible for it and who owns it? Who actually owns the stockpile? The Government should give a very definitive answer as to who is actually responsible for the debt. It is really time for those answers. In light of a comment made in 1991 by the Auditor-General, I raise the question of equity. This matter has not been focused upon to date but is something the Government ing wool are not necessarily those who were growing wool at the time of the accumulation of the stockpile; nor are they the ones who are now paying the tax. These people are not necessarily able to leave, as many who were growing wool did when prices were better. It is interesting to not,e the opinion of the Auditor-General. He said: The individual wool grower is not responsible for the $2.7 billion debt nor the 4.7-or-so million bales. That 4.7 million goes back to June 1991. To date, that very interesting point raised by the Auditor-General has not been properly responded to. Another point I would like to bring out tonight is the accumulation of the stockpile. I remind honourable members that growers initially put in $1.8 billion and then the old Australian Wool Corporation incurred a further $2.9 billion in debt. As I have said, the growers paying for this today are not the same growers who were involved three or four years ago. I am not suggesting that the Government should forgive the debt-I do not want to be misrepresented there-but I do think there are a lot of loose ends. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, another factor which the Government has so far been very reluctant to admit is that, as the stockpile was being accumulated, the Government was one of the major beneficiaries. The honourable member for Barker suggested that somewhere between $500 million and $750 million in additional personal income tax was collected by the Government as that wool was being put into the stockpile. In other words, the debt was being raised so that the wool growers could then pay off a lot of it in tax. That point ought to be responded to, particularly as the income equalisation deposit system was not in place, as I said, and it was not possible for growers to put money aside for a later time. To cover a few loose ends, there are further questions I want to, ask the Government. I refer to the actual tax being paid by wool growers for the reserve price scheme at a time when the stockpile was being accumulated. Until June 1990, when the floor price was 870c-that is, effectively until June; between the beginning and the end of June there was a transition period-there were 2.75 million bales of wool accumulated. After June 1990, floor. The interesting point is that for the financial year 1989-90 the tax that was paid by wool growers for the reserve price scheme was levied at a rate of 4.15 per cent. From 1 July to 4 October, the tax was raised to 14.5 per cent. For the remainder of the financial year 1990-91, the tax for the reserve price scheme was 21.15 per cent. It is unlikely that any of that tax will ever be revolved. That raises some very major questions about equity. In other words, growers were effectively being taxed at two rates during that year. Honourable members can imagine the outcry if a government decided unilaterally to run two levels of personal income tax for two separate groups of people. I think that is something that the Government has never really addressed and never really answered. This is another question that really ought to be dealt with, instead of being left in the too hard basket. There are some very long-term implications in what is happening in rural Australia today. I mentioned the problem of the younger generation having to migrate. Those who are still in the country have problems trying to educate their children, particularly if they have to go away for tertiary education, and many of them have no choice. We still have an Austudy system that heavily discriminates against farming people. How on earth the Government can administer an assets test in the current economic climate is beyond me. I will give the House one simple example. Three weeks ago there was a property offered for sale, about 800 acres, in my electorate in what is generally termed good, high rainfall, wool growing country. The agent got up to sell it. It was in three blocks. He put the first block up. He said, 'Well, I'm not going to try to fool anyone. I'm starting the price at $350 an acre'. That sort of land was probably selling at around $800 an acre four or five years ago. He said 'I will offer it at $350'. There was not a bid. He went to the second block and he said, 'Well, the same thing. I'm not going to muck around. I will start at $300'. There was not a single bid. He went to the third block and he started at $250-and still not a bid. I really do ask the Government how it is going to administer an assets test in that situation, out, could not even get a bid on the property and probably will still be denied Austudy because of some valuation made at a different time. The second longer term implication which also ought to be very disturbing is the fact that there is insufficient reinvestment into rural areas, particularly in this case in woolgrowing areas, where the productivity of the land is going to start to decline because there has not been sufficient capital investment. Of course, linked to this is the fact that the environment is likely to suffer. I think that all honourable members would be aware that the greatest environmental issue facing this country is still land degradation. Obviously farmers have to be at the forefront of combating this land degradation. If they cannot afford to, then who else is going to do it? So there are some very serious wider implications and I would have to say that to date, the Government's response has been pretty woeful. I believe that the amendment moved by the Opposition is a very sensible one. Already we have seen the Government change twice the rules for the operation of the stockpile for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. I guess any shrewd buyer would say, 'Well, if they've changed it twice in a couple of years, when are they going to change it again?'. Obviously, while the Government continues to have this highly visible repayment schedule, every time the buyers can see the prospect of an overhang on the market because the realisation commission has to meet another debt schedule deadline, then clearly the pressure will come on again. I think it makes an awful lot of sense to have a look at operating this scheme in a much more commercial manner; not advertising to the world what the deadlines are going to be for the repayment schedules. If the Government wants a precedent, if it looks at the history of the old Australian Wool Commission back in 1971, it will see that it was a question of commercial confidence that the then commission went into the market without the buyers knowing the rate of depletion of its assets. It managed to turn a market around at a time when, had it been fotced to advertise exactly the state of its finances, there is no dismally. I think that is something that ought to be looked at because, clearly, while the Government continues to advertise to the world the restrictions on the realisation commission, then it will repeatedly run into this sort of problem over the next couple of years. I think this amendment makes a lot of sense. It is one which the Government ought to take on board. In conclusion, there is no doubt that the wool industry is facing the worse crisis this century. There is obviously a major problem with the stockpile and there is a current supply situation, which we hope will change as the rest of the world comes out of its recession. There is also no doubt that the It has played a critical role in the current crisis. It locked the door on growers when they should have had the chance to use income equalisation deposits and it has not faced up to the fact that it has played a major role in this current crisis. I believe that the Government's response to date has been totally inadequate. It is going to have to look at doing a lot more; otherwise it will find that the cost in social terms, as well as economic terms and, of course, in environmental terms will be very much greater than it could overpossibly have dreamt and may well prove to be far greater than had it acted earlier to assist those who are probably facing the biggest crisis of their lives.",108
