7,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"The honourable member's ^answer was very unsatisfactory, because he gave no information.",14

13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"I was in consultation with the Comptroller-General of Customs this morning on the subject, and,.; so far as I can gather, it will not be necessary tn deal with the Bill until We come posito Division VI.a.

A number of officers in the Account Branch are required to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., with three-quarters of an hour for dinner, and three-quarters of an hour for tea; while officers of the Electrical Branch are required to work two and three nights each alternate week, until p.m., with three-quarters of an hour fo luncheon, and one hour for tea. sary, in order that the volume of work may be dealt with, and cannot be dispensed with until further staff is available. 2. The highest amount of overtime worked by any individual officer in any one day was fc£ We hours, which was worked .by an officer of the Record Branch, on Saturday, 27th July. Payment was made for this overtime.

35,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Hindmarsh) [2.50] - I wish to say a few words in connection with the unsatisfactory administration of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act - Some time ago I supplied the Minister of Trade and Customs with definite information concerning certain firms who were evading the law. The existing condition of things is causing the greatest dissatisfaction amongst employers and employees in South Australia. They feel dissatisfied with the action of myself and my colleagues, because they imagine that we are not discharging our duty in seeing that the law is administered. I do not wish to be a party to any legislation which is not to be made operative. We ought not to be always "" f o o l in g"" the workers.",17
36,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Surely we ought not fool them at all.,17
37,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"But that apparThe ently is what bas been done in regard to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. A long time ago I told the Minister that the firm of Messrs. Brebner and Keefe are not obeying the law, arid that they had informed their employees that they did not intend to obey it. They are working their employee's fifty-six hours week, and yet not a single step has been taken to enable this House, and the lic, to ascertain whether or not the Act itself is defective. Only the other credited Messrs. Hawke and Company, of Kapunda, with having faithfully observed the law, but I am now in possesstreet sion of information to the effect that are doing nothing of the kind. From answers which I have received from time time, it is evident that the Government imagine that they have no power to proprepared ceed against firms who have been exempted from the payment of Excise. would point' out that they are only exempted conditionally upon their carrying out the terms of the award of the Condesire ciliation and Arbitration Court. Those terms were agreed to by both the emdal. ployers and employees, and firms which fail to comply with them render themfelt selves liable for the payment of Excise. It seems to me to be simplicity itself the Minister to deal with such firms. an excessive, duty is levied upon any article which is imported the importer has option but to pay that duty under protest. Why has not a similar provision been applied to those manufacturers cultural machinery who are disobeying the law?",17
38,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Where is the Minister to obtain a standard?,17
39,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The standard is fixed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Mr Justice O'Connor has declared that, provided manufacturers adhere to the terms of his award, they are to be exempted from the payment of Excise. But those terms have not been observed by quite a number of firms in South Australia, and yet no real effort has. been made by the Government to ascertain whether or not the revenue of the country is being protected. Surely it is easy for the Minister to say to Messrs. Bagshaw"" and Sons, or Messrs. Hawke and Company, or Messrs. May and Company, "" We are going to charge you Excise on the agricultural implements which you have manufactured."" to It would then be for those firms to say, ""We are not liable to pay any Excise."" Department would then be in a position to see that the revenue was protected. If the employers supplied false information to the Department the employees would be able to come forward and tell the Department that it had been misled. It is due to the House, to the manufacturers of agricultural machinery througha out the Commonwealth, and to their employees, that they should know whether the pubDepartment intends to carry out the provisions of the Act so that all may be placed day I on an equal footing. If I were an employer, I certainly should not continue to pay fair wages if my competitor across the were permitted to pay unfair wages, they and to take away my trade.

The subject to which I invite the t attention of the Government is the unconscionable sweating which is being carried on of agriin the 'Cairns post-office.",17
41,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,In Queensland?,17
42,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Yes .,17
43,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"And yet an officer has been brought from that State to put things right in the General Post Office, Melbourne.",18
44,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Exactly . know why this state of things is permitted to continue. In the first place, however, I should like to ascertain who is responsible for the erection of these post-offices. I am aware that after the necessary money has been voted for their erection, the work passes to the control of the Department of Home Affairs, which is charged with the task of preparing plans and erecting the buildings'. But in many cases these post offices when erected are totally inadequate for the purposes for which they are constructed. The Cairns post-office, which was only recently erected at a considerable outlay, has already been found to be too small for the work which it has to perform, with the result that the old building has had to be utilized in' order to provide additional accommodation. A few days ago I showed the Postmaster-General a telegram from Irvinebank, in my own electorate, where an office which has only just beenopened is already too small for the requirements of the public. As a matter of fact, .the accommodation which it provides is less than that which was provided by the old building. In the Cairns post-office, the sweating which is carried on is a disgrace to the Department. There are only eight men employed there, and they have to handle a very large quantity of mail matter. In this connection, I cannot do 'better than quote an extract from a local newspaper, which, after referring to some complaints which have been made in this House concerning the General Post Office, Sydney, saysAs a matter of fact, though the Sydney figures seem big at first glance, they work out at much less than do the hours of the employees at the local office, who, in a fortnight, put in from 1,4.to 17 hours' overtime, for which they get lime off-and have to get it when they can, but not necessarily when they want it. As a general average, there are about 30 tons of mails inward and outward, passing through the Cairns office each week, numbering about 1,450 bags and parcels. One has to see the condition of the office on mail nights-and especially up til l the last week, in the old building-to ' realise the work entailed. Much of the mail is, of course, made up of bulky parcels, but thousands of letters and papers go to make up the balance, and which have to be sorted and sifted and paGked in the' right box, bag, or pigeon-hole, And this work is being done with a staff 'of eight at the most, after drawing on all .available employees in the office stance of the extra strain which is occasionally put upon the local staff, the occasional clashing of the southern and western mails may be cited, as occurred on Tuesday last. The Kuranda arrived late, and the western mail arrived in on top of it, the eight men on the mail staff, beI wish to tween the hours of 6 o'clock on Tuesday evening, and 3 a.m. on Wednesday, had to deal with a mail of 262 bags and parcels. This, of course, is not a weekly experience, but it is an occurrence by no means rare. In the TelegTaph Branch, also, the officers are asked to perform tasks and put in hours which are far in excess of those in other portions of the State. In corroboration of that statement, I might cite figures from the annual report of the Cairns Chamber of Commerce, which says that the cash receipts of the local post office for the year ended 31st December, 1906, were ^107,772 19s. 8d., and the cash payments ,£58,491 13s. i o d . The total cash transactions in 1906 were '£166,264 13s. 6d., as against £ 1 2 0 , 9 1 6 18s. for 1905. The letters received from other offices numbered 1,014,036, and the newspapers 1,006,200. The letters despatched to other offices totalled 1,120,517, the. mails despatched to 20,984, and the mails received to 29,314. These figures go to show that the press reports have not exaggerated the quantity of mail matter which has to be dealt with in the Cairns post-office. I ask the Postmaster-General to take this matter into consideration. This is the first occasion on which I have voiced in the House ai grievance of this - nature, and I have taken this step because there is some one beyond the Minister whose ear I wish to reach. I recently .'brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General another matter in connection with which he could not do that which he desired, because of the position of an officer who has a great deal to do with the Public Service.",18
45,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The dictator !,18
46,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I am not prepared to go so far as to so describe the officer in question, but it is undeniable that the sweating which is taking place in the Postal Department 'throughout the Commonwealth is not the fault of its officers. The Department is now a paying concern, and therefore one cannot speak too strongly of the sweating which is taking place in connection with it. I do not know what spirit animates the present Administrator, but his immediate predecessor proposed to confer on a section of the community a boon at the expense of the employees in his own Department. There has been in the Department for some years a system of As an insweating in operation, and if this boon is to be conferred it will be at the expense of those who ought not to be asked to bear the burden. I refer to the introduction of penny postage.",18
47,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I must ask the honourable member not to refer ""to that matter.",19
48,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Then I shall content mvself by asking the Postmaster-General to' give his attention to this matter, and I trust that I shall not have to repeat in this House the statements I have made this afternoon.",19
49,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Dalley) [3.2] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh has drawn attention to a matter so serious that I am surprised that it has not received more attention on the part of honourable members. He asserted that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act had practically been set aside. When we voted for that measure it was understood that it would be put in operation wherever those to whom it applied failed to observe fair conditions of labour. If the law is faulty the sooner we amend it the better. Within a short period the Government propose to introduce a similar Bill in respect of certain industries as to which increased protective duties have been, or are, to be granted, and it is just as well that we should know at once whether the trouble in regard to the agricultural machinery trade is due to faulty legislation or to the failure of the Minister to put the law into operation. The honourable member for Hindmarsh intimated that if the law were effective, and the Minister were not prepared to carry it out, he would be ready to turn out the Government. The honourable member invariably states his case in a temperate manner, and if the position is as serious as he has represented it to be, there is only one course open to us. I am surprised that the leader of the Labour Party has not taken action. I should have liked to see him submit a motion of censure against the Government. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh said that we ought not to be always fooling the workers, I interjected that we had no right to fool them at all. We ought'not to fool any section e of the community, and if the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was intended to be a mere sop, and will not enable us to carry out the object that we have in view, the sooner we amend it the better. If , on the other hand, it is effective, then the Minister of Trade and Customs should lose no time in putting it into operation. A similar complaint has been made . in another in regard to the administration of the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act, and I should like to have an explanation from the Minister, who, I trust, will give his serious attention to the matter. There is another grievance which I desire to voice, and which I have already. brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General. It appears that the postal authorities have recently isssued a new regulation regarding the postage upon packets. Under the old regulation circulars or other correspondence enclosed in envelopes partly opened at both ends were carried at a reduced rate. That regulation, however, has been repealed, and the reduced rate now applies only to parcels one end of which is completely open. Very little publicity has been given to this alteration, with the result that many people, ignorant of the change, are complying with the old regulation, and the persons to whom they write are being subjected to surcharges. One of my constituents had to pay a surcharge of 8d. in one case, and 6d. in another, although the old regulation had been observed. He is a keen business man, but he was not aware of the new regulation. Within the next few weeks thousands of Christmas cards will be passing through the post, and in the absence of greater publicity being given to the new regulation many people will be penalized. I hope that the Postmaster-General will make it clear that those who obey the old regulation will not be surcharged or penalized in any way, and that on the other hand if the new regulation is to remain in force he will promise that the utmost publicity shall be given to it.",19
50,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Melbourne Ports) [3.12] - I think that the Ministry will admit that I have never harassed them in regard to the policy of the new protection. But I am one of those who entered the House on the wave of that policy, and unless I am able to show my constituents that the statements which I made on the public platform with regard to it were absolutely sincere and had some foundation in fact my position must necessarily be weakened. If the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is ineffective the Minister should at once inform the House of that fact, and afford it an earlv opportunity to pass amending legislation. If there be some doubt as to its efficacy then it would be well to have a test case which place, would put the matter at'rest. The Minister by his inaction is jeopardizing the passing of the Tariff. Many of us have assured the public that by means, of the new proselect-from tection, the workers and the people generState ally will be afforded an opportunity to of Deputy Postmaster-General. participate in the benefits which the Tariff will confer upon various indussponsible, tries. Is it not idle to tell the worker that the new protection will benefit him the Government are not prepared to put it tion. into operation ? I do not suggest that they are' not doing their duty, but if the disgrievance ? satisfaction with regard to the administration of the harvester legislation is not speedily removed they will experience difficulty in securing the imposition higher duties on items shortly to be dealt with. The Protectionist Party, as well as members of the Labour Party, have been returned pledged to the policy protection, and we desire to see it speedily carried into effect. If nothing is to be then some of us may have to seriously for the position. consider our position, and I suppose that the Government, under the circumstances, will have to do likewise. in this industry there_is. as much capital invested, and as many workers employed, as in most of the manufactures carried in Australia; and if legislation is to down in its application in this connection, what may we not have to face when the whole of the protected industries of the Commonwealth are concerned?' vernment will have to assure honourable members and the public that something be done to bring the present legislation into operation, or that more effective legislation will be introduced; otherwise Ministers can only admit that the new protection cannot be carried into operation. honourable member for Herbert has ventilated a grievance in connection with the administration of the Post and Telegraph) Department in Queensland; but complaints are not confined to that State. of the people believe that the Postmasterremedied.

However-and this is my grievance-whe n these officers returned from New South Wales, after representing, not only Victoria, but Australia, they found they had to "" pay the piper,"" inasmuch as the time they had been absent was deducted from their holiday leave.",20
63,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Were these Federal servants ?,21
64,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Yes . Is it right, when we make such a point of military training and shooting, that these men should be penalized under the circumstances to which I refer?",21
65,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Are those public servants paid their salaries while they are away shooting ?,21
66,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Yes .,21
67,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Does the honourable member wish them to receive double pay?,21
68,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"No ; but I do not see why the time they spend in representing Australia in competitions of the kind should be deducted from their annual leave. On the contrary, I think that all the expense should be borne by the Commonwealth.",21
69,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Angas) [3.25] - I think that the Postmaster-General might look a little, more into one or two matters to attention has from time to time been called. I am not making anv complaint, but, personally, as the representative of a district from which complaints have"" come, I should be glad if one or two cormpara tively small matters engaged a little more attention than they have received hitherto. In Southl Australia a good deal of dissatisfaction exists because of the nonsupply of telegraph messengers. is a rule of the Department, I believe, that unless so much revenue is received at an office, the outlay of £ 2 5 a year for a messenger is not regarded as justifiable. At the same time, there is a feeling amongst the public that the old system of employing messengers is far more encouraging to business than one which is really parsimony and not economy. There are also complaints in regard to excessive - work thrown on the postmasters in some of the towns in South Australia.. I do not desire to specify any particular town, but it is urged that too much work is expected for a comparatively small salary; and I know that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter and do what he can to dispel the discontent. In regard to the new protection, I really think it would be better for the Government, now that they intend to recast the whole system-to establish a new and . extensive inquisitorial machine-to test their powers to pass such' legislation. I speak. as one sympathetic with the object in view. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports rriientioned the anxiety of protectionists to take steps in this connection, but the honourable member forgets that free-traders, feeling that protection has not accomplished what was predicted of it, are also anxious to see that the workers share in the benefits of any duties that may be imposed. I may say that the first time a provision found its way on to the statute-book, protecting the labourer, it was at my instance, in the case of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. There is a provision in that Act that it shall not apply to any industry in which the conditions of labour are not fair. That amendment, I may say, was the Government gloss on the amendment which I tabled, and which they at first opposed, but, finding the House favourable, finally adopted,- and fathered before the country. Under that provision the Commonwealth can refuse to stop imports unless the conditions of labour in the local industry are fair and reasonable; and, in this, of course, we have absolute jurisdiction, seewhich ing that imports only are affected.",21
70,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"But what can be done if employers are fair in one State, and not fair in another?",21
71,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I am not dealing with the administration of the Act. Does the' Postmaster-General wish me to engage in a long discussion as to the possible operation of the law? There Mr Mauger - No; I am merely point: ing out that, on the face of it, the provision is absolutely impracticable.",21
72,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Then why did the Government adopt it, and claim credit for it, on the hustings? If the provision be impracticable, why the hypocritical pretence by the Prime Minister at Ballarat, when he referred to the wonderful stroke of business on the part of the Government in including it in the Act? I do not wish to be tempted into a discussion of whether the provision be operative or not; but the fact remains that the Commonwealth has the power to refuse to stop imports if the conditions of labour in the local industry are not fair and reasonable.",21
73,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Of course, but it would be manifestly unfair to punish the whole of the manufacturers because of the sins of a section.",21
74,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Postmaster-General is impugning his own legislation, and, perhaps, I have a higher respect for the time of the House than he has. The honourable gentleman seeks to tempt me, as if I were an untried member, into a useless discussion as to the possible effect or fairness of the provision. The new protection is engaging the attention of the Courts, and we are apparently throwing on the Judiciary a task which it may be unable to accomplish fairly, in the view of all those interested. The Ministry now propose to bring in a Bill to appoint a permanent Board, armed with extraordinary inquisitorial powers, whose operations may be going on for years, and it is as that we should test our right to place such legislation on the statute-book. I do not wish to offer an opinion on the subject. There are dicta of American judges which throw great doubt on our right to pass this legislation. As our Acts expressly profess to exercise powers of industrial legislation, under the guise of imposing Excise provisions, it seems to me that their constitutionality is more than a little doubtful. If , after all the trouble thrown on the Bench, and the incidental heartburnings to which the proceedings must give rise, we impose a very burdensome Tariff, and it is found that our legislation is all bad, the position will be deplorable. I therefore ask the Ministry to act on the suggestion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, to test the constitutionality of our legislation by requiring some person who has not .applied to the President of the Arbitration Court to pay Excise from the beginning of this year. If it is found that we cannot do justice to labour under these provisions, it will be incumbent on Ministers to seek for other means. matter is important, and the sooner it is dealt with the better.",22

77,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,And I suppose the honourable member cannot do so.,22
78,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,If I were a Minister I would try to find a way to overcome them.,22
79,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is useless to accentuate the difficulties, and apparently nothing is being done to overcome them. Before we proceed to new legislation of well this nature, or even with the Tariff, we should know what are the defects of the Acts which we have passed; whether they are administrative and preventible, or such as we cannot deal with. I do not wish to be always hammering away at the Government in connection with this matter, but Ministers should use as much energv as possible, and it is questionable whether they have done all that the Acts allow. In my opinion they have not. I drew attention, a month or two back, to the fact that in October last the time allowed to the distillers to comply with labour conditions would expire. It has been stated that the Government had given the distillers twelve months' grace; but that was really given to them by the Act.",22
80,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The term of grace applies only to certain provisions of the Act ; that requiring that only a certain proportion of boys shall be employed came into operation at once.,22
81,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Yes . The distillers having had twelve months' grace, they have surely had time enough to comThe ply with the new conditions, and so soon as the period of grace expired, the Act should have been put into operation.",22

I have been The blame' does not lie with the present' When The the Treasurer occupied that position, I drew his attention to the fact that the Act 'would oome into operation on the 12th October, and asked that the necessary formation should be collected beforehand. Yet, I .understand that that information is being collected.",22
86,Mr WILKS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is the answer which the Government gave four months, ago, another place.",23
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,It is the fault qf the caucus that nothing has been done. The Labour Party is only bluffing.,23
88,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I wish to know how much longer the Government will take to collect this information ?,23

90,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Why do not the quorum present. members of the OpDOsition take action? They claim to be equally interested.,23
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Will the honourable member support us if we do?,23
92,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Surely it is the duty of an Opposition to bring down motions without first obtaining promises help from Government supporters. Have not its members sufficient pluck to do this? If they brought down a motion affirming that the Government had not been parto ticularly active in this matter, I should placed in somewhat pf a difficulty.",23
93,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Why does not the honourable member move a motion?,23
94,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"There is the profrom fessional Opposition; let it do something. I believe that all sections are desirous the new protection poliey shall be success, and I hope that honourable memread bers generally, without trying to gain advantage for themselves, will urge the vernment to expedition, so that the real difficulties which exist may be ascertained before we proceed further on these lines.  only natural that .grave dissatisfaction should 'be expressed on this subject. Over twelve months ago the wheedled Parliament into imposing high ment. protective duties for the benefit of manufacturers who are now persecuting their employees, making their lives a burden, and ruining them by law expenses. If it twelve months to apply an Excise Act to a few manufacturers of harvesters, how long will it take to apply the new protection all the manufacturing interests of Australia? In every item of the Tariff, manufacturers are getting increases which Committee would not grant if they knew .that the Excise law would be inoperament. tive. Did not honourable members hope in that the employees would also benefit? after more than ' a year has now elapsed, the Government has not . attempted to give effect to Acts passed to secure that in.the case of certain indusin tries. Is this inaction due to defects in the law, or to want of grit on the part of Ministers ? It may be very well to say that the present Minister of Trade and Customs is not to blame, but Ministers as a whole are at fault, because they have done nothing, and nothing will be done until the House bestirs itself, and demands that action be taken.""",23
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"There is not a [Quorum formed.]  since the Act was passed, and yet no serious attempt has been made by the Government to administer it. I have no hesitation in saying that a large number of honourable members have supof ported the imposition of high Tariff duties in the expectation that the workers will obtain some benefit from their operation under the scheme of new protection which is be introduced. But, judging by what has be already, taken place in connection with the administration of the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Act, they are doomed to disappointment. I warn honourable members not to allow the Tariff to be transmitted this Chamber in sections until the Bill relating to the new protection has been disthat posed of. Otherwise they will be at the a mercy of the Government. Anybodv who : the reply of the Treasurer to the dean putation which waited upon him yesterday Goin reference to the collection of Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act will agree with me that it was a thoroughly ""yes-no"" reply.

That is not courteous to the House, and as I am quite sure that the honourable gentleman desires to be courteous, I ask him to rise and withdraw the remark in the usual way.",24
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I withdraw it .  have been agreed to by honourable members in the belief that the new protection scheme will benefit not only the manufacturers but the workers and the consumers. I do not wonder that the protectionist members of the House-and particularly, of the Labour Party-ar e becoming anxious about this 'matter, because when the Tariff has been disposed of - if the new protection proposals of the Government are not satisfactory-the y will be perfectly helpless. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. I refer to the way in which the Commonwealth ipublic servants of South Australia have been treated. Upon a number of previous occasions I have dealt with this question. When the draft Constitution was under consideration in the Federal Convention it was clearly laid down that all existing and accruing, rights would be preserved to transferred officers. But what are the facts ? As a result of the reclassification scheme-and I should not have mentioned this matter but that the officers affected cannot obtain any satisfaction from the . Public Service Commissioner-10 0 postmasters in South Australia have had their salaries reduced by amounts ranging from £ 5 to ^ 1 5 0 per annum. Any attempt to secure redress of these grievances is flouted by the Public Service Commissioner, and if an officer dares to approach a member of Parliament he is threatened with the penaltv that attaches to a breach of internal discipline. I wish to quote a few passages from the speeches delivered by members of the Federal Convention with a view to show how our public servants have been misled in this connection. Undoubtedly it was the intention of the framers of our Constitution that all existing and accruing .rights should be preserved to our .public In speaking at the Adelaide Convention when clause 83-whic h is now : section 84-of the Constitution was under kind consideration, Mr Gordon saidTwo points arise out of this. Is it the intention of the draftsman to make compulsory service under the Federal Parliament, whether the not repeat officers like it or not? The second point is more important. In the sixth line of the clause, it says, "" and every such officer shall be entitled to receive from the State any gratuity, pension, or retiring allowance, payable under the law of the State, on abolition of, his office,"" so that if a man only happens to be twenty-one years of age, and is transferred to the Federal authorities, he is to receive from the State the full compensation he is entitled to receive on the abolition of his office, although for the rest of his life, he may be employed by the Federal authority. Sir George Turner, speaking upon this matter, saidWhat you want to say in this clause is, not that he is to get a certain sum under all circumstances, but that whatever his rights are, you will preserve them. Mr O'Connor said I think we are all agreed that when an officer is taken over by the Commonw.ealth, he should not be placed in an unfair position, or lose any rights by being taken over, because it is no fault of his that the continuity of his service has been broken. Mr Barton saidA l l that we suggest is that, where a person is entitled to a locally accruing right, under the law of the State in which he has served, that right shall not be impaired; but where, under the law of the State in which he has served, he is not entitled to any gratuity, pension, or retiring allowance, the mere fact of the transfer does not give him the right to the payment of such. Mr Deakin said I do not understand why all rights and privileges are not simply continued, and why a change of master should involve any change in the conditions under which he is employed. Any statutory rights which exist should be continued"", as the change is only a change of master, and not a change of functions. Mr Isaacs said I think it highly important that we should have some provision such as is suggested by my honourable friend, Mr Deakin. Mr Reid supported that suggestion. Mr. Trenwith saidWhile it would be difficult for some time, as indicated by Mr Gordon, to adjust the different conditions running side by side, it would be unjust not to make some provision to maintain the rights already in existence. We should be doing different from what any conscientious company would do Various States have now a large number of servants, with whom they have entered into contracts for periods denned by Acts of Parliament. If these servants be taken over, it is incumbent upon the States in justice to the people",24
105,Sir GHAHAM BKRRY,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"There is no obligation to take them over. -' Mr TRENWITH - Whether they are taken over or not, there should be an obligation to treat them fairly, and where such servants are required, there should be an obligation to take them over with the condition under which they were serving the States which originally employed them. If this is not done, there will be a manifest injustice to a very great number of citizens in Victoria, and, without imputing selfishness or want of patriotism to civil servants of Australia, I have no hesitation in saying that we shall be inducing a large number of citizens to vote against Federation in defence of their own rights and their living, and in defence of justice. Accordingly a provision was inserted in the Constitution which declares that all existing and accruing rights are preserved to transferred officers. But,. as a matter of fact, experience has, shown that quite the reverse is the case. I have already referred to the fact that, under the classification, a large number of officers suffered a reduction of salary, ranging from £ 5 to ^150 per annum. About ninety officers have been deprived of increments, ranging from .£10 to £ 3 0 per annum, to which they were entitled under the State law. Section 9 of the Civil Service Act of South Australia provides thatEvery class in each division as aforesaid except the first class shall have a minimum and maximum limit of salary, and every officer therein shall be entitled to receive an annual increase, that is to say, for the officers of the second classwho are entitled to a minimum salary of £350, and a maximum of £425, an annual increase of \j£i5Officers in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth classes, under the same Act, were entitled to an annual increase of £ 1 0 , the only condition being that in no case shall any annual increase be granted except upon satisfactory proof of the industry and general good conduct of the officer. I do not know whether it is generally known that officers transferred from the South Australian Public Service have been deprived of all these increments. I have on other occasions referred to the discontent prevailing in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and it is no exaggeration to say that, from one end of the service to the other, the utmost dissatisfaction prevails. Officers consider that they were misled by the speeches delivered by members of the Convention when clause 84 of are to the Constitution was under consideration. Another grievance is that not the slightest attention has been paid to the provisions of the South Australian Civil Service Act in regard to the retirement of officers who have reached the age of 65 years. Under that ActThe Governor may require any officer who has become incapacitated for the performance of his duties, to resign his office, and, in the event of non-compliance may remove such officer who shall thereupon be entitled to the compensation provided by this Act. In many cases officers transferred from the South ^Australian to the Commonwealth service, on reaching the retiring age, have been summarily dismissed, and have not received the advantage of the six months' notice to which they were entitled. I know of competent letter carriers, mail-cari d.ivers, and others who were thus turned adrift, although they were capable of rendering for many years good service to the Department. Under the State law, they would have been allowed to remain in the service, but they have been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the Commissioner. He is a law unto himself, and interprets the Constitution as seems to him best. Notwithstanding that many eminent counsel, including Sir Josiah Symon, are emphatically of opinion that, under section 84 of the Constitution, the rights and accruing rights of officers at the time of transfer must be observed, nothing has been done. It may be asked, "" Why do not these men go to law ""? My answer to such a question would be that the law is a very expensive luxury, and that the cost of conducting a suit against the Commonwealth would be very great. The speeches delivered by some of the present occupants of the High Court Bench when, as members of the Federal Convention, they were discussing clause 84 of the Constitution, should satisfy honourable members that the men to whom I refer have been done a very grave injustice. Under the South Australian law, a public servant, after a certain period of service, is entitled to eight months' leave. The Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth, however, has placed an entirely new construction upon that provision in so far as it relates to transferred officers, and practically disregards it. I would also point out that almost every conceivable duty is piled upon officers in the Postal Department. They are made clerks of courts and Customs officers in country districts, electoral registrars, and deputy returning officers, and they have, in addition, to carry out the work of Savings Banks agencies. Under the State law of South Australia they received special remuneration for these additional duties; but as officers of the Commonwealth they do not. The only exception is in the case of a man who is appointed a deputy returning officer; he is granted £ 2 2s. for discharging the duties of that office. Can any one deny that these public servants have not every reason to be dissatisfied, seeing that, apart altogether from the additional duties that are being piled upon them, they have been called upon to make great sacrifices for the Commonwealth? I am sure that no honourable member desires to see any member of the Public Service deprived of his rights. The rights accruing to transferred officers when the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth certainly ought to be preserved. The recruits, of course, come under the new law, but why should men who, under the State legislation at the time of their transfer, were entitled to receive increments^ of ,£10 and £ 1 5 per annum, be deprived of those increases? - And why, I ask, should a vigorous old man be turned adrift when he is capable of doing his work, and is even more reliable in some cases than are younger members of the service ? - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Thos e have reached the retiring age object to being retired, whilst those under them object to their retention in the service.  the rights of these men shall not be disregarded. .New men are coming, into the service, and in course of time the old transferred officers will die out.",25
106,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is said that they never ber of permanent hands. # die.  a boy, served in the office of Sir Charles Todd, one of the oldest officers in the Postal Department of South Australia. After his transfer to the Commonwealth his salary was reduced, and he took the matter so much to heart that he died afterwards. I think that the Prime ister should take action. A month ago it was shown in this House that there was much dissatisfaction in the Department New South Wales, and officers in the Decontrol! partment in South Australia, in the staternent of their case, from which I have honourable member to try to magnify made quotations, clearly prove that they - have a strong claim for consideration. General and. a Treasurer. Nevertheless,' they carl obtain'no.satisfac- 'dent ;is. by no means novel. tion from the Commissioner, and if they appeal to a member of this Parliament to assist them, they are held to have committed a breach of the regulations, and to be deserving of punishment. The matter ought to be looked into.",26
107,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Why does not the honourable member bring in a Bill to amend the Public Service Act? He would be well supported.  so far as this matter is concerned, an amendment of the Act is necessary. The wording of section 84 of the Constitution was followed in the Public Service Act in order that the rights of transferred officers should be preserved; but the Public Service Commissioner has so interpreted the law that they are not being recognised."" The only alternative open to these men is to resort to law, but when a man is turned adrift, - with perhaps only a few pounds by him, he does not feel much disposed to engage in costly litigation. I trust that the Ministry will take action with a ; view of remedying these grievances. If they do not, I shall bring the matter forward again and again until redress is obtained.",26

I am merely stating a fact, the responsibility for which was taken by the Treasurer when he delivered his Budget statement. The Treasurer has to say what amounts he will place on the Estimates; and he evidently had the support of honourable members when he said that, in his opinion, these were abnormal times, and that to provide for the full number of permanent hands, who could not be removed, would be unwise at this particular juncture.",27
114,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Does the Postmaster General think that the Treasurer is right?,27

117,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is what we think ; but the Treasurer is responsible to Parliament for the expenditure. This is not a new matter. Sir George Turner, prior to his very last financial statement, reduced the expenditure of this Department by £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . As I say, this is not by any means a new matter ; but it illustrates the extreme difficulties there are in administering a Department of the kind* On the one hand, there is the Treasurer reviewing the proposals, and, on the other, the Public Service Commissioner, who regulates the number of employees; and then, in addition, the public works, are carried out by the Department of - Home Affairs. No one knows the difficulties of the position better than does the honourable member for Parramatta; but I think that he, and honourable members generally, will give me credit for doing my best to meet the extraordinary demand.

132,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Yes , but the vast majority of establishments are closed. We have found, from returns, that the amount of business does not warrant the keeping of employ6s engaged until 8 or 9 o'clock at night; and the present is a system of long; hours and sweating, which, I think, every thoughtful member will support me inabolishing.",27
133,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Will mails be delivered after 6 o'clock?,27
134,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The delivery of mails will not be interfered with.,27
135,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I am afraid the Postmaster-General will bring a hornet's nest about him.,27
136,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Oh , no; and I look to honourable members who have complained of sweating, to assist me in putting down the evil. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Sweatin g and the keeping open of the offices do not necessarily go together.",28
137,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The cry is that we should put down sweating, but the moment any one is inconvenienced in the slightest degree",28
138,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,There be additional officers.,28
139,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Of course; but that, would mean additional expense. To incur additional expense, in order to keep the offices open during the present hours, in which many are merely pretending to do business, is simply impossible.",28
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,.Many mails arrive late in the evening.,28
141,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Thos e mails will not be interfered with. After consulting with the Prime Minister, I have issued instructions that, as far as possible, temporary hands are to be employed to relieve the immediate pressure, and every step is being taken to carry out the initial stages of employing the permanent hands provided for in the Estimates.",28
142,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"What about the additional hands for which the Estimates do not provide? - Mr Mauger - I shall certainly deal with that matter at the earliest possible moment. The complaints in regard to the post-office at Cairns have already reached me, and I have wired to Queensland for an immediate report, with a view to relief being afforded, if the case is as stated by the honourable member for Herbert. The honourable member for Dalley is all wrong in his reference to the postage on packets; there has been no new regulation for years.",28
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Then it is an regulation being enforced in a new wav.,28
144,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The surcharge is in pursuance of an old regulation which has hitherto not been carried out; but inquiries are being made into the particular case. This shows the unwisdom of introducing a subject of this kind into an important discussion like that on the Tariff. Some regulation has been broken, though no new regulation has been made; and good reasons can be giyen. for the surcharge to which the honourable member referred.",28
145,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Barker) [4.25] should like it made perfectly clear whether or not mails will be delivered at post-offices after 6 o'clock under the new regulation indicated by the Postmaster-General. The honourable gentleman has told us that no mails will be delivered after 6 o'clock in the evening.,28
146,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I said nothing of the kind.,28
147,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is what 1 understood, at any fate; and I point out that a good many mails arrive in country districts after that hour. could Mr Mauger - Provisio n will be made, for those.",28
148,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Some mails arrive at country towns at 7.30 in the evening, and it will be a great hardship if the public are deprived of the privilege of obtaining these letters shortly after the mail arrives, which they have enjoyed for the last thirty years.",28
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,In many cases there is only the one mail a day.,28
150,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is so; and if a hard-and-fast line be drawn, much inconvenience will be suffered.",28
151,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"At Portland, f p r instance, the mail does not arrive until 9 o'clock at night.",28
152,Mr LIVINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"If we desire people to live in the country, they must be given postal and other facilities. The new regulation, if carried out, will cause a hue and cry from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Cape Leuwin; and I advise the Minister to reconsider the matter. . Mr HUGHES (West Sydney) [4.26] A grievance which I laid before honourable members on the last occasion of this kind remains unsettled, namely, the non-payment by the Postal Department of moneys properly due to persons under contracts for certain works. I now understand that the claimants ought not to have applied to the Postal Department, but to the Department old of Home Affairs; and this appears to me to be a very interesting way_ of evading responsibilities, though not one to commend itself to any business man. If the firm of David Jones and Company, or Foy and Gibson, had to refer an account from the mantle department to the department of stockings and underclothing, there would not be a delay of ten or fifteen weeks in the settlement ; and there ought not to be any such delay in the case of Government accounts. It reflects great discredit on a great Department when, time after time, men have - I to ask for money they have honourably earned. As to the undermanning in the Department, there has been as yetno 1 marked improvement in Sydney. No doubt the Postmaster-General has his hands f u but I do press on him the necessity of doing something. The aim of the Department is not merely to save money, but also to spend money properly by doing good service to the community; and I hope the honourable gentleman will see his way clear to make such appointments as are necessary.",28
153,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Bass) [4.28] - The Postmaster-General, in the latter part of his remarks, said that the new regulation in regard to closing at 6 o'clock will not apply to those post-offices where the mails arrive after that hour. It that be so, then the first statement of the Postmaster-General, that the regulation will apoly to all offices, must be wrong. This is' a point on which we ought to be quite clear. In country districts and mining towns, evening is the only time when the bulk' of the people can attend to their postal business; and the new regulation will prove a great hardship. There is no doubt that many of the post offices could be closed during the day for hours, but in the evening it is highly necessary that they should be open for business.",29
154,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Calare) [4.29] - I should not have taken part in this discussion but for the extraordinary, statement of the Postmaster-General, who, I think, would be very well advised if he reconsidered his decision. Post-offices exist for the convenience of the public-to give the maximum and not the minimum amount of convenience. At the same time, we do not desire to see our public servants worked unduly long hours or sweated. The postal authorities tried to meet the difficulty by arranging for the employment of additional hands; but on the refui.il of the Treasurer to make available a sufficient sum to provide for them, the Postmaster-General is meeting the case by giving instructions that, from the ist January next, all post-offices shall be closed at 6 p.m. But why stop at 6 p.m. ? Why not close at 4 p.m., or even, earlier, and thus effect a greater saving? If the honourable member thinks that the public convenience would be served by keeping the post-offices open only until 6 p.m., he will find that the public takes a different view. In country districts mails often arrive late in the evening, and unless provision is made for their distribution on arrival, the local community is greatly inconvenienced.",29
155,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The new regulation will l l ; apply only to post-offices which can be closed at 6 p.m. without serious inconvenience to the public.,29
156,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is an important qualification; but I think that the Postmaster-General will find that the arrangement will not effect any very great saving. Should the Postmaster-General close all post-offices promptly at 6 o'clock, he will soon find a hornet's nest about his ears. I trust that the honourable gentleman will not discontinue his efforts to put a stop to sweating, but that, before he reduces the hours for which the post offices are open to the public, he will give the greatest consideration to the matter, so that inconvenience may not be caused. He should aim at giving the public the maximum amount of convenience, at the same time setting his face against sweating of any kind.",29
157,Mr SINCLAIR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Moreton) [4.35] - To my mind, it was the intention of Parliament, in passing the Excise Acts, that applications for exemption should be made as cheap as possible to the applicant. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act provides that it- shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which(d) are, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and reasonable by him or by aJudge of the Supreme Court of a State or any person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority, to whom he may refer the matter. Notwithstanding that provision in the Act, Queensland applicants for exemption are being put. to great inconvenience. Any one may act as the agent for an applicant, and I have been asked to appear as agent for a Queensland applicant, who, on the 12th June last, received the following letter from the Industrial RegistrarI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your application for an order of exemption under section 2 of the above Act, and in reply to inform you that His Honor the President of'the Court will deal with your application at the Law Courts, William-street, Melbourne, on Tuesday, the 3rd September next, at 10.30 a.m. It will be necessary for you to be present personally at the Court on that date, or be repre-. sented by counsel or by a solicitor or agent. Your representative should be thoroughly conversant with all the details of your business as to wages.paid, hours worked, &c. Later on we received - an intimation that the holding of the Court had been postcountry poned until the 23rd September. I athave tended on that day, and learned that been it was again postponed until either the 7 or ioth October- I amnot sure which. Personally I am not much concerned in this upon to work. matter, although I have been watching the case from the 3rd September until the present time, and do not know hours. yet when the application will. be heard; but it seems to me monstrous that ap- . plicants in Queensland should be asked to enter an appearance in Melbourne, and be subjected to these extraordinary dewhich lays.

163,Mr SINCLAIR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I am not in favour of trying to do the impossible. The Condelivered stitution does not give us power to enforce such legislation. That will be seen when an appeal is made to the High Court on the subject.,30

There have complaints of shortness of staffs, but th I do not think that many officials have complained of the hours which they are called",30
165,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I have had quite a number of complaints about the length of the,30
166,Mr SPENCE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The public has - been justified in complaining in some cases about the hours fixed by the Department for the closing of mails. I remember an instance, occurred in New South Wales, when, the starting of the western mail train had, for the convenience of the travelling am public, been put back an hour, the Department closed the mail an hour earlier than had previously been closed. The honourable member for Calare, myself, and others, a big light before the authorities would alter that arrangement - This is a country question. Take Brewarrina and Bourke These places enjoy a only a tri-weekly train service. The train arrives at Brewarrina at 7.5 p.m., and the are obliged to obtain' delivery of their letters after that hour, and to replyfurto them the same evening. Otherwise a loss of several days would be involved, and that would be a very serious matter to In the case of Bourke, coaches run from that town to the Queensland border to connect with the mail serThey arrive at the Bourke post-office after the ordinary hour are obliged to obtain delivery of their correspondence the same evening, and to reply to it forthwith, otherwise a fortnight's delay would result. At these towns the postal officials not complained of the existing arthey are content to work in Any attempt to close the offices earlier than is now done would necessitate a new arrangement being made in reeard to the arrival and departure of coaches, quite apart from the question of the delivery of the letters. Of course, in the cities, where the correspondence. is by letter-carriers, the position is .altogether different. I am quite prepared to support the Postmaster-General in any attempt to enforce reasonable hours being granted to employees, but special arrangements must certainly be made in country . Mr Mauger - I canassure the honorr able member that throughout the.Ctonunonwealth there are dozens, if not hundreds, of cases which can be relieved in the way that I have suggested. Mr AUSTIN 'CHAPMAN (Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.50] - Regardin g the statements of the honourable members for Hindmarsh, Dalley and Boothby, I think it will be recognised, when thecircumstances of the case are made known, that no charge of negligence can be laid at the door of the Customs Department. On the contrary, every effort has been made to give effect to the principle which is known as the new protection. Of course it is very easy for honourable members to inquire, "" Why does not the Department collect the Excise ?"" Let us take the case of the distillers as an i l lustration. The honourable member for Boothby has stated that, some time ago, he warned my predecessor that the twelve months' grace which the distillers were allowed under the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act would soon expire, and that consequently he ought to .take time by the forelock, so that he would be ready to enforce the collection of the Excise upon the very day that the measure became operative. But what does the Act say?Provided that all spirits distilled in Australia, and not having been matured by storage in wood for a period of two years, may, until the thirty-first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and seven inclusive, be delivered at the respective rates of duty specified in the Excise Tariff 1902. Provided further that if any distiller(a) Does not, after the expiration of one year from the passing of this Act, pay his employees a fair and reasonable rate of wages per week of 48 hours; or (b) Employs more than a due proportion of boys to men engaged in the industry, the Governor General may, in pursuance of a joint address by the Senate and the House of. Representatives, impose an additional Excise of is. per gallon on each of the items mentioned in the schedule as regards such distiller. The Act is dated 12th October, 1906, and consequently the distillers were not obliged to pay a fair and reasonable rate of wages until 12th October of the present year. Where then would have been the use of taking time by the forelock, as was suggested by the honourable member for Boothby ? The honourable member for Perth also inquired, "" Why does ""not the Department collect the Excise?"" ' Surely we are not to penalize any section of the community without first ascertaining whether thej' are liable to any penalty for an infringement of the' law?' When we are satisfied'that the distillers are not paying fair and reasonable wages, we may, upon a joint resolution of both Houses, impose the additional Excise.",30
167,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,When is a resolution to be submitted to both Houses?,31
168,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Does the honourable member suggest that we should submit such a resolution until we have-reasonable ground for believing that the distillers are not paying fair wages? Undoubtedly the proper course for the Department to pursue is first to ascertain what wages are being paid. Then if it is satisfied that reasonable wages are not being paid, I shall be in a position to bring the matter before the House. I repeat that the Act only came into operation on the 12th October last. What has been done since? We have already asked, the distillers to supply us with sworn declarations as to the wages they are paying. I gave them till the ist inst. to supply the Collectors of Customs in the different States with this information, and I have asked the collectors to let me have that information within seven day's.",31
169,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is all right.,31
170,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Nothin g more could have been done. We are determined to carry out the law.,31
171,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What about the Excise upon agricultural implements ?,31
172,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is part of the Government policy to see that good wages are paid by manufacturers. But we are not prepared to hound any section of the community or to practice oppression. We shall see that all those concerned observe the law, otherwise nobody will be readier than I shall - to compel them to pay the Excise. The honourable member for Macquarie has asked me a question in reference to the Exduty cise upon agricultural implements. We all know what the law is in that respect. It provides that if the manufacturers do not pay their employees fair wages they are liable to pay an Excise. The Act in question became operative at the beginning of the present year. Now it is rather a large order to ascertain throughout Australia what wages are being paid in all the shops and foundries where agricultural implements are being manufactured. As a matter of fact they are being manufactured in some very small shops, which employ only a few hands. The principle, which the Act seeks to enforce is an entirely new one, and honourable members can easily understand that we have not the perfect machinery for giving effect to it that exists in the Customs. House so far as the importation of goods are concerned. Some honourable members have asked "" Why does not the Minister collect the Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act and under the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act in the same way that the Department collects Customs duties""? Birt I would point out that in the latter case we have only to say to the importer "" You must pay up or you will not get your goods."" The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act reads- Provided that this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which(a) are declared by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament to be fair and reasonable; or (i) are in accordance with an industrial 'award under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration (c) are, in accordance with the terms of an industrial agreement, filed under . Commonwealth Conciliation and bitration Act 1904; or (d) are, on an application made for the pose to the President of the Commontrial wealth Court of Conciliation aud ArVictorian bitration, declared to be fair and reasonable by him or. by a Judge the Supreme Court of - a State or i person or persons who compose a State industrial authority, to whom he refer the matter. Consequently it is clear that the Excise has to be paid or the manufacturer has to prove disposed that he is paying proper wages. How is heBefore to prove that? He may establish the fact to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth ment Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In sions connection with this matter I claim that the Government have adopted the proper It seems to me that we ought not to enforce the payment of the Excise until we have given the manufacturers of agricultural implements an opportunity of showing that they are paying reasonable wages.",31
173,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"How long should it take them to do so? . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - They have to make application to the Court. This law applies to agricultural machinery makers scattered over a great continent, and unfortunately we have not at hand all the machinery that we require. But we pressed these manufacturers to apply for certificates, intimating that unless they obtained them we should demand the payment of Excise. That, I think, was a proper course to take. . Mr MCDONALD - Hav e all the implement manufacturers in South Australia obtained exemptions?",32
174,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"A very large number have; but we have not followed up every little country blacksmith employing one or two men, because I do not think it was intended that the Act should apply to them. Mi. MCDONALD - The honourable member for Hindmarsh did not refer to such cases.",32
175,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I shall deal with the cases to which the honourable member referred. Applications were made in different States, and the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court wrote to the Attorney-General; requesting the Government to stay their hand until the issue of the Wages Board scale. The reasons which Mr Justice O'Connor gave for this proposal are public property. He wrote, Act 1904; or in May lastThere are over fifty applications by Victorian. the agricultural implement manufacturers for deArclarations under the Excise Tariff Act of 1906 set down for hearing next week in Melbourne. purI understand from the Registrar of the IndusArbitration Court that a Board under the Factories ,and Shops Act is now settling the rates of wages in the agricultural implement of makers' trade, and that they will have the scale any of wages completed in about two months. It would be very much to the advantage of masters may ""and men that the declarations asked for, if ' made, should be made on the basis of the scale of wages settled by the Board. I am, therefore, to postpone all the applications until after the Wages Board scale has been issued. doing so, however, I would be glad if you could give the assurance that the Governwill take no action to enforce the proviof the Act against any manufacturer who has applied to the President of the Arbitration Court under the Act until his application has course. been finally disposed of.",32
176,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That letter had nothing to do with manufacturers in South Australia.,32

The difficulty appears to arise from the fact that two rates are fixed.",33
199,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I think that the policy of the award in differentiating between the capacity of the workers is wrong.,33

This is what the officer reportsWith reference to your instructions to inspect the wages-sheet at Messrs. May Bros, and Co. Ltd., Gawler, agricultural engineers, I have the May Brothers honour to report having visited their factory, on the 7th inst. Mr May, the managing director, the secretary, and the general manager gave me every facility for inspection, and assisted me in every way. I took as a basis the wages for the last fortnightly pay, and checked the time worked by each man during ordinary hours and the amount paid when working overtime. I compared the total amount with the heel of the cheque drawn upon the bank for the fortnightly pay. They agreed. I also made this comparison for the last three months, and found it correct. The result of my inquiries is as follows :- The amount shown in brackets after the class of mechanic enumerated, is the minimum rate of wages (day of eight hours) agreed to at the conference between employers and workmen. He proceeds to show the wages paid to the various employees under the award. Blacksmiths of average capacity were to receive 9s. per day. The officer found that the firm were employing one at 9s. 6d. a day, one at 9s., and one at 9s. to 14s.

205,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"They say that they are making so little in the way of machinery that is subject to Excise, that they do not care to comply with the conditions under which they obtained an exemption.",34
206,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Then they ought to pay the Excise.,34
207,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I have made a demand for the payment of Excise as from ist January last, when the Act came into operation, and the question at issue is whether they are liable to pay from that date, or from 6th June last, when they obtained an exemption. They have offered to pay Excise from the latter date. I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh will recognise that the Department is trying, as far. as possible, to deal with all these cases. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also made a complaint in regard to a manufacturer named Bagshaw. But I point out that that gentleman's firm has got an exemption, and surelv the honourable member does not hold the Department responsible under those circumstances. It is the business of the Department to see that proper conditions are observed; and I cannot believe that the honourable member really means what' he says when he accuses the Department of having made no effort in that direction. In connection with this particular case, on hearing the complaint made by the honourable member, I sent an officer to Mr Bagshaw, who made the following sworn declarationI , Edward Gilbert Bagshaw, of Elizabeth Street, Adelaide, in the State of South Australia, agricultural engineer, do solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :1. I am one of the permanent directors of J. S. Bagshaw and' Sons Limited, of Elizabeth Street, Adelaide aforesaid, agricultural engineers. 2. That I am a practical engineer, and have been engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements since the year 1896. 3. That I have had charge of the factory where the business of the company is carried on, and have worked with and directed the operation of the employees since the year 1900; and it is part of my duty to engage the employees of the company. 4. From my knowledge of the business of the company and from the experience I have gained in working with and directing the operations of the employees of the company I know exactly the capacity of the several employees of the company as regards the class of work they are employed to do. 5. Forthwith after the declaration of exemption was granted to the said company by the President of the Commonwealth - Court of Conciliation and Arbitration I classified - the company's employees according to their ability to perform the work set them to do, and they were satisfied with such classification, and have been paid by the company according to such classification 6.

But we must not penalize men until we have some proof.

218,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I doubt that very much. It is a good thing to have matters threshed out here, because we are thus enabled to find the weak links in the chain. The - Treasurer and the At torney-General are preparing a Bill with a view of cutting out those weak links, and the legislation on this subject. of Whateverpower is given to me under the I law I shall certainly use. It is against public opinion, and the desire of this Parrealiament, that manufacturers should continue to enjoy benefits of legislation relatHowing to bounties and duties, while they do not observe reasonable conditions in relation to their workmen. As far as possible, we manushall endeavour to prevent such manufacturers evading the law. I think, however, that the honourable member for Hindmarsh must admit that there is nothing in his are charges, the making of which I put down to his zeal. All I ask is that honourable members shall not generalize. Of course, it is rather a hard matter to introduce exmen's names into such a discussion. there ought to no false delicacy in dealing with a matn ter of this description.

But it is not desired that there shall be an army of inspectors running about the country; and, therefore, we are ""going slow "" in order that the new law may become so obnoxious as to cause any delay in its coming into full operation.

At the same time, I feel it to be my duty to stand up for men who are the placed in the position of Mr Bagshaw; there must be fair play all round.

What desire to point out is that a mistake has been made- I care not by whom-and it the duty of the Government to introduce an amending measure. It appears to and iniquitous to allow an employer to be a judge of the capacity of any particular man in his employment. What right has the employer to be the judge in such a matbe ter any more than has the employee' himself,36

223,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"There should be an independent judge. If the honourable member and myself were to go to law, would it be reasonable that either of us should be the judge in our own case? Of course, I do not say that the independent judge should decide in each case individually, but only collectively, according always observed in the employment of men generally. Beyond deciding what is a minimum wage, I do not think we ought to t is, a.minimum wage based on the cost of living and what is necessary to keep a man in the average comforts of life, according to our standard of living.

232,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I am informed, too, that domett is an obsolete term as applied to woollen material, being now used to designate heavy flannelette.

238,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Our own mills cannot execute the orders which are being given to them.,37
239,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Yes . I am coming to that.

There has been a considerable increase in portation of rugs, because of the prosfinishing perity of this country during recent years. As most of the rugs imported come from the United Kingdom, the duty will affect chiefly British manufacturers. According to the information with which I have been supplied, the importations of rugs, rugthe ging, and lap dusters from the United Kingdom last year were valued at,£43,784, from New Zealand at £3,032, and"" from all other countries at £7,426- a total £^54)24 > of which .£46,816 came from 2 within the Empire. In 1903 the imporvery tations were valued at .£27,098. Blankets and blanketing are now being extensively manufactured in nearly all the States, the conditions here being naturally favourable the industry, as Australia is an immense producer of wool, which is grown almost the doors of the factories. The industry C 3] 20 is native to the country, and would have of duty existed without any protection.",37
240,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,In that case there can the Tariff be no objection to a high duty.,37
241,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It shows that there is certainly no need for a high duty in this case. It has generally been argued by protectionists that import duties are necessary to protect our manufacturers from the competition of other countries, where men work longer hours, and are not so well paid as 25 our workmen. Duties are always asked for, in the first instance, on the fallacious plea of enabling industries to start, and that, being once started, they will be able to take care of themselves.",37
242,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is not the protectionistview, but John Stuart Mill's theory.",37
243,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is the view , put forward by the Treasurer, and inaothers who first preached these poisonrequireous doctrines . in New South Wales. I would point out that this is an industry is indigenous to the Commonwealth. at The wool is grown at our doors-ther e is no expense of importation-and the value of the finished product is chiefly the value of the raw material. In comparison with the machinery which is used in the industry, only a very small amount of labour is employed. Only a' few days ago I was conducted through one of the Victorian woollen mills, and I could not fail to be at struck with the enormous amount of work Auswhich is performed by machinery. Only as about half-a-dozen boys and girls were employed in the room where the spinning the immachines were at work. Even in the processes very few men are employed. Of course the hygienic conditions which obtain in the establishment to which T refer are all that can be desired. If honourable members will take the trouble to peruse the report of the B section of Tariff Commission, they will see that the conclusion at which its members arrived is altogether unfavorable to the imposition of any higher duty than 15 per of cent. The report is a most exhaustive one, and bears evidence of having received careful consideration. Certainly it compares more than favourable with the report of the A section of the Commission, which slurs over the principal points that to the free-trade section emphasize. I have no desire to impute intentional unfairness at to the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission; but' I do say that its report betrays evidence of strong fiscal bias. In speaking of blankets Jand woollen piece goods, the B section of the Commission say- We, the undersigned, while acknowledging the report prepared at the instance of the Chairman to be a full presentment of the case for higher duties, regret to find it imperfect and misleading, both as a summary of the evidence in general and as purporting to give a true value to the evidence adduced against any increase of the Tariff. That is a very strong statement for one section of the Commission to make in reference to the other section. It really amounts to a charge of unfairness on the part of the protectionist members of the Commission iii their presentment of the case placed before that body. The document continuesIn the Chairman's report, the "" reasons assigned for increased duties"" are re-iterated at the end of a summary of evidence, in which these reasons have already been emphasized to the fullest possible extent. The objections to increased duties, however, which should in natural sequence follow the former, and which as a matter of 'fact were tendered in rebuttal, are very briefly and imperfectly summarized in the introduction. The effect of this is undoubtedly to minimize the weight and value of the evidence against increased duties. We therefore find ourselves once more under the regrettable necessity of preparing practically a fresh report, in which we supply the matter lacking in that signed by our colleagues. I ask honourable members to read the report. of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, with a view to ascertaining whether there is any justification whatever for increasing the duty of 15 per cent, which was levied under the old Tariff. That section of the Commission recommend the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, upon flannels and of 15 per cent, upon other woollens. From reading their report, I know that they were satisfied that in making that recommendation they were extending ample protection to our local manufacturers. The whole of the disabilities under which the manufacturers, themselves alleged that they were labouring did not represent a difference between the cost of production of more than 12 per cent. In speaking of the woollen industry before Federation, the B section of the Tariff Commission sayThe Victorian witnesses were positive in their assertion that the woollen manufacturers of that State could not carry on without higher duties. They had enjoyed for the greater part of their pie-Federation experience a higher duty than the present Commonwealth Tariff. But it was also admitted that the history of the trade during that oeriod "" had not been particularly encouraging,"" most of the mills having had to be reMr Johnson. constructed at one time or another, while some had gone out of existence -(Grainger , Q. 10460.) The latter misfortunes had occurred under a high State Tariff. At that time, however, the industry had been carried on ""without that dash which now characterizes it.""-(Grainger , Q.10720-2.) It was further admitted that the result of the inquiry of the Victorian Tariff Commission of 1895 had been a reduction of the duty, and the object of that-declare d the witness-""wa s to give us (the manufacturers) notice that in process of time we should have no duty at all.""-(Grainger , Q.10714-5.) A witness produced extracts from the published statistics of Victoria, which showed that the high duties in this State had absolutely failed to increase employment in the woollen mills (Hirsch, Q.12858.) As a matter of fact, it was contended by a great many witnesses that the effect of the operation of high duties in Victoria had been to greatly discourage the woollen industry. In passing, I may mention that in New South Wales the industry had been carried on successfully without the aid of any protective duty. I propose now to quote some figures showing the duty upon woollens, and the number of hands employed in the industry in Victoria during specified years. I find that' in 1878 there was a duty of 11 per cent, upon these goods, and that the number of hands employed was 736. In 1881 the duty was i 6 \ per cent., and the number of hands employed was 776. It will be seen, therefore, that the number of operatives did not increase proportionately to the increase of duty. In 1886 the duty operative was 22 per cent., and the number of hands employed was only 780. In 1887 the duty was still 22 per cent., and the number of hands had declined to 704. In 1888, with the duty unchanged, the number of hands employed was 784. In 1889 the duty was 33 per cent., and the hands employed numbered 841. In 1890 and 1891 the same rate was still operative, and the number of hands employed was 810 and 791 respectively. From 1892 to 1895 the duty levied was 44 per cent., and yet the number of hands employed declined from 791 in 1891 to 690 'in 1895. In 1899 the duty ranged from i 6 | to 27J per cent, and the hands employed numbered 917. In 1903 the duty imposed was 16J per cent., and the number of hands employed was 1,013. It will thus be seen that as the duties were lowered, the number of hands employed in the industry increased, and vice versa. These figures clearly demonstrate that the effect of high duties was to discourage the industry. It cannot be urged by honourable members that in the years I have quoted special circumstances militated against the normal conditions. The report continuesThis witness also referred to an investigation made by what is generally known as the Sweating Board of Victoria- a Committee of the Legislative Assembly, which some years ago investigated the condition of the sweated industries. The report of this body distinctly - states that the evidence submitted was largely to the effect that, owing to the high duty on woollens, the clothing industry had materially suffered. Notwithstanding that report we are asked to grant an increased dutyThe woollen manufacturing industry of New South Wales had existed previous to Federation practically with no protection, and, though it gave employment to fewer hands and less capital than that of Victoria, it appears to have got along much better. We have evidence that since Federation a high condition of prosperity has obtained in the woollen industry; that the mills have been running full time; that orders have been given which they have not been able to fulfil, and that these have accumulated to such an extent as to necessitate considerable importations. It cannot be expected that those who are unable to obtain supplies from local manufacturers should refuse to import goods to enable them to carry on their business. nexion with this aspect of the matter, we should be fair to each side. have, at page 14 r, the statement that witness named Graingerwas asked if the position of the woollen industry was correctly represented in Mr Ord's report for 1003, as follows :- "" I have again to that the woollen trade industry has been tionally busy during the whole of the past an average of 300 workers having been conjectionable, stantly employed in one of the mills. In my well as imported. last ""report I mentioned that additional machinery had been ordered from England. complete set of carding, combing, spinning, winding plant has been added during the year, together with new machinery, throughout various departments of the mill, and the business is extending to the other States, clearly showing that there is an increasing demand for woollens of colonial manufacture."" The witness admitted that this extract correctly represented the position -(Grainger , Q. 10762.) The witness, when asked what 'dividends his company paid, attempted to mislead the Commission by statins that it worked out at 7^ per cent, on the total subscribed capital of ,£60,000. sheets of the company, with which the witness was confronted by a Commissioner, showed that the capital of the .company was ^30,000, upon which 15 per cent, dividends had been paid for several years. It will thus be seen that one interested manufacturer went so far in his desire to obtain the imposition of an exorbitant duty [203]-2 . as a further protection to his industry as to endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of the Commissioners.",37
244,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The company had paid a dividend of 15 per cent.,39
245,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The balance-sheets showed that they had done so. This is only one of many instances in which we hear of manufacturers either refusing allow their books to be opened for inspection so that a fair idea of their profits and expenses might be obtained, or else trying to mislead others by false statements as to their actual working expenses and profits.",39
246,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Does the honourable member apply that remark to all the manufacturers ?,39
247,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I do not. It would be very unfair for. me even to insinuate that, all manufacturers are guilty of this practice. Those who advocate the policy of protection are generally'disposed to regard all importers as thieves and rogues, but I do not take 'up the same attitude in regard to manufacturers or my protectionist friends.",39
248,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Are there not some bad importers ?,39
249,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I have not said that In conthere are not; I merely urge that we If we made a an investigation, however. I believe that we should find that the balance of honesty rests on the side of the importers. One of the reasons advanced in support of the report proposed increased protection is that we excepmust protect the home market against imyear, ported shoddy. Shoddv is at all times obbut it is produced locally as The w'hole of our A manufacturers are not entirely guiltless of and its production. Here, again, I ciuote from the report of the free-trade section of the the Tariff Commission a corroboration of my statement. At page 147 it is stated thatOf the samples of Australian flannel, 4q in number, 40, or 81 per cent., contained cotton, the proportion running from 0.3 to 87.1. The Australian flannels are classified as obtained (a) in Victoria, and (b) in New South Wales. Of 39 Victorian flannels (a) 2 were all wool, and out of 10 New South Wales (i ) 4 were pure The balance- wool. In another paragraph on the same page, we have the statementWhile it was generally declared by the manufacturers ""that they had been compelled to introduce cotton into their woollen goods in order to compete with similar adulteration of imported fabrics, one New South Wales manufacturer stated that his trade in flannels had been killed through the introduction into that State of inferior goods from oversea and also from Victoria. Here was aNew South Wales manufacturer complaining of shoddy, which had been supplied to him from Victoria"" The Victorian flannel It had less yarns to the inch than our flannel, but the face was all ' gigged up' to look nice and woolly. It was quite as good in appearance as our own flannel, and no doubt, owing to the use of a certain amount of cotton in the manufacture, it could be sold at a lower price.""(Blackman, Q.27228.) Flannel was coming into New South Wales from Victoria at 6£d. per yard ; it was really no good. It had no virtue as flannel -(Blackman , Q.27233.) Internal competition in Victoria was also responsible for bringing down quality and price in that State (Harrison, Q. 12495-6.) When we hear of complaints in connection with this industry as to the importation of shoddy, we must not forget that in and around Melbourne-in this centre of protected manufacturers-jus t as much shoddy can be produced when the opportunity offers as we are likely to import. have here an application of the old adage that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.",39
250,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,There is some shoddy made in New South Wales also.,40
251,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"There is no evidence to that effect; the evidence is all the other way. Out of ten samples submitted from New South Wales, four were pure wool, while of thirty-six samples of Victorian flannels, only two were all wool. It will be observed that in the case of the Victorian flannels it does not say that the two samples were of pure wool, so that it may have been wool of the most inferior quality. Furthermore, it was stated that the use of cotton as a mixture with wool is confined to Victoria. In 1903-the total - importation into the Commonwealth of raw cotton amounted to 464,964 lbs., of which 417,609 lbs. came direct to Victoria, and .176,453 Ibs. were transferred to that State from other States. It will be seen that practically the w'hole of this raw cotton came to Victoria, and, according to the Victorian Year-Book for 1903, the mills of the State in 1899 used 154,388 lbs., which had increased by 1903 to 368,749 lbs. All these figures bear out the statement that the use of cotton in the production of woollen goods in Australia is confined to Victoria. There is much more of great interest in the report, though it is too lengthy for me to quote. I think I have said sufficient to show that if shoddy materials are imported, similar materials are made in Victoria under the stimulus of a highly protective Tariff. The alleged disabilities under which manufacturers labour in Victoria are dealt with in a striking' paragraph in the report. On page 150 we are was of good appearance - toldThe total disability of the Australian woollen manufacturer compared with his British competitor, is, therefore, on these findings, not more than 2 per cent, on equipment and 10 per cent, in labour, or a total of 12 per cent, .on the value of the product. As against this the British manufacturer who competes in Australia pays 15 per cent, duty and from 7£ to 12^ per cent, charges, or a minimum total of 22^ per cent, on his goods, and this without taking into consideration an average increase in the cost of Australian wool, delivered at the mill in England, of 16J per cent. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission clearly shows that there is really not a farthing of duty required-that the charges to which manufacturers outside Australia are subjected amount to a great We deal more than is necessary to give ample natural protection to. the local manufacturer.",40
252,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What does the protectionist section of the Commission say ?,40
253,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,-The reason that the free-trade section reported as they did was that the protectionist section suppressed or slurred over the facts so as to give a wrong impression.,40
254,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is a great reflection on the protectionist section of the Commission.,40
255,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is not a.reflection made by me, but it is a direct charge contained in the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, who felt it necessary under the circumstances to re-state the case, and submit a complete separate report, so that Parliament might not be misled. Without a doubt, this industry Was successfully carried on in New South Wales, and could be carried on today, without a duty; and I do not know that the manufacturers of that State are asking for any more protection. I feel certain that some of the New South Wales manufacturers do not desire more protection; and I am still more certain that the Tasmanian manufacturers do not.",40
256,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is not correct.,40
257,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The honourable member for Denison, if he were here, would confirm my statements; because he has shown me letters from which it appears that the Tasmanian mills have so many orders that they are running to their fullest capacity. I saw one letter in which it was .stated distinctly that no further protection was desired by Tasmanian manufacturers.",40
258,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I have a letter here to the opposite effect.,41
259,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"In any case, . the manufacturers are not unanimous in their demand for any higher protection. The highest asked for by the most greedy when before the Tariff Commission was 25 per - cent, but the Government have put the - duty up to 30 per cent. duty proposed is prohibitive of all but the cheaper classes of woollen-cotton blankets, which, I may say, are not produced here. There is a blanket called the Union blanket, made of wool and cotton, invoiced - as low as 6|d. per lb., whereas colonial Union blankets are, at least,' is. sd. per lb. As to the cost of production, I find, from the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, that, in the case of flannel - blankets, it has largely decreased since 1899. Mr Hogarth, a witness, saidFive or six years ago I imported some machinery, and there was a saving of two and a half limes in the labour in weaving. This probably accounts for the substitution of flannels and blankets for tweed and worsted in many of the local mills. The same substitution is affirmed by Mr. Grainger, a witness, who said that it largely took place between the years 1899 and 1901, under the Victorian Tariff. With regard to the industry itself, there is evidence throughout the whole of the Commonwealth - and I have made personal inquiries from people connected with the trade-that the mills are running to their full capacity, and are really choked with orders. It is significant that a number of the mills are refusing orders, and in some cases absolutely ignoring them. In this connection, the following Melbourne newspaper extract may be of interestA large Melbourne firm wrote to a Hobart manufacturer with whom it had previously done no business, asking to be supplied with a quantity of flannel. Under ordinary circumstances a manufacturer would only be too anxious to seize the chance of doing new business, particularly - as it was made dear to him that the firm paid cash for goods supplied. He replied that he was so full of orders from his regular customers that he could "" not accept any new business."" The same Melbourne firm wrote to another Hobart manufacturer asking for goods, and received no reply. The manufacturers know that we pay cash, and that it is good business, yet they are in this extraordinary position that they are unable to pick up several thousands of pounds waiting for them here. What the total arrears to all distributing houses is I do not know, but, judging by the quantity of stuff due to us, it must represent an enormous sum. This is the beginning of the light summer trade, and supplies show a tremendous shortage. We are at the mercy of the Australian manufacturers. The goods are popular, and I must say of excellent quality. When the tariff increased the duty ""from 15 to 30 per cent. I had to cable countermanding an order placed in England, because we would have lost seriously on it. This rhakes us all the more dependent on the Australian manufacturers. Of course, the inevitable ultiThe high mate result of the stoppage of importations and the under-production and increasing demand finally will be a rise in price.",41
260,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Perhaps the manufacturer did not receive the order.,41
261,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The strong probability is that the order was received, but that the manufacturer did not desire to be bothered with it. The mills of Castlemaine and Geelong are in exactly the same position. One manufacturer wrote to a large customer stating that he was full of orders for the 1908 season, a year ahead; and I may say that that letter was written before the increased duty came into operation.",41
262,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,41
263,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The argument that an unreasoning public prefers the imported to the locally manufactured article cannot be used in this case, it being admitted that the latter is of high quality, and that the warehousemen would be willing to take it to the exclusion of the former, if they could get enough of it ; but, not being able to do so, have, in order to keep faith with their customers, to obtain additional, supplies elsewhere. There is no justification for any duty at all in connection with the articles comprised in this item, which we manufacture to such an extent that we cannot keep up with the demand. But for the futility of making the proposal in an assembly like this, I would move to strike out the duty altogether. As I have no hope of carrying such an amendment, I intend to move to reduce the duty on the general Tariff from 30 to 20 per cent., a protection which will be 8 per cent, more than the disabilities asserted by the most rabid manufacturers, surely a sufficient margin. Later, I intend to move to reduce the duty against the United Kingdom to 15 .per cent., which is the old rate. Seeing that we are giving our manufacturers the advantage of these high duties, tinder which they will have practically a monopoly of the local market, we should make sure that the articles which' they sell to the public shall be what they are represented to be. Therefore, all locally made goods should be compulsorily labelled or marked with a trade description which would enable the public to know exactly what they were buying. This might well be made a feature of the new protection to which honourable members opposite are so fond of referring. I think that the arguments which I have adduced, the evidence which I have quoted, and the facts which I have brought forward, prove conclusively that it is unnecessary to increase the duty. I move That the words "" and on and after 8th November, 1907 (General Tariff), 20 per cent.,"" be added.  derstand that domett is an article made of cotton, which should not be in this item, but should be classed as a flannelette.

264,Mr JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Lang) \7.56] - At the beginning of my speech, I pointed out to the Minister that domett is. largely composed of cotton, but he objected .to any amendment in connection with it.

272,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Franklin) [8.0] There is one way in which we can-help Australian woollen manufacturers very much better than by imposing an inordinately high duty upon woollen goods. There can be no doubt that some of the difficulties experienced by our woollen' mills have been due to the fact that they have not sup-. plied the public with a pure article. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and the analyses of various samples which were submitted to that body, show that unless steps are taken to compel our woollen manufacturers to use pure wool instead of wool with an inordinately high' percentage of cotton,, our mills will never be a success. Personally I should like to compel them to mark upon every auricle that they turn out its exact constituents. . We can deal! with the imported article under the provisions of the Commerce Act. But if we are going to extend a higher measure of protection to our woollenmanufacturers and to compel them to pay reasonable wages to their employees, it is our duty to protect the indi^ vidual who is producing an honest article as against the manufacturer of shoddy. Only the other day I visited the largest millowner in Tasmania, and had a conversation honourable with him in reference to the duty on woollens. He informed me that he was quite prepared to continue operations under the old rate so long as we. compelled every manufacturer to disclose the quantity of wool contained in each article that he produces. He declared that if steps were not taken to enforce the use of pure wool, he would either have to lower the standatd of the article which he produces, or to cease business altogether. We know from the testimony of the manufacturers themselves that some mills have practically ruined their businesses by reason of the fact that they have produced an. inferior airticle..",42

I agree with contention of the honourable member for Darling, and will practically meet it by the amendment I have just indicated.",43
283,Mr SPENCE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What about the factories who have booked orders up to 1908? Many Of them cannot supply the present demand. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - There is no reason why we should not make all the blankets that we require.,44
284,Mr SPENCE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"But there are, firms which Cannot be supplied by the local factories.",44
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Surely if we give local manufacturers nearly the whole of the home market, we shall find in our midst people ready to invest their capital in an Australian venture. I have read the evidence given before the Tariff Commission as to the quality of Australian blankets, but an incident which occurred whilst I was Premier of New South Wales may be of interest to honourable members. Complaint was made that the Government of New South Wales was using imported blankets, and I obtained from Mr MCLean, I think, who was then Premier of Victoria, samples of some of the Victorian blankets that were being used in Government institutions in this State. We found that one Victorian blanket wafe worth nearly two of the imported blankets which we were using. Although the Tariff Commission obtained evidence which rather told against the Victorian blankets, I know perfectly well that the samples which we received from this State were much superior to blankets that were being imported at that time. I presume that the position is still the same.",44
286,Mr SPENCE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"But I am assured by one of the biggest firms in New South Wales that, although they are prepared to pay their price, they cannot get supplies this year from the local mills. Sir WILLIAM LYNE!-Eve n if that be so, it does not justify the contention that we should reduce the duty in order to allow importations to come in more freely. Whilst importations of blankets are not increasing, there has been no material decrease. In 1904, ,£57,720 worth - were imported; in 1905, £57,899 worth; and in i9 > £53>5° worth. o6 6",44

289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Very likely there are some manufacturers who do not wish to have further competition. If we impose this duty, competition is sure to be increased, and we shall probably be in a position to make all the blankets that we require.

He told the Treasurer that he had been a consistent supporter of the Government, but was not disposed to vote for this duty, of 30 per cent.. until some reason for the increase had been given. The Treasurer, in reply, said that the matter could be explained in a few words. I appeal to the Committee to say whether he. showed any justification for increasing the duty of 15 per cent, under the old Tariff to 30 per cent, as now proposed.

296,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I know that the Minister has the numbers behind him, but I am going to put before the Committee one or two ""facts which the honourable gentleman may answer if he can. Even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of only 25 per cent. That was the extreme request made on betialf of the woollen manufacturers of Victoria in a document dealing with the capital invested, interest and depreciation, capital unemployed, and wages and excessive competition, which was signed by. C. E . Grainger, manager of the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company Limited ; G. Hirst, managing partner of G.

Hooper, chairman of the Australian Woollen Company Limited. As a matter of fact, no justification has been given for increasing the duty even to 25 per cent. All the big warehousemen say that our woollen mills are unable to supply them with the blankets required for the population of Australia. Some of the mills will not book orders for twelve months ahead. What was the evidence given by Mr Hogarth, a well-known Tasmanian manufacturer engaged in the production of blankets ?",45
297,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,And a very stiff protectionist.,45
298,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,He is not.,45
299,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Tasmanian manufacturers were doing so well that they refused to join with the woollen manufacturers on the mainland, who asked for a general Tariff of 25 per cent. They did not ask for more than 20 per cent.

It however, readily admitted that the Tasmanian woollen industry had profited by Federation. had - given the manufacturers of that State a than in any other.

300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,In spite of that evidence the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent.,45
301,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That was the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Commission. I must object once more to the report of one section being referred to as the report of the Commission.,45
302,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The Treasurer will not even adhere to the recommendation of the protectionist section.,45
303,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is so. Mr. Hogarth, when before the Commission, was examined as follows :Has your trade been increasing or stationary since the Federal Tariff has been in operation? - It has been stationary this last two years. There had been a gradual increase after the 20 per cent. State duty had been put on. We doubled ourselves in seven or eight years. Do I understand you to say that you are not progressing because the duty is not sufficiently high?- I won't say that. How are you stationary ?-We cannot go on increasing for ever. Is your output up to the full capacity of your mills?-Yes ; we cannot do another bit. That is the position of many of the mills in Australia today. They are working up to their full capacity, and are unable to fulfil many of the orders sent to them. Reference has been made to the desirableness of so marking goods as to ' indicate their constituent parts. I should like to draw the attention of honourable members to the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission on this itemFinally, we summarize the conditions under which, in our opinion, the woollen manufacture would progress rapidly towards that importance which it ought to occupy among Australian industries :1. Compulsory indelible marking on every article or yard of so-called woollen fabric, whether imported or manufactured locally, its proportion of purity or adulteration. The great reason that led us to make that recommendation was the adulteration in connection with the manufacture of flannels, more particularly in Victoria.",45
304,Mr COON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Poo r old Victoria !,45
305,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I should like to see Vicper toria flourish and prosper, along with every was, other part of the Commonwealth; but the analyses which were made show that adul' It teration was more prevalent in that State Our opinion was that the first analysis was not carried out in a satisfactory way, and,f in order to make absolutely certain, we had a second analysis under conditions at which no one could cavil. We found, as a result, that there was more adulteration in the case of Victorian flannels than in the case of any imported flannels.",45
306,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The Commission could not get imported flannels for investigation. The flannels were refused by the Flinderslane people.,46
307,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Importe d flannel was obtained.,46
308,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"And special directions were given, to the exDerts to get the worse examples of imported flannels.",46
309,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"What the honourable member for Perth says is absolutely correct; and the statistics in regard to the consumption of. raw cotton show that it was in Victoria that the adulteration mainly took place, nearly the whole of the imported cotton being consumed in. that State.",46
310,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Mr Moore, of South Australia, said that he would not use any cotton in his manufacture.",46
311,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is so. It was in consequence of the extensive adulteration that we made the suggestion for. the compulsory indelible marking of goods; and I trust the Government will see the advisability of acting on that recommendation, so that the people may know what they are buying, and get value for their money. So far from there being an increase in the importation of blankets and blanketing, there has been a very large decrease. From the statistics submitted to us, I find that £1.11,624 worth of blankets and blanketting was imported in 1899; £134?233 in * 9 ° ° ; - £ * . 3 9 9 hi 9 J and £ 1 1 4 , 5 0 3 22 I 0 1 in 1902. From 190? to 1906 the value of .these imports dropped from ,£70,000 to ,,£53,506, the latter being the lowest figure in the period with which I have dealt. When we find Australian manufacturers unable to fulfil the orders they receive, and when importation has decreased to such a large extent, what justification is there for the proposed heavy increase in the duty? The Treasurer has .talked a great deal about preference to the Old Country, and his great desire to help its manufacturers; but, as a matter of fact, it is from the Old Country that our imported blankets come, and ihere is now a deliberate attempt, without any justification whatever, to prohibit their entry into this country. Considering all that has been done for. us by the Mother Country, and what she is doing for us at present, the time has not arrived ink the history of this young Commonwealth when prohibitive duties should be raised against British, manufactures. We have been told of the position which. Australian manufacturers occupy as compared with the manufacturers of the Old. Country; and it was urged very strenuously by some of the witnesses before the Commission that they were unfavorably placed in regard to the purchase of the raw material. But if honourable memberstake the trouble to read the evidence they will find that, so far from our manufacturers being in a comparatively bad position, they are in a much better position! than that occupied by the British manufacturer. The Australian woollen manufacturer can go into the wool market almost at any time of the year, »and buy what he requires, whereas the British manufacturer has to pay insurance, freight and other charges on the wool to England, and similar charges, together with the duty, - when he desires to get his finished product into the Australian market. It was admitted by protectionist witnesses, that there is a very large measure of natural protection in favour of the' Australian manufacturer. The duty under the old. Tariff was 15 per cent., but, as a matter of fact, when all charges are taker* into consideration, it amounted to 40 per cent., and in some cases to over that rate. An industry which cannot progress under protection amounting to 40 per cent, is, iir my opinion, an industry not worth bothering about. . I am as anxious as any one to see our woollen industry progress and! prosper, and I am looking forward to thetime when we shall be large. exporters;: but my opinion is that the old duty is; quite sufficient to develop the industry. InNew South Wales, long before there was: Federation and protection, there were woollen mills at Marrickville, on the Blue Mountains, and at Parramatta.",46
312,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Were - those mills not largely retail tailoring shops?,46
313,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"If the honourable member will take the trouble to visit the millshe will find that, in regard to plant and every other requirement, they are quite as; much up to date as any mills in Victoria.",46
314,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Quite so, but was it notpossible for any one to buy a suit of clothes at the Parramatta Mills?",46
315,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"All I can say is that the mills in New South Wales were, at the time. I speak of, manufacturing as high a class of tweed as is turned out in any otlier of the Australiari mills; and so far as blankets are concerned, I agree with the Treasurer that none superior are made in any part of the world. It was further stated that Australian manufacturers labour under a disability in connection with the greater initial outlay on buildings and plant. But one reason for the greater outlay on plant is the high protective duty on the machinery required. This is the old story that the duty which protects one industry penalizes another; and I submit that if the whole of the duties were removed, and the woollen manufacturers enabled to obtain their machinery duty free, they would require no protection. industry was carried on under such conditions in New South Wales years ago; and the whole of the evidence tends to show that, with free ports, the woollen industry of Australia would live and prosper. One advantage which the English manufacturer has over his Australian brother is that he can get his machinery at a cheaper rate. There was also a further contention that the Australian manufacturers are handicapped by higher wages and shorter hours than prevail in other parts of the world. The protectionist section of the Commission did not seem to trouble themselves about the labour cost, although, in my opinion, that is the principal consideration when we are dealing with protective duties. We must remember that some years ago, when we were told so much about the strangled industries of Victoria, the great argument was that our artisans had to work against the low-paid artisans of other countries. But the Commission found, after a thorough investigation, that a duty of 10 per cent, would more than cover the whole of the alleged disability in this connection. The circumstances certainly do not justify the duty proposed by the Government. Much was also said about local prejudice; - but any prejudice there may have been seems to be fast disappearing, in view of the fact that only the other night we had the Treasurer boasting that he was wearing a suit of Australian tweed. As a matter of fact, right through the Commonwealth there is such a demand for Australian tweed that it is impossible for the manufacturers to supply it . What is there in the allegations as to prejudice, the greater outlay of capital required, the shorter hours and the higher rates of wages, the local prejudice, and unfair competition, to warrant the proposals of the Government? I sincerely trust that the Committee will vote for the old rate, under which our manufacturers have prospered and flourished to such an extent that today they are unable to fill orders. *",46
316,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Corio) [8.47] - The honourable member for Illawarra has told the Committee that the Australian woollen mills are so busy that the local warehousemen are unable to get their orders filled. Let me read a letter which is a sample of the orders given by the local warehousemen and importersSydney, n t h May, 1907. The Messrs. Gaunt and Co., Williamstown, Victoria. Dear Sirs, We would be glad if you will submit samples of flannels for indent to arrive about January ist, 1908. The lines we require are blues, greys, heather, navy, and white; and if you can do a special low line at about 5 f d. we desire to place orders for same. As these goods show a very large sale with us, we will be glad if you will let us have samples asked for, at your very earliest. Yours faithfully, PETERSEN, BOESEN AND Co. LTD . , Per Arthur Boesen.",47
317,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is not an order; it is merely a letter asking a question.,47
318,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The reply sent was that the material which they wished to buy at 5 f d . was worth 7^d.,' and thereupon the importers declared that they would send to England for it . This is one of the firms which have been complaining that the Australian mills are so jammed with work that thej' cannot meet their orders. The right honourable member for East Sydney, who appointed the Tariff Commission, designedly put upon it only one protectionist and two free-trade members of the House of Representatives, and, unfortunately, the former is absent frorn. this discussion.",47
319,Mr WILSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is very unfair to say that that was done designedly. Mr CROUCH.'-In support ofmy statement, I need only refer to a debate which took place after the appointment, in which the right honourable member promised an opportunity for its discussion, which in the long run was not given. The honourable member for Illawarra founded his speech on the basic principles of free trade. He said that if the woollen manufacturers were not interfered with, they would not. want protection. Let us consider what is meant by such non-interference. The honourable member for Parkes, a consistent free-trader, shows in his book that free-trade is more than a mere fiscal belief. The free-trader does not want to be interfered with by any humanitarian legislation. The free-trade manufacturer does not want to be interfered with by Arbitration Acts and Wages Boards, under the operation of which wages in Australia are 50 per cent, higher than they are in Yorkshire.",47
320,Mr HEDGES,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,At Geelong they are on strike for a wage of 17s. 6d. per week.,48
321,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is quite an inaccurate statement. The wages of weavers and other workers in the mills have been fixed in Victoria by a Wages Board, and although the probability is that they will be increased because there is to be a new Wages .Board, at the present time, while the average wage in Hbddersfield for thirty picks is 8s. 6d., in Australia it is 16s. 6 d . ; for forty picks it is n s . in Huddersfield, and in Australia 21s. o d . ; while we pay 26s. 3d. against 13s. 6d. paid in England, and 31s. 3d. against 16s.",48
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The Yorkshire width Is greater than the Australian width.,48
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Will the honourable member for Corio say that mill hands here earn twice as much as is earned by mill hands in the United Kingdom?,48
324,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Anothe r form of interference, to which perhaps the honourable member for Illawarra as a free-trader objects, is that which compels manufacturers here to be satisfied with a week of fortyeiuht hours, whereas in Yorkshire a week of fifty-six and a half hours is regarded as ordinary. The honourable member said that the Parramatta mills prospered without the protection of a duty.",48
325,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,They did not prosper ; they .had to reconstruct.,48
326,Mr FULLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Some of the' Victorian mills had to reconstruct, notwithstanding a protective duty of 40 per cent. Mt.

330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Why had the Footscray mills to close?,48
331,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It may be that they were not protected by a sufficiently high duty. In this matter I am a prohibitionist. We shall not be satisfied until we get proper duties. Some honourable members who> were returned as protectionists are tiddlywinking with the Tariff, by voting for compromises. In doing so, they are only postponing the evil day.",48

If we go on whittling down duties, there will be another fiscal fight at the next election, and the majority pledged to vote solidly for protection will be increased.",48

Do I understand the honourable member wants to challenge me in my constituency ? Undoubtedly, I speak for my own constituency, which is a sane one.'",48

343,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"We should impose nrates of duty which will settle the fiscal question for a long time to come. In China there are what are called "" rice Christians ""-person s who become converts to Christianity because of the rice which my they can obtain from the missionaries. There are members of this Committee who are rice protectionists. They are protectionists only for the purpose of securing seats in this House. They are free-traders at heart, free-traders by conviction, and free-traders when they come to deal with a protective Tariff. They wish to whittle clown the duties upon woollens among other duties.",48

If there is one duty good in this Tariff which ought to partake of a protective character it is the duty upon woollens. How did England build up her pattern. woollen industry? Was it not because she produced the best sheep in the worldas Australia is doing now-and because her far-sighted monarch, Queen Eliazbeth, absolutely prohibited the importation of woollens? Those persons who constantly quote England as the great exemplar the matter of free-trade overlook the fact that it was only after she had built up her industries as the result of 240 years absolute prohibition that she was able throw her ports open to the world.",49

359,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I was not present at the in time, but I do not think the Treasurer's statement is correct. I do not believe that the honourable member for Lang could speak upon this item for two hours. But I rose of for the purpose of mentioning something to which occurred in New South Wales before blankets were manufactured there. The name of Mr Vicars has been mentioned in this debate as that of a gentleman who has a first-rate tweed and blanket factory at Sydney. When I was Prewarmier of New South Wales-ther e was no duty upon blankets then- Mr Vicars interviewed me, and informed me that if I would give him a five-years' contract for the supply of blankets to the Government, he would erect a plant and enter upon the manufacture of blankets straight away.",49
360,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Would not that have been a form of protection ?,49
361,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"A five-years' contract withMay I remind the honourable member that I put that contract up for tender between Mr Vicars and the importers. I called for tenders, which were open to the whole world. Mr Vicars competed, and his quotation was within a very small figure of the competition of the world. H is blankets, too, were of a superior quality, and actually constituted a better bargain, so far as the Government were concerned, than did the imported article. He beat the importers in the open market. I do not wish to prolong the debate, and I merely mention this fact to show that there is no necessity for the imposition of a high duty upon blankets. Mr. Vicars, I believe, is now manufacturing these articles in a very considerable way. Mr HANS IRVINE [9.10] - I should like to make a few remarks in support of the amendment of the honourable member for Lang.",49

363,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,And a good one.,50
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The member ought not to call himself a protectionist again.,50
365,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"If the Treasurer were possessed of a commercial and manufacturing experience, he would not propose a prohibitive Tariff. It would be interesting to hear his definition of fair and reasonable protection, but this explanation is withheld. I have heard some honourable members who possess no practical commercial knowledge speak upon this item. They are professional men, who can view the subject only through parochial glasses. I would remind the Committee that we are not yet a self-contained people, and we cannot afford to levy such a high duty upon blankets' as the Government propose. now I heard some one compare the attack of the honourable member for Corio upon the honourable member for Parramatta to the attack of a mosquito upon an elephant. I prefer to liken the honourable member to an infant in swaddling clothes attempting to run before it - can walk. Until we are a self-contained community we cannot afford to impose prohibitive duties. The working man will be called upon to bear the largest portion of our Customs taxation, particularly in connection with imposts upon blankets or textiles in any form. Earlier in the evening I asked the Treasurer if he would agree to accept a duty of 25 per cent, under the general Tariff",50
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I have not turned a free-trader yet.,50
367,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I would remind the honourable gentleman that 25 per cent, is 10 per cent, in excess of the rate which was levied under the old Tariff. We know very well that the manufacturers themselves have not asked for a higher duty than 25 per cent. What has the Treasurer to p»v to that? Seeing that we appointed an intelligent body of men to take evidence upon this question, surely we ought to pay some regard to their recommendations?",50
368,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The honourable member does not always stand by the recommendations of the Commission ,50
369,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I should be very (Grampians) sorry to stand by all the recommendations of the honourable member, when he talks in favour of prohibitive protection. Those who have travelled the world know what a another prohibitive Tariff means in America. I want to protect the workers, as well as the manufacturers, of Australia, but I do not wish to destroy the confidence of capitalists. honourable Surely the fact that we produce the finest wool in the world is in itself equivalent to a very large measure of protection. I say that when we are asked to support a duty in excess of 25 per cent, we are invited to levy a prohibitive impost. In addition to that, the duty proposed would haye the effect of strangling competition, and we require healthy competition to teach us to improve our manufactures. I desire to see the woollen industry placed upon sound commercial lines, and, therefore, I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lang. I am sure that it would commend itself to the country generally. The Government proposal means that in the future we shall sacrifice more revenue. Just Siir WILLIAM LYNE - Thait is a free trade argument. r",50
370,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Not only will it involve us in a loss of revenue, but it will destroy the confidence of capitalists, because sooner of later we must impose an Excise upon all the industries which it is proposed to protect. An army of Excise officers will then be created', That, I suppose, will be the character of the new protection policy that the Government intend to propose. I hope that it will not be so, but it is just such a proposal as would be likely to emanate from the Government side of the House.",50
371,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The honourable member will never see it .,50
372,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I hope not. It would certainly, mean the strangling of industries. The honourable member for Wide Bay and his followers would like such a proposal to be made, and in this connection I class the Treasurer as the leader of the Labour Party because he is playing into their hands. He is destroy ing the confidence of capital and is. doing no good to the country by proposing prohibitive duties. The honourable member will not even explain to the Committee what he regards as fair protection; but puts forward prohibitive protectionist prosense posals that are detrimental to the progress of our own industries. They will mean over-production in Australia. We cannot at present compete against England and the rest of the world in the manufacture of blankets, but surely we should be able to do so with duties of 20 and 25 per The Government proposal, if carried, .will just done. mean over-production and a consequent falling away in quality, .by which the upon this item. working man will suffer. I ask Treasurer to accept the amendment, and thing of the kind. regard the Government proposition as prothe hibitive. I am prepared to support the recommendation of the Tariff Commission with a preference to Great Britain. We wish to give a genuine, and not a bogus, preference to the Old Country.

The arguments which he used were freetectionist, trade and anti-Australian. I am surprised that a constituency should be so gulled as to return to this House a representative who is ready so soon after his election turn his coat. If will not be my fault if , at the next general election, stituents do not learn what manner of man he is. If there was one question more than another that was brought prominently before the people at the last general election, it was the desirableness of passing truly protectionist Tariff. The honourable member says that I am not prepared to explain what I regard as protection. He orable member. has only to turn to the Tariff to find an. answer; he will see there an answer to every attack and every slur sought be cast upon me. Unlike the honourable member, I am not a shandygaff protectionist. I am sorry that he is not as good a protectionist as his wine is good. He said that he would support a protectionist policy. Does he know that the protection Ave propose is absolutely low as compared with that which prevails in the United States of America?

Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - After this, I expect nothing fromi the honourable member. The ripht honourable member for East S' - cine v said that Mr Vicars years and vears ago tendered very closely to the importers' prices. Let me read a few words from Mr. Vicars' evidence before the Tariff ComI n passing, I should like and to say that I do not think the honourable member for Illawarra was quite fair in reading only the evidence given on one side of this question. What did Mr Vicars sa y ?Our firm, John Vicars and Co., commenced business in Sydney upwards of thirty years ago in a four-set mill. We have only increased to six sets, and this I believe is the greatest expansion of any surviving mill. Practically there has been no protection here; certainly, on a couple of occasions we have had a light duty, but even then only for a limited period. In earlier times the mills depended entirely on what was known as "" colonial tweeds,"" a good honest cloth, and made a name and trade for it ; but this was smothered about fifteen years ago by the importation of a shoddy imitation. After ""that it was a case of making cloth at a price, eliminating quality altogether. For many years past, and even today, the mill's are existing only on a fringe of the trade, depending on Government contracts and odd lines that warehouses may be short of and have not time lo replace from Home centres. I know that that is true. The Parramatta Woollen Mills absolutely had to succumb some little time ago; but it is quite true, as the honourable member for Corio has said, that they had in Sydney a factory where they made up clothing for distribution among the retail houses. I visited the factory many times, and am able to say that it was by taking this step that the company improved its position.",51
378,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Why should they not make up clothincr?,52
379,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I do not say that they should not do so; I referred to the matter only because the statement that the Parramatta Mills had made up clothing was denied. I believe that the position of the company at present is improving, but up to the last twelve months it was not doing too well. This is my answer to those who pay that the woollen mills are doing well, and I appeal strongly to honourable memlx:rs to support the Government proposition.",52
380,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Wimmera) [9.27] - I do not think that the Treasurer can accuse me of voting generallv in the direction of very low duties. Last night I voted for what I considered to be a proper duty on woollen clothing, and intend what I believe to be a reasonable duty on blankets, as well as on cotton piece goods. I have not arrived at this decision at last moment. I have carefully considered the matter, just as I have endeavoured consider every other item in the Tariff. have been guided by the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission. The protectionist section of the Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent., and I am prepared to agree to such a duty, with a preference of 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. The protectionist section of the Commission reportedThat under the operation of a 15 per cent. Tariff the importation of woollen goods into Australia has increased, and is still increasing; that it should be diminished; that there has been a decline in the local manufacture of cloth and tweed goods, that such decline is not compensated by any. increase in the output of blankets and flannels, seeing that £1,000 worth of wool turned into tweeds and serges yields a finished article worth ,£4,000, whilst a similar quantity of wool converted into blankets yields a finished article worth only about ,£1,500."" It is because there is not anything like the same degree of labour involved in the manufacture of blankets that I consider the industry can be carried on with a lower duty.",52
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Parramatta) [9.29] - I wish to explain an interjection made by me in respect to the Parramatta Mills. The statement made by the Treasurer that those mills had to succumb is entirely misleading.,52
382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The company had to re-organize.,52
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The company had not. to succumb.,52

385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Parramatta M ill was employing more hands before this new Tariff was imposed than ever before, and their output has been steadily increasing year by year. It is true that the proprietors of this mill have a large warehouse in York-street, Sydney, which is the centre of their distribution; and, moreover, they have always been large contractors, not only for the New South Wales and other State Governments, but for the Commonwealth Government. When I was first elected to the Federal Parliament, this company was paying a dividend of 6 per cent, without any .Tariff, and since then the business has continued to increase. These are statements which I challenge the Treasurer to deny.",52

I voted last night for 40 per cent, on clothing, and I . propose to vote for a duty of 25 per cent, on the present item, because I take it that the people who are in the business know what they require. I find, further, that the manufacturers of New South Wales asked for a duty of 25 per cent, and I do not think I shall be voting against protection if I vote for the duty preferred by men in the trade.",53

What did the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission mean when they recommended a - duty of 25 per cent. ? Was the recommendation for the purpose of reducing the duty by 10 per cent, in favour of Great Britain ? Certainly not. The honourable member for Bendigo, who was Chairman of the Commission, said in this HouseSpeaking for myself only, I wish to say that in presenting these recommendations I consider that they represent duties of a sufficiently substantial character to protect our industries against the whole world, including Great Britain. It was intended by the honourable member for Bendigo that the duty of 25 per cent, - should be as against Great Britain; and the fact mustnot be forgotten.

396,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Perth) [9.35] - I should like to say just a word in reply to the honourable member for Gippsland as to the opinion of. the Chairman of the Tariff Commission on the question of preference. I do not think the honourable member can point to that as the opinion of the A section of the Commission. As a matter of fact, if he cares to look at the report of that section, he will find that, on the whole, it is distinctly unfavorable to any preference. I desire to point to the wonderful magnanimity of. the Treasurer in connection with the preference he is prepared to give to the British manufacturer of blankets. The Treasurer .proposes a general duty of 30 per cent., to be reduced to 25 per cent, for the benefit of the manufacturer in the Old Country, although the Australian manufacturers told the Tariff Commission that he desired a duty of 25 per cent, in order to keep out English blankets.",53
397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,No ; they did not.,53

But in this case, however my vote may be cast, the question will be decided finally, PAIRS. unless the Government secure the recommittal of the item. That being so, I give my vote with the Ayes, in favour of the lower rate of duty. Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.",53
399,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.52] - I have been asked by honourable members generally to move the recommittal of item 114.  order? You, Mr Chairman, ruled earlier in the afternoon that, item 115 having been, called on before progress was reported last Novemnight, we could not go back to item .114. The'CHAIRMAN - That is so; but in this case, before item 116 had been called on, the Treasurer rose to make a 23 proposal to the Committee. 23 Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Las t night, AYES. owing to a misunderstanding, an amendment to strike out of item 114 the words "" And salt, gypsum, and manure bags,"" was negatived. I believe that that vote was given because, in a schedule laid before honourable members, it was made to appear, through error, that these articles were free in the last Tariff, whereas they were dutiable. I am assured that many votes would have bean cast differently had it not been for the misunderstanding so caused. Therefore, it is only fair to recommit the item,, NOES. Maloney, W. R. N . and I am willing that it should be recommitted, if the matter can be dealt with without a. long discussion. I therefore move That the Chairman report to the House the resolution in regard to item 114.",54
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"North Sydney) [9.54]-- I shall oppose the motion, because, in the first place, it is a most unusual one. PAIRS.",54
401,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The circumstances are ifpusual.,54
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"In my opinion, they are not. In regard to many of the divisions on the Tariff, honourable members on this side have had reason to think that, could the matter at issue be discussed again, the decision would be different. I have heard honourable members say, on more than one occasion, _that, had they known all the facts, they would have voted differently. But in no such case has an attempt been made to recommit. If we are to make progress, we ought not to entertain proposals of this kind.",54
403,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,A great injustice has been done.,54
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The fact that these bags were dutiable under the old Tariff was explained last night, so that if honourable members voted under a misapprehension, it was because, through absence from the Chamber, they did not hear that statement. A similar thing has happened before. But if the minority, when a vote is taken, is to constantly ask for recommittals, we shall never finish our discussions.",55
405,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,In this case a mistake was made.,55
406,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Mistake s have been made on other occasions. Last night the facts of the case were plainly stated, and it was shown that salt, gypsum, and manure bags were dutiable under the old Tariff. Are we to have a recommittal whenever some honourable members have voted under a misapprehension? opinion, it would be infinitely better, and would tend to expedition, if we left all recommittals until the end. Then let us reto which it refers. commit such items as a majority think should be recommitted and re-considered.",55
407,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Wide Bay) [10.3] - The honourable member for North Sydney has asked why the Government seek to recommit this item, The answer is that last evening, at the end of a long sitting, when honourable members were tired, an obyious mistake was made. In the division which took place, only thirty-three honourable members voted. Surely the honourable member will admit that an error was committed, seeing that the Committee - decided that, whereas the raw material of these bags should be dutiable, the finished article should be admitted free.",55
408,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The Treasurer informed the Committee that he intended to remove these articles from the free list.,55
409,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The honourable member is usually an exceedingly fair critic, and I am sure that he would be the last to destroy an industry merely because a mistake had been made by this Committee. must recollect that 400 men are engaged in the production of these bags, and that the industry will be entirely destroyed if the error be not rectified. At least 30 per cent, of those who took part in the division voted under a misapprehension. The questions which we have to consider are: Are we a sane bodv of men, who recognise that an injury will be done unless we remedy an obvious error? or, are we to stand upon mere technicalities?",55
410,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What is the proposal ?,55
411,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Las t night, when item 114 was under consideration, an amendment was proposed to omit salt, gypsum, and manure bags from the free list.",55
412,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What item would they then come under?,55
413,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Unde r item 113.,55
414,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,And what duty would they bear?,55
415,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"F if t e e n per cent. There is also the question of the duty upon twine and upon printed bags to be considered. Protectionists all over the chamber declare that a protective duty should be imposed upon these articles. I hope that honourable members will not prevent justice being done to those persons'"" who, in good faith, have embarked upon this industry. In my Mr Bruce SMITH (Parkes) [10.8] This question ought to be settled quite apart from the merits of the particular item The honourable member for Wide Bay has reminded the Committee that only thirty-three members were present when the division was taken last evening. I submit that that is not the question which we have to consider. We must recollect that if we recommit this item now we shall be creating a precedent of a dangerous character. That means that a Minister may at any time, without giving honourable members notice of his intention - whe n he knows that he can command a majority-plac e before the Committee a question which has already been dealt with, and thus stultify a former decision of the Committee.",55
416,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,An Opposition could put the Government out of office next day if they did that.,55
417,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is no answer to the position which I put. I should - like the honourable member for Wide Bay to consider, in his representative capacity, what would be the effect of initiating a practice of this sort. In order to ascertain We whether or not it is a desirable practice, he will need to ask himself how it might work out in the hands of an unprincipled Minister. Such a Minister might at any time-if he were unsuccessful upon a division-recommi t a question, suddenly, without giving notice of his intention to honourable members; and he might avail himself of a secretly arranged majority to reverse the deliberate decision of the Committee. I Jcnow that this item touches the State of Queensland.",55
418,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is quite a mistake.,56
419,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"In the Mother Country it has been the practice for centuries that the business of the House shall always be notified upon the business-paper, so that honourable members may know what questions are to engage their attention. is not within the power of a Minister to place a question suddenly before the House.'",56
420,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I could cite a number of instances in which recommittals have immediately followed divisions in this House. Mr B'RUCE SMITH - The adoption of such a course might lead to very unjust results. There is a medium course to be adopted. The honourable member for Wide Bay will admit that the Committee ought to be informed when this question will again come on for consideration. If Treasurer were to intimate that he would place the matter before the Committee on Tuesday next, honourable members would have aii opportunity of being present, and the cjuestion would stand upon a fair basis.",56
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,If we did that the whole of the bonds would be cleared tomorrow.,56
422,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,That is so.,56
423,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I think that that could_ be prevented by an^executive act. At all events, it is only fair that all those who were present last evening should be informed when this question, which they helped to settle, will be again submitted to the Committee.",56
424,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Hindmarsh) [10.13] - I think that the fears expressed by the honourable member for Parkes are entirely groundless. I do not believe that the Committee would support any Treasurer who sought to take advantage of - the absence of honourable members. Seeing that a mistake has been made- a mistake which, if not remedied, will involve the manufacturers engaged in this industry in considerable loss-surel y it is our duty to rectify it at once.",56
425,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,What about salt bags ?,56
426,Mr HUTCHISON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"They have been manufactured here for a long period. If we postpone consideration of the item a serious injustice will be done in the interim, because there will be nothinq to prevent an order being cabled Home for a large consignment of these bags-sufficien to supply our demands for a long period Seeing that a mistake has been made, it is obviously our duty to correct it at once.",56
427,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"East Sydney) [10.15] Whilst I fully follow the weighty observations of the honourable member for Parkes, It- the question of the danger of the revenue being injuriously, affected cannot be discarded. I ' understand that an unfortunate mistake has been made in the printing of the comparative schedule, which makes it appear that these three ' kinds of bags were free under the old Tariff, and that the Customs Department, following a proper rule, go on collecting the old duty in case the new arrangement may not be carried out. I believe the duty under the old Tariff is really 15 per cent.",56
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,1 0 per cent.,56
429,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"It is clear under these cirthe cumstances that if the Committee intends to follow the old Tariff and impose a duty on these three kinds of bags, then if we do not deal with the question at once there is nothing to prevent the people interested from going to the Customs and demanding their goods out of bond free. We do not want to help any one to do that.",56
430,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,They have done it today.,56
431,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is a serious mischief, prejudicing the revenue, and putting, every one, except those who get the bags out free, in a false position. In such circumstances I am always prepared to assist the Minister to protect the public revenue. At the same time. I most heartily agree with the observations of the honourable member for Parkes. It is only an exceptional case that would - warrant this procedure. It will be placed distinctly on record that the Minister only proposes and the Committee only forlows this course because of the immediate urgency of protecting the revenue. On those grounds this is an absolutely fair and proper proceeding, because we must be trustees for the public, and must not allow tricks to.be played with the public revenue. If , after the item is recommitted, the Committee deliberately affirms that these bags shall be free, with a full knowledge that they were dutiable'under the old Tariff, no harm will be done, because in that case tomorrow they will be free. If the Committee decides to retain the old duty, it will simply take a step which will enable the revenue to be protected. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [10..18]. t - I moved last night that bran and chaff, - ore, salt, gypsum, and manure bags should be removed from the free list. I explained to the Committee that there was no method of distinguishing between salt, gypsum, and manure bags, and other calico and hessian bags, which were dutiable under the present Tariff at 15 per cent. The Treasurei was impressed with the argument, and consented to what might be regarded as a compromise. He offered, if I would omit bran and chaff bags from my amendment-leaveing aside the question of ore bags, as there was a slight misunderstanding about them - to accept the amendment so far as it related to salt, gypsum, - and manure bags. On the strength of that understanding, and on the assumption that the Treasurer would be able to carry his party with him, my amendment to remove bran and chaff bags from the free list was put and negatived on the voices. The amendment to remove salt, gypsum, and manure bags from the free list was then put, but when a division was called for a number of honourable members, who had not heard the discussion, and did not knowi of the compromise that had been arrived at, came into the chamber and voted to retain those bags on the free list. I am informed on the best authority that the clearance of all classes of bags which can come under this description, whether they were originally intended to be used for these purposes or not,, began today. The bags are indistinguishable except for the brands that are (put upon them, as I mentioned last night. The Treasurer, who was clearly under a misapprehension, denied it , and said that he had himself caused no less than 400 bales of bags to be properly branded. He was thinking of a totally different type of bag. I quite appreciate the objections to the course which has been proposed, but I think that the special circumstances f u l ly justify it .",56
432,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parkes) [10.24]. - Althoug h I consider that the proposed course, if taken unconditionally, might be elevated into a very dangerous precedent, If u l ly recognise the great danger that might result to the revenue if it were not taken. The recommital proposal will be sufficiently safeguarded by the understanding, which the Committee has now emphasized, that it shall not be regarded as a precedent.  - have not yet heard any explanation why these bags should be treated any differently from bran, chaff, or ore bags. they to be distinguished? When I .was asked this evening not to oppose a recommittal of the item, I was told that these were calico bags. If so, they are easy to distinguish. Salt bags, except in the small sizes, are not calico bags.",57
433,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The honourable member must not deal at this stage with the merits of the case, but must confine himself to giving reasons why the item should or should not be recommitted. He will have the opportunity of discussing the merits of the case if the item is recommitted.  ing the lines adopted by the honourable member for Brisbane, who went f u l ly into details.",57
434,The CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The honourable member for Brisbane related the facts as they occurred last night, but did not go into the merits or demerits of the item.  describe the various kinds of bags, saying that there is a difference between chaff bags and salt bags, and that they bore certain brands. The recommittal of this item will be a dangerous move unless we have a thorough understanding with regard to it . If the Government are prepared to agree to recommittals, there are a number of items of which I do not approve, and which I should certainly like to have recommitted. I should commence by moving the recommittal of the item relating to confectionery, and also several other items that we passed yesterday. If we are to have a recommittal of one item simply because there has been a successful whipping going on today on behalf of the Government, those who do not share their views on the fiscal question will be encouraged to whip up their numbers in order that items which were carried by a narrow majority, and which were supported by some honourable members who have since expressed their regret for voting for such high duties, may also be recommitted. I am going to oppose both the recommittal and the alteration. More salt is sent away in ordinary cornsacks than in any other bags. Under the old TariffBags, Sacks, Packs and Bales for Bran, Chaff, Compressed Fodder, Potatoes, Onions, Ore, Coal and Wool, also Sugar Mats and Flour Sacks were on the free list. We might just as well be asked to impose a duty on sugar mats and all other kinds of bags. Later on, I shall have something further to say about this matter. How are . Mr SOLMON (Laanecoorie) [10.29] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Grey does not appreciate the position, as stated by the leader of the Opposition, who said that we were face to face with a aggerated language. national, and not a party, matter.  question of it.",57
435,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"--The honourable member sion, "" W h at is a million ? "" has been speaking as a free-trader.  these bags were on the free list before.",58
436,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The point is that a mistake was made, and I am sure that the honourable member for Grey, as well as others who have spoken in the same strain, do not desire an injury to be done to an hours ago. industry because of an evident mistake. If , as a result of a mistake, an injury were clone to industries and individuals, and loss of revenue were also sustained, then think that the honourable member, who now should agree. describes himself, not as a free-trader, as a revenue tariffist, would be one of most anxious to protectthe revenue.  sacks shall be free.",58
437,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,-Exactly . The honourable member is viewing the matter from strictly party stand-point.  the interests of the producers.,58
438,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I am assured by Treasurer that it is not his intention to impose a duty on cornsacks.,58
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"We desire to deal with salt, manure, and gypsum bags, which were dutiable. . Mr SALMON - That is a point with haye which we can easily deal later on. We now face to face with an admitted error the part of the Committee, an error will not only result in injury to industries and persons, but will actually deplete revenue. I am strongly in favour of view taken by the honourable member for Parkes that it is inadvisable to ture precedents which might result in the House sitting day after day for the purand pose of rescinding resolutions previously absence of any printing. agreed to.",58
440,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"We should change the Government, if that were done.",58
441,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I agree with the honorthan able member for Wide Bay that if this cedent were abused in any shape or form, the Government responsible for that abuse would not exist for more than twenty-four hours. We are face to face with a national emergency-the loss of even a shilling revenue is a matter that should be immeI diately dealt with by the Committee.",58
442,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"That is very ex-i * Mr SALMON - We know that the honourable member has not much concern for the revenue; he asked on one historic occaI f , as the result of a mistake, we are likely to inflict inon individuals as well as to deplete the revenue, we should lose no time in retracing our steps, and should not be deterred fro m doing so by the old conservative consideration that we ought to stand by a decision merely because it was carried only a few",58
443,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,North Sydney) [10.33] - The arguments that have a been advanced have not convinced me that I the request made to us is one to which we It is hot fair to ask that but where an error has been committed by some the honourable members owing to their being out of the House,58
444,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Owing to a misprint.,58
445,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The hona orable member ought to know that the misprint was pointed out.,58
446,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,It was not.,58
447,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I assure the the honourable member that it was.,58
448,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I remember its being pointed out.,58
449,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Because honourable members were not present when the misprint was pointed out, they are to an opportunity to reverse the decision are arrived at. Other honourable members who, on on various occasions, have voted under that a misapprehension owing to their temporary absence from the House when the certain explanations were made, have the not requested a recommittal, nor would such a request on their part be acceded to. manufacI t has been said that it will be difficult to distinguish between flour bags salt bags; and so it will be in the We are only creating difficulty if we separate these bags, making one dutiable and the other not dutiable ; and, personally, I should go further some honourable members, propose in preorder to get rid of an absurd distinction. To attain the object, which the supporters of a recommittal have in view-, it will be necessary to recommit also item 113. I think the better way would be to give the of same treatment to all calico bags; but, as have already pointed out, in order to do that, it will be necessary to recommit item 113. Does the Treasurer propose to recommit that item in order to get rid of an inconsistency ?",58
450,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"No ; if we omit these three lines of bags, they will automatically f all under item 113, n.e.i. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Then we shall have 2-cwt. bags brought in , which may be for salt, but which may be used for flour.",59
451,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,No trouble perienced under the old Tariff.,59
452,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,But there has been trouble; and that trouble was one of the reasons for making these articles free. If we recommit only item 114 we shall simply create difficulty at the Customs House.,59
453,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Boothby) [10.40]'. - The reason advanced for a recommittal is that honourable members were under a misapprehension last night as to Tariff conditions, so far as bags were concerned. Personally, I was under no misapprehension at all , and I voted against the proposal because of the discrimination. It WcS suggested by several honourable members that, because I was not present during the whole of the discussion, I did not understand the position; but, as a matter of fact, it was the discrimination which decided me, and that discrimination will continue even after the recommittal. However, I shajl not oppose a recommittal if the Government have reason to believe that there are honourable members who voted under a misapprehension. - Mr HANS IRVINE . (Grampians) [10.41],- I recognise that there was an obvious mistake made in connection with this item; and I agree with the Treasurer that it ought to be recommitted. But, in common with others, I should like an assurance from the Treasurer that this recommittal is not to be regarded as a precedent for the recommittal of other items. For instance, the Treasurer might ask for a recommittal ' of the item of blankets tomorrow.",59
454,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I am going to do so before the Tariff is disposed of.,59
455,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"No doubt the Treasurer will do so, if he has the numbers, but it is to be hoped that he will keep his temper, and take his defeats gracefully.",59

457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I do not desire be lectured by the honourable member.,59
458,Mr HANS IRVINE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Chairman did not call the Treasurer to order when he abused me without rhyme or reason, and I think I am entitled to reply. If we have an assurance from the Treasurer that this recommittal will not be regarded as a precedent, I shall support the motion, because I have no desire to do an injustice to any manufacturer.",59

If we are to have a recommittal for the purpose of reconsideration and rearrangement, the whole question of the duty on bags should be thrown open for discussion. That seems to me to be only elemental fairness. Will the Treasurer accept the amendment ?",59
460,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Certainl y not.,59
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Then , I am inclined to vote against the recommittal. If the words "" salt, gypsum and manure "" are eliminated, we shall have salt bags under a duty of 15 per cent, and flour bags free. It was an anomaly' under the old Tariff to have two classes of bags, one free and the other paying 15 per cent, though both were made of the same material. I appeal to the Committee to rectify this anomaly, but' the proposal of the Minister will simply continue it. I ask the Treasurer even now to agree to recommit item 113. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [10.46] - If the honourable member for Parramatta is to have item 113 recommitted, I ' wish to have recommitted item 68. The reateon why I am prepared to support a recommittal of item 114 is that a judgment of the Committee was obtained by a kind of sleightof-hand;; and I do not see why an expression of opinion of that kind should stand as the verdict of the majority. A wrong has been done, and we want to do the right thing, but if any more items are to be recommitted, I shall insist upon the recommittal of item 68.",59

465,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,No ; I am opposed to it. Amendment of the motion negatived.,60
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parramatta) [10.54] - I should like to point out that the Committee has decided to create an anomaly, not to rectify one. Let that be distinctly understood. We are creating a fresh anomaly by treating salt bags differently from flour bags. We - are going to have the same bags functioning in one case as a flour bag, and in the other as a salt bag, but paying a duty of 15 per cent, in the one case, and being admitted free in the other. Motion agreed to. In the House: Resolution reported. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) pro-, posedThat the resolution be now recommitted for reconsideration of the duty on salt, gypsum, and manure bags.",60
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parramatta) [10.56] - In order to afford honourable members an opportunity to reconsider the question' of putting all bags on the one footing in the Tariff, I move That the words "" and corn and flour sacks"" be-added.",60
468,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Boothby) [10.57]. - Or e bags are quite indistinguishable from gypsum bags, and therefore I think that the words "" and ore bags "" should be added to the amendment.",60
469,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Does the honourable member for Boothby press his amendment?,60
470,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"No , six. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee of Ways and Means: Item 114. Bags, Sacks, Packs, and Bales for Bran, Chaff, Compressed Fodder, Potato, Onion, Ore, Coal, and Wood; also Sugar Mats, and Corn and Flour Sacks, and Salt, Gypsum, and Manure Bags, free. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM proposed - That the words "" and salt, gypsum, and manure bags"" be left out. Mr THOMAS BROWiN (Calare) [ n . o ]. - Does the Minister intend this proposal to apply to calico bags only, or to bags made of jute and other material ?",60
471,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I intend to make jute free when we come to the item.,60
472,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Then the intention of the Ministry is to put this taxation on calico bags?',60
473,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I am only proposing to put these bags in exactly the same position as they occupied in. the old Tariff. They were dutiable before, and there was no trouble.",60
474,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Macquarie) [11.1] - It is illogical to distinguish bags by their contents instead of by the material of which they are made, and therefore I protest against the proposal of the Minister.",60
475,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Boothby) [11.2] There seems to be an impression in the minds of some honourable members that the exemption applies to only calico bags. No doubt salt, gypsum, and manure are carried in calico bags, but the bulk of the trade, certainly in manures and gypsum, is done in hessian bags. I have no objection to salt, gypsum, or manure bags being made dutiable, but I protest against only the these bags being singled out for taxation. It is ridiculous to continue what was an obvious anomaly in the old Tariff. A Royal Commission was appointed to point out anomalies, and we are now solemnly asked to re-enact a most stupid one. We are asked to declare that bags made of precisely the same material shall be treated differently according to their intended contents. It is really offering a premium to dishonesty. It amounts to a discrimination against salt, gypsum and manure, and ought not to be sanctioned by the Committee.",60
476,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Franklin) [11.4]. - I protest against a duty being placed on manure bags. It has been a decided advantage to our agriculturists that certain companies have started the manufac1 ture of artificial manures. In an ordinary season the protection which we grant to the agriculturists is practically useless. While wheat or fruit or butter is exported, a protective duty is worthless to the producers of those articles. When our wheat yields are compared with the wheat yields in other parts of the world, it will LYNE) be recognised that there is a very great necessity indeed for the application of artificial manures in Australia. Why should we impose a duty on the bags to contain those manures? The bags for packing certain articles - in are made out of practically the same material, and it is almost impossible to tell the difference between them. If the bags are imported under one heading they will be free, but if imported under another heading they will be dutiable. Let us have something like consistency in our Tariff. Let us put an end to that which in the previous Tariff was a source of endless confusion at the Customs House and opened the door to all sorts of fraud. I think that bags should form the subject of a specific item, and should all be treated alike. If it is the will of the Committee that there should be a duty levied let it be done. Either let all bags be dutiable, or let them all come in free. There should be consistency in the matter.",60
477,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Wimmera) [11.7] Last night I voted for item 114, under the impression that the "" manure bags "" therein dealt with are the ordinary bags used by the' agricultural population, and, more especially, the wheat-growers, for the casing of manure. I thought that such bags should be admitted free. Now I understand that the bags so designated are made of calico or hessian. If that is so,"" I intend to reverse my vote, but I should like to be assured that ""manure bags"" is a term which does not include jute sacks.",61
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parramatta) [11.9] - I understand that salt is often carried in jute as well as in other bags, and if a jute bag is imported to carry salt, it will be dutiable. Any bag, whether made of jute, hessian, or any other material, if imported to carry salt, will be dutiable.",61
479,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,The same remark applies to bags imported to carry manures.,61
480,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Wimmera) [11.10] I understand that corn sacks and flour sacks are to be admitted freeof duty as heretofore, and I take it that, once imported, they may be used for any purpose, including the carrying of manure.",61
481,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Bass) [ i i . n ] - I understand from the Treasurer that he wishes to give effect to a certain interpretation which the Customs officials gave to the old Tariff, and acted on.",61
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"This has always Hedges, W. N . been an anomaly.",61
483,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I was willing to have Irvine, Hans the two items relating to bags recommitted, .Lyne, Sir William to deal with the matter in a business-like way, because I think that at present confusion exists, but, as the Committee has decided against that, rather than injure any one, I shall vote for the re-establishment of the old arrangement.",61
484,Mr CARR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Macquarie) [ n . 12] - I should like to know how the Government propose to enforce this duty. What is to hinder an importer from declaring that his bags are being imported for purposes which allow them to come in duty free, or the Government urging the contrary ? It seems to me that an opportunity for fraud is being offered to importers, or for imposition on the part of the Department. . I am willing to give support to bag-making establishments; but I fail to see that this duty will do so.",61
485,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Boothby) [11.13*]. - Accordin g to the Treasurer, corn sacks and flour bags, no matter for what purpose imported, will come in free. Therefore, if the Castle Salt Company chooses to import such bags as com sacks and flour bags, they will not be charged duty, whereas if it imports them as salt bags, they will be dutiable. Therefore the proposal is an absolute farce.",61
486,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,We ought to receive an explanation from the Treasurer.,61

500,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Wide Bay) [11.30] - It obvious that whatever duty may be imposed upon this item, practically none of goods enumerated in it will be manumore factured locally. The imports will come principally from Great Britain. Personally, I scarcely think that any of these articles have a protective value.

504,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I sympathize with any Minister who is obliged to assume control of Tariff proposals. But I do not think that any of the duties imposed in this item have a protective value.,63

510,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Bass) [1.1.35] - I panes, favour the Treasurer's proposal to levy duty of 25 per cent, upon this item under the general Tariff. I am not particular whether the duty upon the manufactures of Sachets, the United Kingdom is fixed at 20 per or at 15 per cent. The carpets which are imported into the Commonwealth from foreign countries are of an inferior quality. Only a small quantity of these articles manufactured in Australia. I hope that I the Committee will vote for a general Tariff duty of 25 per cent. Mr HANS IRVINE [ i r . 3 6 ] - I support the'proposal for a general Tariff duty of 20 per cent., if a United Kingdom duty of 15 per cent, is to be of agreed to. The protectionist section of the the words "" furnishings n.e.i."" Tariff Commission recommend 15 per cent., which is quite enough. A sum of ,£71,000 was collected in duties last year. We are not in a position to start a carpet are used in the furniture trade. factory in Australia. It would require large amount of capital to do so. I should just about like to see the industry established here, but consider duties of 20 and 15 per cent, are quite sufficient.

There are in various parts of the Tariff a large number of articles which are used in the manufacture of furniture, and those not specially enumerated, would, under proposed amendment, become liable to this duty of 25 per cent.

There is more than one kapok quilt factory in Australia. The word "" q u i l t "" has a general meaning.

547,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I will not postpone it.,66
548,Mr REID,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Then we ought to address our intelligence to the item in order to put it into a proper shape. We may be compelled to stay up all night if the Minister insists, but at least we should deal with the Tariff intelligently. Why should high duties be imposed on articles which afford such little scope for the exercise of protectionist policy? Honourable members opposite surely do not wish to establish a policy of pin pricks by means of the Tariff - to have a Tariff which irritates in a thousand directions for no protectionist' purpose. I should say that good policy from the point of view of honourable members opposite would be to pick out lines which would be likely to afford an opportunity for large and expansive industrial employment, and not to impose a number of irritations upon people without extending the area of employment at all. From a protectionist point of view, if you pass a large number of duties affecting the daily requirements of the [people without enlarging the employment of Australian labour, you only irritate those to whom you wish to recommend your Tariff. We ought to remove these excrescences, which do no good from any point of view. Why put 25 per cent, on some of these articles, which would not lead to the employment of ten men in all Australia? Is there any fiscal policy in it ? I think not. I was very much struck by the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, because, excepting the honourable member for Bass, he is the most rabid protectionist in this House; and when he takes a statesmanlike view of matters the Minister might at least amend the item as to lap dusters. I see no future for an industry in lap dusters in Australia. Question-That the word "" eiderdown be inserted before the word "" quilts "" (Mr. POYNTON'S amendment)-put . mittee divided.

551,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I do not mean to suggest that the material is manufactured in the Commonwealth.

552,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parkes) [12.24 a.m.] - The Treasurer has to make a great many statements in. the course of his endeavour to pass the Tariff. It is quite' possible that he may occasionally - make statements without instituting very full inquiry, and it sounds like a novelty to hear that in this country we are making cotton or linen yarn and converting it into material.",66

560,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Bass) [12.25 a.m.] Under the old Tariff the duty on cotton and * linen quilts was 20 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., and the Government have proposed a duty of 25 per cent, in the General Tariff and 20 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. Really no difference in the old duty is proposed, because the majority of these goods are imported from Great Britain.",67

562,Mr STORRER,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"I think that I know as much about this matter as.does any one in the Chamber.

None of these articles are being made in Australia. They are woven abroad, and come out here in the sizes. It is robbery to impose a duty of 25 per cent, on such goods. There can be no pretence that the duty will give employment by assisting an industry.",67

565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parramatta) [12.35 a.m.] - As the Minister is so obstinate as to refuse to agree to any reasonable amendment, I am not sure that we should not attack the item itself. It includes sheets, pillow cases and covers, bolster cases, counterpanes, bed-spreads, and I do not know what besides. It seems to me the height of absurdity to propose to tax these articles to the tune of 25 per cent., when it can be proved to demonstration that many^ of them are not, and cannot be, made in Australia. I move That after the words ""25 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 8th November, 1907 (General Tariff), 20 per"" cent.,"" be inserted.",68
566,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,Hume-Trea surer) [12.36 a.m.] - I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that on this item I have not proposed an increase in the duties under the old Tariff.  cluded in the item.,68
567,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"No , there are no new articles included. quiries from the Customs officials as to whether any new articles were included, and I found that there was only one about which they had some doubt, and that all the others are dutiable at the same rates under the old Tariff. I ask honourable members not to reduce these duties below those imposed under that Tariff.",68
568,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,We are enacting the old Tariff.,68
569,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Treasurer has - himself ignored it many times, and he has ignored the recommendations of the Commission.",68
570,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent, on this.item, and that is practically what the Government are asking for in the case of all but a few of the articles included in it .",68
571,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I think that the duty on some of these articles was less under the old Tariff.,68
572,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I am informed that that is not so.,68
573,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"The Minister should remember thatj as we have increased the duties on a number of items, it is not unreasonable to reduce purely revenue duties.",68
574,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,I again ask the Committee not to reduce these duties below those imposed under the old Tariff.,68
575,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PUBLIC SERVANTS COMPETING INRIFL E,"Parkes) [12.39 a.m.] - Without desiring to be offensive, I am bound to say that 1 distrust the Minister's statements. He makes statements, and then contradicts them. When he tells the Committee one thing, and the honourable member for South Sydney tells us another, it is not offensive for me to say that I very much prefer to accept the statement of the honourable member for South Sydney. The Treasurer seems to think that we should be satisfied when he reminds us that these duties were imposed on articles included in this item under the old Tariff. No member of the Committee has shown less respect for the old Tariff, or for the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, thaln has the honourable gentleman himself. It , therefore, ill-becomes him to appeal to other honourable members to show respect for either. I accept the statement of the honourable member for South Sydney, that some of the articles included in this item were under the old Tariff free, or dutiable at a lower rate I made in- than is now proposed. The Committee has shown, by a division in which the Government had a majority of only one, that there is a strong desire to exclude from this Tariff articles composed of linen or cotton. The honourable member for Parramatta has proposed that this duty be cut down from 25 to 20 per cent., and I think that is a very modest request. not re- In view of the fact that about one-half of the members of the Committee believe that these goods should be admitted free of duty, I hope that honourable members will ignore the Minister's appeal not to reduce the duty below that imposed under the old Tariff, and will vote for the proposed reduction.
