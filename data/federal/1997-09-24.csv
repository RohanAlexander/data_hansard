2,Mr ANDERSON,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (9.31 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 is to enable a research and development levy to be collected from certain ships arriving in Australian ports. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 will introduce a levy on certain ships to provide funding for the strategic ballast water research and development program. This is to fund research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention, of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens transported in ballast water and on ships' hulls. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 will provide the framework for collection of the levy. For the last 10 years Australia has led the world in developing ballast water management strategies aimed at minimising the risk to Australia's marine environment, ies and aquaculture industries, and on human health, posed by unmanaged ballast water discharge in Australian waters. In 1990, Australia was the first country in the world introduce national voluntary controls to apply . to the discharge of shipping ballast water and sediment from overseas vessels entering Australian territory. This initiative was subsequently adopted by the International Maritime Organisation when, in 1991, it incorporated the principles of the Australian arrangements for international application. Australia has also been at the forefront of the development within the International Maritime Organisation of a new annex to the Marpol convention-the International ConBILL 1997 vention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships-specifically for ballast water. It is hoped this annex will be internationally agreed by the end of this decade. Australia as an island nation and a major exporter of minerals and agricultural products is heavily dependent on shipping. Some 98 per cent of all cargo moved into and out of Australia is by ships. As such, we are also a major importer of ballast water from other countries. Each year, approximately 120 million tonnes of ballast water is discharged from over 6,000 vessels arriving at Australia's 40 ports. While ballast water has been used by shipping for around 100 years, it is only recently that the extent of the problem has become known. As shipping traffic increases, as ships become faster, and as many of the ports with which Australia trades become more polluted, then the threat to Australian waterways has increased enormously. It has already been established that at least 15 unwanted aquatic species and organisms, including fish, molluscs, worms and a toxic algae, have been transferred to Australia and established here. The most likely source of transfer is ballast water. A number of these species and organisms have the potential to cause serious diseases which are harmful to humans, animals, plants and seafood production and the marine environment. These unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens are carried in ballast water and can establish in our harbours and waterways after the our fisher- ballast water is discharged. Ballast water management is recognised internationally as an important global issue, to and Australian scientists were among the first to recognise the risks posed by ballast water. It is for these reasons that, in 1995, Australia developed its ballast water management strategy. The strategic ballast water research and development program, which is a key component of the strategy, was subsequently developed by the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council. The recent review of Australia's quarantine arrangements by Professor Malcolm Nairne recognised that this was not only an important issue but one that is an international issue of environmental and quarantine concern. He recommended that Australia maintain an international leadership role in relation to ballast water management. The government fully agrees with this recommendation, and through the coasts and clean seas initiative recently announced by the Prime Minister, has demonstrated its commitment by allocating $1 million for the strategic ballast water research program for 1997-98. In so far as ballast water is concerned, the coast and clean seas initiative also provides for: the reduction, management and local eradication of introduced marine pests; a rapid response capability to manage and eradicate marine pest outbreaks before they become established in new locations; and the implementation of management arrangements and guidelines to prevent the spread of pests transferred by coastal shipping. While a modest research and development program has been in place for some years, it has been funded largely on an ad hoc basis, primarily by the government but also with some industry assistance. In 1997-98, as noted above, it will be almost fully funded through the coasts and clean seas initiative. Funding is required, therefore, beyond 1997-98. The Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council, which includes shipping and bulk exporting representatives, has had this matter under consideration for some time. The council supports the introduction of a levy on shipping to fund the strategic ballast water research and development program. This agreement by industry to the implementation of a levy on shipping for two years to fund the research and development of effective ballast water management is an indication of their commitment to resolving the risks posed to Australia from ships' ballast water and hulls. This industry is to be complimented on their cooperation and support in establishing this funding mechanism in the endeavour to develop technically and environmentally acceptable solutions. Current major research projects include the development of a decision support system, an information and communications system to monitor and support decision making concerning the risk of individual vessels and required ballast management arrangements; port baseline surveys, to ascertain existing port conditions; and heat treatment of ballast water, as a possible means of killing unwanted marine pests and pathogens. Future projects will include further evaluation of techniques for the detection of cholera in ballast water, identification of high risk vessels and routes, and the implementation of protocols for ballast water sampling and testing. Collection of the levy is to commence on 1 July 1998 and will operate for a period of two years, ceasing once the agreed amount has been collected. The amount to be collected is $2 million, with a 10 per cent variation to allow for fluctuations in collection, and interest accrued on the fund account will be added to the fund. The amount of the levy is $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for all other ships, including tankers, with a length of 50 metres or longer. This legislation has the full support of not only those directly affected by the ballast water issue, but those who will pay the levy in the shipping industry. They have not only agreed to the levy but have been a party to all aspects of the proposed administration of the levy, including the purposes to which it is to be allocated-that is, to enable the conduct of research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens found in ballast water and on ships' hulls. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Fergu- . son) adjourned. NA NA COLLECTION BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr ANDERSON,DEVELOPMENT FUNDING LEVY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This is the second of two bills that will enable a research and development levy to be introduced on certain ships arriving in Australian ports. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 provides the mechanism for the collection of the levy. It provides information and explanations of liability for the levy. The ship's owner, master, agent or consignee are liable to pay the levy on behalf of a ship, and this levy is payable on the first day of each quarter on behalf of ships arriving at Australian ports. These categories include both coastal and international shipping. This bill also provides emergency categories for situations when a ship is exempted from paying the levy. The levy must be paid to an authorised person as defined in this bill, and is to be paid into the Strategic Ballast Water Research and Development Fund. This fund is to provide the resources for research and development of solutions to the risk posed by exotic marine organisms found in ballast water and on ships' hulls. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA IMPLEMENTATION BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIONAL FIREARMS PROGRAM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Australian firearms buyback, which has been a central part of the implementation of the nationwide agreement on firearms regulation, comes to a close in a few days on 30 September 1997. To date, about 570,000 firearms have been surrendered in the various states and territories. The National Firearms Program Implementation Act 1996, which appropriated the funds required to reimburse the states and territories for the compensation paid fOJ"" surrendered firearms, followed the letter of that nationwide agreement. It applied, however, only to those firearms which were expressly prohibited by that agreement. There have in addition, of course, been historically prohibited weapons, including submachine guns, heavy machine-guns and other similar weapons in the community. It was certainly the intention of the Australasian Police Ministers Council that these weapons should also be surrendered for fair and proper compensation. To ensure that this compensation can be properly reimbursed, it is necessary to provide authority for the Attorney-General to certify that the surrender of particular firearms or other weapons is consistent with the spirit of the national program and to allow the Attorney-General to authorise payments for the purpose of providing compensation to firearm owners and dealers. The bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed as quickly as possible. The national firearms program has had bipartisan support throughout, and I ask that that support continue. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.5) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",15
5,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"In speaking on behalf of the opposition, I would indicate that it is our intention to oppose this migration bill. From our point of view, we believe that the House of Representatives has before it today a bill which, if passed, will bring dishonour to this nation. It is a bill which undermines cherished legal principles based on the right of appeal to the courts of this nation. It is a bill which undermines the important principle of checks and balances in our society. It is a bill which will inevitably set the stage for another showdown between the government and the High Court. I know that is not an issue in the minds of some members of the government not only with respect to this bill but also with respect to legal proceedings generally in Australia at the moment. If anything, more and more there is a tendency on the other side of the House to hold the independence of our judicial system in Australia, including the High Court, in contempt. More importantly, I do not believe that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), in his heart of hearts, wants to go down in our legislative history as the person who pushed this most dishonourable law through this parliament. I suggest that in his heart he knows better. But neither the minister nor the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) seems to have the political muscle to convince cabinet colleagues that there is something inherently wrong in this bill. The principal aim, indeed the only aim, of this bill is to restrict access to both the Federal Court and the High Court.. This is done by the mechanism of introducing so-called privative clause decisions relating to visas of all classes. In effect, under this bill there be no review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal or the new Migration Review Tribunal. In my view, even the very best administrative tribunals need the oversight of the courts. Tribunal members are not always lawyersnor should administrative review tribunals be made up solely of lawyers. It reminds me of myoid days in the industrial arena: we sought to go out of our way to ensure. that the legalistic approach to dealing with people was taken out of the conflict situation. Non-lawyers can and do bring important and valuable insights and knowledge to the work of administrative tribunals. They tend to be better than lawyers in dealing with people and personal situations. If we accept that it is not a condition of membership of a tribunal that you have legal training, let alone that you have a great legal brain, then we should not be contemplating removing the right of appeal and the right of scrutiny by the courts. Whether the tribunal decision is straightforward or complex or even whether the tribunal is good or bad, we should maintain the principle that all tribunals must be subject to the review of the courts. To my way of thinking, that is a fundamental principle. Review of .legal procedures has historically been the approach of this great nation. In any event, the Refugee Review Tribunal, as it is at the moment, is a case study in why a watchful court is needed to ensure they do not overstep their jurisdiction. As an example of the apparent inability of the tribunal--or at least its principal member-to understand its own legislation, I cite a recent report in the Australian newspaper of Friday, 22 August of this year. The principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal requested the minister to sign off on appointments of acting senior members which he did not have the jurisdiction to make. If the principal member, a so called expert on these issues, was not aware of the legislative limits on his power and the minister's power in this regard, it is clear that he and his tribunal need a watchful court to ensure that they do not overstep their jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the principal will member knew he did not have the jurisdiction to act as he did with regard to the appointments and still made the request to you, then it is even more important and clear that he needs the oversight of a watchful court. I would also suggest to the House that there is a fear amongst those interested in civil liberties that the privative clauses in this bill are a trial run. I do not think the importance of that view can be underestimated by the House. If the government is successful here, the worry is-and it is a widespread worry not just among civil libertarians but also amongst lawyers irrespective of their political persuasion-that similar provisions may be introduced in another area of administrative review. I also suggest to the minister that all tributions nals need courts to watch over them. For example, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal recently purported to make a new appointment, which took to three the number of community representatives. Unfortunately, the legislation only allows for two such members. Again, this is an example of a tribunal head who does not understand the limits of his power as set out in his legislation. The minister is basing the need to remove the right to appeal to the Federal Court on a perception that all those who are unsuccessful at the tribunal stage are in some sense rorting the system. We have heard a lot about rorting the system in recent days, be it waterside workers or, perhaps a bit closer to home, ministers of the Crown. It is about time we came clean on some of these issues. The intent of the legislation, in the minister's mind, is that by these changes we would not be allowing such people to keep rorting the system. The minister knows that this is simply not the case for asylum seekers. An applicant can be unsuccessful because the tribunal does not correctly apply the relevant law. The law to be applied to refugee matters can be very complex and requires an understanding of international conventions and Australia's obligations under those conventions, as well as of Australian law. I will refer to one appeal, the Yesus case of 1996. The judge, Justice Madgwick, said that this particular applicant faced the possibility of being arrested and detained for some significant period of time should he return to Ethiopia. The judge ruled that this amounted to persecution. Therefore, the tribunal member had misapplied the basic test for deciding whether a person was a refugee or not. It is the minister's intention that, under the new privative clauses, this could not have been looked at by any court. If this bill becomes law, there is a real possibility that Mr Yesus would have been deported and possibly 'disappeared' on his return to his home country. I do not think that is an issue that should be dismissed lightly. This would clearly be a breach of our obligaunder the refugees convention and a blot on Australia's claim to be a humanitarian nation. I do not think the minister, in his heart of hearts, wants to be associated with such an approach to the handling of these sensitive and important issues. These issues not only are important domestically; they go to international standing. As the minister and I know, Australia has had good standing internationally-irrespective of who has been in government-for many years with respect to these issues. My only concern now is that others in the cabinet have other views on these matters. The truth of the matter is that the minister may have been rolled with respect to what he regards as fair play on these issues. The intended end result of the, privative clauses will be that only in very exceptional circumstances will a tribunal decision be reviewed. Unfortunately, those very exceptional circumstances will not be related to the seriousness of the possible error as regards the applicant for asylum. If there is a major flaw in a Refugee Review Tribunal decision, such as a misunderstanding of persecution as in the case I have cited, that would not be reviewable. But, under the examples given by the minister in his second reading speech, a decision could be challenged, even on a minor technicality, if it is found that the person making the decision had not been validly appointed-for example, if the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal had not validly appointed the senior members. I understand the minister's frustration about the number of asylum seeker applications. It is understood on both sides of the House. However, on this issue it may be useful if the minister asked his department to check, and I would hope he would report to the parliament whether it is not the case that from the same countries where his government has now relaxed visa requirements we have now seen the greatest increase in onshore refugee applicants in the last 12 months. Minister, if your government had a well run visa system it would screen out some of the shonky applicants well before they arrived in Australia. In his argument for these privative clauses, the minister has relied on the fact that a substantial minority of applicants withdraw their applications to the court prior to the hearing. Without more information this parliament cannot say this is real evidence that these people were not genuine applicants. Minister, some of these people may have withdrawn because they could not afford to continue the action. There could also be other legitimate reasons that applicants have chosen to withdraw. What the opposition finds distasteful is that the government's aim in the privative clause is to exclude almost entirely the High Court as well. However, the coalition will probably fail in this objective. The jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be totally excluded and, to a large degree, how much it can be excluded will depend on the High Court itself. As the minister would know, the courts have viewed privative or ouster clauses with distaste, fearing that the right of the judiciary to insist that legislation is correctly interpreted and validly applied will disappear if they, the courts, are not vigilant. Privative clauses of the type in this bill invariably lead to complex and expensive cases to interpret what exactly is included in the restrictions. The minister knows this because he made reference to it in his second reading speech. The minister should desist from the attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court and avoid the very real risk that applicants who truly fear persecution would be denied a chance to put their case to the courts. If this bill is enacted lawyers will have a field day before the High Court. They will argue that privative clauses may, for example, take away the court's constitutional powers, provide the tribunals with broader powers than they legitimately should have, breach our international obligations and, finally, breach natural justice. Let us go through some of the basics of each of these legal arguments. Firstly, let us go to the question of the court's constitutional powers being taken away. The High Court could read the privative clauses in the bill in the literal meaning of the words. For example, section 474(l)(c) states: A privative clause decision is not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account. The courts could say that such a paragraph is a direct attempt to take away powers given the High Court by the constitution, which states at section 75 that the High Court has original jurisdiction in all matters in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. There are several High Court decisions which have interpreted these clauses in this way and have therefore said that they were invalid or had only limited operation. Secondly I go to the issue of providing tribunals with broader powers than they legitimately should have. The privative clause can be read as giving the tribunals broader powers than they would otherwise have rather than as a direct attack on the jurisdiction and powers of the court. The minister, in his second reading speech, indicated that in his view the success of this bill depends on the High Court taking this second view, the so called Hickman view of the privative clause. However, even the Hickman principle of expanding the jurisdiction of the previous will decision maker will not necessarily lead to a valid decision, even when there is no constitutional invalidity. Justice Brennan, as he was then, indicated this in the Richard Walter case. If there is an inconsistency between the privative clauses and those parts of the legislation which limit the power of the decision maker, the provisions must be read together in an attempt to give effect to each. Perhaps more importantly, in the Richard Walter case, Justice Brennan indicated that the privative clause was valid in part because the taxpayer had a right to challenge the assessment in a judicial as well as an administrative tribunal. Thirdly I go to the question of the potential breach of international obligations. I would draw the minister's and the House's attention to another principle of statutory interpretation, which is that the courts should favour that interpretation of Australia's law which accords with Australia's obligation under a treaty or convention to which Australia is a party. A privative clause in its present form may be read down by the High Court in conformity with the Hickman principles and others so as to not place Australia in breach of its international obligations. The minister appears to contemplate that Australia may be in breach of its international obligations and that he may be asking the High Court to accept and condone this. Fourthly I go to the issue of breach of natural justice. From the statements of High Court judges Deane, Gaudron, MCHugh and Dawson in the 1991 O'Toole case on privative clauses it is not at all certain that the High Court would accept them because they condone a breach of natural justice. Recently your colleague Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is one of the real stars of the coalition government-I wonder if she gets the same going over in the coalition caucus that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) received yesterday-acting in your position it seemed got herself into some legal hot water with the High Court on this very issue, with a breach of natural justice involving American radical Mr Ervin. When this issue came before the Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice Brennan, he said: It is a matter of the gravest constitutional ance to think that the proposition would be advanced on behalf of the minister that this court does not have the jurisdiction to control unlawful acts committed by the minister. I suggest on the basis of these comments it is not at all certain that these privative clauses would be accepted by the High Court. Minister, I go back to where I started. The opposition has not lightly considered our position today. We understand some of the concerns with respect to the issue of refugees, but for us this is an issue of principle and one on which we will not take a backward step. I question whether the objective of stopping a cherished legal principle, the right of appeal to a court of this nation, is an honourable decision. I question whether the objective of allowing tribunals to act in breach of the requirements of natural justice is an honourable decision. Minister, the opposition will not agree to this bill as it stands. We will oppose it; we will not seek to amend it. I also suggest that the government is heading for another expensive brawl with the High Court. That is for the government to decide. If that is where we end up then we will not be making any progress with respect to the handling of these difficult issues.",16
6,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997, I must say I am very pleased but disappointed-mixed emotions, you might say-at the closing comments by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who said that the opposition will be opposing this legislation. It really does draw yet another line in the sand on where the Labor Party stands, with their failed legislation. They are not willing to own up to and admit mistakes, which we all make, and move forward with the process; they want to remain in a system which has proven to be against the best interests of Australians. I just want to make it very clear why this amendment bill has in fact been moved forward. It really stems from a commitment by the government before the last election to address what is seen by the overwhelming number of Australians as an appalling situaimporttion, where people either illegally arrived or illegally remaining in Australia are able to prolong for inordinate periods of time their stay in this country, tying up enormous amounts of resources for no real outcome. This is simply because the system which we currently have has failed. If you really want a stark situation to be outlined, I have been informed that there is one gentleman who arrived in Australia in 1986 on a one-month visa who is still here today and who has been abusing the process, the courts and the associated situations which are available to him under the current legislation to ensure that he can remain in Australia illegally. I am sure that all members' offices would be aware that we have numerous cases of people wishing to migrate to this country who genuinely have a reason to do so and want to use the correct process, and they are frustrated cases. because Australia has a very small migration program at this stage in our history. They get extremely frustrated when they see people abusing the system-a system set up by the previous government which it will not admit the failings of. This ensures that these people are using resources which could be better used throughout Australia. Let us look at some statistics. In 1994-95, there were 398 cases in the courts; in 1995courts. 96, there were 630; and in 1996-97not remembering it is under the previous government's legislation-it is over 640. In Australia. 1995-96, approximately 65 per cent of the Federal Court's entire administrative case load was on migration matters. The 1995-96 budget shows that litigation cost taxpayers $7.4 million; and that does not include the cost of legal aid or running the courts. Currently there are 590 active cases before the courts, and from experience about 40 cent of those will actually withdraw, so they really do not have a case. In 90 per cent of the remaining 60 per cent of cases the governbeing ment will be successful in fighting their 1992. applications. That means that out of 590 cases we will end up with some 23 successful more applicants, at an enormous cost in time, money and resources to the Australian taxpayer. From 1993-94 to 1995-96 the average number of days from the date of application for judicial review to the handing down of decision trebled, for Refugee Review Tribunal decisions, from 107 days to Immigration Review Tribunal decisions Allegedly, doubled from 259 to 488. All of these are very good reasons why this legislation must be amended to make way for legislation which will meet the Australians. The estimated cost of keeping a person at an immigration detention facility in 1996-97 is $137 a day. As at June 1997, there were 643 in detention facilities, with the detainee days being 84,741, at an estimated cost to you, the Australian taxpayer, of million. That is why we should only allow people who have come to this country in many cases illegally or have overstayed their visas to have access to the courts in extraordinary",19
7,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,What? Does a refugee come here illegally?,20
8,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Don't get excited, Andrew. When a refugee comes to Australia, I believe that their case should be handled fairly and quickly, and there really should be an emphasis on the speed. We do not want to see people tying up resources, whether it be in detention centres or whether it be in the What good does it do them? They are getting on with their lives. It is no good for them and it is no good for the rest of This came to a head last year when it was revealed that boat people who had been detained for some 700 days were in fact granted Australian taxpayers' money for having been detained here in excess of the allowable time. I quote from the Age of 5 November 1996. I am sure most of the people per in the gallery will recall this. It read: The 56 asylum seekers were held in Immigration Department detention centres for 700 days, after found on the Mitchell Plateau in January Earlier this year the Federal Court ruled that under Australian law they could not be held for than 273 days. Thirty-eight of the group then sued the Government. I think that is the thing that most Australians find disturbing and appalling, that they come to Australia illegally and then they sue us. I a, just could not see that happening overseas, but under the law that still stands to this day 354 days. The they could do that. they were deprived of their liberty and suffered mental and bodily pain and anguish. They settled for an undisclosed amount. That is proof positive that it is essential, we needs of address this situation. To put this into context, once again drawing a line in the sand between the current legislation-which is supported by the member for total Batman and his colleagues-and that of the response by the Minister for Immigration and $10 Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in this amendment bill, the analogy I would like to draw is that of industrial relations and the unfair dismissal laws. There has been an enormous amount written and spoken about unfair dismissal laws. Under the old law, if someone was found thieving from their employer, in some cases they would go before the court-which is what it was: a legal court-and it would be found that the employer did not cross every t and dot every i. He was morally correct and correct in every form other than the fact that he had missed some small administrative detail. As a result of missing some small administrative detail, in some cases employers were forced to reinstate employees or pay them some form of compensation! Could anything be more hypocritical than that: saying that that system-where someone steals from you and then you have to pay them for the privilege-is good? That situation is very similar to this one, in that a person whose case, on whatever basisoverstaying a visa or not being of refugee status-has been found to be failing, has been able, through a court of appeal, to find that there has been some administrative glitch. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the decision, but not every t had been crossed and every i dotted. As a result of that, we find Australians having to put up with detention costs, court costs and a sense of frustration that the Australian concept of a fair go is not being attained. For those members opposite, I want to make it very clear that I am not one of the people who believe that you put a shell under the waterline or tum the boats around when people try to land in Australia. As I have stated in many public meetings in my electorate-where those views are held by somethese people should be allowed to land and to prove their case in a short period of time. When you look at some of the events in our region of late-where leadership challenges have caused people great consternation and perhaps lives have been put at risk-I would hate to think that we, as a compassionate nation, would tum those people away and send them back to either death or detention. At the same time, the figures prove quite conclusively that those people are a very small minority. I do not have the exact figures, but everyone will recall the crew of approximately 160 'designer boat people' - as I think they were called-who arrived only a few months ago in a steel hulled boat. Under the previous law, you could have expected nearly 160 of those people still to be here today. The minister may correct me, but I believe there are only four of them remaining in Australia today. That is not widely reported in the press. It means that 156 had no legal right, no humanitarian right and no right as refugees-no refugee status-to be in this country, and they quite rightly were returned whence they came. The other four are still being investigated to see whether or not they can justify being here. Mr Ruddock-No they aren't.",20
9,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"My apologies. Mr Ruddock-We want to charge them: There are further investigations taking place, with a view to charging them for people smuggling.",21
10,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"-'-I stand corrected by my learned colleague, the minister. They are being looked at with a view to being charged.",21
11,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Is this to show that you don't know what you are talking about?,21
12,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No. What it shows is that things are moving so quickly that, whereas in the past I could have been quite sure of what I was saying, now, because we react to these things, we deal with them. I appreciate your interjection. We are always brought up-to-date by our ministers, and that is one of the great things we have; those opposite have always been in the dark and continue to be. That is why they keep harking back to the days of old. The Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 4) Billhonours the government's pre-election policy commitment, restricting access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances. That is where the opposition wants to draw a line with us. They are saying, 'Give everybody access to the courts. Let them stay here for years.' I remind you, in 1986 a man arrived on a one-month visa and he is still here today. He is allowed to work. No doubt he has been accessing our social security system and our health system-and he is only one of many examples. And the ALP wonder why the Australian public has had a gutful! You really must be embarrassed by the fact that these people are being succoured by you when they have no right to be in Australia. Let us draw a clear distinction between those who have a real reason to be in Australia-those people who really are fearful of persecution in the countries they have come from-and those who have no real reason to be here. Let us ensure that we deal with them in a speedy manner, so that those who have a reason to be here can be integrated into Australia fully and not feel as though they are some add-on to our communities. The originally scheduled Migration Legislation Amendment (No.4) Bill dealt with the amalgamation of the initial departmental review of non-humanitarian visa decisions with the next stage of the review process for such decisions, reviewed by the Immigration Review Tribunal. This part of the bill was deemed by the Labor Party to be non-controversial. However, the Migration Legislation Amendment (No.5) Bill inserts a privative clause which will have the effect of narrowing the possibility of judicial review by the Federal and High Courts. It will permit administrative decisions to be considered valid, subject to procedural defect and legal irregularity. That is the whole point. Anybody who applies through the system will still be accepted into Australia if it is found that they have a genuine case. But we will not allow this never ending process of litigation and appeals, this use and abuse of the process by people seeking to overstay in Australia. That costs Australian taxpayers substantial sums of money and ties up valuable court time. I believe that this bill responds to the and the concerns of the wider community of Australia. If those views are not accepted by those opposite in the Labor Party, then I suggest that they go back and listen to the people. It could be the first time they have done that in a long time. Mr Billson-They mightn't know who to talk to.",21
13,Mr BROUGH,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"They may not know who to talk to. The point still remains: do we want to look after the welfare of the people who arrive in Australia illegally by dealing with them quickly and in a humanitarian manner and allow them to return to continue their lives, or do we want to delay the process and cost Australians money? The choice the ALP have made is that they want to see them remaining in detention centres and going through the courts, tying up resources and money, which we can ill afford to do. I commend the minister for immigration. He is doing a fabulous job right across this portfolio. The resources and intellect that he has brought to this portfolio have ensured for the first time in a long time that the immigration policy of· this nation is heading in the right direction. I am sure that these measures when accepted by this parliament will go a long way to correcting the ill-informed, illdirected policies of the Labor Party. I commend this amendment bill to the House.",22
14,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,In a number of ways it is very disappointing to see the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) bring forward this legislation. Over a period of time the minister has had a record of support for fundamental human rights. Mr Billson-He still has.,22
15,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"We will get into that in a minute. The minister and I have been engaged for a long time in dealing with immigration issues. This very issue that we are talking about was one of the subjects of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations in August 1992, of which I was the chairman and the minister was the deputy chairman. The reality is that we have had problems, needs as the member for Longman (Mr Brough) talked about, in drawing the line on how we deal with refugee applicants in the most fair way. This is not a simple question. There are things that can be put in place to deal with the issue. In that 1992 report, the committee put down a number of bipartisan recommendations to deal with some of the key issues, which were later adopted by the Labor government-for example, the question ·of the speedy processing of refugee applications to ensure that, when people arrive on our shores as boat people or in aeroplanes and seek asylum, they are speedily dealt with. That was a problem which had to be dealt with by bringing in new regulations, and they were supported by the then Labor government and by the then opposition. So we had a bipartisan approach to dealing with this issue. What has happened? The minister claims that there are too many cases of refugee applicants going to the courts on matters which should not go to the courts. He says that he wants the process further speeded up to the point where people will not be able to appeal to the courts. But there is a need to balance the question of speeding up the processing of these applications with the question of justice for applicants. There is also a constitutional issue concerning the separation of powers-the issue of what the parliament is responsible for and what the High Court is responsible for. These issues have been trampled on in this legislation. In dealing with the question of needing to have a more speedy processing of applications, the minister put into place the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), which was approved by this parliament. In that legislation, the minister reduced two levels of appeal to one level. The MIRO and RRT levels were reduced to one level. The opposition agreed with that. Mr Ruddock-How many levels do you want, Andrew?",22
16,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Just a moment; we agreed to and supported your legislation to have the one level of appeal. Mr Ruddock-The department, the tribunal, one judge, the Full Court of Appeal, the High Court-five levels. That is what you are after.",23
17,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, I do not want five levels of appeal. We have already agreed with the legislation.",23
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"MrJenkins)Order! I advise the honourable member to ignore the interjections, and I am sure the minister will cease interjecting.",23
19,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The minister is getting a bit excited because of the fact that he understands the principle involved which he is crossing. The reality is this: we have reduced the levels of appeal to the one level-the RRT-and the principal of that tribunal will be making the decision; then we are going to have a situation where, except under the most limited circumstances, there cannot be any appeal to the courts. Mr Billson-Hear, hear!",23
20,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"'Hear, hear!' says the honourable member. That is all very well, but I ask you to have a look at the constitutional history of this country in relation to the concerns between tribunals and the High Court. We are talking about a democracy. If you start to put into place ideas where the ability of the High Court and the courts to examine determinations of tribunals is limited, then you will get onto a slippery slope in terms of the separation of powers and the powers of the courts to examine the actions of tribunals.' Once you get onto that slippery slope, it is not going to affect just the area of immigration; it will affect every area of government, every area of tribunals with respect to the determinations of the court. If the minister does not think there is any serious matter involved here, then I think he has not studied this issue sufficiently. A very serious matter is involved here, and he knows it. I ask this question of the minister: are you so administratively unsure of your abilities that you need to bring in such tough rules in order to deal with the issue? You have been given authority by this parliament to have only one level of appeal. You have been given authority to speed up applications. You have put into place regulations to deal with the refugees, and now you are saying that is not enough. Why is it not enough? Is it because you are not competent enough to deal with the issues? Is that what it is? Do you need to take people's rights to the courts away? Mr Ruddock-Because every loophole will be exploited by my profession. They know how to do it very well.",23
21,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Oh, do they? If that is right, and if you competent and able deal with these issues, you do not need to take this further step. You do not need to interfere with the constitutional arrangements of this country in terms of the powers of the High Court vis-a-vis the question of tribunals. This legislation is very likely to be challenged. It is very likely that the High Court will take a very different view from you in relation to the interference with the basic rights we have had. We are dealing with something very important here. The first determination under these powers was made in 1904, when the High Court's powers to deal with tribunals were attempted to be interfered with in a similar mariner. The High Court made it perfectly clear that it had powers to deal with other tribunals. For you to come in here now and try to ""take away those powers is a nonsense. Let me go further. I want to ask the minister what would happen in the event of his making a mistake. Let us assume that he is not totally infallible. He makes a mistake: he appoints the wrong person as the principal person to head the RRT. Let us say that you appoint the wrong person, Minister. Mr Ruddock-No, he is your appointment.",24
22,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"All right. Let us say that you replace our appointment with another appointment in the near future, which is happening in virtually every area of your administration. What happens then? What if that person happens to be making determinations not entirely consistent with fairness the principles of justice? What happens then, Minister? Will we have a situation in which these people will not be able to appeal to a court about the determinations of that principle of the tribunal? That is what will happen. Under these provisions, these people will be stuck. They will not be able to appeal to a court in relation to the determinations of head of that tribunal if he happens to have made a mistake. As I said, the whole of this parliament wants to see a speedy resolution of issues concerning refugees, but we also want to have justice and fairness in the system. Notwithstanding the comments of the member for to Longman, there are some genuine refugees. There are some people who actually have a claim, and those people ought to be treated with respect. We should not be ruining our international reputation by putting into place a situation in which these people will not be able to get the kind of justice which they are entitled to if we adopt these provisions. What I do not understand is why the minister has proceeded with this after the advice he has received about the dangers of this issue in terms of the legal implications. Why has he proceeded with this knowing that this is dividing the parliament on an immigration issue in a serious way? Why has he proceeded with this knowing that we on both those sides of the House have supported him on every other provision to speed up the applications to ensure that those bogus claimants were dealt with effectively. The minister is trying to say that, even though bogus applications will be dealt with effectively, these people will still be able to go to the High Court and delay the process indefinitely. This is the sort of discussion that we have had here. Mr Ruddock-But they do. That is exactly what happens.",24
23,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"If that is what is happening, it is the fault of your government. It is not the fault of the constitution; it is not the fault of the arrangements between the tribunals and the High Court. You do not solve an administrative problem like this by putting in a principle which is very dangerous and for the constitutional arrangements in this country. The minister knows that, whenever he has brought forward a fair and reasonable proposal to deal with these issues, the Labor Party in opposition has accepted those proposals, as we did with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4). Even though there that were aspects of the bill that we did not particularly like, we allowed the bill through and we supported it in the Senate. Mr Brough-Very big of you.",24
24,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You are such a fool on these matters. You do not know what you are talking about.,25
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The they honourable member for Calwell will his remarks through the chair and ignore the interjections. The honourable member for Longman will not encourage him.,25
26,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The member for Longman in his own speech contradicted the minister. Mr Ruddock-Rubbish!,25
27,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,He did. He did not know what he was talking about. The minister had to correct him on half of the issues he raised. Mr Ruddock-I added information.,25
28,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"You added someconstitutional thing, did you, Minister? That was not my interpretation of the events. I commend to House a paper by the Parliamentary Library which discusses this bill and which outlines in detail the history of these privative powers of the High Court. It outlines why it is that these powers have been so important constitutional arrangements. The minister appears to have completely ignored this issue in his dealings with this matter. Instead he has put into place clauses which will be very objectionable on constitutheir tional grounds and which will involve us a conflict not only on this bill. ment continues with this process, where will we stop? We start with this tribunal and then move to another tribunal. We go to the tribunals dealing with social security and tribunals dealing with other matters of law. Every tribunal will be brought in and told, 'You cannot go to the High Court because are going to limit the powers of the High to migrants? Court on these matters.' Just as a claim can be m-de in the area of immigration, it can made in other areas. The situation is that do not need this to deal with the issue. We can process the applicants quickly now that we have the original process plus only one tier of review. We have reduced two tiers of review to one and the minister should be satisfied with that. He should be able to say that, if people feel they have a case to go to the courts on this matter, then they should be able to do so. After a while precedents will be established and people will recognise that, if are going to go to the courts on spurious address grounds, they will not succeed. Mr Brough-That has worked well so far.",25
29,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Why don't you have a discussion with the courts about processing people more quickly instead of trying to take away their powers? Why don't you do that? Mr Ruddock-We are doing that as well.,25
30,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"You are doing it? The minister says they are doing that as well. If you are doing that, then why do you need to try and take away the powers of courts? Why do you need to interfere with this basic right? The fact of matter is that you do not need this at all. This is a surpristhe ingly dogmatic position on the part of the. minister because he is under pressure from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) all the time to be really tough on migrants and refugees. He has to be as tough as anyone else, like the in our member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Mr Ruddock-Come on. I don't need that sort of comparison. That is beneath you.",25
31,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Why are you being so tough on people and trying to take away rights? Why are you trying to take away in people's rights? You are trying to show the If the governPrime MinisterMs Worth interjecting,25
32,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, this is not your the view. We know about your views. We are talking about the Prime Minister. Why are you trying to show the Prime Minister that we you are such a maniacal type when it comes The reality is that there is no doubt that this be tribunal will make mistakes from time to we time. It will be required to have a judicial review and such a review should be put in place. That is what should have happened and that is what is required under the current constitutional arrangements. The High Court will be very unhappy about this bill. I would not be surprised if they knocked it out. Certainly they will be making some determinations on it, because the idea that the court should not be able to review matters concerning immigration is a nonsense. It is going to lead to a position of conflict of laws that we do not need in this country. In conclusion, we need to get a balance. Honourable members will remember the report, Achieving a balance between refuge and control. The minister signed this report as deputy chairman. Mr Martin Ferguson-His hand was shaking.",25
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, at that time he was not under pressure from the current Prime Minister. Mr Ruddock-And I am still achieving balance.",26
34,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You are not achieving a balance through this law. We have given you plenty of powers by supporting you in the area of control. Mr Ruddock interjecting,26
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The minister should not try to add to the member for Calwell's speech. The honourable member for Calwell has the call and should address his remarks through the chair.,26
36,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am referring to the minister. I know the minister is getting a bit excited because he recognises that this is going over the top. He knows very well that this is going over the top. This is very unfair on those people. This is shifting the balance too far towards control and not far enough towards humanitarian considerations for refuge requirements. The UNHCR will be very concerned about this issue when this provision goes through. Mr Ruddock-Not at all. They do not demand administrative review and judicial review as well, and you know that. You have heard the evidence.",26
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,It is not a question of what they demand; it is a question of what they think is ideal. It is not a question of what they demand. It is not a question of the minimum conditions; it is a question of the best conditions. The minister is making a mistake in thinking that because they do notMr Ruddock-They would rather see the $60 million go to the UNHCR. It· is $60 million down the drain.,26
38,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I know a lot about this matter. The minister need not think that they are going to be in a position to put one over us.,26
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The minister will cease interjecting. The honourable member for Calwell will ignore him and address his remarks through the chair.,26
40,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The minister is getting excited because he knows that the UNHCR are unhappy about these provisions, but they are polite. They are not demanding that we do this. They are saying that in a ideal or best situation they would prefer to have both levels. That has been the tradition in Australia. There is to going to be a lot of trouble over the legislation because of its implications for people's rights, its implications for the separation of powers and its implications for the constitutional arrangements in this country. The minister does not need this. The previous shadow minister and the current shadow minister have agreed to put through rules and regulations which will support a fair, fast and speedy process in refugee applicants. We are not going to allow shonky people to stay in Australia. At the same time, it is necessary to have a balance-as their previous report said-between the humanitarian requirements and the requirements of control. (Time expired)",26
41,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). He provides me with such a wealth of material that I can fire back his way and demonstrate that the opposition do have form on these issues. I will cover some of that area shortly. The key point we are here to discuss today is a proposal by this government to restore some credibility in the migration program. Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting,26
42,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I am being interjected on by 'billable hours', the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who recited a speech very well that I would imagine was written for him by some of the migration lawyers who make an absolute feast out of the complexity and the options for review and appeal. He well-deservedly describes that as pro bono work on behalf of those migration lawyers, although some might argue that it was an investment in their future. The point we are here to discuss today is the fact that there are people seeking to delay and to abuse some of the review processes that are available to legitimate people with a grievance in this country in order to stay here longer than their visas entitle them to or to bypass our migration program entirely. There are hundreds of thousands of people around the world wishing to migrate to this country. We have a system in place-albeit, one that is being hampered by those opposite in the Labor Party-to process applications for migration to this country, which has legitimate terms and conditions under which migration will be supported and those applications approved, as well as a very important program in the refugee area. This country has opened its heart each year to thousands of people from war-torn sections of the world, who are being legitimately persecuted and have the view that they can no longer stay in their home country, to provide a refuge for them in this country. The last thing most average Australians want is to see that generosity abused. When you have people applying for refugee status in this country or seeking to stay in country because of very genuine reasons and fear of persecution if they return to their own country, we should be very careful in how we handle the generosity that the nation has provided to the rest of the world. One way to undermine the support for that generosity is to perpetuate a system that allows people to rort those provisions. If people apply to be a refugee and if they seek to extend the appeal options that are available to them purely to stay in this country against the provisions of our migration program-not having proven their eligibility to be here or on the grounds that they are claiming or, more particularly, having queue jumped in front of those people who have done the right thing in working with this nation and its migration policies and in respecting the generosity and the heartfelt goodwill that Australians have towards genuine refugees-they deserve to be treated in a way that recognises that abuse. The coalition went to the election with a policy in which it made very clear its intention to limit judicial review to migration decisions in all but exceptional circumstances. This commitment was based on the fact that, despite there being extensive merit review rights in the current system through independent tribunals, many people were seeking to extend their right to stay here by abusing further review options that were available to them. You could listen to the member for Calwell or even 'billable hours', the member for Batman, and think that they have no form on this matter. In the evidence provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee it was quite clearly put that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) is a continuation of a process to limit judicial review that was commenced under the Labor Party-under the former government. Mr Georgiou-They have all got amnesia.",27
43,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"That is right. My friend and colleague the member for Kooyong, who is highly respected in the migrant community, has quite rightly pointed out that the Labor Party wants the community to just forget about its form on these issues and to forget this about the fact that in 1986 there was already a start to these sorts of changes. Those most recent changes were in 1994 when then Minister Bolkus recognised that there was a problem with the review processes through the courts and that that was being abused and was clogging up the system. The former government decided to expand and extend the merits review process-not dissimilar from the government's strategyand reduce access to the courts on grounds of natural justice. So you could not apply to the courts because you felt natural justice had been denied to you in your application. But you do not hear about that. The Labor Party would have you all believe that they did not do that. They would have you all believe that they have not gone down this path that the government is seeking to pursue in this case, but they have. The reason why we are here discussing this bill today is that the Labor Party was spectacularly unsuccessful. The number of people applying to the courts to have migration decisions reviewed has gone up. So despite the Labor government introducing a measure to limit access to the courts in processing reviews of migration decisions, what has happened? The applications have gone up. We are hearing this righteous indignation from other side-in some cases script pro bono by migration lawyers, I suspect-telling us that this is the most outrageous thing and the greatest threat that this community has faced for a long time. What the Labor Party is going on about is utter nonsense, and it would do well to take heed from what the coalition did in opposition. It supported these changes and said, 'If they don't work, we'll be back. If they are unsuccessful in achieving their objectives, coalition will revisit this matter,' and the coalition has. The coalition has gone further to strengthen the merits review process. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has even strengthened the personnel who are available to conduct those merits review processes. To draw a comparison between the minister and the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is indescribably inaccurate. Mr Georgiou-Grotesque.",27
44,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"It is just grotesque. The closer parallel you would draw is the similarito ties between the member for Calwell and the member for Oxley. The drivel that the member for Calwell has just gone on with has all the hallmarks of what the member for Oxley goes on about-appealing to the crowd, trying to be sensational, being a little economical with the truth and facts at times and playing to a constituency. Those characteristics are commonly shared between the member for Oxley and the member for Calwell. The member for Calwell and the member for Oxley would do well to familiarise themselves with the facts of this matter and try to get a little bit in tune with what the broader Australian community is saying. As my colleague the member for Bowman (Mrs West) mentioned earlier, people are appalled by the fact that someone who applies for a one-month visitors visa in 1986 is still here a decade later because of the way you can manipulate the review process and do legal gymnastics to hang around more than a decade after the visa expired. In the refugee area you have people applying for refugee status who have been able to find the money to travel to this country, have the applied successfully for a visitors visa or something like that, have left at a time of their choosing and chose the destination themselves, have been able to organise their affairs back in their home country to come here, have been able to communicate with people back in their country of origin and have had the time to brief, liaise and fund immigration lawyers to put together a refugee case. Contrast those people with the people who the are in war-tom parts of this world where, because of their appearance, their religion and their beliefs, they are killed. They are not able to have the basic human rights of safety, shelter and comfort. That is the contest that is on here. The Australian community has opened its heart to thousands of refugees each year, recognising that this is a refuge for people-a place where they can live out their lives free of that sort of persecution. You have those opposite arguing that we should be making those places available for the people that can afford to spend $600,000 $700,000 in some cases backing up their refugee claim. That is just breathtaking. It leads you to ask: what are the Labor Party trying to do? Who are they trying to please? Are they trying to please the Australian community? No, because they are out of touch there. They do not understand the concern that surrounds this abuse of the migration program. They are not trying to please the Australian people. Have they tried to help legitimate migrants who go through the due processes of this country, who apply in accordance with the migration program and who, in some cases, queue up for days at our posts overseas to put their case forward and be tested against the provisions of the migration program? No, they do not want to help those people either. Do they want to help the people who come from war-tom parts of the world where ethnic cleansing and those sorts of things mean that basic living is not doable in those countries, the people who apply for refugee status and out of the goodness of our hearts in this country we support a lot of those people to start a new life here? No. What does that leave us with? That leaves us with the people who come to this country and then try to manipulate the system to stay here, many of whom use finances that would represent almost a year's budget for some the governments of countries where genuine refugees come from to try to stay here and rort the system. The Labor Party is trying help those people. Are they trying to help the migration lawyers whose billable hours go through the roof because of the legal and process gymnasself-interest. tics you can engage into stay here, notwithadvice, standing the fact that you have review of the merits of your claim? These are the sorts of questions I encourage everybody to think about-those in the gallery, those listening and those on both sides of the House. Who is the Labor Party trying to please here? We have had 'billable hours Ferguson', member for Batman, talking about his underCal standing of what was a legally robust proposal and suggesting that this was somehow vulwas, nerable, that the continuation of a program, strategy, that was commenced under the former Labor government is something that so abhorrent that it could not possibly pass legal muster. Then we had the member for Calwell come in and give his account of the robustness of this measure. But what has government done? The government has said, 'Here is our policy position. It is clear the broader community supports our view. have gone and got the best legal advice available and we have asked· the question how we implement this measure.' Mr Georgiou-No billable hours.",28
45,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"There are no billable hours there for some of the people those opposite seem to be representing and who put in a very strong survival driven performance to the Senate committee on this subject. It is amazing how vigorous and robust you can be when you feel your billable hours are under threat. But what has the government done? It has sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department. But that is not all. Eminent counsel was also consulted-David Bennett QC; Robert Ellicott QC; Tom Hughes QC; Richard Tracey QC; Mr Dennis Rose QC; and, as I mentioned, the Attorney-General's Department. That is not bad. If you stack that up, there are eminent legal counsel with no vested interest offering advice-probably of some of the same eminent legal counsel who gave the opposition whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), advice on the bike to fiasco. They have given very good advice to this government-advice that was not borne out of a motive of self-service or out of a desire to protect an interest, self-preservation, These people provided eminent with no stake in it, that this was had a genuine entirely doable. In fact, the proposal before this parliament reflects that advice. Who would you go with? Would you go with 'billable hours Batman'and I congratulate you, Martin, on your capacity to read a legal brief that I am sure the migration lawyers had a hand in, and it the sounded almost credible-or the member for well who very scantily referred to the matter before the House, as colourful as it flamboyant even at times? Would you go a with that advice or would you go with this non-vested interest eminent legal advice? I is know what horse I would rather be on-the government's horse. This is a proposal which was referred to this eminent legal counsel, and the advice the government was provided the with is what you see embraced in the bill. As I said earlier, the 1989 changes that the that previous government introduced tried to We provide certainty in decision making-and that is fine; this came out of the Senate of inquiry into it-through codification and a strengthening of the merits review process by trying to reduce applications to the Federal Court. But that was spectacularly unsuccessful. But, as I said, that was in 1989. I have mentioned that, in 1984, the then minister, Senator Bolkus, went even further. To use a phrase of a colleague of the opposition from some time past, what are those opposite going on about? This is a proposition that is borne out of a strategy that they have already commenced, that is being introduced by a minister who is extraordinarily credible amongst the migration and refugee community, that is supported by government opinion, that seeks to implement strategies that the previous government embraced but have now just dropped. It is like a case file-and I can understand why the member for Batman might be handling it this way-where the billable hours concerned with that case are the only thing you focus your mind on. What those who were providing him that advice did not do was go back and look at his form. There is bucket loads of form from the Labor Party which I would have thought would have seen them support this measure. Mr Martin Ferguson-Not as good as John Sharp's form.",29
46,Mr BILSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I must give him some credit. He has actually come up with a thought of his own there. Congratulations. That would be pro bono advice to the government and that is excellent stuff. There was some suggestion by those opposite that somehow this measure would deny people access to the courts. That is not right either. The privative clause that the government is seeking to implement here is not only valid but leaves open the opportunity for judicial review to the courts. We heard before those opposite trying to mount the case that if the trihunal acted beyond its powers where would people go? They would go to the courts. The provisions that allow access to judicial review remain strong and remain responsive to the sorts of issues those opposite raised. the decision maker was not acting in good faith we can zip off to the courts. If they did not have the authority to make the decision that they had made or if a member had not been properly appointed we can zip off to the courts. If they are exceeding their constitutional limits we can zip off to the courts. Those opposite were trying to have you believe that that was not the case. They are wrong. This provision seeks, with matters of judgment and application of the parameters applying to people's migration and refugee applications, to have an intellectual gymnastics exercise about who said what, how, and whether they were right in arriving at certain conclusions, taking into account all the matters before them. Then getting on that traina gravy train for migration lawyers-and trying to delay the ultimate decision, is not the way to go. In some of these court cases, even if the court does find there perhaps was a microscopic breach of the black-letter law about process, the matter is sent back to the tribunal. And guess what happens? They get knocked back again. They tidy up, dotting the i's and crossing the t's, and they get knocked back again. What arrant nonsense comes from those opposite. I mentioned earlier the credibility that surrounds this matter: the fact that eminent advice has been taken on board; the fact that former governments did start down this path and were spectacularly unsuccessful. The coalition government is now trying to implement measures that actually make a difference, and implement the policy commitments that the coalition took to the electorate. I would have thought those things would have been supported. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in his second reading speech said that the government believed restricting access to judicial review was necessary. This is proposed by the privative clause I have just spoken about. What we are looking at is the merits review process, where someone can put their case before someone who is skilled in that area of law, and argue their case on its merits against the parameters that have been If established for the program for refugee access. They can still do all those things. And we have actually tweaked that process up. So you can be even more confident about that merits review process. If, as I mentioned earlier, those three aspects of the decision are unsatisfactory, there still is access to the courts. I think the most useful thing those opposite could do would be to reacquaint themselves with their position when in government, be a little bit honest with the Australian community, try to salvage a skerrick of credibility about their position on this particular migration issue and many others, and recognise that this nation is blessed with having one of the most decent persons Australia has produced as its minister, someone who has a long history of understanding and working with the migrant and refugee community. Those opposite could also reacquaint themselves with one thing that the vast majority of Australians hate-that is, somebody trying to rort systems while others are going through the process reasonably expecting, and receiving, a fair go. I just bring you back to that contrast: do we want to support, to facilitate, people staying in this country who have bypassed the migration program, who have displaced people who have done the right thing and gone through that process-those legitimate refugees we see in sad parts of the world where they cannot live in peace because of war, because of ethnic tension, because of violence, because of religious tensions? Or do we want to leave our refugee program open and exposed to people who think they can buy their way into this country; people who, by their presence, stall their removal by arguing that they have been here for so long they should be entitled to stay? Do we want to help support the people whom those opposite, particularly the shadow minister, the member for Batman, are trying to help-those billable hours migration lawyers and those people who are seeking access to this country by displacing those who have legitimately gone through the processes that this country has set up, in compliance with all the laws under the sun? Do we want to support that, or do we want to support the bill? I would encourage everybody to support the bill. It is good law, it is safe, it is solid, and it is responsive to what the Australian community are saying about the need to restore credibility in our migration program.",30
47,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"We have just heard the suburban lawyer's approach to what we should do with the migration system in Australia. We have heard the suburban lawyer tell us is what the bush lawyers ought to do, which is to take the government's point of view on these things. There is a thread that goes through this bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5), which has gone through a number of other bills that the government has brought into this House. I would like to just pick up on a couple of things that the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) has said. He started out by trying to snow us with the idea that the minister who is in charge of this piece of legislation, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Ruddock), is a wonderful, decent person. And he is right. I think Philip Ruddock is a decent person-and that is part of the con here: Philip Ruddock is a decent person, the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) is a decent person. But the people behind them in the government are very nasty, bitter, indecent little people. These are people who basically are poll driven and who do not like migrants; they do not like migrants at all. The member for Kooyong does and the minister does. They both have very good records over a long period on these issues. But the rest of the Liberal Party, like the member for Dunkley, have a pretty bad record on these things. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member, whose seat I cannot quite recall-we know him more as 'Leo the bike rider' - is casting aspersions on my support for the migrant community.",31
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The member will go to his point of order. Mr Billson-'Papakos' is the name of my wife's family, So I would ask you to acquaint yourself of the facts, Leo.",31
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-You sting them, and they get up and try to wriggle out of it. They try to wriggle out of it by throwing a bit of invective around, trying to move the issue off themselves. That is the truth. The people who are driving the views of this government are people who do not want migration to this country. They are people who do not want to help those who are not as well off as they are. The government's policies in a number of areas have shown that in recent times. The member for Dunkley says 'We shouldn't let people have access to the courts.' The government have done their level best to try to cut legal aid and other mechanisms which will give people access to the courts. The minister, in his second reading speech, has said that the bill will 'limit' the judicial review of decisions made under the Migration Act relating to the ability of noncitizens to enter and remain in Australia. It part of this doublespeak we get from the government. It is part of the nice front from the minister, and part of the nasty front from the people behind them. It will not limit them; it will stop them. It will take away from the system, rather than enhance the system. The minister knows what he is doing; he is fixing up the wrong end of the problem. After all these things have been done, the minister says: 'Shock, horror! We really ought not let these people get past the immigration department's decision makers and into the courts and let some unbiased judge make a decision. We should not do that because, my goodness, the loose cannons in the court might actually take into account the circumstances of the person. We couldn't have that, could we? We couldn't have people getting a fair go. We couldn't have some unbiased decision maker reviewing the decision of the immigration tribunals or the immigration department. We must do something to limit people's access to the courts.' So, quite apart from the question of the constitutionality of what is being proposed in this legislation, there is a very important question of human justice: the right of a person, be they the highest or the lowest, to be able to seek a review of what has happened to them through the courts. It is difficult not to be a bit cynical about the government's intentions. The government is deliberately trying to take away powers from the High Court and the Federal Court. The problem that this government is having in a wide range of areas how is that they seem to be getting themselves offside with the courts. This is just one of a tranche of things we will see from the government over the next little while where the government tries to keep ordinary Australians out of the courts. The courts are looking at a number of things this government is doing and saying that they do not think that is fair; they do not think that justice is being delivered. We had the absolutely unusual spectre earlier this year of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) attacking the courts because he did not like the decision and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sitting mute, and then sitting is mute for longer. Finally, the Chief Justice of the High Court said last week that if the government wants judges to stay out of the political system, as they should, then someone needs to defend the judiciary, and that should be the Attorney-General. But the government goes a step further and says: 'One of the things we will do in legislation such as this and in cuts to legal aid is keep people out of the courts. We will stop the courts from making adverse decisions on these ridiculous pieces of legislation we are putting forward and decisions that we are making by limiting the right of people to have access to the courts.' In doing that in the cause of making savings and rationalisation, which is what the government is doing, they are giving no thought to the overall fairness of the system. Doesn't the government appreciate or even want to consider that the careful system of checks and balances in the present system is about trying to ensure that people are not dealt harshly with by harsh governments? We have seen the behaviour of ministers in this House in recent times where they keep saying to the opposition: 'We are not going to give you debating time, we are not going let you speak on this matter, we are not going to let you speak on that matter, because we won the election. So we should be able to do whatever we like to do. We are going to set new and higher standards. But we won the election and you are not going to be able to participate.' Unfortunately for the government, the courts are saying that they want to make some comments about what the government is doing, about whether legislation stands up, about whether decisions stand up. So the government adopts the same attitude there: 'We will gag the parliament. We have succeeded in doing that. We will now try to gag the courts.' One of the ways they want to gag the courts is by taking away people's rights to go to a court. The government says, and the opposition has said in the past, that there are people are extremely litigious, there are lawyers who try to make a living off the backs of people who are in desperate straits. All of us as members of parliament know the letters that we get from sleazy local solicitors who cannot fix someone's problem for them and then send them off to their local member of parliament after they have mucked up the case. Every member of parliament who has an electorate with a large number of people from non-Australian backgrounds knows that. The member for Kooyong knows it. I know it. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) knows it. Maybe even the member for Dunkley, on the sylvan shores of the Mornington Peninsula, might come across the odd such person from time to time. Maybe he has a guilty conscience. Maybe he did not handle some of those cases rightly in the past. Maybe he is trying to protect all the dopey suburban lawyers who muck up these cases and then send them off to us. We know that people get charged $500 and $1,000 for a letter from some spiv solicitor that we would do for free. I make a very loud noise in my electorate-I am sure that the member for Kooyong does and I know that the member for Batman does-telling my constituents and those people who are not Australian citizens but who still live in my electorate, 'Don't go to lawyers, come and see us as the first port of call; it will save you money and probably get you a better shake with the bureaucracy,' because the people who work in our offices, as well as ourselves, probably know far more about the immigration system than any suburban lawyer who will charge them $500 or $1,000. That is even being nice to suburban lawyers rather than to the people I think are the scum of the earth-the people who are a cyst on the system: the spivvy, spivvy immigration agents-because I have not found too many of them who are in any way, shape or form interested in anything except really wringing the last cent out of the families of migrants and migrants themselves. But the answer is not to stop these people's access to the courts. It is not to limit their access. The answer is to make sure that the who decision making process in the department is right, that the decision making process in the tribunals is right and, if the member for Dunkley is right when he says that this is all about billable hours, to crack down on the people who give dud advice in the first place. It is pretty easy. If you are some suburban lawyer who has charged some poor devil $500, $1,000 or $5,000 and that person has not got any justice, you know that when the case fails they will not be around to go and see the Law Society; they will be on the plane out of the country. It is a terrific way to get rid of the people who are going to complain about you. But the government says, 'Let's limit the victim's chances.' The government is saying in this legislation, 'Let's punish the people who may have had a mistake made against them.' If the government wants to say, 'Punish the lawyers,' I will come in here and put my hand up for it. Or, if the government wants to say, 'Punish the immigration agents double,' I will put my hand up for that three times. But the government says, as it is saying with a whole range of other things in this House, 'Let's punish the victims.' Like it has done with the unemployed: 'Let's take away their benefits.' Like it has done with poor people who want to go to the courts for other matters but have not got the ability: 'Let's take away their legal aid. Let's punish the victims. Let's go out there and say in those great little Anglo-Saxon seats like Dunkley, ""Look, we're putting the stop on migration. We've read the polls, we know you don't like it; we're doing our best.""' The truth is that that should not be done. The truth is that, in this case, there are people who have had genuine mistakes made against them, and to limit their right because they are non-citizens is quite abhorrent. The unfortunate thing about this legislation is that it not actually fix the problem that the government sees in this area. All it will be is a short-cut method in the interests of saving time and money and the applicants will not get a fair review of the case. To say that we should limit the rights of one group of people in Australia-those people who are non-citizens and who want to appeal decisions to immigration tribunalscan take you down a slippery slope if you are not careful. Because who's next? Who else's rights might we want to circumscribe? Who else's rights might we want to take away from them? Mr Martin Ferguson-Veterans. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As my colleague at the table says, the veterans might be next. So where does all this take us? I guess one of the things that the government ought to think about when it looks at these polls that come out of Mr Morris's office-which tell you that you should not like migrants any more because that is unfashionable; you should put up a bit of a facade that says that these people do not contribute much and that they bring their parents here and put them on social security so you have got to stop all this, feeding into the ignorance generated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)-and before it starts agreeing to pursue them is the effect that will have on the fabric of this country. Australia is a country coming to the centenary of its federation, the centenary of its life as a nation, in three years. We are one of the newest countries in the world. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, not all that many new countries have been created. We are a country of waves of migration. There are not too many people in this country who can say that they have more than five generations of their family here. As for those who can say they have more than five generations of their family here, those early generations were probably part of the criminal class of Britain. It is those waves of migration that have enriched this country. It is the waves of the compulsory immigrants from Britain and Ireland, it is the waves of free settlers from Britain and Ireland and it is those waves of significant post-war migrants from Italy, will Greece, Cyprus, the war-tom countries of Europe and Britain. It is those waves of migrants to Australia in the sixties and seventies from the Middle East and from Asia in the seventies and eighties. Each one of those groups has added something to this country. It is rather interesting that this legislation will limit the rights of non-citizens. Who is the largest group of non-citizens in this country? It is not the Greeks like the member for Kooyong. It is not the Irish like the member for Batman and me. Mr Martin Ferguson-Forget the Scots.",31
50,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Or the Scots. It is not the Italians. It is the British. The largest single group of non-citizens in this country is the British. So really the group of people who will probably be singly the most affected by this piece of legislation is all those British migrants who came here. Maybe they ought to go and have a talk with Mr Morris about that, because that probably was not in his poll when they said, 'This will be terribly popular out there.' That is all this bit of legislation is about: cheap populism. It is about trying to send a message to the people who have been inspired by the member for Oxley to believe that the government is really onside with them. I think there are parts of this area that need to be tightened up. The opposition said that and we said it while we were in government. But we believe that it should be tightened up at the front end, by the tribunal getting its decisions right and the department getting its decisions right, not by denying justice to someone who has been disadvantaged. The unfortunate thing about that concept of justice for the government is that, even if there are 10 dud ones and one right one, we should allow the system to be there to protect the person with a genuine grievance. We should not say, 'There are too many duds in this system. We are going to wipe the system clean.' The government should rethink this. They should ensure that they fix the system up at the beginning and do not limit the rights of any group of people living in this country to get a free and fair review of their case by a judge who is not part of a system. If we take that right away, then it is a right that we will start taking away from others. (Time expired)",34
51,Mr GEORGIOU,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) was introduced during the last sitting of the House, shortly before the commencement of the second reading debate on another bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997. Interesting as these changes may be, members will recall that the government moved some very important amendments to that bill prior to its passage through the House. In particular, the government responded to concerns about the possibility that measures included in the bill, which were designed to improve the speed and efficiency of the merits review process in the area of immigration, could have significant unintended downsides. In addressing these concerns, the government moved amendments guaranteeing the right of applicants seeking merits review of migration decisions to appear before the Refugee Review Tribunal and the newly created Migration Review Tribunal in person, subject to some appropriate restrictions. The government also modified the provisions relating to the reconstitution of the two tribunals by their principal members, ensuring that such a reconstitution could take place only after consultation between the principal members and the other members of the tribunals within set time limits, prior to which no reconstitution could take place. I am very pleased that the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), supported the bill. However, he did intimate that the opposition had played some significant role in having these amendments made. I regret to say that this was not the case; in fact, it is my understanding that, prior to the second reading debate, these concerns had never been raised by the Labor Party in discussions with the minister. So, much as I appreciate his attempts to boost the Labor Party's sensitivity in this regard, it is simply not so. What the opposition did trigger was the removal from Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) provisions relating to the judicial review of migration decisions. Identical decisions now form the basis of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5), which is before us today. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the capacity of the courts to scrutinise the legality of administrative decisions made by the executive arm of government is an established and important part of the Australian judicial system. The capacity is enshrined in section 75(v) of the Australian Constitution and is embodied in legislation such as the Judiciary Act 1903 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It does provide an important check on the exercise of power by the executive arm of government and offers those people who are adversely affected by decisions of the executive an avenue through which to test the validity of those decisions. As important as the principle of judicial review is, however, it is obviously not possible for the courts to review every disputed administrative decision made by the Commonwealth and its officers. Moreover, given the high cost of legal action, it is unlikely that a system which depended exclusively on review of decisions by the courts would provide a genuine avenue of appeal for those affected by government decisions. In Australia, particularly over the last two decades, these two realities have combined to shape a system of administrative law which relies upon a series of independent, informal and efficient review tribunals for dealing with disputes and in which judicial review is a last resort rather than a first port of call. This trend has been as apparent in the area of migration law as it has been in other areas. During its 13 years in office the Labor government made a number of very substantial changes to the migration decision making and review process, moving from an essentially discretionary system to one based on legislation and regulation, introducing independent tribunals to facilitate speedy and impartial review of migration decisions, and limiting the grounds on which applicants could use the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. While these measures have undoubtedly been positive in many respects, they have failed to make any real impact on the number of migration cases being taken to the courts. Indeed, over the past 15 years, there has been an appreciable increase in the number of applications being made to the courts in migration matters. In the early 1980s the Federal Court received only about 30 applications for review of migration decisions each year. By the end of the decade this had increased to about 100 applications per year. In 1992 it was almost 200, in 1995 it was almost 400 and by last year it was almost 700. This expansion reflects the fact that for a long time decisions about who could and who could not migrate to Australia were essentially left to the discretion of the minister for immigration, with the Migration Act 1958 giving no real hint as to how the various discretions could be exercised in individual cases. The fact was that very few such decisions were challenged. With the coming into force of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in October 1980, however, dissatisfied migration applicants for the first time had a - ubstantial mechanism for seeking judicial review of these discretionary migration decisions. This newly available avenue of review, when combined with the lack of any effective and independent system for reviewing the merits of a particular decision, not surprisingly did lead to a swelling in the stream of applications to the courts. These factors were very much in the mind of the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who said in his second reading speech on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989: The wide discretionary powers conferred by Migration Act have long been a source of public criticism .. . Accordingly this Bill proposes a decision-making system in which policies goveming entry to and stay in Australia will, for the first time, be spelt out in the migration legislative scheme . . . There has been dissatisfaction with the former review system, with the end result that in some instances, a number of applicants have considered that the only way they can gain an independent review of their case is to pursue judicial review. A new two-tier review system is therefore proposed in the Bill. In the very same speech, however, the then minister identified what would be the major shortcoming of the new regime: Immigration is an unusual jurisdiction in that delay in decision-making can work to the advantage of the applicant, at least where the applicant is already in Australia. Delay is compounded where the same matter is repeatedly reopened through fresh applications, reviews and appeals. However, the fact is that, by introducing a two-tier review system but leaving open the option of further appeal to the courts, the 1989 bill, when passed, simply expanded the opportunities for those so inclined to delay the final decision on their immigration application. Not surprisingly, the number of applications for review by the Federal Court doubled in the space of only three years, necessitating further legislative change. I want to emphasise that this legislative change was made by the former Labor government and it came by way of the Migration Reform Bill 1992. In introducing the reform bill, the new Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, highlighted the problem confronting the government, saying: There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country . . . Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here, even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law. This must stop. Reflecting on the debate and particularly the statements made by members on the other the side, I am stunned by the hypocrisy of those statements and by the gargantuan failure to recollect what happened only a couple of years ago. The bill initiated by the Labor government, when passed, restricted the scope of the judicial review of migration decisions to situations where the applicant had pursued all available merits rights reviews. Furthermore, the possible grounds for judicial review were limited to failure to follow prescribed procedures, lack of jurisdiction by the decision maker, inconsistency of the decision with the act or regulations, proper exercise of power and so on. But a large number of claims including the denial of natural justice, unreasonableness, taking into account an irrelevant consideration, failing to take into account a relevant consideration and bad faith were specifically excluded as grounds for review. The fact is that, as I have already indicated, even those restrictions failed to make any appreciable impact on the trend to an increasing volume of recourse to the courts in migration matters. There are a number of reasons why this could have been the case. Firstly, someone seeking to delay in the final determination of their case is unlikely to be perturbed by the fact that they can pursue judicial review only after all avenues of review have been used up and even then only on restricted grounds. Indeed, the fact is that, if delay is the objective, the existence of just about any grounds for review will prove sufficient to achieve this. Secondly, underlaying this judicial review mechanism, applications to the Federal Court have to be lodged strictly within 28 days, possibly leading to the filing of applications the merits of which have not been assessed. Thirdly, it strikes me as significant that the special 1 November 1993 announcement, which granted access to permanent residence to certain nationals of the People's Republic of China, Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia already resident in Australia, created an additional one-off batch of contestable cases. Whatever interpretation is put on the situation, since the introduction of the Migration Reform Bill the simple fact is that the changes ushered in by the legislation had no discernible impact on the trend of increasing recourse to judicial review. During the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 a fortnight ago, I highlighted the fact that this was an outcome which the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) had foreshadowed in 1992 when speaking on behalf of the coalition during the second reading debate on the Migration Reform Bill. I think this gives the lie to the assertions aboutthe minister behaving inconsistently, out of character and in a fashion which he had only recently thought of, because in 1992 he said: I am disappointed that the Government has gone to water in relation to this matter, because the system that it seeks to put in place still provides access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be able to be obtained. That is a matter of concem to us. I should say this was before anybody thought of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). He went on: We are concerned that the review system that the Government intends is one that all of the applicants will be able to access, whereas in our view it is only those who have arguable cases who should be able to obtain that access. Indeed, not wishing to do the minister injustice, going back over the Hansard records of various debates on immigration legislation over the last decade, I found about a dozen occasions dating back to 1987 on which the minister cautioned the then government about the growth in the number of migration cases being taken to the courts. Again, I think this is important because a significant number of statements were, as usual, loosely made by the opposition, critical of the minister, which have absolutely no foundation in fact. No, this is not a response on the minister's part to the member for Oxley, to the shallow, wrong-headed and dangerous arguments she makes. It is a consistent concern that he has had for a decade. And it is in line with this consistent approach that the coalition made a commitment prior to the 1996 election to limit access to the courts in all but exceptional cases. This bill implements that commitment by restricting the grounds for judicial review of migration decisions to the question of whether the decision maker was acting within their jurisdiction and power in making the decision. A court will still be able to review matters, but the available grounds will be confined to exceeding constitutional limits, narrow jurisdictional errors and mala fides. The intention of the provision is to provide decision makers with wider lawful operation for their decisions such that provided that they are acting in good faith, have been given the authority to make the decision and do not exceed constitutional limits then the decision will be lawful. The consistency of the coalition's position on this issue stands in stark contrast with the hypocrisy which we have heard today and we heard in the last sitting from the Labor Party. The fact is that over a period of years, through a series of legislative measures, the Labor Party when in government sought to limit the incidence of judicial review in the area of migration law. That is incontrovertible to anybody who has any respect for the facts and has got the capacity to read Hansard. The measures that they introduced differ from those now proposed by the government in degree. As the former member for Adelaide, Dr Catley, said in debate on the Migration Reform Bill 1992, the government was seeking to: . . . strike a better balance between the rights of people to clear justice and a fair hearing in our processes, as against the enabling of undue and extended delays in the lodging and processing of applications for residency status in this country ensure that the judicial review of migration was available only on grounds which take into account the special nature of decision on the status citizens . . . and provides for a code for decision makers, and decision making, to replace the current common law rules of natural justice. But, as we have seen in a large number of areas, Labor in opposition is a very different creature to Labor in government-by the way, with some good and some bad effects-and it is my understanding that it will be opposing the bill. But, more than simply opposing the bill, some members of the Labor Party have sought to attribute to it a range of restrictions which are in fact already in place and have been put in place by the former Labor government. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), speaking on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) a fortnight ago, and he has echoed it today, said: If you have only one process of review and something goes wrong in that review, then surely it should be possible to appeal to natural justice by going to the courts. If somebody has a reason why they feel the tribunal has made a determination which is contrary to natural justice or is contrary to their fundamental rights . . . all of these different reasons ought to be taken account of when looking at the possibility of going to a review process. I think it is worthwhile reminding the member for Calwell, and indeed members on the other side, that natural justice was specifically excluded as a valid ground for seeking judicial review by the Labor government in 1992. But the rewriting of history goes on. The fact is that, despite the misinformation and hypocrisy peddled by the opposition, I believe that this bill does bring about a reasonable reform, and a reform which is in the flow of movement of change to the Migration Act and migration matters. It should make a significant difference to the number of migration cases being taken to the courts, thus avoiding lengthy and costly appeals. But I would in conclusion sound one cautionary note. Of the 545 immigration matters resolved in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or in the courts in 1995-96, around 35 per cent were successful. As a ... proportion of a total of 3Y2 million visa applications, this is not a huge number. But putting even 159 people on the wrong end of of non- an incorrect decision on a matter which fundamentally affects their lives is something that I think all members would like to avoid. Given this, I think the success of the reforms proposed by this bill and their full realisation will depend in part on the reforms included in Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) delivering an increase in the quality of the decisions being made at the primary level by the department and by the review tribunals. I commend the bill to the House.",35
52,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997. Firstly, I would like to refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). The minister states that the bill gives legislative effect to the government's pre-election policy commitment to restrict the access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances. This is driven by a number of factors: the fact that there are extensive merits review rights in the migration area, and the growing cost and incidence of delays resulting from migration litigation. The tool that the minister has used to achieve this end is a privative clause-clause 474. I say as well that the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court. Despite the bleatings on the other side of the House, Labor have attempted to do this in the past, unsuccessfully, and one can understand their embarrassment at their failure. In 1989 they made changes which offered a measure of certainty through codification and statutory merits review rights. This was unsuccessful. In 1994, part 8 of the act was brought in. Again, this did not stem the flow of those seeking a judicial solution. The recourse to the courts is trending upwards. The level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, is at present going unchecked. It seems that migrants and their legal representatives are intent on remaining litigious. And why wouldn't they? It is one of the few areas of government where it is to the benefit of those seeking judicial redress to prolong the proceedings for as long as possible. The fact that many are entitled to Medicare and other benefits only increases their desire to continue to prolong the proceedings. We have also heard from the other side of the House phrases such as these: 'There is a cherished legal principle', 'Natural justice is being denied' - nd 'We will end up with a brawl with the High Court.' It has been made quite clear that the privative clause will not prevent any individual from going to the High Court. Their right to do so is not fettered by the privative clause at all. In fact, the High Court itself said that a privative matter is not really a narrowing of the review of the court but a broadening of the authority of the decision maker. I thought it was significant that the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) mentioned that natural justice was not so important to the Labor Party back in 1992 when they removed this as a basis for judicial review. It seems that hypocrisy is the order of the day. I would like to refer to some of the information put forward at the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee-and particularly to Mr Mark Sullivan's comments to that committee on Tuesday, 16 September 1997. With his very accurate overview of the difficulties in the migration system, he has shown that many of the claims made by those on the other side of the House are totally out of order. In 1996-97, of the 440 applications to the Federal Court, there were only eight successful applications. Sixty per cent of the Federal Court's caseload is to do with immigration. Significantly, 45 per cent of those who wish to go to the Federal Court withdraw before the hearing, indicating that what the minister said in his second reading speech is so: making an application to the Federal Court in these cases is often merely a device to delay for as long as possible. Of the remaining 55 per cent of cases regarding immigration matters that go to the Federal Court, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs wins 90 per cent. But, significantly, 95 per cent of the cost is not recovered. In fact, quite a number of those cases are funded by legal aid. The costs to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in 1996-which did not include the costs of h-gal aid, applicants' costs and the costs of the courts-amounted to $6.7 million. So the claims by those on the other side of the House that there is a cherished legal principle are simply not correct. People will still be able to take matters to the High Court. There is no denial of natural justice, because Labor has already done that-in 1992. There certainly will not be a brawl with the High Court, because their own interpretation of privative clauses is quite clear. Timing-the time that the present system takes-is another factor in the minister quite rightly moving to limit judicial review. Under the existing scheme, the MIRO takes 5Y:z months to review a matter, with 6,000 cases per year. The Immigration Review Tribunal takes a further 11 months. So, to settle applications, there is a total of 16 months under the existing system. Under the new scheme, the Migration Review Tribunal will take six to eight months. So we will have one level of review-as opposed to two levels of reviewwith an improvement in processing time of 12 months. And there is always the opportunity to go to the minister in exceptional cases. As Mr Sullivan said-so rightly-to the senate committee, since the days of Arthur Calwell through to the Hon. Philip Ruddock, we have been fortunate to have had men of exceptional integrity and character to make a fair judgment in those cases. What do the Australian people think of these changes? I can tell you what people in the electorate of Dawson think. Last year, when there was a significant payout through the immigration department which was settled out of court-and there was talk of some millions of dollars being involved, although that has not been confirmed-people in my electorate were furious. They rang the office and they wrote to me, and they said it was absolutely unacceptable that people who hoped to come to this country who were not Australian citizens-who were supposed refugees-were using and abusing the legal system in this country for their own ends. Australians are fair-minded people. They do not mind people being able to make a fair appeal with a fair cost attached, but they are absolutely furious to see their taxpayer dollars being wasted on what in many cases are unsuccessful attempts to have a judicial review bring down a satisfactory outcome. This finding is not only from my own electorate It is interesting that in 1988 there was a survey commissioned by the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Senator Robert Ray, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs declared in a news release that Australians supported multiculturalism. Certainly the survey seemed to indicate that, but it was very significant that in that survey a majority of respondents opposed programs which provided special assistance for ethnic organisations. Australians were very supportive of any moves to assist migrants to function effectively in Australia. They wanted to see English courses for migrant children and adults, information centres and interpreters in hospitals and courts. That was all quite proper. But they did not want to see waste. In fact, it is quite plain that the Australian people, fair minded as they are, are very happy to help those who genuinely want to come to this country. They are not interested, though, in waste. I would like to share with you some of those costs. As I have already said, in 199596, $7.4 million was spent by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on litigation for immigration and refugee decisions. As of 1 May this year, 590 active litigation cases were before the federal and high courts, 390 of which were refugee cases. The detention costs for boat people in 199697 were of the order of $10 million. In 199596; $16 million was spent on the asylum seeker assistance fund. It is significant that the estimated cost of keeping a detainee at an immigration detention facility in 1996-97 was around $137 a day. This year, to 30 June, 2,050 unlawful non-citizens were admitted to Sydney, Melbourne and Perth detention facilities. Total detainee days were 84,741. These are the people for whom Labor wants to allow 16 months under the existing system to settle applications. These are the people whom the Labor Party is willing to give unfettered opportunity to use judicial review. It is not interested in seeing costs and delays brought back to a fair and reasonable level. The total accrued administrative and property cost for detainee days is estimated at $10 million. The total administrative and property cost for Port Hedland was estimated at $20.7 million for the year, including $7.2 million for capital works. This is timely legislation brought in by a minister who is well aware of the demand by the Australian people for fairness. Australia is one of the most successful nations in the world in resettling migrants and refugees. Since 1945,5.5 million people have come from over 150 countries, of which over half a million have arrived under humanitarian programs. Under the existing minister, Mr Ruddock, we have a non-discriminatory migration policy. That means that anyone from any country can apply, regardless of their ethnic origin, their sex, their race or their religion. It is an entirely non-discriminatory program. The only criteria are based on the applicants' ability to meet certain selection criteria, which again are very balanced and fair. To the minister's credit, he has moved the program more into line with the expectations of the Australian people. There is a continued emphasis on skilled migration and less on family preference. For this financial year the total planning level of 80,000 comprises 68,000 in the migration program and 12,000 in the humanitarian program. This has declined from the previous two years when the total was 74,000 in 1996-97 and 83,000 in 1995-96. Over 35,000 places will be reserved for skilled migration in the 1997-98 program, compared with 2.8,000 last year. The minister recognises that Australians are appreciative of those who have the skills to very quickly assimilate into our country, to find work and to have a satisfying and fulfilling life in this country. I see that quite clearly in the seat of Dawson. I noticed that one of the members on the other side made a jibe about those members with Anglo-Celtic electorates. My electorate is blessed with people of many different ethnic originsItalian, Maltese, South Sea Islanders, Filipino, Chinese, Greek, and many more that I could not mention. Forty per cent of the descendants in the Mackay area are of Maltese extraction. They came here in the early days of the cane industry. They cut cane by hand, built their homes and reared their children. They have been a significant factor in the success of the sugar cane industry in North Queensland. We now have the Maltese Festival in Mackay, one of few in Australia, and it is very successful. Up in the Burdekin we have a large population of Italian descent. Again, they enrich that area with their culture and customs and make a significant contribution to the economic welfare and benefits in the Burdekin. We are very fortunate. We do not even talk about multiculturalism. Everyone in the area of Dawson is an Australian and a North Queenslander and jolly proud of it. They appreciate and share with us the cultural gifts that they have brought to this country. I am pleased that we have a minister who realises the benefits and richness that other cultures bring to this country and who is intent on delivering an honest immigration program that reflects the aspirations of the Australian people. I commend our minister, and commend the bill to the House.",38
53,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"in reply-I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the members who have contributed to this debate: the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the members for Longman (Mr Brough), Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Dunkley (Mr Billson), Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly). I have been particularly gratified by the quality of contributions by my colleagues on this side of the House. I think they have very effectively highlighted a number of issues which are important and which ought not be lost sight of in debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997. I want to make a number of short points to make it abundantly clear that the government's approach is not one to see bona fide refugees who have made claims in Australia being refouled. I am the minister, and I give instructions to my departmental officers and to the Refugee Review Tribunal members, whom I recently addressed, that it is my intention that people who have bona fide claims should be accepted. There should be no ambiguity about that. I would expect that Refugee Review Tribunal members would conscientiously discharge their obligations, as I would my department. The question you have to look at in the light of the very significant growth in the numbers of claims that have been made-and we expect something of the order of 10,000 claims for refugee status this year-is that refugee status is being seen as the basis upon which people who come here, essentially as visitors, intend to make applications to remain here either temporarily or permanently. I have been asked by the Senate to produce some information about the numbers of people who apply for visas at offices onshore. I will be making that information available, probably in the course of the day. To get some idea of the numbers involved, for 1996-97 in Sydney and Melbourne offices of my department 8,213 people applied for protection visas --1'he only other class that anywhere near it are those who apply on spouse grounds. Essentially, many of them have been properly visaed for that purpose when they have applied as a fiance. It surprises me that there is this enormous growth in protection claims. That is against something of the order of 500 claims that we used to see when the former government was first elected. The second point I want to make about that process is that delay for some people achieves their objective. If your objective is to be a guest worker in Australia, that is your principal objective-not protection but a guest worker. The more people who apply, the longer the delays. The benefit you derive from being able to put an application into the system is the opportunity to be employed, to work in Australia and very often to remit money out of Australia. That is the objective, and that is what you are able to achieve. In many cases you are also able to get access to Medicare benefits in Australia. If you need an operation or an expensive treatment, it can be carried out freely in Australia at the expense of Australian taxpayers. It is known that numbers of people come to Australia with that as an objective and lodge protection claims in order to be able to access those services. Interestingly, we sought to deny that opportunity and introduced regulations in the Senate to do so. One of the first decisions taken by the Labor Party and senators was to disallow that measure. We have in place for bona fide asylum seekers the provision for medical care and support. But, in addition, they get access to Medicare. That is something that the Senate has not yet been prepared to address. It is something that I hope the Senate will be prepared to address when we see regulations on that matter again on another occasion. A further point I want to make is that, in providing access to review here in Australia and access to our courts, we are providing access to people who are not citizens of this country. What we are saying is, 'You are entitled to every opportunity to exploit every loophole in the law-supported in many cases by Australian taxpayers through the legal aid gets system-and you are entitled to do it notwithstanding the fact that you broke our law in coming to Australia and that you are not a citizen of this country.' What we are talking about is the access to our courts by noncitizens. I want to conclude my remarks of a general character in relation to this matter by making one other point. I do have a discretion under section 417 of the Migration Act. It is a responsibility that lies very heavily on my shoulders, and I discharge it with care and a great deal of attention. At the end of the day not only do I tell my officers that I do not want anybody who has bona fide claims refouled but also, as the minister, I expect to be informed about any marginal case and for such a case to be able to be dealt with. Beyond that, we are talking about a situation where people come here and make claims that are being improperly pursued. Interestingly, the shadow minister suggested in his comments that he was unaware that claims were being improperly pursued. I think that comment can, at best, be described as naive, given the number of times I have commented on this issue. The fact is that we have a system which provides for a first-tier application to my department and a second-tier review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. Most of those people rejected go to the Refugee Review Tribunal, if you look at the numbers. Then we provide access to our courts. Access to the courts does not provide you with just one tier of review; it provides you with consideration by a Federal Court judge, consideration by the Full Federal Court of Australia as well as the opportunity to go to the High Court of Australia. It is a fact that people who have been unsuccessful at every level have taken the opportunity to take their decisions every part of the way. After that, they still have access to me. The question is: is that reasonable when you know it is being abused? I do not consider it is reasonable. The former government did not consider it reasonable. The member for Kooyong highlighted the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in pressing this opposition on a privative clause when it is abundantly clear that the measures that they enacted, which were designed to achieve a limitation on access to the courts, are failing. The current judicial review scheme-part 8 of the Migration Act-is seeing an increase in the incidence and cost of litigation. In other words, the applications are going up. The Labor Party sought to limit access to the courts. In 1994-95 there were 400 applications, in 1995-96 there were 600 applications and in 1996-97 there were 749 applications. A recent Federal Court case, the most important of which is Eshetu's case, has found that the grounds for judicial review which were sought to be excluded by part 8 of the Migration Act-the sections implemented by the former government-such as unreasonableness, are now available to review tribunal decisions. So where the former government sought to close it off, the courts have now overturned it. I have made some comments on this matter. The honourable member for Batman referred to an article written by Steketee in the Australian. He has pursued a little campaign against the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal in relation to some temporary appointments that were made. This matter was picked up by the honourable member for Batman. The fact is that the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, Mr Shun Chetty, was himself a refugee who fled South Africa because he was defending the rights of those who were in opposition to the apartheid system. He was a very distinguished officer of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and he was appointed by the previous government. I do have confidence in Mr Chetty. I am very surprised that the member for Batman would bring into question such a distinguished appointment, which was made by their government. I am giving the tribunal a further chance. As I said to Mr Steketee some time ago when he wrote the article, if we are going to have a system in which people are able to access genuine merit review then in my considered opinion access to the courts is no longer necessary. But if we are going to have a system in which the courts insist that they have a continuing role because of the constitution then I have to question whether or not we need an expensive merit review system. If the courts are going to provide the system of review through three tiers of review, why do you spend $15 million on a Refugee Review Tribunal providing independent merit advice? The member for Calwell picked up in the course of the debate a matter that I had raised about the tribunal itself. He was suggesting that it was appropriate to have a system which included both administrative and judicial review and that the UNHCR would support that. There is nothing that I have seen published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in its ex com decision making that suggests that there should be a multiple system available-in other words, administrative review on top of judicial review. It makes it abundantly clear that it expects it only in the alternative. The fact is that the system which we have inherited is one in which Labor's attempts at containing abuse have proven unsuccessful. We need a multifaceted approach to this issue. I have brought forward amendments, which the opposition has indicated it will support not only in this House but also in the Senate, to reform the administrative review arrangements generally. But they are not enough in themselves. What we want to do is to be able to restore public confidence in the way the review system is working. The Australian community should know that of the order of $60 million a year is on dealing with the review of asylum claims within Australia-detaining people who arrive here illegally-and their repatriation. The Australian people should appreciate that there is also a cost when people access judicial review . We spend all this money on a review system. In comparison, we spend of the order of $20 million on bona fide refugees who are taken from some of the most deprived situations around the world, in concert with assisting other migrants who come to Australia and their resettlement. In comparison with the amount of money we give to the UNHCR for its wider work, again the $60 million is infinitesimal. If we really care about refugees we would be about identifying those who have a need for our support here and we would be about giving more support to those who are abroad. But we would not be about this growth in refugee accommodation within Australia. At the moment of the order of 2,000 people are expected to come through that system in the course of the next year. These numbers bear no relationship to what we saw in times of genuine refugee concern when people were fleeing oppression in far greater numbers in other parts of the world. This is a new phenomenon for Australia. The Labor Party-I have to say this to the honourable member for Batman-is about giving comfort and succour to those who are exploiting these individuals and to those individuals who are exploiting the Australian system for their own advantage. I say to the honourable member that if you want an issue about immigration which the misinformed can exploit, you leave these issues open, you fail to give the government support on a bill of this sort and you leave open the whole system to be attacked by those who have other motives. I do not intend to leave the system flawed. I intend to ensure that the system is run with integrity. I intend to ensure that the former government's measures to contain abuse of our judicial system are given effect. I want to assure the House that I am intent on ensuring that those people who are genuine are accommodated and at the end of the day there is a spent safety net; and that safety net is me, as minister. I will continue to be conscientious about the way in which that is implemented. You find a very interesting picture when you look at the outcome in relation to refugee applications going before the courts of Australia. I have the figures here for 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Let me take the honourable member through it because I think it is exceedingly educational in terms of what we are spending and what the outcome is and whether or not the safety net of section 417 would work. The fact is that in 1993-94 there were 1,437 cases affirmed-that is, decisions taken by my department and affirmed by the RRT. There were 53 applications to the Federal Court. In relation to that one case that was remitted by the Federal Court to the RRT for a reconsideration, the reconsideration led to a refusal again. In 1994-95 a total of 2,333 applications were affirmed and there were 204 applications to the Federal Court. You can see the growth. Twenty-eight were remitted by the Federal Court to the RRT. As a result of that recommittal, four favourable decisions were obtained. In 1995-96 there were 2,741 applications, 282 cases to the Federal Court, 53 were remitted to the RRT and nine resulted in favourable reconsideration by the tribunal. In 1996-97 there were 3,497 applications affirmed by the RRT, 440 applications to the Federal Court and 61 remitted to the RRT as the court started to expand its view as to the natural justice issues it wanted addressed, and eight resulted in favourable reconsiderations. That is a total of 20 over four years. If you look at the Federal Court costs, you are probably talking about $25 million or thereabouts. I am just collating the figures; I think it is $7 million a year in court costs, so $25 million is probably fairly right, and we have less than 20 cases which involve favourable consideration. It puts it in some sort of perspective, I suspect. The privative clause is one that we believe will work. We have had opinions from very eminent counsel, admittedly-two distinguished former Attorneys-General, Tom Hughes and Bob Ellicott, from Richard Tracey, David Bennett and Dennis Rose. They tell me that it is constitutional and they tell me that it is legal. I have had advice that we will not be in breach of our international obligations through implementing this bill. I would hope, in terms of the sort of respect Sornlyay, A. M. that we gave when we were in opposition to the government's desire to deal with these matters sensibly and in the national interest, that the opposition would reconsider its position on this matter and recognise that there is a need for fundamental reform and that they are riding the wrong horse if they think there is any support in the community for the abuse that has been occurring in this area.

54,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill is not contentious in principle, and is supported by the opposition. The general thrust of the legislation is to protect the Australian tax base by tightening up the rules governing certain types of foreign source income earned by Australian residents. Of course, it also gives me an opportunity to recount to the House and to the Australian people some of the hypocrisy of the coalition on the issue of international tax avoidance. By way of background, the current regime for taxing foreign source income was introduced by Labor to ensure that Australians were properly taxed on income earned outside Australia. Prior to these major structural reforms, the payment of tax on overseas investments made by Australian residents was, in practice, largely optional. So, if you were Premier Jeff Kennett and were lucky enough to get yourself some Guangdong shares, you did not have to pay tax on the income that you got for them. In 1975 the Asprey committee recommended the introduction of a' comprehensive system of foreign tax credits under which the foreign source income of Australian residents would be subject to Australian tax and a credit given for the foreign tax paid on that income. This was one of the many taxation issues that Prime Minister Howard, when he was Treasurer, did not tackle. Equitable tax reform in this area of foreign income was not introduced by the Fraser government; it had to be introduced by the Hawke Labor government. After stalling on the issue for years the Fraser government announced in 1978 that, on both equity and efficiency grounds, it would be following the Asprey committee recommendation. However, in typical fashion, it abandoned the proposal in the face of opposition from big business in both Australia and overseas. So this blatantly unfair situation continued for a further decade until a decent government, a Labor government, had the courage and the conviction to reform and modernise the tax system, especially its international aspects. There were three factors contributing to this previous totally unsatisfactory situation. First, there was the deficient legal regime. Until 1987 paragraph 23Q of the assessment act governed whether or not foreign source income, except for dividends, was subject to Australian tax. This provision granted an exemption for foreign source income which had borne any foreign tax, including withholding tax. Indeed, income was exempt in Australia under this provision, even if it did not bear foreign tax but was not exempt from foreign tax. So, in practice, foreign investments were often structured to ensure some low level of foreign tax was paid, so that no Australian tax was payable. This regime made no distinction between the offshore source of the income; all investments were treated equally, whether sourced in a high-taxed OECD nation or through the most notorious tax haven. Of course, the distinction for dividends was largely academic because, if an Australian company received a dividend, it would be tax free anyway because of the dividend rebate regime. Secondly, the actual legal regime that applied generally applied only to income which was remitted back to Australia. So investment income could accumulate offshore outside the tax net quite legitimately for those with significant means. Meanwhile, honest PA YE taxpayers, who worked for their income, had to contribute their tax week in and week out. The third aspect of this system was the lack of information to enable Australian tax authorities to ensure that offshore investments were complying with Australian tax law, weak as it was at this time. There were only a small number of double tax conventions entered into by Australia relative to the current situation, and there was a generally poor level of international cooperation by taxation authorities compared with the current situation. So tax was, in fact, optional for those wealthy enough to be able to invest offshore. This anomalous situation was noted in the draft white paper on taxation reform issued by the government in 1985. At page 230 that report noted how unfair the prevailing system was. It stated: Revenue consequences aside, these exemptions are inequitable where the foreign income tax is lower than the Australian income tax that would otherwise be payable. It can result in markedly different tax levels as between two resident taxpayers with the same amount of income, in the one case derived from Australian sources, and in the other from foreign. The exemption runs counter to neutrality objectives, providing a tax induced incentive for investment abroad rather than in Australia. At the same time the exemption affords an incentive to avoid tax by arranging to give income an artificial source overseas. The reforms introduced by Labor to address these anomalies were comprehensive. They comprised, firstly, the foreign tax credit system. I indicated earlier that this was a minimum reform to. ensure some justice, which the Fraser government could not achieve, even though it knew it should have done so. When this legislation came before the Senate, the then opposition voted against the proposals-that is, the coalition yet again sided with those who were not paying their fair share of income tax. Secondly, there were the controlled foreign company, or CFC, measures. The controlled foreign company measures tax Australian shareholders on their pro rata share of a controlled foreign company's tainted income, the passive income-for example, interest, royalties, et cetera--or related party sales income, whether or not that income is remitted back to the Australian shareholder. This is an important measure to ensure that moneys invested in foreign businesses cannot be accumulated in tax havens outside of the Australian tax net and acts in addition to the foreign tax credit system. Thirdly, there are the foreign investment fund measures. The foreign investment fund measures apply to Australian shareholders who have an interest, but not a controlling interest, in a foreign entity, a company or a trust, that is not caught by the CFC or transferor trust measures. These rules ensure that passive offshore investment, say in an international share trust, cannot escape taxation where equivalent investment behaviour, say in the Australian share market through a domestic share trust, would be subject to Australian tax. Finally, Labor changed the law to introduce the transferor trust measures and other measures to ensure that the taxation of interests in non-resident trusts is fair. The transferor trust measures attribute the income of a nonresident trust to an Australian resident who has transferred some value to the trust, and that is a broad parallel to the CFC, or controlled foreign company, system concerning companies. So Labor has a proud record of cleaning up rorts in this area of international tax avoidance and the coalition has a disgraceful record. Given this background, the opposition was pleasantly surprised when we saw the discussion paper released in December of last year on the issues and the final decisions announced in the 1997 budget. The coalition appear to have accepted the reforms made by Labor. While I condemn their previous obstructive actions, I welcome this change of direction. The process of keeping the tax system fair is an ongoing process. Bills such as the one before us today are part of the day-today work necessary to keep the tax net as free from holes as possible while still encouraging investment. The aspects of the current arrangements that will be reformed by this bill include alterations to the current listing arrangements for comparable tax countries. Currently, both the controlled foreign company and transferor trust regimes and the foreign tax credit system use the same list of comparable tax countries which provides too lenient treatment for the controlled foreign companies. The list for the controlled foreign company and transferor trust regimes will be reduced from approximately 50 nations to seven, to be known as the broad exemption list, to reflect the fact that there are many countries on the current list that do not consistently levy tax on a truly comparable basis to Australia. These countries will be known as limited exemption listed countries. The foreign tax credit system exemptions will be available on both broad exemption listed countries and limited exemption listed countries. Secondly, there are measures which will purportedly reduce compliance costs. Various measures are being implemented which the government claims will simplify the rules concerning calculation of income from interests in the controlled foreign companies, thereby hopefully reducing compliance costs. Of course, the goal of reducing compliance costs in all areas of regulation is shared by the opposition so long as standards are maintained. I do note various comments reported in the media about the actual effect of this legislation from some of the industry experts who will have to implement it. For example, Mr Ian Farmer, a Coopers & Lybrand tax partner, is reported in the Financial Review of 11 July to have said: The changes will require companies to conduct more detailed annual reviews of their overseas subsidiaries and will increase compliance In addition, a tax partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Mr Duncan Baxter, is also reported as saying 'You've got to be joking,' when asked if the measures would reduce compliance costs. So just like the failure of the government to deliver on its commitment to have the compliance costs and red tape for small business, there is certainly some doubt as to whether this legislation will actually reduce the compliance costs of Australian firms investing overseas. Thirdly, there are changes to the treatment of branch income of Australian companies operating overseas. The branches of Australian firms in a limited exemption listed country will face tougher rules for exemption of certain types of income. The taxation of branch income of Australian financial institutions will generally be brought more into line with the treatment of Australian financial institutions under the CFC regime. In addition, there are various consequential changes and transitional rules in the bill which are supported by the opposition. For example, taxpayers will have the option to treat states emerging from the dissolution of listed countries, for example from the former Czechoslovakia, the USSR or Yugoslavia, as listed countries. Finally, there are changes to the foreign investment funds rules. The existing exemption for approved country funds is to be repealed and additional stock exchanges-Bogota, Colombo, Zimbabwe, Bratislava-are to be added to the list of approved stock exchanges. The estimated revenue flowing from all of the above measures combined is said to be $125 million in 1998-99, and $100 million in subsequent years. The opposition does not oppose these measures.",46
55,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it being the first opportunity I have had to speak whilst you are in the chair, could I offer you my congratulations and best wishes. Given its small population, Australia has a very complex foreign source income tax law-so complex that I sometimes wonder if the real aim of the legislation is to discourage Australians from making 'overseas investments'. costs. That was the comment of one well-known Australian tax expert in a recent editorial in the Australian Accountant in response to the government's proposed amendments to the foreign source income legislation. The coalition asserts that the amendments proposed in this bill will substantially simplify the current foreign source income laws and therefore facilitate Australian investment abroad. However, that proposition stands in marked contrast to the views of the tax fraternity, who are united, it seems to me, in their crjticism of many aspects of this bill. The controlled foreign company, CFC, provisions were first enacted in 1988 to prevent taxpayers earning passive or tainted income from escaping Australian taxes on income arrived at in those countries that do not tax companies at a level akin to the Australian company tax rate. The Income Tax Assessment Act has allowed for the development of a list of countries, which currently includes 61 nations, that are deemed to have a comparable tax regime at least for the time being. The government argues that this list is now excessively long and poses difficulties when monitoring the designation of tax deferred opportunities. This legislation will see this existing list divided into two. The first list, or the new list as it is to be called, will be severely restricted and will include only seven countries that are to continue to receive the current tax treatment. They are the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and France. These seven countries have been set apart by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the basis that they have demonstrated a commitment to taxing tainted income as well as implementing their own domestic CFC systems. The other 54 nations will be sidelined to the new repatriation list, which will see them granted a continued exemption for non-portfolio dividends, but the unlisted active income test will now apply to all their CFCs. A paper prepared for the University of New South Wales ATAX Masters of Taxation at a course earlier this year by the international tax group at Arthur Andersen has expressed concern at the inequity in the composition of the new list members. Firstly, Arthur Andersen suggests that the information paper about this bill failed to explicitly state the membership criteria for inclusion on that list. Arthur Andersen also indicates that, while the seven countries that have made it on to the list meet the inferred criteria, this is true also of many other countries that have not been granted new list status. Arthur Andersen has asked, 'Why has preferred taxation status been given to countries such as France while other comparably taxed countries, including Scandinavia and Italy, have not been given this status?' Another inconsistency is that, while all seven countries on the new list do have domestic CFC regimes in place-as seems to be one of the government's membership criteria-this is also true of another six countries that will be dropped to the repatriation list. As I have already said, the catalyst for the drafting of the two separate lists is the claim that the current system complicates the monitoring process. Yet the government has failed to adequately explain how two separate lists containing a total of 61 countries can be any easier to manage than a single list that has the same number of countries. Furthermore, as Ernst and Young has noted, no resources have been made available by the government to monitor tax concessions provided in the present group of listed countries. Ernst and Young suggests: . . . it is difficult to appreciate the inability to identify tax deferral opportunities as there are many pUblications which provide such information and tax journals which monitor new concessions. The Ernst and Young group goes on to note that successive federal governments have ratified a number of double-tax treaties over the past seven years and that these would have afforded the opportunity to review the tax concessions available to the treaty partners without the complex process put forward in this bill. However, the government seems determined not to take expert advice, insisting instead on further complicating an already incomprehensible tax act with these amendments. This bill does, however, bring about a number of improvements to the taxation of foreign source income. The Arthur Andersen group has suggested that one 'substantial benefit' of these amendments will be observed in the active income test measures for a controlled foreign company resident in a country that ceases to be a listed country. Currently, a CFC's active income in a listed country takes into account only the eligible designated concession income, and usually only tainted income-that is, passive amounts and income from certain related transactions with Australian residents-has been determined. The result of this has been that the tainted income ratio of a company in a foreign country usually works out to be either nothing or 100 per cent-nothing in between. This was not the intent of the original legislation and the proposed amendments will see this change for the better. However, the representatives from Arthur Andersen also note: The current anomaly will continue for the proposed CFC listed countries, and, in our view, the anomaly should have been removed long ago, and is not dependent on the changes proposed in the information paper. One of the more glaring inconsistencies in the bill relates to the coalition's supposed commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on business and investment communities. If we are to believe the government, one of the explicit aims of this legislation is to reduce the cost to business of - ompliance and yet, as Mr Robert Richards observed in the March 1997 edition of Australian Accountant: In an attempt to counter possible tax avoidance by a small group of taxpayers . . . the government will make the law even more complex for all those Australian companies carrying on genuine business in non-listed countries. Mr Richards went on to note that the government has failed to provide any evidence of the extent of the so-called rorting and that as a result: All such companies will be subject to complex and burdensome laws, designed to counter some unspecified problem, and to relieve the tax office of what presumably are its responsibilities. Ernst and Young have echoed that sentiment, noting that the government has offered only 'vague comments' in relation to the supposed compliance benefits that this legislation will confer on business. Their paper asks: Is it really anticipated that reduced with the introduction of a further 35 pages of complicated legislation? Anyone who followed the debate on the changes to the research and development tax concession last year will remember that the government was attacked by industry groups on this very same point. It is totally unacceptable that the Treasurer continues to refuse to substantiate his claims of widespread abuse of the tax system. How can the government expect anyone to take its financial impact statement seriously if it continues to refuse to provide information as to how it costs the extent of the problem? Ernst and Young have indicated that, while this bill is the first to bring about substantial changes to the controlled foreign companies rules since they were introduced in 1988, it does not simplify the rules. Furthermore, Ernst and Young have criticised the government for its failure to ensure that its proposals form a part of a consistent approach to changes to taxation legislation. Chapter 5 of the information paper indicates that the application of the existing active income test for unlisted country CFCs to those on the repatriation list will reduce compliance costs. Arthur Andersen, however, points out: More types of income are included in the unlisted CFC active income tests and this would be expected to increase the monitoring and calculation costs of Australian shareholders. They go on to observe that the likely impact of this change on Australian taxpayers with repatriation list CFCs will be a significantly more complex system of determining which credits are to be brought forward or transferred. This point was also argued by Mr Ian Farmer-I notice the previous speaker, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) referred to him-a partner at Coopers and Lybrand. Mr Farmer says that any Australian company that has a subsidiary in those countries on the repatriation list will be required to maintain a comprehensive analysis of their profit and loss accounts. In the 2 July 1997 edition of the Australian Financial Review, Mr Farmer is reported as compliance costs will be saying: In a number of cases there will be no income taxable in Australia but a lot of time will have to be spent mvestigating the accounts. Not only is there doubt about whether these amendments will reduce compliance costs for Australian businesses, but also some tax experts are predicting that they will actually compound the compliance burden. Another major inconsistency in this government's taxation policy can be seen in the treatment of tax sparing arrangements. On 26 March this year, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), introduced the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1997. That bill sought to enhance Australia's business opportunities in' Vietnam by providing tax sparing arrangements. for specific Vietnamese tax concessions. At the time, I noted that double-tax agreements are generally supported by Australian tax experts who acknowledge that they are an integral part of our internationalisation. The bill, which granted tax sparing relief for income from construction and infrastructure projects in Vietnam, was assented to on 19 June this year. On 24 December 1996, only three months before the introduction of that bill, the Treasurer announced the release of the government's information paper on the bill that we are talking about today. His press release read, in part: The government has reviewed the provision of tax sparing ... and proposes that Australia's position be that tax sparing generally not be provided in future agreements and existing provisions generally not be renewed on expiry. There is nothing equivocal in that statementyet only 12 weeks after that announcement was made the government introduced and ensured the safe passage of a piece of legislation that runs contrary to its stated position on legitimate tax concessions. Chapter 6 of the government's information paper on this bill justifies the withdrawal of future tax sparing arrangements on the basis that 'it provides opportunities for tax avoidance, especially in relation to highly mobile income and assets'. If the government was so concerned about the effects of tax sparing arrang-ments, why did it endorse the doubletax treaty between Australia and Vietnam earlier this year? The international tax group at Arthur Andersen suggested in a paper published in the March 1997 edition of Australian Tax Week that the government's reasons for rejecting, in general, all tax sparing seems an excessive reaction. That particular viewpoint is consistent with one published by Ernst and Young. They said: Rather than stating that tax sparing will not be provided in the future, it would (have been) more appropriate to ensure that the terms of future tax sparing relief are drafted to minimise avoidance opportunities. As another tax expert suggested, it is a bit rich for the government to specifically provide for tax sparing arrangements and then to condemn those who take advantage of them by labelling them as tax cheats. The Commissioner of Taxation does it time and time again and it has never been contested by anyone in this government. This government has a long way to go if Australia is to compete for increasingly mobile investment capital in the future. Multinationals will not be encouraged to locate their regional headquarters here until this government begins to show signs that it has a proven commitment to an integrated industry policy and a competitive taxation framework. Dr Vince FitzGerald, executive director of the Allen Consulting Group, was recently quoted in the Australian as saying: Making Australia a more competitive place to invest, do business and create jobs must be a key aim of reform and it must involve a shift from taxing business and earning to taxing spending. There are many flaws in this bill and it is therefore difficult to see how the changes it seeks to bring about will do anything to make Australia a more attractive place in which to do business. Additionally, it is questionable whether the benefits that will be brought about by this bill will outweigh the additional compliance burden for Australian businesses. For that reason I intend to register a dissenting vote at the second reading. I will close by quoting from the summary of the paper prepared by the Arthur Anderson group, which makes the point: The proposals fail to recognise the growing investment in the Asian region, and impose an unjustified additional tax compliance burden on companies seeking to take advantage of the opportunities in this region.",48
56,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (12.53 p.m.)-in reply-I would just like to make a few comments in conclusion and specifically address a couple of the issues raised by both of the speakers who have participated in this debate. The proposed changes will improve the effectiveness of the rules for the accruals taxation of foreign source income and thereby help ensure that investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons. Improving the effectiveness of the rules will also help stem the erosion of the Australian tax base that could otherwise occur through payments from Australian profits to foreign subsidiaries. In this regard, the changes are expected to result in a revenue gain of $125 million in the 1998-99 financial year and $100 million for subsequent years. The creation of a shorter list of countries for providing exemptions from accrual taxation could, however, result in some increase in overall compliance costs for companies and trusts in limited exemption listed countries. These costs are considered necessary to protect the revenue. Both speakers raised the issues about compliance costs and I would make these comments in particular in regard to the advice given to me on these areas. The CFCs conducting an active business in a country which ceases to be listed for accruals taxation purposes are also unlikely to be significantly affected by the changes because accruals taxation will apply only to tainted amounts and then only if these amounts exceed five per cent of the CFC's gross turnover. The compliance costs arising from the proposed changes will therefore be primarily borne by companies with significant amounts of tainted income and then only in relation to that tainted income. These companies are the legitimate targets of the CFC measures. I think that is a fair comment: they are a legitimate target for these measures. Efforts have been made to keep compliance costs under CFC measures at a minimum. It is, however, necessary to address tax deferral opportunities for tainted income derived offshore to ensure that competitive investment opportunities in Australia are not overlooked. The decision to not entirely abandon a list of companies for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation will continue to help reduce compliance costs. Many companies will not be affected by the changes because the proposed broad exemption list includes most of the major financial centres and countries where the bulk of Australia's investment abroad is located. It is also relevant to note that most of the additional compliance burden will be borne by the Australian controllers of foreign companies that derive significant amounts of tainted income. These companies are the legitimate target, as I have already mentioned, of the controlled foreign company measures. Compliance costs will not increase, however, for all foreign companies controlled by Australian residents. The changes being made to help reduce compliance costs under controlled foreign companies measures are likely to result in an overall reduction in compliance costs for most companies in broad exemption listed countries. The second speaker also suggested that more countries should be added to the broad exemption list. A robust list of closely comparable tax countries is crucial for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because the list is only as strong as its weakest link. If non-comparable countries are included on the list or if countries are listed but tax concessions not identified, tainted income, by its nature, can easily be diverted from Australia to take advantage of lower tax rates. The new broad exemption list comprising Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to significantly reduce compliance costs under the CFC measures because the list includes most of the major financial centres and countries where the bulk of Australian investment abroad is located. The countries on the proposed broad exemption list have a demonstrated commitment to taxing tainted income as it accrues and have tax rates and bases comparable to Australia's. These countries also have well-developed tax administrations and where tax concessions are provided they are clearly defined and transparent. Mr Rocher-Why not Scandinavia? They qualify.",51
57,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The second speaker, the member for Curtin, is also asking: why not Scandinavian countries? I do not have an answer to that here but I will seek an answer for you from the Treasurer's office. Question resolved in the affirmative, Mr Rocher dissenting. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Miles) read a third time. NA BILL (No.4) 1997 S'econd Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",52
58,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 is the fourth omnibus taxation bill for this year. It covers a variety of issues which can be grouped into anti-avoidance measures-amendments to the new simplified Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 aligning it with the former Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and a collection of other unrelated matters. Turning to the anti-avoidance measures first, I wish to indicate thai the opposition supports these proposals in principle. We do, however, have some questions on the precise impact of these proposals and we will be seeking to have these examined publicly in the Senate. The first area that the bill goes to is what is referred to as 'thin capitalisation'. The anti-avoidance measure involves tightening the thin capitalisation provisions. These provisions were in fact first introduced by Labor and limit the amount of interest deductions allowed to firms with foreign debt to ensure the integrity of the Australian company tax base. The bill is proposing change in a number of respects to the thin capitalisation regime, specifically that the general gearing, that is debt to equity ratio, is to· be reduced from three to one to two to one for non-financial institutions. The definition of foreign debt is to be broadened, the rules for trusts and partnerships are to be tightened and the specific anti-avoidance provisions are to be repealed. As I indicated, we support these changes in principle, but we are concerned that the rules may have some unintended consequences for some important investments. This is an issue that the opposition hopes the Senate, in its proper role of close examination of legislation, will look at it in greater detail. The second anti-avoidance measure in the bill concerns finance share rorts-that is to say, it contains proposals aimed at stopping abuse of the finance share provisions. Australian financial institutions-we do not know how many-have apparently been abusing the concessions available to so-called eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares by converting payments which are, in effect, interest into dividends in order to qualify for a tax exemption and for underlying foreign tax credits paid in other jurisdictions. The opposition strongly supports this measure and we question whether the proposal is adequate given the magnitude of the problem. The explanatory memorandum lists the savings from. these proposals at around $130 million per year, so presumably this rort has been costing Australian taxpayers that amount for some considerable period of time. Honourable members would be aware that, over the last few years, financial institutions-bankshave been reaping huge profits, have produced huge increases in their share value for their investors-we note that the National Australia Bank passed BHP, to the chagrin of first BHP investors-,-and have massively increased the level of f-es and charges levied on ordinary customers. We now find out that some of these financial institutions have apparently also been rorting the tax system to the tune of $130 million per year. This kind of blatant sham arrangement should be shut down and we will be supporting the passage of this bill. I also ask the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to detail to the House what action the Taxation Office has taken in attempting to collect this tax for the period prior to 4 February this year. Has the issue been taken to the courts to see whether these schemes are legally bullet-proof and, if so, what was the reaction of the courts? Wouldn't it in fact be the case that the general anti-avoidance provisions of part 4A operate to strike down an arrangement which is merely converting income from one form to another for tax avoidance purposes? And if the anti-avoidance provisions do not cover arrangements like these, doesn't this suggest that there is a need to review and possibly strengthen these anti-avoidance provisions? Our society functions on voluntary compliance with our taxation laws. Ordinary taxpayers pay their share because they acknowledge that this is the price of a decent society. Decent public services cost money and have to be paid for by taxpayers. They pay their fair share and they kriow that business is also supposed to pay its fair share. The schemes dealt with in this bill are examples where large businesses have not been paying their fair share. Those examples tend to undermine the vital system of voluntary compliance because people think, 'Why should I pay tax when I'm struggling to make ends meet, if large transnational financial institutions can rort the system?' The third area in the bill concerns the involvement of charities in tax avoidance. That has been occurring through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore. The bill proposes that the existing exemption for foreign located charitable trusts be terminated; the exemption provided to charitable trusts established in Australia be restricted; the exemption be removed for certain organisations-for example, trade unions and religious, educational and other bodies-which do not operate principally in Australia; and the exemption for non-resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax be also removed for certain organisations located offshore. The mere thought of tax exempt bodies being used for tax avoidance is an unpleasant one. These are bodies which have, ostensibly, been set up for public benefit, be it a charity, a sporting organisation, an educational organisation, a trade union, an employer body, et cetera. In recognition of the important roles played by these bodies, this parliament has provided tax exemption to the income of these bodies to enable their important work to be undertaken without tax penalty. It is frankly despicable that some accountants or lawyers have abused this system to enable tax exempt bodies to be conduits, either knowingly or unknowingly, for tax avoidance. A rort is a rort and it has to be stamped out irrespecexport tive of the players involved. All that said, when fixing a problem, it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that no damage is done to genuine tax exempt bodies in the process of sorting out the cheats. On this score, the government has failed miserably. Every member of the House probably received correspondence from alarmed groups, including religious groups, sporting groups and educational groups, after they saw the initial draft of the legislation earlier this year. That draft legislation proposed to penalise those groups who had virtually any offshore connection or activity. The proposed penalty was not minor or trivial but, rather, involved the loss of their income tax exemption. So, clearly, many legitimate bodies would have been significantly adversely affected by the original proposals of the government. It is true that, because of the outcry over the original clumsy approach to addressing this issue, the government has backed down. However, there is some considerable doubt about the extent of the redrafted provision. In particular, the education and training industry is concerned about the possible effects of the redrafted legislation. For example, International Training Australia-ITA-has written to the opposition expressing its concerns about the bill before us. ITA is a private company with its shareholding comprised solely of Victorian government enterprises. It was established to combine and coordinate the training and education capabilities of the Victorian TAPE system in large-scale overseas projects. ITA is very concerned that the provisions in this bill will impact on its members' current drive to increase the export of Australian educational services. These Australian educational institutions, for commercial reasons, often have to establish foreign subsidiaries or Australian subsidiaries which do not operate principally in Australia. These bodies are not engaged in tax avoidance, but they may be caught by this legislation and, hence, lose their tax exempt status. Clearly, this would be a poor outcome for Australia as these bodies are in fact engaged in earning income for Australia. There has already been a serious attack on public education by this government, and the opposition is very concerned by any legislation which would further inhibit the legitimate activities of the education sector. Some religious groups are also very concerned about the pote·ntial impact of this bill. For example, the Africa Evangelical Fellowship of Australasia sends missionaries to Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean, where they are engaged in a wide range of religious, humanitarian and social programs to assist the peoples of the region. This group has been operating for more than 100 years providing vital assistance to underprivileged peoples. All of these issues need to be carefully considered in the Senate to ensure that these important groups are not unfairly penalised. The Trustee Corporation of Australia is also concerned about the potential impact of the legislation from a different perspective: the impact on wills and on charitable bequests arising from wills. The TCA is concerned that the legislation may necessitate many trusts having to appear before the relevant state supreme courts in order to amend their terms to comply with the new regime. For example, amendments may be needed to expressly prohibit overseas distributions. This is a potentially complex and expensive process and may be more legally difficult than assumed by the government. Again, this is a serious issue that needs to be examined by the Senate to ensure that the correct balance is struck. The general issue of trusts and tax avoidance is a very sensitive one for the government. There is now widespread knowledge in the community that considerable leakage of revenue from the tax system arises through the use of trusts. In a speech to CEDA on 10 September the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, put the ·issue squarely in the court of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) when he addressed the issue of trusts and whether the current arrangements are appropriate. Mr Carmody made the point that, in some situations, trusts can allow the tax-free receipt of profits by beneficiaries which would have been taxable if they had been earned by companies and then distributed to shareholders. As he said, how can such a situation be fair and promote the efficient conduct of businesses? Mr Carmody pointed out that the tax office is in a unique position, given the extensive powers that they necessarily exercise, to make judgments about some of these issues. He said: As trusts have increasingly become simply an altemative business structure we believe it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration what should be the appropriate treatment for tax purposes. Both companies and trust structures can offer the advantages of limited liability and a capacity to split income (even more in the case of trusts). In these circumstances we think it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration the question 'why should not the starting point for this be that companies and trusts be treated the same for tax purposes'. Thus, for example, we believe it is fair to ask why certain distributions from a business conducted through a trust are capable of being received free of tax while the same distributions made from a business conducted through a company are subject to tax. For example, where a company pays a dividend out of profits which have been sheltered from tax because of, say, deductions for building allowances or accelerated depreciation, the dividend is taxable in the hands of the individual shareholder. A distribution in similar circumstances from a discretionary trust is free from tax. He goes on to say: Similarly, a distribution by a company from an asset revaluation reserve is treated as a taxable dividend whereas a similar distribution from a trust is generally not taxable. He further mentioned reports of one particular high wealth individual receiving a tax-free amount of $19 million in just one year. How can such a system be supported when part-time workers earning just over $100 a week have to pay income tax? And why is the government so reluctant to address the issues associated with the use of trusts? Why are we still waiting for the government's final legislation dealing with trafficking in trust losses? Labor introduced legislation into the parliament in 1995 to deal with avoidance practices involving trust losses. The then opposition refused to pass these provisions and delayed the measures in a Senate committee until the election. Since then, we have had two budgets which both announced further relaxations of Labor's fair proposals, but we still are yet to see this legislation before the parliament. The reason is, regrettably, obvious: the issue is too difficult because too many of those opposite have family trusts and hence have a conflict of interest in seeing the issues properly addressed. Mike Seccombe from the Sydney Morning Herald reported on 4 July that, according to the official registers of interest, 13 of the government's 27 ministers had family trusts. There is a real problem for the Treasurer if he wants to improve the fairness of the tax system: half of his ministerial colleagues will resist measures to increase the amount of tax that would be properly paid on their family income. Yet the Commissioner of Taxation has clearly signalled the direction that he prefers-comparable taxation of both companies and trusts. The response of the government to the review of the tax treatment of trusts will be a key indicator of whether the Howard government will simply be a re-run of the Fraser government, which let tax avoidance get completely out of control, culminating in the infamous bottom-of-the-harbour scandals. Alternatively, this government can continue the outstanding efforts of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments which introduced equity into the Australian taxation system. The problems of tax avoidance are perennial. Once one loophole is closed, advisers move on to the next one, so governments can never relax in their task of keeping the tax system fair. Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning's newspapers have reported that the Prime Minister Howard has ruled out a major crackdown on tax avoidance through the use of trusts, and quoted him giving certain assurances concerning these matters to the government party room. This is a matter of great concern, because it is pre-empting a review which the government itself initiated into trusts and the taxation arrangements surrounding them. It also appears to be an attack Costello, who has authorised this review. Indeed, according to the report in the Australian today the Commissioner of Taxation,. Mr Carmody, was believed to have checked with Mr Costello's office before delivering what the reporter described as 'his contentious speech on trusts'. So we have the Treasurer initiating the review, we have the Treasurer giving the Commissioner of Taxation the green light to raise these issues for public debate, and then we have the Prime Minister squashing him and saying, 'Oh, no, we're not going to get into the area of taxation of trusts.' That is entirely a regrettable development. For some time now, commentators have suggested that the treatment of trusts-and family trusts in particular-as companies for taxation purposes may be one approach to discourage the use of trusts for income splitting and other tax minimisation practices. This was an approach considered in the draft white paper entitled Reform of the Australian tax system, prepared by the Treasury for the tax summit back in 1985: This chapter has drawn attention to the increasing use of trusts to avoid the company tax arrangements and engage in income-splitting practices. A possible approach to this problem could be to tax trusts and limited partnerships on the same basis as companies. In the case of family trusts such a step would also substantially eliminate one major mechanism for income-splitting practices among family members. However, in view of the complexities involved in this area, further detailed study of this matter will be desirable, particularly in the light of changes to the classical system of company taxation. Later, in 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its report entitled Follow the yellow brick road, also recommended that there should be a system of taxing trusts and companies in a uniform manner. This report was issued after the introduction of the company imputation system. Recommendation 3 of this report stated: The Committee recommends that there should be a move towards a system of taxing trusts and corporations in a uniform manner, with tax payable on the trust's net income at the company rate of tax and credit given proportionately to beneficiaries for on· Treasurer income tax paid. The Treasurer announced in his 1997-98 budget speech that the government would issue a discussion paper later this year with a view to reviewing the taxation of trusts generally. Budget measures 1997-98 states that this review became necessary as information gathered by the Australian Taxation Office High Wealth Individuals Task Force has identified the use of complex trust structures for tax avoidance or undue tax minimisation. It adds: The Government is concerned to ensure that the taxation provisions relating to trusts deal ately with the modem day usage of trusts and do not permit tax avoidance or undue tax minimisation. It will be necessary to review the taxation of trusts accordingly. Indeed. The 1996-97 budget provided additional funds in excess of $19 million to the Australian Taxation Office to establish this task force to improve the compliance of high wealth individuals, who it was claimed had with aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements put at risk revenue estimated at $800 million per year. The prevalence of this form of tax minimisation and the extent of revenue at risk was disclosed on 11 February last year by the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, in a press release under the heading 'Increasing the surplus and funding: Labor's election commitments'. Although $800 million per year was the estimated income from tightening up the tax minimisation schemes of high wealth individuals, the 1996 budget papers apparently gave up on a lot of this revenue. Thus, 199697 Budget Paper No. 1 only provided for additional revenue of the order of $100 million in 1997-98 from high wealth individuals, with no figure being put on the possible intake in 1998-99 and the following year. It is significant that the financial implications of the taxation of trusts in the 1997-98 Budget Paper No. 2 do not indicate any additional revenue-not one dollar-from the activities of the High Wealth Individuals Task Force in the years 1997-98 to 2000-2001. It would appear that even the $100 million which the 1996-97 budget papers anticipated would be realised in 1997-98 from the investigation into high wealth individuals is in doubt. The Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office are clearly reluctant to publish an estimate of the revenue that the activities of the task force will generate in 1998-99. This reluctance may be attributed to the uncertainty as to the extent to which high wealth individuals with family trust structures would be able to utilise losses under the concessions announced in the 1997-98 budget. An additional factor contributing to this reluctance is probably the awareness that the long lead time between the initial announceappropri- ment in February 1996 and the yet to be enacted measures to discourage such avoidance or minimisation practices may well have afforded high wealth individuals an opportunity to reorganise their affairs to avoid any likely changes in the law. In other words, if the government closes the stable door, it will be after the horse has bolted. Given the comments of the Prime Minister as reported this morning, there is a real question mark as to whether the government indeed intends to close the stable door at all. If we go back, the government had demonstrated that it was conscious that timely legislative action might be necessary even before the completion of the proposed review of taxation of trusts, to prevent the further erosion of the tax base by the use of trusts. Budget Paper No. 2 says that before the review the Treasury and the ATO will release a discussion paper. It concludes by saying: The Government reserves the right to take earlier legislative action to prevent tax minimisation or avoidance by the use of trusts. We will see, won't we? In his 1997-98 budget speech the Treasurer also said that the proposals in the exposure draft of February 1997 related to the treatment of trust losses would be modified so that they did not affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. If we go back one year earlier, to the 199596 budget of 9 May 1995, the former Labor government announced measures to restrict the transfer of ownership or control of trusts that had accumulated losses. These measures were intended to reduce the opportunity for tax minimisation or avoidance by taxpayers with high marginal rates of tax who might acquire such trusts and inject income from other sources with a view td utilising the losses and thereby reducing their marginal rate of tax. On 10 February 1997 the government released exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. The budget measures of 19971998 provide the outlines of the modifications to the draft legislation on trust losses. In the 1997-1998 budget speech the Treasurer stated that the government had changed the draft legislation and the legislation dealing with the use of trust losses would not now affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. The measures included the modification of three crucial definitions in the exposure draft: definition of 'outsider', definilook tion of 'family member' and application of the definition of 'benefit'. The exclusion of family groups from the trust loss provisions will probably reduce the additional revenue to be expected from these trust loss measures. It is significant that the 1995-1996 proposals the additional revenue in the first year was $90 million, rising to $185 million in the second year. However, under the 1997-1998 proposals the additional revenue in the first year is a mere $5 million, rising to $15 million in the second year. So these changed definitions are likely to retain the attractiveness of trusts as a tax avoidance device, given the scope for income splitting and tax minimisation and the availability of trust losses to family groups. We will await the final bill in this area with great interest. Let me also express concern about the fact that the Taxation Office is reducing its staff levels. We have seen evidence of some 50 positions in Melbourne and Sydney being shed. As a result, these 50 staff in the Australian Taxation Office are involuntarily being made redundant in Victoria and New South Wales. At the same time the Taxation Office is telling taxpayers that, due to limited resources, they cannot expect to have their amendments looked at for some time. It is worth noting that this includes taxpayers who, due to a Taxation Office error, have received a debit assessment instead of a refund as expected, and that in tum is due in part to the fact that they have staffed new processing centres with inexperienced temps at the expense of full-time permanent staff. The level of the staff earmarked for redundancies is the same as those who will normally process these returns. While it is not clear where the sacked staff will come from, it is almost certain that some,for example, will come from the Moonee Ponds office located in my electorate. The sacking of those 50 staff means not only that people cannot get their returns in time but also that the Taxation Office does not have the resources that it needs in order to protect the country's revenue base. It is simply not good enough to say that the taxation base is being eroded so we need to at a GST, we need tax reform, when the government is failing to make adequate preparation for protecting the revenue base and is getting rid of staff in the way that it is. I conclude, as I began, by indicating that we do not oppose the measures which have under been brought before the House, but we think that the government needs to do a lot more in the area of preventing tax avoidance and protecting the nation's revenue base. Debate (on motion by Miss Jackie Kelly) adjourned. NA Travelling Allowance",53
59,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-It is with regret that I inform the House that I have accepted the resignations of both the Minister for Transp_ort and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull). For the information of honourable members, I table the two resignations. I also announce to the House that I have asked the Auditor-General to conduct an inquiry in the following terms: The Auditor-General to conduct an inquiry as a matter of urgency into the following matters relating to travel allowance claims for members of parliament: (1) whether the travel claims made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for the period 11 March 1996 to 18 December 1996 were made in accordance with established procedures; (2) whether the amended return for travel allowances submitted by the Hon. John Sharp on 26 May 1997 was processed in accordance with established procedures by the Department of Administrative Services; and (3) whether the Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development andlor their officers acted appropriately to ensure that due process followed in relation to the processing of Sharp's travel claims. I also inform the House that I have asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to act as Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) to act as Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the appointment of new ministers to replace the two resigned ministers. I also inform the House that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) has, in the normal course, repaid a significant sum of money, but in circumstances that did not involve any suggestion of an improper claim or a claim to which he was not entitled. I table for the information of the parliament a signed statement from the minister, which I fully accept, explaining the circumstances of it. I also inform the House that in relation to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), as I think is already known, there was a repayment of $1,715. This related to three separate times: an amount of $860 on 3 March 1997; $685 on 26 May 1997; and $170 on 28 May 1997. The amounts repaid related to two inadvertent overnight claims-one on 21 April in relation to Norfolk Island and one on 29 July at Katoomba. The balance relates to the minister refunding 52 nights spouse entitlement-and I ask the House to listen carefully to this-on the basis that the minister did not believe he had incurred additional expenditure in relation to those particular nights, even though entitled to the payments, and 10 nights refund of the differential rate paid as a member rather than as a minister, even though entitled to the higher rate. In other words, Mr Scott has been absolutely meticulous in his honesty. Clearly, the greater part of Mr Scott's repayment need not have been repaid at all. I accept that and I think all honourable members ought to accept that. I will take the opportunity of saying a few words. First of all, I would like to record my gratitude to the Minister for Transport and was Regional Development for the absolutely Mr outstanding reforms that he has been responsible for over the last 18 months. Can I also say of him and also of the now resigned Minister for Administrative Services that, in all of my dealings with both men, I have never had any reason to doubt their personal honesty or probity. In appointing the inquiry that I have mentioned, not only have I acted swiftly and promptly and appropriately but also I make no judgments at all about the outcomes of those inquiries and I make no judgment about any views concerning their behaviour in relation to those events in terms of integrity and probity. I have accepted their resignations and I believe that their resignations are appropriate because, firstly, given the magnitude of the adjustment that was made, it ought to have been disclosed at th- time and, secondly, given the magnitude of the adjustment, there should have been a pursuit of a more detailed formal explanation for the reason for the discrepancy. What I have done is in stark contrast with what was done on earlier occasions by those who sit opposite. So I hope we are spared the crowing hypocrisy that might otherwise be forthcoming. I have acted to uphold not only the reality of standards but also the perception of standards, and that is why what has happened has occurred. I repeat, Mr Speaker, that I make no judgment about the outcome of the inquiries. I should also inform the House that I was not informed of these matters when the adjustments were made in May of this year. Given the circumstances, that also was an oversight which should not have occurred. I again take the opportunity of saying that I have very much valued the contribution of my colleagues. I think it is regrettable that these events have occurred, but there was really no alternative. The public is not only entitled to the reality of honesty and probity but must also not be left in any doubt in relation to perceptions. I do not believe, on the information available to me at present, that either man has acted with any lack of probity or honesty. But I do believe, for the reasons that I have outlined, that their resignations were necessary. . In those resignations being provided and in my accepting them, I have upheld standards which have not been matched in this country for a very long period of time and which were certainly not the standards adopted by my predecessors, who were prepared to embrace the dying carcasses of condemned ministers rather than face the reality of the responsibilichance ties that ministerial office brings and establish a proper inquiry. I again contrast what my government and my colleagues have been willing to do and the standards we have been willing to uphold compared with the miserable performance of our predecessors, particularly in relation to a former Labor senator from the state of Queensland. I again thank my two colleagues. It is a regrettable day for them and for the government. But I believe that, given the responsibilities that we owe to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the people of Australia, it was the appropriate course of action, and I commend it to the House.",58
60,Mr SHARP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I tendered my resignation to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier today, and I concur with all of the comments the Prime Minister made a few moments ago. My reason for tendering my resignation was to avoid the government experiencing any embarrassment or any distraction from the good work that it has been doing for 18 months. This is a good government, and it is led by two very good people: John Howard and Tim Fischer. I believe that an event such as that which has happened in the last 24 hours will only distract from the work of this government and those two good leaders of it. So I made my resignation available to the Prime Minister earlier this day. I thought I might take the opportunity to explain that I deny any impropriety in the way that this matter has occurred. Those who know the details of how these travel allowance claims have been made will know that at the first opportunity to correct them. I did. I did so voluntarily. I informed within 24 hours of the corrections that were needed to be made. I offered to repay the money as soon as it was toted up for repayment. I make the point again, Mr Speaker, that this was a correction that was offered to every minister of the government and every former minister of the former Labor government. I took that opportunity. It was the first I had to make those corrections, and I did so voluntarily. I believe there was no impropriety. Indeed, I believe that, unless ministers are given the to correct their travelling allowance alaims, the system does not work properly; and I took up that opportunity. I also take this opportunity to say that I am very proud to be a part of this government and, particularly, to have been Minister for Transport and Regional Development for the last 18 months. In my particular portfolio area, there have been a number of very significant and important reforms undertaken. The Prime Minister has, on occasion, referred to some of them. With respect to the reforms in our rail sector, only just recently we have seen for the first time in more than 100 years all Australia's states and territories agreeing to the establishment of one national rail system-the equivalent of one national rail highway system. We have seen for the very first time private sector rail operators come onto the system in Australia. In aviation, we have made some very significant reforms as well. Sydney airport is one which the Prime Minister is very interested in, as I know a number of other members of parliament are also. When we came into office, Sydney airport and aircraft noise was a major problem for people living in Sydney. It is now much less so. Indeed, I believe the reforms there-the reopening of the east-west runway and the new long-term operating plan-have brought enormous relief and benefit to the people of Sydney. With regard to other reforms in aviation, there is the privatisation of the Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports and the subsequent privatisation of the other 15 airports which I, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), have put on the market. I believe those will see enormous gain. In road transport and in the roads area, I know with respect to the Pacific Highway that a number of my colleagues in the National Party who represent the area up there and, of course,others in southern Queensland will be enormously proud. I am enormously proud of the fact that, for the very first time, we are now putting funds-$3.1 billion in partnership with the two state governments-into upgrading the PaCific Highway. The black spots program, which is a terrific scheme that should never have been axed by the former government, will save 74 lives per annum, on the figures that we have accumulated. This year we will have the lowest road toll in more than 25 years. I think the black spots program and other works will help contribute to that lowest road toll in Australia. In maritime, we have made a number of important changes. For the record, when ANL is privatised, you will not give it away; I assure you of that. You will get a good value for it because in the last 18 months it has been reformed dramatically and is performing extremely well. We did away with the transTasman accord, and I think the road is now clear for major reforms on the waterfront. I am very proud of the shipping reform group's recommendations for reform of the shipping industry. Those are but some of the reforms that we have seen undertaken in Australia in the last 18 months in the transport area. I again thank the Prime Minister for the support that he has given me throughout this 18-month period. To my friend Tim Fischer and to my colleagues in the National and Liberal parties, I say thank you all very much. To my staff, who are terrific, I say thank you. To my wife and children, whom I love, thank you.",60
61,Mr JULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-For the same reasons that have been outlined by my colleague Mr Sharp, I tendered my resignation this morning. I would like to put on record that I believe I acted the advice I was given in relation to this matter. I am delighted to see that the Auditorseen. General will be going through the system to check out what exactly went on, and I am confident that there will be no difficulties there. It has been a very great privilege to serve as a minister of the Howard government for the last 18 months. I suppose that the Department of Administrative Services is not one of those departments that gets much of a profile, but the reforms that have been undertaken in the last 18 months, in terms of the way government does business and in terms of our privatisation program, have been really quite remarkable. I would like to place on the record my thanks to my departmental officers and, in particular, to my personal staff, for giving me all that assistance during the last 18 months. I suppose it is rather ironic but, seeing that I am not going to get a question today, I would like to inform the House that the new accounting system for members' entitlements came into operation on 15 September. I believe that the reformation that we have can undertaken in this regard is going to mean that all members of the Senate and the House of Representatives can be quite confident that the reporting system is going to be open and transparent. I hope the disease that has spread through both Houses over the last 12 months or so in terms of travel rorts will now be gone forever. The KPMG report. indicated that the vast majority of members of parliament are honest. What has happened in the last 12 months is that the reputation of senators and members has been sullied, and that is the last thing I want to see happen to this institution. Prime Minister, may I put on record my thanks for the support that you have given me. I trust that the reform programs that we have undertaken in terms of the way government does business-the fact that we now provide something like $500 million worth of government business out to the private sector and the fact that better than 10 per cent of government business is going to small businesses-will continue, because I believe that on the Howard government is the greatest reformist government that this country as ever",61
62,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave- Mr Speaker, firstly, all of us are human beings and all of us aspire in this place for opportunities to serve in the way in which the two resigned ministers have served. Therefore, all of us must feel for them humanly today in the Circumstances in which they find themselves, no matter how deserved we might think their situation. Nevertheless, you struggle very hard in politics to attain the positions that they attained and you must feel sorry for people who find themselves in that situation. Nevertheless, the operative point in my remarks is that these are resignations that were necessary, and the resignations of themselves do not answer questions. I hope the Auditor-General will answer those questions, though there are some that, I would say almost immediately, lie outside his frame of reference and really do need to be considered. Before going further on that, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrapped himself and his standards in the remarks that he made and made some gratuitous comments about us. Let us be absolutely clear on this: these events today would not be happening but for an article by Laurie Oakes. It is as simple as that. If Laurie Oakes had not put these matters before the Australian public, these events would not have been happening here. So let us take that as the first point of correction. This is not a self-generated set of resignations. That is the first point that needs to be made about it. Second, he chose to mention the situation of Senator Colston, who was permitted to pay resources back likewise in circumstances where there was no publicity. The actions taken at the time were the exact equivalent of actions taken by the previous governmentthat government immediately prior to oursand was in total accordance with that. So some sort of notion that something special and unique was done back there is revealed as a nonsense by those facts. The third point that can be made about those particular standards is this: whilst within a day of the public revelation and several days of the revelation to the Prime Minister these individual ministers have in fact been sacked, that is not the pattern of performance here. The Prime Minister referred to carcasses twisting slowly in the wind and not wanting· to have carcasses twisting slowly in the wind. If he had been around at the end of the last parliamentary session instead of in the United Kingdom, he would have seen them swinging in a hurricane in that particular instance. There are still ministers in this government who should have gone on a normal set of standards and there are other ministers who took a long time a-going, as in the case of the first resignation. What makes this Pr-me Minister unique in the experience of past prime ministers is that he has managed in the first 18 months of operation to have more than half a dozen cases where ministers should have gone and in fact six have gone in these circumstances. That is a high casualty rate by any set of standards, and it reflects the unique problems of this government. The Prime Minister reminds me so much of that old Russian story of the couple in a sleigh being pursued by wolves. They have a bag of apples on the back and, as the sleigh charges on, they throw an apple out every now and then to stop the wolves as they come after them. In this particular case the Prime Minister would have had the wolves coming for him because, on the advice to us-and this is something that can be cleared up in question time-he knew about these circumstances on Monday, was briefed on Monday as far as he was concerned, and yet managed on Tuesday, the day after it, to declare full confidence in his minister for transport. That immediately raises a substantial question for the Prime Minister to answer in due course. It was only when it was absolutely clear cut to him that he was going to be overrun that his 'full confidence' changed to 'I demand your immediate resignation.' Then we also have the terms of reference for the Auditor-General. I suggest strongly to the Prime Minister that he look more broadly, at least in the case of Minister Sharp's pattern of travel claims. Minister Sharp's pattern of travel claims differs not one wit from the last two years when he happened to be a frontbencher. In fact, it was slightly lower. Last year there were 156 claims. A claim was submitted for every single parliamentary sitting night on a Thursday in Canberra and every single Sunday immediately prior to the parliamentary sitting beginning. If you are talking about patterns of behaviour in relation to this, then a pattern of behaviour has been established in that regard. The government is once more covered in soil from its performance in this place. There have been six ministerial resignations in 18 months of existence and at least three or four other ministers who should have gone on misleading the House, misdeclarations of their pecuniary interests or conflict of interest. have had a situation of truly gargantuan proportions when it comes to propriety here. Then there is the Prime Minister knowing full well that, were it not for the fact of Laurie Oakes's exposures, there would have been no resignations on this occasion either. Let us be absolutely clear about all this unction in this place from the Prime Minister on his standards. If Laurie Oakes had not produced that report and given notice to the various ministers' officers that he was working on it, there would have been no resignations here today. I suppose Laurie can chalk that one up to himself, but the person who cannot chalk it up is the Prime Minister in the situation in which he finds himself. I will conclude where I started off. As I say, all of us here, as well as politicians and partisans, are also human beings and we are saddened to see the circumstances in which other people find themselves, and certainly the circumstances in which the two ministers find themselves. I wish them well in their future careers, what remains of their parliamentary careers. I express our sorrow for them that they should have left on such a poor note. NA BILL (No.4) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (1.53 p.m.)-I rise today to debate the fourth taxation amendment bill of this year. I wish to make reference to a few of the comments made by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who spoke previously on this topic. He seems to be very jealous of any high wealth individuals in this country. His mean-spirited, money grubbing, small thinking, bullying tactics are more appropriate to a school yard than to a global economy. He makes reference to a high wealth individual who in one year avoided $19 million in tax. I imagine that in that same year he would have paid at least $1 million in tax, which is certainly a lot more than any other individual I know is paying in tax. It reminds You me of the position of Steffi Graf, who has been hounded by the German tax office for $2 million and is considering surrendering her German citizenship, given that over her tennis career she has paid $41 million in tax to the German economy. Numerous other individuals have given up their dedication to their nation and country in order to get out of avaricious, money grubbing tax regimes that do not encourage investment or a climate of wealth generation and do not encourage a nation of people to progress within a global economy and seek to further advance themselves by staying within the OECD nations rather than falling out the bottom. The honourable member made reference to the NAB during his comments on thin capitalisation. In fact, the NAB is a financial institution and as such is not affected by the thin capitalisation provisions of this act. This legislation is really looking at allowable foreign debt and foreign equity gearing ratios for taxpayers who are not financial institutions, that is, anything but a bank. The banks still retain their 6: 1 gearing ratios. That is obvious, given that by very definition they are in the business of lending money. Generally they have borrowed money in order to loan money and thereby make a profit. That is their business and they are exempt under this legislation. The other interesting amendment in this bill is the provision relating to electronic lodgement and electronic funds transfer. It allows the income tax law to provide for the electronic lodgement of tax returns. In fact, this is already a current administrative practice for tax agents right throughout Australia. It is very efficient and expedient and is also a comprehensive resource that is easily traced back to source. That sort of technology is throughout our society today and is something that we should be pursuing as a nation. We should be looking at reducing our administrative costs, our paper shuffling and the number of bureaucrats who stay in one position and transfer a pile of papers from one side of their desk to the other. These days it is up to the taxpayers, individuals and citizens of Australia to have greater electronic access to their government departments, to referenda and to a number of other issues that will be coming up in the future. It must be recognised that the electronic lodgement of tax returns is the way to go. It can be done far more accurately than being done by the human eye and it becomes simply a matter of operator error. It has enormous applications right throughout other government departments, not only Treasury. This sort of technology can be moved into the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Social Security. We could end up with a situation, as is coming up in child care, where we have smartcards doing all the returns and the record keeping for everyone into the future. The technology available in Australia, our initiative and our national wealth in the ability of people to come up with new ideas are things that should be encouraged by supportive tax regimes. These tax regimes should support investment and growth and encourage global multinationals to move cash to Australia and invest in Australia, our children, our future and our future electronic base. This is where the future of Australia lies. Ireland has gone a long way with the structure of its tax regime in order to attract those sorts of industries. In that nation they have no withholding tax for information technologies. They have a 10 per cent tax regime guaranteed to the year 2010 and R&D royalties are tax free. We should look at the year 2010. I want Australia to be in the top 10 in everything by the year 2010. That is where we must head. That is our children's future, but it will only occur under a tax regime that contains elements which are open, not to abuse, but to investors. People must be able to conduct their tax affairs under the legislation without suddenly having the mat pulled out from under them when Carmody and other bureaucrats run around wailing that people are avoiding millions of dollars in tax and then never giving them credit for paying millions of dollars in tax.",61

65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, can you confirm that you were briefed on the travel allowance claims of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development prior to expressing full confidence in him yesterday in this House? Why did you only launch an inquiry last night after you had expressed full confidence in your minister?",64
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sequence of events was as follows. The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development did speak to me on Monday. Following that discussion, I sought from the Minister for Administrative Services a letter dealing with the background of that matter. I had no reason, on the basis. of the briefing that I had received on Monday, to think ill of the minister. I received the letter from the Minister for Administrative Services at the conclusion of question time yesterday. When I read that letter, I realised that it was not containing all the information I had expected to receive, particularly in relation to investigation by the department of the circumstances of the withdrawn claim, that is, the first claim that had been submitted by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development. That is the sequence of events. I might also, in the interests of full disclosure, make it plain that I knew nothing, as I said in my earlier statement, about the repayjudgment ment of this money or about these matters when these events occurred.",64

68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you can express Arabia on 17 October. whatever view you like, but I was not told about them in May. I was in fact given an indication on my way back from the Cook Islands that there could be an issue involving the repayment of money and this had arisen as a result of a press query. I then, of course, had the discussion with the minister. I quested a letter from the Minister for Adminmatter istrative Services. When I received that letter, it did not contain all of the information I had expected it to contain. I then had further discussions with both of the former ministers, and last night I requested from the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services a letter providing a chronology of events. Arising out of that, of course, as members would expect, I had a number of conversawhoever tions with the two ministers this morning and, following those conversations, both of the ministers have indicated, I think in an approprotocol priately gracious fashion, their desire to resign and the actuality of their resignations. the totality of the chronology. Saudi Arabia: Murder of Australian",65
69,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed recent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the held government's response to reports of the verdict in the Gilford case in Saudi Arabia? What role, if any, is the Australian governthough, ment playing in this matter?",65
70,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I think the House would be aware that a hearing took place on this matter in Saudi Arabia yesterday, 23 September. I have been advised our embassy in Riyadh that the court confined its deliberations to a judgment involving a gaol term of eight years and 500 lashes for Lucille MCLauchlin. The accused has two weeks to appeal against this judgment. No sentence has been handed down at this stage and it would be inappropriate to comment or speculate. Regarding Deborah Perry, no or sentence has been announced at this stage and therefore equally it would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt outcomes from the Saudi judicial system. We understand there will be further hearings in Saudi I can inform the House that I have had a number of conversations recently with the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. I met with Robin Cook during the time of the Princess of Wales's funeral when I was in reLondon in early September and discussed this with him then and on other occasions. I have also discussed this matter on occasions with the British minister of state for foreign affairs responsible for the Asia-Pacific, Derek Fatchette, and spoke to him most recently last week about it. I have also had discussions with the British High Commissioner. This is, of course, a very difficult and sensitive issue. Our first priority has been that it was who murdered an Australian citizen must be brought to justice. Secondly, Australia is a signatory to the second optional to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and therefore the That is Australian government does not support capital punishment. I have also met with Frank Gilford to discuss this matter. Citizen There has been significant progress in weeks but the issue is not yet resolved. Legal representatives' of both parties have discussions about a possible settlement, and I think that is a welcome and a positive development. The terms of any agreement, are a matter ultimately for both of the parties concerned. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment further on the possible terms of any settlement. I have played some role in helping to bring the parties together, and clearly the government by would welcome any outcomes which would contribute to a settlement while also securing justice for the memory of Yvonne Gilford.

72,Mrs CROSIO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It deals with health rebates. Prime Minister, I wonder if you recall saying on 28 August last year: ... people will get the full value, the full the full benefit of the tax rebate. Isn't it a fact that any benefit from that rebate has now been swallowed up by two premium increases in the last eight months introduction of the $50 per night hospital bed tax introduction of large excesses on most private health policies; and massive charges to cover medical gaps. Why, Prime Minister, have you so badly misled three million Australians in such a mean-spirited manner through your personal approval of the latest health fee slug?",66

74,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. What progress has the government made in meeting its commitment to award a distinctly Australian medal for recognition of active service in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian confrontation?",66
75,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know his concern about those who were pleased when we made the promise that a distinctly Australian medal would be made available to those people who served in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian confrontation. You will recall that I answered a question in the House on a previous occasion when the question of double medalling arose. You may also recall that I made a subsequent statement that, because the government had listened to the call of the people, a medal would indeed be awarded. I am very pleased to say today that what we will be awarding to those personnel who served in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian confrontation is an Active Australian Service Medal 19451975. But, because we believe that those who served in Vietnam should have a similar, distinctively Australian medal, they will also be eligible for the AASM '45-'75. The government considered it important that a clear distinction was kept between warlike measure, and non-warlike operations. Thus, the ASM medal is for non-warlike duty and the AASM medal is for warlike duty. In principle approval for the new medal has been received from Her Majesty the Queen, and the formal process of instituting the manufacture of the medal and the ribbon has begun. I hope the initial batch of medals will be available for next ANZAC Day. Eligibility for the AASM will be limited to personnel who received or have an entitlement to receive the Imperial Medal, the Korean medal for service in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, a general service medal for service in either the Malayan Emergency 1948 to 1960, the Indonesian confrontation 1962 to 1966 or the Vietnam War. Eligibility will also be extended to those who have received the Vietnam Medal or the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. The precise eligibility of the AASM '45 to '75 for those recipients of the VLSM will be determined by myself in consultation, but will include current and former defence personnel and some civilian recipients of this medal. I am giving this detail, because the medal has been a matter of concern to many Australians, and I think the detail is deserved. . I repeat the point about the Vietnam Medal. Bars to the Vietnam Medal will not be awarded to recognise multiple tours of duty, because we are now awarding the AASM to holders of the Vietnam Medal and those who qualify for the VLSM. The ban on people being eligible for the Vietnam Medal and the VLSM will be retained. Those veterans who applied earlier for the medal and were advised that their application was not to be processed will have to apply again. Those who have forwarded their applications but have not been rejected will be processed. We are in the process of having new forms sent to the offices of all members and senators of this parliament and to branches of the RSL, whence those applications can be picked up so that the process can begin and true recognition can be given to those people who served. Employment and Growth",66
76,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen the comments of the Reserve Bank in its most recent quarterly report on the economy, of Ted Evans in his evidence to a Senate Estimates Committee last month and of his employment minister, Senator Vanstone, in her cloud-watching speech of 11 September, all of them conceding that the coalition's budgets have had a negative impact on jobs and growth. Were all of them wrong?",67
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It may surprise those opposite-but it will not surprise any of those who sit behind me-that I do not automatically accept the assessments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, particularly when it comes to economic matters. Can I say that, if you had not left us with a $lOY2 billion deficit, if you had not left us with an 8.7 per cent unemployment rate-if you had not left us with those two particular legacies-then, I believe, not only the employment outlook but also the growth outlook of Australia at the present time would have been greater. I totally support and totally reindorse the fiscal strategy undertaken by my government in its first two budgets. I think those first budgets were both outstanding budgets and I want to pay tribute to both the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance for the roles that they played in putting together those two budgets. And can I say that, when you look at the impact of a budget on the economy, you must look not only at the impact of the particular fiscal changes contained in the budget; you should also look at the impact of those fiscal changes on things like business confidence, interest rates and inflationary expectations. I suggest to all commentators-learned or otherwise-on these matters that, when you factor those things in, you are left absolutely ineluctably with the conclusion that they were outstanding budgets that have boosted the Australian economy, improved our international standing and earned us the high praise of the world financial markets. There are no more hard-headed financiers in the world than the investors of Wall Street and of New York. And just remember that when we came to power the gap in the long-term bond rate was 250 basis points. I am very proud to say that only 10 days ago, for the first time since the floating of the dollar in 1983, the Australian long-term bond rate dipped below the United States long-term bond rate. That would never have happened under this motley crew opposite. It would not have happened if they had continued in office. It happened because we had the courage to tackle the profligate fiscal inheritance that we received when we were elected. I am absolutely proud of the budget decisions that my government has taken on both occasions. Mr Gareth Evans-I seek leave to table the quotations to which I referred in order that the Prime Minister can see for himself their accuracyMr Reith-No.",67
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Leave is not granted. Resume your seat. United States-Japan Alliance,67
79,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister advise the House of the Australian government's response to the announcement two today of the Japan-US defence guidelines?,67
80,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise that a lot of members in the House are very interested in this important regional security issue. It will not come as a surprise to the House to hear that the government supports the continuing vitality of the United States-Japan alliance as a key factor in our regional security environment. We see the achievement of the new guidelines yesterday in New York as further enhancement of this important relationship, not least by encouraging a continuing regional defence commitment by the United States. It does not change the fundamental framework of the United States-Japan alliance, of course. . The revised defence guidelines clarify the United States-Japan roles in a contingency. The guidelines now specify that Japan could be expected to undertake a range of taskssuch as search and rescue, enforcement of sanctions, non-combatant evacuations and provision and maintenance of supplies of US forces, and so on-in international contingencies which threaten Japanese interests. But how it will apply in practice is a matter for the United States and Japan. Australia supports a broader role for Japan in the region while accepting that it should determine when, how and how fast it should go in enhancing this role and that this role should develop with sensitivity to the views of the wider region. In this context, we have welcomed Japan's efforts to be transparent with China and other regional countries about the review, a process in which we have appreciated being included. I conclude with one very important point. In supporting these revised guidelines, Australia is very strongly of the view that they should not be seen as part of a containment strategy aimed at China. They are certainly not that. I have made it clear that, as with approach to China's growing economic influence, Australia's perspective on China's emerging strategic influence is an inclusive and a constructive one. Prime Minister Hashimoto's recent successful visit to China and President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to the United States demonstrate a strong and very welcome commitment by both the United States and Japan to cooperating with China in ensuring stability in the region. Strong and stable relations between Japan, the United States and China are vital and benefit the security of the entire Asia-Pacific region, of course including Australia. NA",67
81,Mr SPEAKER,SOUND REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM,"I have just been advised that we are having considerable technical difficulty today with amplification of sound in the chamber. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the remedies will be in place before question time is concluded today. As a special request, I ask members to be very careful with interjections. So far you have been very good. NA South Pacific Cruise Lines",68
82,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of media reports that South Pacific Cruise Lines planned to use nearly $3 million of taxpayers money to kick-start a floating casino and hopes to use Norfolk Island as part of a tax scam? Has the minister sought a briefing on why South Pacific Cruise Lines moved nearly $400,000 of the government's training dollars to Norfolk Island? What assurances has the minister received from his colleague Senator Vanstone that this money and any other DEETYA dollars which have gone offshore or not been used properly will now be fully retrieved?",68
83,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not had any information given to me in respect of that allegation. I am happy to seek what information I can find and to report back to the parliament in due course. I say again that, when it comes to our providing employment programs, I commend the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs on the initiatives that she has taken in the context of focusing future employment programs on outcomes. Those programs, as they cut in, are very much designed to deal with individuals and the capacity of individuals to get back into full time employment. On the specifics, I will seek further information. Mr Martin Ferguson-The bottom of the harbour at Norfolk Island.",68

87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Order! I warn the member for O'Connor. Literacy Standards,68
88,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What does the national English survey reveal about the reading and writing skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the impact of the 13 years of policies of the previous government? How will the government's literacy policies assist young Australians from battling families?",69
89,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bowman for her question and for her concern for the literacy standards of young people in her electorate. What gives such great importance to the government's drive for higher literacy standards is that literacy is absolutely mental to addressing effectively social disadvantage. One of the most disturbing findings of the recent national English literacy survey has been the very low literacy levels, the low reading and writing skills, .amongst school children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the fact that more children from this group fall below the national standard in year 5 than they do in year 3 and that the gap between these children and children from higher socio-economic status backgrounds actually widens between year 3 and year 5. Nothing so clearly demonstrates the failure of the previous government to live up to its most central tenet according social justice than its failure in the literacy area. Over the last decade some $1 billion was poured by the previous government into disadvantaged schools programs, and there was no assessment whatever of the results of the expenditure of that money. This goes to the heart of the fact that the Labor Party has been unable to address a central issue of social disadvantage over the last 13 years. Its party meeting yesterday discussed literacy for half an hour and still was not able to come up with a policy. There is no leadership being given by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. He came into parliament on a silver platter; it was just delivered to him. You could not expect him to understand the problems of battling families in this country.",69
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order goes to relevance. What possible relevance has that attack on the fact that I took a marginal seat off the Liberals got anything to do with the question he was asked?",69
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,69
92,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is relevant to your utter failure of leadership on this issue and every other issue and the complete philosophical failure of your party. The reason the Labor Party is making no contribution to the debate on literacy is that the anointed one down the end there is absent under fire, and your spokesperson on this fundamatter is Senator Kim Carr, the spokesman for the teacher unions. Even your own side of politics admits that Senator Carr is absolutely hopeless. You might want to take the advice of a former Labor Premier John Cain on your present education spokesman. John Cain said in his biography about Kim Carr: I was to tell Kim Carr in mid-1991 when I saw him at Parliament House by chance that he could take a lot of credit for the destruction of Victoria's Labor government. I told Joan Kirner to get him out of the place as soon as possible.",69
93,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",69
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the minister concludto its rhetoric of ed his answer?,69
95,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have not.",69
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order goes to relevance. What conceivable relevance does this perambulation through the past have to do with some sort of contemporary view we are supposed to hold on this issue?,69
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. I recognise that the minister is traversing a very wide perspective in his answer, and I encourage him to return to the thrust of the question.",69
98,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The thrust of the question is why Australia is facing this literacy problem at the present time. The reason is that the Labor Party has failed in its most fundamental obligation to the battling families of this country. John Cain advises in his biographyand the Leader of the Opposition would do well to listen to this-that in the area of education we should have been firmer in our stand with the unions. The problem you face is this: the unions are only concerned in this area, as John Cain pointed out, with talking about class size and teacher salaries. They are never concerned with literacy standards; they are never concerned with effective policies to correct social disadvantage; they are never concerned with monitoring results in this area. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to show some real leadership and develop a policy in this critical area, instead of doing what he has done in every other area: leave the Labor Party utterly directionless.",69
99,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and it relates to agricultural tariff policy. Minister, you were recently quoted as suggesting that, if chicken meat imports are approved, the government will consider introducing a nine per cent protective tariff. Yet you have now taken away the tariff for the sugar industry a long way ahead of any trade or international obligation to do so. What are sugar growers expected to make of this? On the one hand you cannot remove protection for their industry fast enough, and on the other hand you are hoping that chicken growers will be conned into accepting imports by giving them a tariff. What sort of a trade policy are you running here?",70
100,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am running a robust, comprehensive systematic trade policy which produced a record set of export figures last financial year of $104.4 billion. In case you missed that message, there was a surplus for the first time ever in both goods and services. In case you missed that message, we are now through the 20 per cent ratio of exports to GDP, and this is for the 12-month financially period in which the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the coalition have been fully in power and seeking professionally, systematically extra market share. I am very happy to answer the member's question. I feel sorry for him because he does not realise that, when you move from a total embargo on imports, there is a range of options well within our Uruguay Round bound commitments which the government has to consider and will consider at an appropriate time as we work through the science in relation to chicken meat and other issues. In respect of sugar, I am underwhelmed by the moves of the United States last week in cutting back its quota. That came on the very day that the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Rubin, said that trade liberalisation was the right step forward and that countries involved in trade liberalisation will gain by that. On the one hand the US Secretary to the Treasury was preaching trade liberalisation, and on the other hand we had the US Secretary of AgriTariffs culture, Mr Glickman, winding back the quota on our exports. Let me conclude by saying why we are systematically getting on with the path of sensible trade market access expansion. I refer to the UAE; Slovenia, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia, Latvia, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Israel, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Brunei. Following various negotiations with those 12 countries over recent months, as well as previously, I am pleased to say that they have agreed to provide a zero tariff on Australia's exports of high quality sugar products into those countries. In other words, this has got to be seen as part of an overall equation. I will stand up for increased sugar market industry access to the world and expansion of their export efforts. I was in dialogue with industry leaders yesterday and we will further expand their markets at every opportunity. I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, my first time at the dispatch box, to commend my two departing colleagues on their outstanding contribution to the parliament and the government of this land. Black .Hawk Inquiry",70
101,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of media reports today of comments made by the shadow minister for defence concerning the Black Hawk investigation and disciplinary process? Can he inform the House about his role in ensuring that the procedures are being followed properly?,70
102,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have noticed that on a number of occasions the member for Brisbane has attempted to interfere with the disciplinary procedures in this very tragic Black Hawk matter. Despite the fact that on 6 March this year the shadow minister said 'the board of inquiry report is being conducted in an open way and I commend the army', on at least three subsequent occasions he has, in my view and the view of others, quite improperly called for an intervention in the disciplinary procedures. In effect, he has advocated on three occasions an interference with some of those procedures, as I said. I have told the shadow minister before in this House that the convening authority cannot be directed as to how to exercise his authority by a superior officer or indeed by anyone else, and that includes the shadow minister. Subsequent to that advice which I gave in the House, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition gave me a bit of advice of his own. Mr Bevis-What are you going to do about the review and the replacement of Rowlands?",71
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,71
104,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He said that in the end it is not a matter for the minister but he can certainly send signals down through the system. Mr Bevis-Are you going to replace Judge Rowlands?,71
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Brisbane.,71
106,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So I sought some more advice from the Government Solicitor and the advice I received was: There would be a very substantial risk that if the Minister sought to influence the conduct of the Defence Force Discipline Act in a manner reportedly suggested by the Leader of the Opposition then the proceedings could be vitiated. He went on to say: I leave it to others to comment on the propriety doing privately what could not be done publicly. What the Leader of the Opposition was advocating is that I covertly tried to interfere in the way that the shadow minister is doing. I think this is such a serious matter that the Leader of the Opposition should carry out what he has been advocating in the last few hours in this place in regard to integrity and pull his shadow minister into gear. Both he and they have been acting totally irresponsibly in this very serious matter. If you look at the Leader of the Opposition, you know I am right. Australian Taxation Office",71
107,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Acting Treasurer explain why the Australian Taxation Office charges 17.8 per cent, which is twice the prime bank rate, for small business battlers who are behind in their tax payments? Does the recent reduction from 18.5 per cent to 17.8 per cent adequately reflect commercial rate drops this year?",71
108,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the honourable member for Moore would appreciate that the Income Tax Assessment Act is based upon payments being made within the appropriate time. Clearly, in the event that there is to be a delay in the payment by any taxpayer there is a penalty imposed, and it is appropriate that there be a penalty imposed as a deterrent. The revenue of the Commonwealth and its obligations with that revenue in respect of all of the programs require that payment is made by those who are liable for taxation at an appropriate time, and that is within the time noted in the assessment. The penalty rates that the honourable member refers to have apparently changed. On the basis of what he has put in his question, there seems to have been a small reduction. The rationale behind that reduction has not been brought to my notice, but I will certainly get that rationale; and I am happy to pass it on to the honourable member for Moore when it is forthcoming. Superannuation: Commonwealth Public Sector",71
109,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed of to the Acting Treasurer and Minister for Finance. Can the minister provide the house with details of the new superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth public servants?,71
110,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has announced changes to the Commonwealth civilian employees superannuation schemes. The details of those changes are that, as from 1 July 1998, new employees in the Commonwealth public sector will be able to put the . employer's contribution into a complying superannuation scheme or retirement savings account of their choice. They will not be able to join the public sector superannuation scheme. As from that date that scheme will be closed to new members. As from 1 July 2000, current Commonwealth employees can, if they choose, leave the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or the public sector superannuation scheme and can choose, if they wish, after ceasing membership to have future employer superannuation contributions paid to another complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account of their choice. I stress that remuneration for current or future Commonwealth employees will not be reduced by these changes. Funding of the Commonwealth agencies for this purpose-for employer superannuation contributions-will not be affected. However, new employees or existing employees, if they choose, can in fact negotiate the level of the employer contribution with the employer, subject to the safety net of the superannuation guarantee rate. These changes are consistent with the government's objective of facilitating greater choice in superannuation arrangements, as was announced by the Treasurer in the 199798 budget. The changes will provide individuals with flexibility, portability and choice to save for their retirement in a manner to suit their individual needs. I stress again that is entirely consistent with the Prime Minister's pre-election commitment to the public sector, notwithstanding statements that have been made in the past 24 hours by the CPSU and the Labor Party. There is no way in which that commitment has been breached by any of these changes. Literacy Standards",71
111,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer to the minister's statement earlier this week, when he said: . .. funding from this government for special literacy programs increases from year to year over the next few years. Minister, why then has your own department told the Senate that literacy funding in' the year 2000 will be less than it is today by the sum of $4 million? Minister, if literacy funding is increasing every year, how can it end up to be $4 million less? Does this not mean that you have misled the parliament by doctoring the figures?",72
112,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is hard to believe that such a pitiful question could have come forward from the opposition on this vital subject of literacy. They cannot even interpret the budget papers properly. The member has drawn attention to the forward estimates three years out, which show that at the end of the current four-year funding program, where there has not been funding for the following quadrennium, there is a fall in funding. What does that tell us for this year, 1997? It tells us that funding for literacy programs is higher than 1996. For next year, 1998, it is higher than for 1997. For the following year, 1999, it is higher than for 1998. You think that by going forward to the outer limits of the forward estimates, before decisions are going to be taken two or three years down the track, you have made a valid point. The fact is that this government is putting more and more money into literacy in each successive year over this funding period. Your question shows the utter failure of the Labor Party to come to grips with the major this social justice issue facing young people in this country. That is the great philosophical failure of your party . You claim to be a party that cares about equity and you claim to be a party that cares about social justice. Yet we will never overcome the problems of social disadvantage, of broken families, their impact on young people and the fact that young people are coming from backgrounds where their first language is not English unless we can teach those young people to read and write by the end of year 3 of schooling. That is this government's commitment. It is a commitment you never made and it is a commitment you still do not make.",72
113,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Stop grandstanding and restore their funds.,73
114,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I challenge the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to tell the people of Australia whether they believe literacy standards in this country need to be raised and whether they are prepared to commit themselves to the national standard. Are you prepared,73
115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you prepared to restore their funds?,73
116,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the Leader of the Opposition can say is, 'We need more money. ' We know that the Labor Party never had any compunction in spending the money of Australia's families. It reached deep into their pockets and it wasted money on labour market programs that did not work. Despite the fact that these families are putting $12 billion a year into schooling, they want more money again. Literacy is the first call on that money. is what the schools money is for and that is what that money should be spent on. The Labor Party and the teachers unions who speak on their behalf should be asking the states to clear that overcrowded curriculum to make sure that the methods used in the classroom work and to hold the schools accountable for actually delivering on the result. You have never done that. All you can come up with is some pathetic question of the kind we have just had. That is why you betray a generation of young Australians. Rural Communities Program",73
117,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. How will the rural communities program, announced as part of the 'Agriculture-advancing Australia' package, benefit communities in rural and remote areas?",73
118,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the very serious problems faced by rural and remote communities is the lack of access to services which are very often taken for granted in urban areas. The rural communities program, announced as part of the AAA program recently, seeks to address the problems caused by isolation and size but to do so in a way that is not prescriptive. The rural communities program offers significant opportunities for people in rural areas to develop much needed community services. The RCP has three core areas of opportunity--community development, information and technology, and infrastructure and regional strategic planning. Services provided through the former rural communities access program and the rural partnership program are still available. Perhaps the best example of the kind of service that will be funded under the rural communities program is the highly successful credit care, which the government has continued to commit itself to. We have committed further money under this package to this program because some studies put together by the University of Southern Queensland show that when the last bank pulls out of a country town, there is a very real and significant That impact on that local town-on its businesses, clubs, sporting activities and even its local fuel station and what have you. There are 33 country towns across Australia with credit care and another 30 waiting to access credit care facilities. Now they will even be able to issue cheques. We also fund those much needed rural financial counsellors. The RCP will also provide improved access to telecommunications technology and community development projects as well as professional assistance for community based regional strategic planning. This of course is new. These initiatives will build upon the successes of previous programs. Funding will still be directed towards rural communities but with added flexibility for the local community to define the sorts of services which will best service their needs. The member for Grey knows very well the big difference that these commitments can make in hard pressed rural communities of the sort that he represents. No doubt, this commitment to funding for community development initiatives under agriculture advancing Australia will be welcomed in your state, just as the package as a whole has been. I note with some interest that the member for Wakelin has brought to my attention that the main rural journal in that state, Stock Journal, has splashed across its front page this week that there should be thumbs up for the AAA package and goes on to say that rural South Australia welcomes the package. The editorial says: ... Prime Minister John Howard and ... Primary Industries Minister John Anderson have delivered a package with real vision and hope. It goes on to say that it is a package which not only recognises the bush's contribution to the nation's bottom line but also acknowledges that there are real people in rural Australia who continue to need this sort of approach. It concludes on a very positive note, and a very insightful one. I commend the editor; I think it reflects well on farmers in that state-as primary producers, we need to take this latest package and make it work to our advantage, throwaway the red tape and march on to a free market. Superannuation: Social Security",73
119,Mr HATTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the study released yesterday by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia which shows that 81 per cent of men and 64 per cent of women retire early, not because they choose to but because of circumstances beyond their control, such as their workplace closing down. The same study shows that well over half of the men retired with lump sum superannuation payments of less than $40,000, that very few had enough superannuation assets to support themselves until retirement age let alone for the duration of their retirement, and that most relied on social security payments as their primary source of income. Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have given us very explicit instructions about lengthy introductory statements. I ask you to rule the member's question out of order.",74
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parramatta. I will not rule the question out of order, but I do ask the honourable member for Blaxland to move quickly to the question.",74
121,Mr HATTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. My question continues: are the 20 September social security changes, which effectively reduce or cancel these people's social security payments, fair? Why is the government forcing older Australians to retire before they choose to?",74
122,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I regard the changes we have made as both fair and defensible. Opposition members-Fair!,74
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Quite fair and defensible. As you know, and as all of those who sit around you know, many of those measures were an extension of a measure that you had already introduced. If you are arguing that they are unfair, you are really condemning measures that were introduced by the government of your predecessor as the member for Blaxland. I cannot imagine that you would ever do that, would you? I take the opportunity that the honourable member's question affords me to continue some of the things I was saying yesterday about the benefits of my government for retired Australians. I would like to remind you of the great savings initiative that is coming into operation in July next year. I remind you of the introduction of retirement savings accounts which provide more flexibility for people making their superannuation arrangements. I remind you of the extra choice that is being introduced to allow employees to access the superannuation fund of their choice. I remind you of the benefits that will accrue to many retired people in relation to providing under legislation, for the first time, that the pension should not fall below a fixed percentage of average earnings. So not only are the measures of my government fair and defensible-and when you consider that you left us with a $10.5 billion deficit, they are eminently fair and eminently defensible-but, indeed, when you look at the other measures we have introduced, they also represent an unparalleled package for older Australians. Small Business: Employment Trends",74
124,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its business growth and performance survey on small and medium sized enterprises. Can you please inform the House what this survey reveals about employment trends in the all important small business sector?",74
125,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think this is a very importfrom ant question because it does go to a survey which has been released this week through the ABS and which has been funded through the Office of Small Business within my departtold ment. It is one of a number of these longitudiany nal studies. It involves 6,000 business units, 3,000 of which are small businesses. It is of our survey generally in the small business community so that as we are better informed we can go on producing good policies for small business, as we have been doing last March. What the latest results show very starkly is that small businesses, firms with less than 20 employees, are the driving force for the net increase of jobs measured by the survey and they accounted for 65 per cent of the jobs, which shows you what a tremendously vibrant and great section of the Australian community are the small businesses which were the tion, subject of this survey. The survey also reveals that micro businesses, those with less than five employees, accounted for 57 per cent of the total net employment change. That, again, re-emphasises the importance of small busiwith ness for growth of jobs in the future. All that also makes the point need, as a parliament, to be giving real encouragement to the small business community. That is why the proposal, for example, provide all small businesses with employees of 15 or less an exemption from the unfair dismissal law is a good idea, and it ought to be passed. The Labor Party, which was so ruinous for small business in 13 years, has gall today in opposition to be still anti-small business and to be still opposing a proposal which would be to their benefit. So whether it is fiscal policy and getting benefits to small business through interest rates or whether it is doing the right thing create jobs it is opposed by the opposition. But I can assure the House that this governquestions ment is pro small business and, on this and other issues, we are determined to have a fair go for small business. Social Security Entitlements",75
126,Mr TED GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what would you advise me to tell one· man New South Wales, married with four children and paying off a house, who has been battling on an average income of around $27,000 a year, to do now that he has been by Centrelink that he is not eligible for help from social security for 16 weeks, until next February, because of the imposition part of your government's maintenance period and your new liquid . assets waiting period? By next February not much of this man's small savings will be left. What would you advise since his children to do for Christmas? Mr Causley- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 144 clearly states that a question cannot be hypothetical. This question is hypothetical, and I ask you to rule it out of order. Mr Ted Grace- Mr Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order. It is a real quesbut I want to protect the man's privacy. Government members-Name him!",75
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question was very long but was not hypothetical. Therefore, due respect, I ask the Prime Minister to respond to the question but not to be enthat we really tranced by the detail.",75
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first piece of advice to I would give to the honourable gentleman is: you tell your constituent that, for heaven's sake, he really mustn't vote Labor, because his interest rates will go up; if he votes Labor, the debt of this country will go up and inflathe tion will probably start going up again; and, if he votes Labor, there will be further deteriorations in the international creditworthiness of Australia. My second piece of advice is: if you would like to get all of the details, including this to man's name and address, I would be delighted to write to him to explicitly deal with the he has asked. I would also reinforce the advice I have just given to you: under no circumstances ever, ever again should he vote Labor. Human Rights",75
129,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. The attorney yesterday announced the government's strengthening of Commonwealth action on human rights through the development of an equitable and effective human rights organisation. Would the attorney inform the House of the reaction to the government's decision from people involved in human rights matters?,76
130,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I thank the member for Makin for her question. She is one of a number of members on this side of the House who has a genuine commitment to human rights-and in her case, in particular, to children rights. The announcement yesterday of the proposed establishment of a Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission demonstrates the government's commitment to human rights, and it is a commitment to effective and equitable protection of human rights and the promotion of them. We are introducing balance and equity where it has not always been. As to the responses to the announcement, they have been very positive. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself welcomed the announcement, and it specifically stated that the approach taken to the membership of the commission by the government was a positive one. The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment also welcomed the government's decision. That council informed my office that it considered the introduction of a broader focus for the commission and a greater emphasis on the responsibilities which accompany rights will be a positive assistance to society in general. Support also came from the Law Council of Australia. The new president of the council, Mr Brett Walker SC, highlighted that the previous administrative structure was not the best one for handling human rights issues. In welcoming the government's decision, the Law Council described the position as sensible and one which the council favoured. Interestingly, there is one organisation whose response is out of step with those I have mentioned. It is a response which is as out of step as it is predictable, and it is of course from the Labor Party. The Labor response from the shadow spokesman provided no constructive comment or criticism whatever. It conveniently ignored the fact that previous Labor ministers have revealed that the previous Labor government recognised a need for reorganisation but failed to address that need. Labor will no doubt continue to suffer from selective amnesia, and continue to delude itself about what it might have done. This government will continue with a true commitment to human rights. We have the support from a number of organisations and individuals involved in human rights to highlight that the government's move is undeniably a positive one. Telecommunications",76
131,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. I ask the minister: does Australia now have one of the most open and competitive telecommunications regimes in the world, as the result of this government's policies? What have been the benefits both to business and to the ordinary phone user of this highly competitive new regime? Do you expect further competition and benefits to consumers in the future, given the fact that the new regime began only on July I?",76
132,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Certainly the first two parts of the question asked the minister for an expression of opinion and are out of order.",76
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There was a fair amount of hubbub in the presentation of the question. Perhaps the honourable member for Fisher would liketo revisit the first two parts of the question.,76
134,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: I was asking the minister for a statement of facts, not of opinion. The first part of the question was: does Australia have one of the most open and competitive telecommunications regimes in the world as a result of this government's policies? That clearly is in order. The next part was: what have been the benefits both to business and to the ordinary phone user of this highly competitive new regime? That also is in order. I also asked the mipister whether he expects further competition and benefits to consumers in the future, giyen the fact that the new regime began only on July 1.",76
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his well intentioned advice. In the light of that advice and my own reflections on the topic, I find the question to be in order and invite the minister to respond.",77
136,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question and his legal interpretation of whether or not it was in order. I certainly believe it was. is indeed a very important matter. It is very pleasing for this government to be able to report that we now have one of the most open and competitive telecommunications regimes in the world. Even in the United States and the United Kingdom they have greater restrictions than we do. For example, the US 'Baby Bells' have to pass a 15-point test before they can enter into the long distance market. I can give about five examples of changes and new operators. AAPT, for example, announced that they would offer up to 60 per cent off the current cost of national and international long distance calls. Primus Globe-Talk have reduced all international charges. They have dropped the rate to Germany by 40c per minute. With Northgate Communications, the cost from Ballarat to Melbourne for an untimed call is now 75c as a flat rate. World Exchange is operating a flat rate of 39c a minute for calls to the United States and the United Kingdom, and 38c a minute to New Zealand. Telstra is now fighting back-this is the product of the decisions that the government has made in this parliament-with a tariff plan under which by paying a higher up-front line rental charge customers can now get local calls for as little as 18c per household. There are new pricing regimes such as Telstra's Smarts aver flexiplan, at 23.2c per minute, with a 12c connection fee. Optus are matching it in the market with a 26.7c a minute fee. These are the types of pricing structures that the member for Fisher should be taking back to his electorate and telling them that this is the product of competition that is growing as a result of the decisions of this government. The reason for this happening is that the price reductions are founded on a concept known as interconnection. The ACCC's new interconnection rates-and this is the centrepiece of telecommunications; this is as a result of the decisions we made on 1 Julysee that the interconnection price for Telstra's national access service has dropped by around 35 per cent. This has led to new, tangible benefits that have flowed through the act to consumers. So change is all about in this This industry. You have even seen Victoria's privatised United Energy become a licensed carrier. We have seen innovative technologies engaged by new operators. OMNIconnect, for example, is looking at wireless network systems to provide savings of up to 30 per cent for existing users. There have been innovative services introduced into the market. Things we have not seen before in Australia have emerged in the last 18 months. TechniCall Australia, a new entrant into the payphone market, aims to establish a network of 20,000-odd smart payphones capable of advanced functions. There are other examples I could quote, but the fundamental point is this: because of competition, because of the decisions made by this government, endorsed by both houses of this parliament finally, greater competition has been created. We have a whole new range of licensed providers-about 12 now, I think, are licensed. The benefits have flowed to consumers. The major decision that was made yesterday by my colleague Senator Alston, the Minster for Communications, was groundbreaking, and it is fundamentally important to telecommunications-number portability. What number portability means is that now you can take your telephone number with you to another carrier. That has not happened before in this country. With number portability you underpin the changes in services, the changes in technology, and you capture for consumers that huge benefit. By doing what Senator Alston did yesterday we enhanced even further the decisions we made on 1 JUly. We have enhanced the opportunities for consumers. We are leading the way in this nation in competitive telecommunications services. We made a promise and we kept it. High Court of Australia",77
137,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney aware of the comments made at the weekend by the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, that the High Court is part of a republican plot which would see the court 'overturning conventions relating to the former powers of the Governor General'? Attorney, will you repudiate Senator Boswell's suggestion that the High Court would engage in such blatant political conduct? If not, why not? Does the Attorney honestly expect the court to enter the political fray in order to defend itself from such an absurd attack?",78
138,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the first time. I have heard that Senator Boswell made any comment about the High Court on the weekend, and I cannot confirm or deny it. I am not going to comment on anything that he might or might not have said without knowing that he did say it. As to the broader issue, I think it is a very important issue. The High Court is set up under our constitution. The executive government is recognised in the constitution and so is the parliament. Each are separate branches of government. Each has a separate role. Each must recognise the different role of the other and must respect that role. I think we need to establish some clear ground rules because there is a lack of understanding on the part of some members of the executive, on the part of some members of the parliament and on the part of some members of the judiciary. If we can lay down the ground rules and get a better public understanding of the relationship of the three arms of government we will not have that sort of issue being raised at all.",78
139,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Jetset: Cost of Parliament House Accommodation Refurbishment",78
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yesterday the member for Watson, the Hon. Leo MCLeay, asked me a multi-part question regarding the Jetset parliamentary travel operation in Parliament House. I am advised that the changes to the Serjeantat-Arms's office were to provide privacy from the Jetset area and were funded by the Joint House Department at a cost of $2,844. All other costs, including the cost of fit out of the Jetset office, have been or will be paid by Jetset. Details of these costs are not available as they are internal Jetset matters. Jetset pays a general service charge for use of the space it occupies in Parliament House. The amount that it has paid is commercial-inconfidence. However, members should be aware that it is a full commercial fee assessed by the Australian Valuation Office. It is in accord with the charges imposed on other .retail outlets within Parliament House. There were no identifiable costs in relocating departmental staff from the transport office. The only works necessary to relocate these staff related to the moving of furniture and luggage racks. Finding a Balance: Towards Fair Trading in Australia: Government Response",78
141,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to page 614 of House of Representatives Practice in respect of government responses to parliamentary committee reports. By preamble, very quickly I remind you that on 26 May this year a very important report on fair trading was tabled in this parliament and toe government had indicated during the consideration of a former minister and, indeed, the fair trading inquiry report that it would respond within three months. That period was up on 26 August. The minister was asked at that time when that would happen and he said within a couple of weeks. Given that now nearly another month has passed, would you be prepared to inquire of the Leader of the House in this place as to whether that might be coming forward as a statement in the House and when we might expect that?",78
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his question. I see the Leader of the House is on his feet and I will respond subsequent to him.,79
143,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Just to respond to that, it may assist the House to know that the government has obviously been working to prepare a response to the fair trading committee report, and. it will not be long before the formal response is made available to all members of the House. I can understand that, after 13 years of inactivity, the shadow minister would be impatient for the response. The only thing I might suggest to him that might temper his patience is that he is going to be very disappointed with what will be a great response to a great committee report.",79
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the Leader of the House. I think the honourable member for Cunningham has had the thrust of the query responded to. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA South Pacific Cruise Lines,79
145,Mr FAHEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I wish to give a supplementary response to a question asked earlier this afternoon by the honourable member for Batman. I have received an assurance from the office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, that legal proceedings are under way to protect the Commonwealth's position in relation to the matter that was raised by the honourable member for Batman. The government is not aware of the basis for any allegation that $400,000 of funds owed to the Commonwealth have been moved to Norfolk Island and, on the basis of the legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate to go into any of the details regarding this matter at this stage. NA Social Security Entitlements: Hypothetical Questions",79
146,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you.

152,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I have received advice from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) that he has withdrawn the matter of public importance which he had submitted for discussion this day. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent a definite matter of public importance being submitted House by the member for Jagajaga and discussed forthwith. Aged Care,80
153,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's changes to social security and care for the aged which will disadvantage older Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",80
154,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.14 p.m.)The Howard government has just delivered another slap in the face to older Australians. The social security measures which started last Saturday are going to see older Australians who lose their jobs through no fault of their own being forced to retire and dip into their superannuation long before they are ready to as a result of this government's changes. This measure is on top of appalling changes that have already gone through this parliament as a result of this government's attitude to the aged. We have seen the introduction of two new fees for older Australians who want and need to go into nursing homes. From 1 October, nursing homes will require each and every older Australian who needs a nursing home bed to pay an up-front entry fee if they have any assets-and that includes their family home. This will mean that older Australians will have to sell their family homes. It will be interesting to see whether the speakers opposite repeat the promise that has been made in this parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that people will not have to sell their homes. There is a realisation now out in Orders the community and out in the nursing homes that people will have to sell their homes to get a nursing home bed. As I discuss this issue with older Australto the ians around the country, I ask them: 'Have you got $80,000 to $100,000 tucked away in your back pocket to pay an entry fee to get into a nursing home?' Every Australian I talk to says, 'No. The only place I have that sort of money is in my family home.' They know that they will have to sell their family home before they can get a nursing home bed. This is a decision that will have to be made when an older person is in total crisis. It will have to be made when the older person is, in most cases, very ill and lying in a hospital bed. Their family will have to come to terms with the fact that their mother, father or relative has to go into a nursing home. You can just imagine the scenario: the nursing home owner will be saying, 'It is $100,000 to get a nursing home bed.' The family will be saying, 'The only way we can pay that is to sell the home, and we cannot do that immediately. How are we going to ensure that our relative gets the bed they need?' It is becoming clear, particularly to members of the medical profession, that people are going to bank up in our hospitals while these very unfair negotiations take place. 'Negotiation' is the word the government likes to use. The government thinks it is a negotiation between equals-between the nursing home owner and the person who needs the nursing home bed. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that there is a limited number of nursing home beds. The person who needs to get a bed is desperate, as are their families. They will do whatever is necessary to get that person a nursing home bed, including selling the family home, which is what will be required. The second measure that is being introduced-I understand it has now been delayed until 1 November because of this government's incompetence in getting anything done in time-is that from 1 November people currently residing in nursing homes and those who need to go into them in the future will have to pay an extra daily fee of 25c for every dollar the older person might earn outside the pension free area. When talking about this to a group of pensioners last week, one of them piped up very quickly, 'Oh, this is another 25 per cent tax.' And that is exactly what it is. But, in usual way of this government, do you think they have been up-front and made it clear to older Australians that they are imposing another 25 per cent tax on them when they need to use a nursing home bed? No. They are saying to nursing homes: 'You collect the tax on the government's behalf. Don't give the money back to the government, notify us how much you have collected and we will deduct that from the government subsidy you get.' How devious can this government be in taking money out of people's pockets? These appalling changes to aged care, which are going to see the development of a two-tiered system of nursing home care in this country for the first time in many years, are to be deplored. It will be the case-nobody should be so naive as to think it will not be that those who can pay $100,000, even if it does require the sale of their family home, will get the best nursing home care. Those who have, say, only $20,000, let alone those who have nothing to spend, will have to wait at the back of the queue and get second rate care; The other measures that I wanted to touch on here today that go to the heart of this government's attitude to older Australians are the changes that came in last Saturday. The first measure will require that superannuation assets be taken into account in the social security means test for people who are aged over 55. It will mean that more than 60,000 Australians will have their social security payments reduced or cancelled. That is happening as we speak. People are being told around this country: 'You have a little bit of money put away for your retirement. Bad luck for you.' The government is going to get into your pocket and say, in a very short-term way: 'We are going to make you use that money now, when you are not ready for retirement.' By the time they reach the age of 65, it is likely that most of those people will have had to use up their superannuation and, of course, will then be dependent on the pension. If ever there was an example of short-term policy making, this is it. The Prime Minister is shifting the goalposts for older workers who have done the right the thing and invested in superannuation for their retirement. Thousands of Australians have lost their jobs and, because of this government's complete ineptitude in dealing with unemployment, are finding it very difficult to get another job. This measure will force these older workers to draw on their superannuation nest egg long before they are ready to retire. Most older workers do not want to retire; they cannot afford to retire. They want to be able to keep working and contributing to their superannuation so that, by the time they do get to 65, they can afford to retire in a little more comfort than they otherwise might have. There are two other measures that started on 20 September which will mean that another 103,000 older workers-people who have lost their jobs-will have to wait a lot longer to get access to social security payments, to get any support from the rest of us. What those two measures say is that if you lose your job-if you are made redundant through no fault of your own-and you have any accumulated annual leave, long service leave or sick leave as part of your redundancy package then you will have to work out those leave entitlements before you get any help from social security. So if you thought that at the age of 50 or 55 you could put some of this redundancy package into paying off your mortgage, into getting the roof fixed and into making sure that things were done around the house so that you could live in reasonable comfort on your social security benefits, forget it. Basically you have to work out your leave entitlements and you will not get any support from this government as far as social security payments are concerned. The other related issue is that not only will you get no social security support but also you will get no help in getting a job because if you are not said to be unemployed you will not be able to go down to the employment service--even the new privatised employment service. You will not be entitled to any support from employment services let alone any labour market training or retraining programs, which have been totally abolished by this government. These are very cruel measures, harsh measures that discriminate against older workers. It shows that this government has no concern about helping older Australians-older workers-get back into the work force. What this government is saying to older workers is, 'We just want you off the unemployment queues. We do not want you to be counted. We want you to eat into your superannuation and use up your annual leave entitlements.' This is a very short-term measure because these people are going to end up on the old age pension, whereas they would have preferred to have been able to provide for themselves. I would like to give examples of two people whom this affects. One is a man who is 56. He was made redundant 12 months ago. He has spent the last 10 of those months on Newstart while he looks for work. But from 20 September his payment was cancelled because, for the first time, his superannuation payout will count under the social security means test as he is over the threshold for single home owners. With no income from social security he must, to survive, draw on his superannuation, even though he really wanted to continue working until he was 65. The other example is of a woman who is 54 and is about to be laid off after nine years of working. Her redundancy package is worth $25,000, including $12,000 in superannuation, 12 weeks of cashed out annual and long service leave worth $5,000, and severance pay of about $8,000. Under the new rules she will have to wait three months before she gets any Newstart allowance. She will have to eat into the $13,000 that she was otherwise going to put into a deposit for her retirement. These measures show clearly that this is a very short-term measure. It is saying to older Australians, 'You use up all your cash. It does not matter if it means in 10 years time you will have to go on the old age pension. We want to get hold of your money right now and we are going to make you use these funds. We are not going to help you back into the work force.' These measures, on top of the changes to aged care, show that this government has no concern for the aged. No doubt we will hear from those opposite that they are doing a wonderful job at introducing legislation to tie the pension to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. Let us just look at a little bit of history about this issue. When the government first came in, the National Commission of Audit said that the pension should be aligned with average weekly earnings, which would have seen the pension go down. Under pressure from Labor, this government has introduced legislation to trYland ensure in the future that pensions are tied to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings-the higher level. I Mrs Gash-Why didn't you do it?",80
155,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was Labor that made sure that pensions were 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. With the method that is going to be used by this government under the legislation that is still before the Senate we will see that pensions never meet 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I recommend to all of those who are interjecting opposite that they go and ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) whether or not it is the case that pensions under her system will ever meet 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. They will not. So not only will people's superannuation be used up but also they will never, under this government's mechanism, get a pension equalling 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. (Time expired)",83
156,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.29 p.m.)-Once again the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has come into this place hoping that this matter will be debated and reported, that older Australians might be listening and that they will, yet again, be frightened. The member for Jagajaga was not here over the 13 years that her colleagues were but they have got no record to be proud of at all. For thirteen years it was easier for them to sweep all of these issues under the carpet, to never face up to the fact that there was an increasing ageing population. Ms Macklin-What did we spend? Just tell the truth! What did we spend?",83
157,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't interrupt. Ms Macklin-No, because you don't know.",83
158,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, there is a record which Labor can have absolutely no pride in whatsoever. Labor did commission the Gregory report to look into nursing home and accommodation for older Australians-for the 10 per cent who end up in institutions. It did look at those, and what did we find? I recall that it was Mr MCMullan, the member for Canberra, who actually called Professor Gregory 'that eminent Australian economist' . Professor Gregory found that the nursing home stock was of such low standard that people with walking frames could not get into toilets, that there were up to five or six in one room, and that the rooms were substandard. But, while this highly regulated industry was in actual fact providing the most basic of care, there were no improvements available because of financial arrangements which were in place. Government funding was kept down. No arrangements whatsoever could be made to improve that stock. At exactly the same time, the managements of hostel accommodation, which was largely run by the not-for-profit sector-in fact, 95 per cent run by the not-for-profit sector-were charging, whether you like to call it a bond or an up-front fee, and managing it very well so that there could be some choice. People who had left their own homes had been enjoying a standard of living all their lives which they had worked hard to achieve. Now they could enjoy a standard of living which was not too different from what they had had and could have some enjoyment in their last months or years of life. But in nursing homes those standards were being kept right down. They were not being adequately funded, and there was no provision at all for any choice: whether a higher or better standard could be purchased. This government is a very reformist government. It is not just saying it would be easy to sweep these things under the carpet. It is not just saying it might be politically sensitive to not give it attention. It is giving it attention. There are massive reforms. These reforms are not easy but, with an ageing population, we are not facing up to our responsibilities if we are not taking these issues absolutely head-on. Ms Macklin-Forcing them to pay.",83
159,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Nobody will be forced to pay if they cannot afford to pay, but it is entirely reasonable that those people in our society who can afford to pay do contribute something to their care and that it not just be set aside for somebody else to spend it another time. The government will not demand that it is absolutely necessary and essential for the family home to be sold. That guarantee has been given by the minister in this place on a number of occasions before, every time the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) gets up to try to frighten elderly Australians. There was no requirement in the first six months that there be any up-front bond or any bond payable. It is then up to negotiation. For instance, if the real estate market is down, if tum. the family decide that it might be appropriate to manage their business in various ways, then they can do that. There will be moneys required. What are the alternatives? The member for J agajaga would seem to think that there is an endless pot of money to keep dipping into and putting it where you like. Ms Macklin-You took $500 million out.",83
160,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What did we find when we came to government? A debt of over $10 billion dollars. It is not simply a matter of taking money out; it is a question of managing. And it is not government money. I so often hear, 'What is the government going to do about this? Will the government put some money into that?' It is not government money; it is taxpayers' money. Elected governments have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers' funds are managed wisely and managed well, that any services which are in place are administered in such a way that our nursing home stock will be sustainable. The instruments which will be in place will mean that there will be a change from people saying, 'There is a hostel here, there is a nursing home here, and, by the way, if your health deteriorates you will have to leave the hostel to go to the nursing home.' You might be leaving staff, friends and other residents that you are well acquainted with or in some circumstances a life partner. Under Labor, there is no way that care could be delivered in that hostel. So there was a change of great disruptive capacity impacting on those older Australians' lives-off to the nursing home. The instrument there is changed. Care will be delivered and funding will be managed-not on the institution but on the amount of care and the standard of care required for that importantindividual. i This coalition government is acting wi-ely with the changes that are being bought in, changes recommended by Professor Gregory, and changes whichMs Macklin-He did not recommend fees.",84
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Jagajaga! You have had your,84
162,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have to get it right. Is it an entry fee or is it a bond? We are calling it a bond. That is what it is. All but a limited amount will be returned to that person when they leave that institution or to the estate, should that be the case. Rather sadly, for the 10 per cent of people who do enter nursing homes, it would often be returned to their estate. I have no doubt whatsoever that nearly all Australian families would want a good standard of care for their parents, aunts, uncles or grandparents. They are not going to be so jolly mean that they are just thinking about what it is going to cost all the time. And good care does cost. We are fortunate, in nearly all circumstances-the greater percentage of them-to have people in our community providing the best standard of care.",84
163,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Tell us about the ones in need, the ones that need to be protected.",84
164,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You will have your tum, if you are speaking, at another time. An ageing population is a good thing. It is something that we should welcome and that we should be providing and planning for. Under no circumstances should we be thinking that older people are less important as they become old. In fact, people are staying healthier longer. That is something to be welcomed and something that we should be planning for. The member for Jagajaga has talked about superannuation being put away as a nest egg well into the future so that when somebody retires they have a pension and still keep their superannuation. The whole idea of superannuation is about planning for the future. People want to spend time in retirement spending money in order to maintain the lifestyle which perhaps they had while in the work force. It is no good just taking the tactic that his a smart thing to go around frightening older Australians. I think it is entirely inappropriate. Ms Macklin-Telling them the truth.",84
165,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Labor and the member for Jagajaga are not telling you the truth. Ms Macklin-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the parliamentary secretary suggests that I have not been telling the truth. That is unparliamentary.

173,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am prompted to remind the member opposite-and I hope that lots of people are listening-that his colleague, Senator Bolkus, has distributed letters to constituents in South Australia saying, for instance, that pensioners are going to have to pay $30 per prescripti()n. Of course, there is a state election going on over there. If this is not an example of terrifying older Australians, I do not know what is. So, if the member for Jagajaga wants to feel pure about this, she can go right ahead. But she had better take her colleagues on and she had better lick them into shape and suggest to them that they start being fussy about the truth as well. Ms Macklin-Good. I am glad you realise that I have been telling the truth.",85

I have told you on previous occasions that it is not your role, having once spoken, to conduct a running commentary on everything else that is said. I suggest you stay in order.",85
176,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the first 18 months of the coalition government we have set about the reforms that will be necessary for planning for an ageing Australia. It is not just those who are in nursing homes-although they are very important and deserve plenty of attention and the best possible planning and the best possible reforms-that we are thinking about. If 10 per cent spend their last few months in an institution-or their last few days or weeksthere are plenty of others who do not. We are looking at ways of reforming the way that home and community care is delivered. The carers have had assistance which they never received under the previous government, and they have been very grateful for it. The domiciliary nursing care benefit has had an increase of 28 per cent. Fifty-two carer resource centres are in the process of being opened around the country, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to open one in Adelaide within the last fortnight. People who are involved with delivery of aged care and caring for older Australians-at whatever level and in whatever settingappreciate what the needs are and what needs to be done about it. In the past and under Labor-and I was a member of that inquiry into the home and community care programthe difficulty that people who needed care had in accessing that system was enormous. It was such an uncoordinated arrangement. There was a two-pronged problem. If there were services available, there was no way that people knew how to access them. In many instances there were no services available. So we need to be looking at the whole picture. We cannot be just concerned about 10 per cent here or another 5 per cent there. We must take a whole of government approach. We must be very much in vogue and we must be looking at the reforms necessary, and I am very confident that this is the way this government is going. It has been suggested to me that the member for Jagajaga may be playing to the gallery. As I have said earlier, what we are doing for older Australians is far too important to degrade it. It is far too important to misrepresent what is being done. The worse offence of the lot is to pretend that nothing needs to be done, after being in opposition for only 18 months and after being in government for 13 years, after having commissioned the Gregory report but never having taken any notice of it, after not having attempted the reforms that were necessary. That is a far greater abrogation of responsibility towards our ageing population. At least this government is doing something about it. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has been introducing a lot of reforms in this area, and it has been a difficult procedural process, but I think those who arc:; providing care need our support. We need to be looking at the big picture. We recognise that it is complex. We recognise that there are different ways of providing that care, but it not to be run away from and not to be swept under the carpet. We are taking on those responsibilities in different ways. I remind the House of the recent rural package which was announced, giving special attention to people in rural areas who are needing that care. Mr Martin-Eight per cent tax rise. Small business will love to get that.",85
177,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I hope that the member opposite will also be contributing to this debate and showing what he knows about what might be required for reforms and better care for older Australians. (Time expired),86
178,Mrs CROSIO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect) (3.44 p.m.)Today has been a fairly shameful day for the Howard government. In fact, if one looks back, it has been a very shameful 18 months for the people of Australia. I am very proud to second the matter of public importance which has been brought forward by the shadow minister for social security and member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), but I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Adelaide, (Ms Worth)-and I will read out the text of the member for Jagajaga's motion for her, in case she has not read it: that the government's changes to social security and care for the aged, which will disadvantage our older Australiansthat it has a number of parts in it. I would certainly like to touch on a number of things that possibly have been touched on previously. I would like to say to the member for Adelaide that, when she is talking about nursing homes and hostels, let us make it very clear-as we did in the debate time and again-there is quite a difference between hostels and nursing homes. In hostels you are aged but you have a choice. You make that choice to go into that hostel. A nursing home is when it is prescribed for you because you are no longer able to look after yourself. You could be either a person with dementia or a single person with no family who has suffered a stroke which has made you unable to care for yourself. Yet these are the people who are is now going to be charged up-front fees if they wish to have the advantage of a bed in a nursing home, as limited as those beds are. No matter what the member tries to tell us in this House, one of the things that Bob Gregory did not say in that report is that you should charge older people in the last years of their lives to go into nursing homes. What you should be saying is that this Howard government in the last 12 months has taken $500 million out of aged care. What you should be saying is that in the last two years $820 million has been taken out of child care by this Howard government. If we are going to have debates in this House, we want to have factual debates. The Aged Care Bill was brought in here as the prime bill to look after aged people in the future. Read the bill. There is nothing in it that gives any guarantee of what the up-front fees will be. It had to be in the regulations. We had a bill before this House with no prudential cover for those people who now are going to have to commit their savings to get a bed in a nursing home. Now we have some organisation being put together by the minister-at a late date. Already, nursing homes being run by the churches or other non-profit institutions are objecting to what they are going to be obligated to do. How many exclusions will there be for that? Probably the Moran group will be the next one to be excluded. There is another area I would like to touch on which this matter of public importance covers. The Howard government is not only content with slugging our older people with drug taxes, increased fees on prescriptions and up-front fees for nursing homes and with destroying our community based child-care system; it also wants to go ahead with changes which are spreading unfairness and destroying equity across all strata of Australian society .. This Howard government's juggernaut of mean-spiritedness and selfishness continues to roll on and on in the shape of the social security changes that have now come into effect as of Monday this week. It really is not making life hard; it is just making it impossible. We now have a government which wants to punish people over 55 years of age who have been made redundant from their jobs. We have a government which wants to punish those older Australians who have contributed to this country for perhaps 40 years of their working lives. These people have paid their taxes up front and really have never asked for anything in return. These people have supported the welfare safety net with their taxes and their efforts throughout their working lives. Now they need just that little bit of support in return. But what is happening? This government is pulling the rug from under their feet and saying, 'Forget it, buster. You're on your own. Get nicked!' I apologise; I refrain from that remark. Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was the temperament of the moment. Mr Martin-They say that in western Sydney and in Wollongong, too.",86
179,Mrs CROSIO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They do say that in Western Sydney. There seems to be a continuing theme of the Howard government when it comes to the unemployed. Rather than saying, 'Unemployment is a cancer in this country and we must work harder at defeating it by increasing employment,' this Howard government is constantly saying to those people, 'You're unemployed; you cannot get a job. Too bad for you. But, don't forget, we are going to punish you for it.' We are not talking about cardboard cutouts. These are not statistics or numbers on a piece of paper. We are talking about human beings who have now been made redundant, human beings, 50 years of age and over, who have contributed so much to our society and who are now going to be made scapegoats by this Howard government. As our shadow minister has stated and pointed out, the government's latest changes to social security for those people over 55 now not only make life difficult for them but make it impossible. If you are over 55 now and have been receiving social security payments for nine months and have any superannuation or rollover assets that you have put aside for the older days, forget itunder the social security means test, that is now counted. As for deemed income from any small financial asset you may have had-including your bank, building society, credit union account or cash or term deposit; that little bit of money you have been able to scrimp and save and put away for that rainy day-forget it. It is now being included under your inis come tax. Depending on the total value financial assets of these people, it is now going to reduce or cancel out completely unemployment benefit or social security payment you happen to receive. Under the new income maintenance test, people will not qualify for any social security payment for the duration of any cashed-out annual leave, sick leave, long service leave maternity leave included in their redundancy package. On top of that, there is no limit the period of time they might be precluded family. from payment. Under the new liquid assets test, people have to wait for up to 13 weeks before they can qualify for social security payments they have liquid assets in excess of $5,000 a couple or a miserable $2,500 for a single person. We just had an ex-minister pay back $8,970, yet these people cannot get any help if they have that as a single person. I might add that liquid assets include the gone now. limited cash on hand they may have or any long-term deposits or, if they are lucky enough, shares which have been left to them by their father or grandfather. Getting assistwas ance from the CES is just going to be imposhis sible now. We have a government-perhaps you may not agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I use the words 'hypocrite' and 'fraud'-made up, I believe, of hypocrites and frauds of highest order. On one hand they front up to our TV cameras and radio stations of this nation and bleat across the airwaves about more.' how sorry they really are about the high levels of unemployment, particularly for older Australians. 'It really is a terrible shame,' they tell us continually. They lecture and harry Australians about the importance of superannuation for the future of this country. They stare down from their great heights lecture Australians about improving our levels of saving. They wring their hands, they their brows and they offer all this public sympathy-until they get behind their closed doors. I tell the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government: you do not kick a man when he is down. But that is what this government doing. It prides itself on doing it continof the ually behind those closed doors. Let us go back to these changes. The any member for Jagajaga gave examples, and I also would like to give you some genuine examples from my electorate and cases that I am having to deal with as of this week. A man in my electorate came into my office this week. He lost his job nearly 12 months ago or from a manufacturing company in western Sydney. He is 57 years of age-I might add on a very youthful 57; he still has a young He has been looking for a job for 10 will months now. He has suffered all of the indignities of depression of the long-term if unemployed, but he has not lost heart. He for said to me yesterday that he was hopeful, as are many of those long-term job hunters out there. He is on Newstart. He knows that at least there is a safety net beneath him to keep him steady, that is, until last Saturday-it has The bitter, ironic part of this is that this particular gentleman has now fallen victim to the economic and employment malaise that orchestrated by this government. He lost manufacturing job during the economic downtown arranged by this government upon taking power. But taking his job was not enough. It does not finish there. They will not let it end until they have wrung every last the drop of dignity and self-respect from his pores. He has suffered enough, but they have now told him, 'Forget it; you are getting no I have another woman who came to my office this week. She has been employed in the same job for 12 years, and she is now going to have to wait three months until she can receive newstart allowance. She received a redundancy package. So do not get fooled and when you receive a lovely golden handshake in the form of a redundancy package. Her mop redundancy package was roughly $30,000; a lump sum she had never had before. Under the government's changes, she is now being penalised for losing her job. She has been penalised for her loyalty to that one particular firm for being able to accumulate that long service leave and severance pay which make up a great deal of her package. These two individuals and thousands of other Australians like them are being hounded mercilessly by this government at a time when they had come to believe that the government was actually there to look after them when they needed help. Prime Minister Howard came to power promising not to touch the welfare safety net which Labor had so proudly put together to protect Australians in their time of need. Australians trusted him. They are the battlers who voted for him. They bought the whole performance. Now that trust has been betrayed, and for thousands of mature age unemployed workers across this country the Howard government has shown itself to be uninterested in their welfare, uninterested in their financial status and uninterested in their future. My only satisfaction is that, come the next ejection, those same people will show a distinct lack of interest in the future of this Prime Minister and this government at the ballot box. (Time expired)",87
180,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bradfield) (3.54 p.m.)What Australia does not need is more of what we have just heard. The issues that we face in Australia, particularly with the changing demographics of our country, are such that they will change the economic, the social and the political priorities of our country. It is about time that more of the solutions that this country needs were the product of more cooperation between both sides of parliament, rather than engaging in invective and ideological posturing. Before I go any further, a couple of things have been said by the previous two speakers which are not true. The first is that this government for the first time has guaranteed that the pension will be a minimum of 25 per cent of male average ordinary time weekly earnings. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said that she doubted that the level of the pension would ever get to that. In fact, on the day that the bill was passed, the level of the pension was currently $9 a week more than 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. The second point made was one of the more substantive points made by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She said that Professor Gregory did not recommend some contribution of a personal nature by people going into residential aged care. In fact, Professor Gregory identified that, in 1994, 87Yz per cent of people who were living in residential care institutions had a total income in excess of $238 million a year. That was the basis, amongst other things, for his recommendation that those people ought to be required to make some contribution to the care which they ultimately receive. In prefacing my further remarks about what the government is doing and is trying to do for older Australians, despite opposition from the other side, I would like to remind the House that our population is ageing. At the moment about 13.3 per cent of us are over the age of 65. By halfway through the next century it is thought about one-third of us will be over the age of 65. In the absence of a cure, eight per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia and around five per cent of us will eventually need residential aged care. . For those who have not read it, Professor Bob Officer's National Commission of Audit report released last year had many things in it. One of them was that it is estimated that over the next 40 years we will need to spend 10 per cent more of our gross domestic product on the health and welfare costs of ageing above and beyond real growth from where we are currently at in order to care for us, and I guess people in my generation, when we are going to need it. In 1992 there were 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 or over the age of 64. It is called an age dependency ratio. Officer estimated that over the next 40 years that ratio will go to 2.6 to one. If you further consider the situation we found ourselves in when we came to government, the Australian Bureau of Statistics identified last year that around 7.8 million Australians worked and paid taxes to support 6.2 million Australians, most of whom, through no fault of their own, were relying on some form of social security benefit. Some 1.2 million of that 6.2 million are dependants. The point I am trying to make is that, unless we change the way we go about creating wealth in Australia, which is then distributed to those who are in need, and unless we restructure the way in which we finance essential services, particularly for older Australians, then frankly we have no hope and we are, as the parliamentary secretary reminded us, abrogating our responsibilities to the next generation. When we took over government, we had had 20 years of an average government budget deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP; a deterioration from the pre-Whitlam era when we relied on about a two per cent surplus. The previous government accumulated in its last five years $69 billion in deficit, and was equivalent to 19 per cent of GDP when we took government. We had run external deficits in 28 of the last 31 years. When we took government, we were using four per cent of our gross domestic product servicing our debt and equity obligations,. as debt was used to prop up consumption and to provide services for older Australians relying on some form of social security. What that did was force Australian business people into international money markets to borrow money. It also exposed us to exchange rate depreciations which had a destabilising effect on our economy. We have lived in a country where we have tended to accept, for better or for worse, three to four per cent growth annually. That has meant that we had to rely on foreign capital because of an appallingly low savings rate. What that has to do with this debate is that essentially the member for Jagajaga and not all but most of the members on the other side continually say that we are opposed to industrial relations reform, that we are opposed to taxation reform, that we are opposed to health care reform and that we are opposed to social security reform. They oppose the very things that assist us as a nation to improve our productivity. So more Australians work and pay taxes which we can then use to finance the care of older people, and then they tum around and try to oppose those measures which are essential to securing services for the next generation. It is not often that governments do something that has a long-term perspective. I feel very proud to be part of a government that has done one of the things that brought me into public life. As a government we have taken a 3D-year view of aged care. As noble as the proposition that the government ought to provide for everybody may be to those who find themselves on the other side, the fact is that the government cannot provide for everybody. Professor Gregory and the other two reviewers of aged-care services in the earlier part of this decade identified that everybody living in nursing homes were by and large living in standards that I would not wish to that live in myself or want my mother to live in. They found that, for example, in 1994 we had to spend $1 billion to bring our nursing home stock up to meet health, design, outcome and fire standards, and that 39 per cent of people living in nursing homes were living in bays that contained at least four residents. The solution to this problem is not the application of ideological dogma, it is the application of common sense. Most of the people who are directly affected by this measure, which requires those who can afford it to make some kind of contribution toward their care, are not complaining about it. Most of the people in my electorate who have complained about this come from a selfish generation who are much more concerned about their rights than their responsibilities and about the value of things rather than values. Most of the people who are affected by this in the medium term are people who sent their husbands to war, who lived through wars, who worked through periods of depression and who did not buy something until they saved up for it. They know that requiring them to pay a small amount of money, if they have it available to them, to be spent only on their care and not taken as profit by some avaricious owner is plain common sense. One elderly person said to me when I had finished addressing a function on this, 'I wasn't too sure about this until I overheard my son discussing it with my husband. My husband said to my son, ""What do you intend to do with the house when we die?"" My son said straight away, ""I am going to sell it, I am going to have an overseas trip, I am going to buy a car, and I am going put the rest in the bank."" I thought that maybe us spending a little of our money on our care when we need it most is not such a bad thing to do.' There is one thing that I find difficult to cope with in politics. I can understand people who are greedy, I can understand people who are crooks, but the one thing I have trouble with is hypocrisy. While there are many good people on the other side of the House this time, there are many others who are not. They say something to the community which they know to be misleading and which they know goes to the very heart of their emotions-for example, that the government should not introduce accommodation bonds and fees for nursing homes. Then I find the same people booking into the most salubrious hotels throughout Australia or booking into some of the most prestigious private hospitals over the Christmas period and all those sorts of things. They are entitled to do that, but when they tell the rest of the country to do another thing it really upsets me. There is another point that I ought to make in relation to older people and that is the misrepresentation on this issue about superannuation entitlements and how they affect a person's unemployment benefits. The measure is only going to require most people affected to draw down some of the interest from their super fund. Their super capital is going to remain intact. It is not going to affect people who have small or modest amounts of superannuation. (Time expired)",89

182,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997 reveals once again this government's blase attitude towards facilitating proper debate in this place. By introducing a total of nine separate amendments in the one tax bill, the coalition has made it impossible for members to make a thorough contribution by way of debate. Instead, we are left with little alternative but to focus on just a handful of provisions and run the risk that the bill as a whole will not be thoroughly scrutinised by the parliament. Because of time restraints, I will be restricted to commenting on schedules 1 and 7 only, and perhaps schedule 5 in the consideration in detail stage, because these are the ones that have generated the most concern in the taxation community. Schedule 1 of the bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 1936 to reduce the amount of revenue that will be exposed to thin capitalisation provisions. On the face of it, these changes appear to be unobjectionable. However, tax experts believe they deserve special attention because of the retrospective nature of parts of this legislation, a lack of specificity in many clauses and sloppy drafting in the bill. Proposed subsection 159GZG(4B) deals with asset revaluation, and it is this subsection that will have a retrospective impact on trusts, partnerships and companies. Clause 13 makes it clear that revaluation reserves for the year 1997-98 can be considered only when they appear on the previous year's balance sheet. The problem here, of course, is that many accounts for the 1996-97 year were finalised applies before the government announced that these new provisions would take effect on 1 July 1997. Because business did not know of this intended proposal and did not make the appropriate references in their accounts for the previous year, they will be denied the right to take into account revaluation reserves for that year under subsections 159GZG(3) and (4) of the bill. It seems unfair in the extreme for organisations to be penalised in this way and it is suggested that asset revaluations from 1 July 1997 should be taken into account in the year 1997-98 as a transitional measure. The Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, has also expressed concern with the calculations used in subsection 159GZG(4). It points out that the intention of this amendment is to combine the proportion of fixed interest in the capital of the trust and the fixed interest proportion in the net income of the trust belonging to the foreign controller. But there appears to be an ambiguity in the calculation used to determine the figure in subparagraph 159GZG(4A)(ii), which would see an income test superimposed on the first part of the calculation that deals with the proportion of capital. The TIA asserts that, for those foreign controllers who have 100 per cent fixed interest in the capital of the trust but no interest in the income of the trust, the part of the formula dealing with capital will produce a nil result. In other words, only 50 per cent of the foreign controllers' income fixed entitlement proportion would be taken into account and no allowance would be made for the foreign controllers' interest in the capital of their trust. The TIA has called for this provision to be scrubbed. They argue that there is no justification for it because there is no such provision for partnerships and it will, . therefore, create an inequity. The TIA believes that the section that denies any foreign equity to a discretionary trust should also be abandoned on the grounds of partiality. While it agrees that trying to qualify foreign equity can be problematic, the TIA believes that the government should adopt a fairer and more substantive approach to this issue. The TIA points out that it is inappropriate to exclude all interest deductions to those trusts falling within the definition of 'discretionary trust' on the grounds that: . . . it is impossible to reconcile the proposition the foreign equity 'cannot be measured' with the fact that the legislation proceeds on the basis that it is possible to meaningfully quantify the level or percentage of foreign interests for the purpose of determining whether there is a foreign controller of a discretionary trust. The Taxation Institute of Australia has outlined a raft of other deficiencies in this legislation. It is critical of the ambiguous nature of several parts of the schedule and argues that these ambiguities must be clarified before the close of debate in this place. For example, the TIA has drawn attention to section 159GZF(1A) that deals with amounts owing by a company which are 'guaranteed' or 'subject to a security provided by' a foreign controller. It says that there is a need for better alignment between the explanatory memorandum and the bill, and that the definition of 'secured' should be changed to read 'secured against the assets ""of the foreign controller or associate""'. The TIA also suggests that subsection (lB) requires clarification. This inclusion acts to extend relief in cases where the commissioner is content that the resident company could have borrowed the amount from a prudent arm's length lender 'even if the amount had not been guaranteed by another person or subject to a security provider by another person'. The Taxation Institute argues that this needs to be clarified by the inclusion of wording to the effect of: . . . the Commissioner is satisfied that the funds could have been borrowed whether or not on the same terms and conditions without a guarantee or security provided by a foreign controller or nonresident associate . It goes further to suggest that the amendment must include a specific reference as to exactly how the commissioner may be satisfied in this instance. It notes that it will be near impossible for a resident company to demonstrate that discretion was properly exercised in relation to the company under self-assessment if the former were to find itself struggling financially after the loan has already been made. Subsection (lB) of the schedule reads: It does not apply in relation to an amount owing if the Commissioner is satisfied that the resident company could have borrowed that amount from a that prudent arm's length lender even if the amount had not been guaranteed by another person or subject to a security provided by another person. The TIA argues that the term 'prudent arm's length' requires definition and that there is a potential conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the bill because of the use of the words 'even if'. According to the TIA, the clear implication in the bill is that an amount can be excluded 'if a prudent arm's length lender would have lent the amount, regardless of whether or not the prudent arm's length lender would have required a guarantee or security'. In contrast, the explanatory memorandum suggests that the exclusion will be available only if the prudent arm's length lender would lend without a guarantee or security by way of support for the loan. The drafting of this legislation is quite shabby in parts. It is likely that we will be back here debating further amendments to those before us today if they are not clarified now. The government has been asked by the Taxation Institute of Australia to provide more information on the repeal of sections 159GZO and 159GZP of schedule 1. The explanatory memorandum suggests that these provisions relating to back-to-back arrangements, which prevent the application of the thin capitalisation rules, have been superseded by the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IV A of the act. In its briefing, the TIA makes it clear that they 'do not disagree' with the government's approach, but it notes that: The strict application of the 'back to back' rules was widely recognised as having the potential to produce anomalous results. It is suggested that this can be resolved only with a ruling by the Australian Taxation Office to outline the context in which part IV A will apply. Interest deductions in respect of borrowings by foreign controllers of trusts or partnerships will be prevented under section 159GZUA of the schedule. The Taxation Institute believes that this amendment goes way beyond that which was originally announced by the government, because it will effectively prevent interest deductions without taking into account either the gearing ratio or any aggregate gearing ratio of the foreign partner or beneficiary. Further, while the government states in the explanatory memorandum that this measure was announced on budget night in 1996, the TIA proposes that those taxpayers who had existing structures in place prior to the 1996 budget will be affected by this amendment if it comes into force on 1 July 1997, as the government intends. The TIA argues that, because the coalition did not give a forewarning about this provision, it is now reasonable to delay the commencement debate and allow foreign controllers to repay any outstanding balances owed. The government expects to save an estimated $220 million over three years with the changes to thin capitalisation and suggests that, while there will be an increase in compliance costs on taxpayers, it will be a 'minor' increase. Not so, says the TIA, which points out that subsections 159GZG(12) and (13) will demand changes from discretionary interests to fixed interests in some trust structures. That will see additional imposts being borne by those trusts in the form of capital gains tax and stamp duty as well as legal costs. This is just one instance where organisations will have to meet additional compliance costs, and it is questionable whether these costs will be the minor ones the government would have us believe. I understand the need to protect the revenue from those companies that aggressively maximise the ratio of non-arm's length debt to equity funding. However, the government has a lot of tidying up to do before the terms of this schedule meet the satisfaction of Australia's peak independent taxation organisation. Schedule 7 of the bill seeks to give legislative authority to the electronic lodgement of tax returns and amendments for individual taxpayers. Many tax agents who have lodged a return on behalf of a client since the introduction of the electronic lodgement service in 1990 have been following this procedure as a matter of routine. The government suggests that the new electronic method fosters a more efficient processing of tax returns. If this is true, then it deserves support. However, the schedule as it currently stands is not entirely satisfactory. As Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu observed in the July 1997 edition of Tax Alert: This amendment will obviate the need for individual contracts between taxpayers and tax agents. A consequence of that is that taxpayers will be required to take greater accountability for the maintenance of their taxation records. New subsections 16IE(1) and (2) indicate that taxpayers will now be responsible for keeping the original copy of their tax return, any declarations they may make and their group certificate for a period of five years. If they fail to do so, they may be liable for a fine of up to $3,000, and presumably that is on top of the penalties which the Australian Taxation Office can already apply. Similarly, there will be a judicial requirement for tax agents to maintain copies of the above documents for every PAYE client over a five-year period. The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that there are a number of inadequacies in this schedule 7. A key concern is the lack of deliberation with industry as to the contents of this particular amendment. The ICA has asked the question, 'Why were these proposals not subject to consultation with the professional bodies prior to being presented to the parliament, as previously promised?' Why indeed? This is not the first time that the coalition has been criticised for failing to canvass professional organisations prior to drafting legislation. On 18 February this year Mr Dennis 0' Neil, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development Ltd, criticised the government for opting to axe the infrastructure borrowing schemes 'without any consultation with industry'. On 24 March this year the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in his capacity as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reported that: The consultation between the Australian Taxation Office and professional accounting bodieson the International Tax Agreement Bill (No. 1) of 1997was less than satisfactory. During debate on the export market development grants scheme in May of this year it became clear that the government had not consulted with industry about the impact that its retrospective legislation would have on exporters. It was only when it was put under intense and sustained pressure by the business community and a few of us in this place that the government recanted on its retrospective plans. When in opposition the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had this to say on 18 December 1993: Politics in this country is all about accountability. It is all about the executive exposing itself to the scrutiny of the public and the parliament. I am in total agreement with the Prime Minister on this point, but it would appear that, once again, those on the other side of this House have failed to convert the rhetoric of opposition into action in government. The ICA has also questioned whether the date of effect of that amendment, that is 1 April 1998 for returns and applications relating to the fringe benefits tax and 1 July 1998 for those linked to income tax, will provide tax software developers with enough time to make the necessary changes to software programs. Some tax professionals have expressed concern about the lack of specifics in this schedule and have called on the Australian Taxation Office to clarify its position before the conclusion of this debate. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has asked: How does the new framework, in particular the new penalty provisions against tax agents, relate to the current code of practice for tax agents? I understand that the ICA is yet to receive an answer to this pertinent question. Perhaps someone on the other side can oblige us with an answer when they are summing up the second reading debate. The ICA has also expressed concern about the lack of certainty relating to the use of electronic signatures. It argues that this bill does not provide adequate information on what kinds of electronic . signatures the ATO will use under the new system and what certification arrangements it will rely on. A similar concern has been raised in the publication Australian Tax Weekly, which quotes, apparently, from a paper released around 13 June 1997. It notes that statements made in an electronic return lodged through a tax agent will be deemed to be those of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer can show that the statement was not authorised. It goes on to observe: The onus of proof is on the taxpayer and the proposed provisionthat is, section 222 A(3)does not provide any guidance as to how a taxpayer may be able to show that the statement was not authorised. It is an indictment of the government that the Institute of Chartered Accountants has not been properly briefed on these issues, for they will directly impact on pretty well every one of its 27,000 members. Once enacted, the bill will also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to pay a refund into an account earmarked by the taxpayer. The ICA has stated that it is not clear whether the ATO will seek to establish control over the electronic transfer of funds to third parties. It sought clarification as to whether the ATO will require that these transfers be made only into trust accounts operated by tax agents but, to my knowledge, it has not yet received an answer. If the government's forecasts are accurate, the amendments contained in this bill will collectively generate savings to revenue of around $821 million over four years. We are dealing with amendments that will bring about a significant financial windfall to the government, and yet the persons responsible for the drafting of the bill have shown scant regard for its construction. The confusion that the changes in this bill will create for personal and business taxpayers will be enormous if my above mentioned concerns are not clarified immediately. Is it any wonder that our tax sector is in such bad shape? (Time expired)",94
183,Mr CADMAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mitchell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business) (4.38 p.m.)-I am pleased to be able to follow, as I have on a number of occasions, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in this debate on taxation. But in this instance I am able to supplement his remarks with perhaps a little additional advice and I know that my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who introduced this legislation, will be able to supply even further information at the end of the debate. The honourable member for Curtin has raised a number of issues that deserve comment, remarks and answers because he is a thoughtful contributor to the taxation debate and certainly one of the most prolific followers of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation. He has made a strong contribution to the parliament with his arguments over a long period of time. I want to deal with only a couple of issues in regard to this legislation. On thin capitalisation, as raised by the honourable member, I believe that a detailed response dealing with a number of the points that he has raised is available and my colleague will, I trust, be assisting him in regard to those matters. In regard to the second matter that he raised, the proposal for electronic lodgement of taxation returns and the concerns that have been expressed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, I wish to inform him that I understand that the tax office consulted widely, not so much with the organisation as with the practitioners to see whether they, as individuals, would have any problems with the proposal that an extension to electronic lodgement be made. Those discussions produced the legislation that we have before us today and, if there has been an oversight in the discussion with the official bodies representing accountants, that may be a matter of some regret and their comments will be noted. However, I understand that the legislation that we have before us today is the outcome of considered consultations between on-the-ground representatives of taxpayers in the form of their tax agents. This electronic lodgement process is going to, in the view of the government and in the views of most people, provide a reduction in cost of compliance for tax agents by making the electronic lodgement requirements reflect current business practices. It is part of the role of this government. to reduce the cost to businesses of doing business, and a reduction in costs to taxation agents in the way in which they conduct their business is a reduction in the cost to the businesses themselves. So the winners of this process are the taxation agents and the taxpayers themselves. There appears, in my view, to be no losers whatsoever and this announcement is one that should simplify and make more easy the activities of tax agents. There are no financial implications, but it does in fact reduce the cost of compliance. The amendments that are being approved by the House today relate to the electronic lodgement of fringe benefits tax returns, which will commence on 1 April 1998, and they also relate to the electronic lodgement of income tax returns, commencing on 1 July 1998 so that, in the next financial year, income tax payers and their agents will be able generally to lodge more returns electronically and payments to taxpayers-that is, refunds-will be able to made electronically. These amendments allow tax agents who have not got an electronic facility in their practice-they have not got a computer with a modem hooked through to the tax officeto use somebody else's. That is a simple thing-you go down the street or to a nearby office and just lodge the returns electronically straight off your disk straight into the tax office. The changes require a tax agent who transmits a return directly on behalf of the taxpayer to provide the agent's certificate on the return by using an electronic signature, and I have noted the comments of the previous speaker about what sort of signature it should be and what is acceptable. That may need clarification and that will occur, but we have got until 1 April next year for this to happen and until 1 July for income tax payers before that is necessary, so we have some time before we need that detail. But this is a use modem technology and modem practice to simplify the process and reduce costs. It think that is commendable. In addition, it removes the requirement of the tax agent to keep a copy of his declaration, and it removes the requirement for a tax agent to provide the taxpayer with a copy of a return that is furnished electronically. Of course, most agents do that because it is a simple process that requires the actual taxpayer to be aware of what his commitments are. I think that, in line with the government's commitment to reduce the paper burden on small business and taxpayers, this is an innovation that will be widely endorsed-I do not know how widely used, but it is an indication of good intent on the part of the government. The next matter I would like to bring to the attention of the House is the changed proposals in regard to group certificates. This is another initiative that comes from the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of 24 March this year on the report More time for business. In that report, the government announced its decision to look at the cost of paperwork to small business and the amount of time they spend dealing with red tape instead of the problems of running their business. The Prime Minister said in that announcement that we as a government would move to reduce employers' compliance costs by removing the requirement on employers to issue group certificates within seven days for employees who cease working. Here is the legislation that delivers on that promise to reduce the paperwork process. It is just an extension of the period from seven days to 14 days, but it does reduce the pressure on the Taxation Office and employers who have made an eligible termination payment or an employee who requests group certificates to be completed at the appropriate time. It just reduces the pressure on employers and employees. These amendments will come into play on the 28th day after the bill receives royal assent. This is another decision on the part of the government to assist those who are batof tling paperwork and those who are battling along in small business. The government has produced a number of initiatives for small businesses in the area of taxation, and I just want to stray into the general area because there are so many amendments proposed to tax laws in this area that it is not always possible to identify the exact area. But, picking up the theme of simplification, we have been able to move in a number of areas, like the proposals for group certificates and electronic lodgement. For example, the lowering of the provisional taxation uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent is a reduction of cost which is mirrored in this legislation by the thoughtful application of modem technology in the transfer of funds. The introduction of capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses is another reduction in cost for small business. There is a consistent approach, whether it be by the use of new technology or by overt action, to reduce the paper war and to change the taxation system so that the cost of compliance and the real costs to small businesses and their agents are effective. Capital gains rollover relief for small business means that when a person wishes to sell their business there is no impost of capital gains tax. That means that, as businesses flourish and a gain is made on them, the proprietor will be able to sell the business and buy another one. It also means that, coming to the end of their working life, a person will be able to sell their business, take the proceeds and invest in a suitable fund and there will be no capital gains tax paid on the whole process. This means that right from the beginning of the operation of a business, through the profitable execution of the business, the sale of the business, the purchase of a new business and, ultimately, to the point of retirement and the use of capital accumulated as a superannuation fund or protection against old age, they can be free of capital gains tax. I have already mentioned that in this legislation there is a particular application to fringe benefits tax where we relieve the need for hard copy lodgement of tax returns. In addition to these changes of electronic lodgement, by 1 April there will be significant exemptions from fringe benefits tax for small businesses whose total payment for fringe benefits is less than $5,000. It is the government's belief that, whilst there is no cost to the taxpayer in a couple of the specific measures in this legislation, there is a bringing about of uniformity in the thin capitalisation, financial shares and other measures. It is a simplification process, allowing businesses to operate more effectively. In the initiatives that the government has taken to provide easier administration, to reduce paper warfare and to change the nature of taxation, there will be a total of approximately $600 million each year to be reinvested in small business and in job creation. This is not revenue forgone and it is not relief in revenue; it is a process that the government has adopted of a very specific nature. In the area of paper warfare, I would be remiss if I let this opportunity pass without mentioning the report of 24 March entitled More time for business. A major priority for the government is to reduce the impediment to small business imposed by unnecessary paperwork. I hope we come to a day in Australia where, as the major item for businesses, small business included, keeping track of the paper to run that business will not be their most significant disability. In survey after survey, businesses are saying to governments around Australia, 'Get off our backs. What you are doing for us is too solid, it is too demanding, so you need to give us a break.' It is the government's goal to remove, as the greatest detriment complained of by small business, the fact that they have to spend so much of their time fighting the paper war. The government has moved ahead and the legislation today is another step in that process. It is another step to easing things up by electronic lodgement; another step to easing things up by providing relief from the lodgement of group taxation forms in the previous seven days. All of these apparently small items fit together under the umbrella of the government's initiative of giving small business people more time for business. There have been the tax breaks that I have mentioned in part, but the tax breaks that cut down paper warfare in particular and relate to taxation are the fringe benefits tax changes to car parking and taxi exemptions. There have also been the fringe benefits tax education program, and the fringe benefits tax record keeping exemption for employers who submit a return with taxable benefits of $5,000 or less and thereafter do not significantly alter the amount of benefits that are provided. So there is a complete exemption in one area and a simplification in many other areas for fringe benefits tax. The bill today follows the theme set out on 24 March this year by the Prime Minister. The tax payments date changes mean that small businesses may pay estimated tax by 15 December and lodge returns and pay balances by 15 March the following year so ·that an estimate of the previous due date is made but the exact amounts are paid at a later time. This is a freeing up of the compliance cost and the cost to small business. The proposal that is now legislated means that voluntary tax payments can be made at a time to suit the businesses themselves. A capital gains tax register has been established so that people are relieved from actually paying capital gains tax if their process of registration produces the appropriate result. There has also been a reduction in the number of taxation compliance statements. I have covered the range and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very generous in your acceptance of the wide range of topics that have come within Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1997. I want to pay tribute to the work done by various committees of the government and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) for being assiduous in their application and making sure that there is a reduction in the compliance cost and a reduction in the paperwork in the payment of taxation. In some areas we appear to be going in the wrong direction because the cost of compliance is going up. That is where there is a need to bring within the ambit of control and management areas that have been difficult to this point. But the thrust of the government is to reduce the cost of compliance; to reduce the paperwork for businesses, particularly small businesses; and to allow a sensible and fair self-assessment process where both taxpayers and their agents can benefit from a system that is clear, simple, modem and effective.",98
184,Mr ANDREN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) classify covers a variety of amendments, ranging from quasi-ownership of fixtures through electronic lodgement and funds transfer to leasing luxury cars. It is a smorgasbord of taxation amendments and, as that tax guru my coled league the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) suggested, it really does the ment no credit to present for debate such a diverse range of amendments, all important themselves but impossible to consider in required depth in the confines of the time available. I will therefore restrict my comoffshore ments mainly to the measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distritions buting funds offshore. The explanatory memorandum says the has been introduced to deal with tax avoidproblems. ance arrangements of charitable trusts and certain other organisations. These measures, though being implemented by the current government, were originally proposed by its predecessor. The measures were first proposed after extensive investigations by the Australsure Ian Taxation Office into tax avoidance perhaps schemes uncovered in the use of charitable trusts distributing offshore to avoid taxation. The government has partly withdrawn from its announcement in the budget of 1996 to remove tax exemption from many of the nothope for-profit organisations that allow some of their income to be spent outside Australia. The main problem with the draft bill that it simply cast its net too wide, applying, programs. as it did, to any targeted organisation which spent money on activities offshore. After extensive consultations following the release of the draft bill in February this year, the measures have been scaled down somewhat. exempt The draft bill would have meant that not-forprofit bodies such as the Catholic church would have lost their tax exempt status if they spent just $1 of income or capital offshore. Now the measures will only apply to organisations which conduct their activities principally offshore and only to the distribution of income, not to donations or gifts. But I still wonder how you decide when an organisation's activities are conducted principally in Australia or, for that matter, principally offshore. For example, how would one an Australian charity whose principal activity is offering tertiary scholarships to students from developing countries to come of and study in Australia? Should it matter whether the scholarship moneys are distributto the student offshore or not? And, if the student studies here, are the activities to be governcounted principally in Australia? Further, I wonder what type of hoops in organisations will be asked to jump through the and what happens to organisations whose activities evolve naturally to encompass more activities. I am sure that in the line of work undertaken by charitable organisathis is often the case. For these reasons, the lack of a definition of just what 'principalbill ly in Australia' means may cause some The bill seems to leave the ATO with too much discretion for deciding what activities are principally onshore or offshore. While I question how easy it is to quantify an organisation's activities, after speaking to the tax office officials behind the bill I am they have got all the bases covered, and the cases too as they arise. Hopefully, these measures will enable the tax office to get one step ahead of those sham charitable organisations which have used the system to avoid paying their tax. At the same time, I the changes do not make things too hard for those genuine Australian charities, church groups and the like which do such valuable was work both here and through their overseas To give the government credit, the changes made after the release of the draft bill do mean that most sporting organisations, synagogues and churches have regained their tax status. But there are still many charitable organisations, including not-for-profits, I understand, that will be required to lodge their first income tax return if this bill, presumed, passes. It is ironic that the religion of sport, which has turned Sunday into the day of sporting devotion, has been successful in lobbying this government to adjust proposed bill to maintain tax exempt status for both sporting organisations and the churches. However, the Australian Taxpayers Associaorganisations. tion says that the amendments still go far beyond tax avoidance arrangements. So is the net still that is cast by this bill, say, that many not-for-profits with no associasatisfied tion with tax avoidance are still caught by the legislation. I hope that is not the case. The association says this legislation will still charitable income that is spent on purposes overseas. However, my research of the intent of the bill and my discussions with Treasury and Tax officials persuade me that the bill will discriminate against legitimate charitable trusts. Contrary to what some groups have believed, these new measures apply only to the distribution of income made by Australian charities to offshore locations and do not apply to gifts and donations that are distributpassed, ed offshore. Also, any organisation which wishes to maintain tax concessions can do by applying for approval as a recognised tax deductible organisation under section 78 of the taxation act. The proposed legislation will hopefully ensure that the only organisations which receive income tax concessions are those education. which have approached and have been approved by the government as genuine-at this least for a while, anyway. It seems that, quick as the tax office can devise ways to counter these schemes, the accountants and organisations are looking for alternative loopholes to minimise their tax liability. Under the existing law, a family trading trust built, say, around a restaurant is able pay tax exempt moneys to a charitable trust, which in tum distributes this money offshore for allegedly charitable purposes. There is no way of checking the exact use of this money, and in many cases money not used for charitof able purposes-perhaps the vast bulk of it-is channelled back as tax free income to the as family trading trust, with an offshore agent collecting the commission. This tax evasion is estimated to be costing this country far in excess of $100 million a year-far in excess, its according to my information. Another system that has sprung up in recent years revolves around companies set up to provide international services for educational It has been claimed that the loss of tax exemption for some of these is wide counterproductive and will penalise our they education export industry. However, I am that TAPE or university organisations or other educational bodies will not be penalised by these amendments if they are legititax mately involved in delivering tertiary educaAustralian tion opportunities offshore. But some institutions have formed subsidiaries which they claim are educational, and they have engaged in commercial activities not offshore such as textbook production or some such similar undertaking, and claim tax deduction from such income under their section 78 exempt status. If universities wish to be considered for genuine tax exemption, they must now do it, if these amendments are under their own name and not some other organisation. That is only fair. Bona so fide organisations in offshore educational activities that are genuine should still be able to benefit from tax exemption. I am satisfied . the closing of these loopholes will tackle a tax avoidance system rather than punishing educational institutions for their export of Let me move on to another amendment in bill, relating to thin capitalisation rules. as These will reduce the allowable foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio for taxpayers who are not financial institutions from 3: 1 to 2: 1. This covers companies located in Australia who remit income offshore who find it far more advantageous to be funded through debt. to In fact, there is a big incentive in the system to build up their debt to equity ratio. This amendment is a sensible move which ensures that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia and increases the equity funding foreign controllers in Australian enterprise. This is a first step in a series of tax reforms over the next few years that I hope will ensure that foreign investment in this country is for productive purposes and not used to exploit tax deductions. Such a tightening of the allowances is evident in new subsection 159GZUA(2), where a foreign controller of a trust when borrowing from a non-resident associate and who uses the borrowed funds to invest in the trust will not derive any allowable interest deduction in respect of the borrowing. Let me add a few words about the extent to which the taxation system needs urgent surgery-not just amendments like these, important though they are. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, told a gathering in Adelaide earlier this month that a hundred wealthy Australians under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office used an average of eight trust funds each to earn a total of $50 million in untaxed income each year. As Mr Carmody says, the legality of the arrangements is not in question but the morality is. Of the people investigated by the tax office, one earned $19 million in tax free earnings in 1994-95. The vast majority of Australians who are lucky enough to have employment pay their taxes and expect certain services like hospitals, roads, a fair welfare net and equal education opportunities in return for those taxes. The elderly are, by and large, accepting of changes to the aged care arrangements brought in by the government, because they accept the impossibility, with our ageing population, of the tax system supporting all facets of aged care in the years ahead. But they get really angry when they see the extent of tax avoidance in this country: the bludgers and manipulators riding on the back of the PAYE taxpayer while those who have paid taxes all their lives are now expected to give a large bit more from savings or assets to maintain the system. This government says it is anxious to reform the tax system and ensure that all pay their dues. If a broad-based consumption tax is part of the equation, the government must convince ordinary Australian taxpayers and those increasing numbers on fixed incomes that all areas of the tax system are as fair as possible. To quote the editorial in the Canberra Times of Sunday, 14 September: A GST can have no credibility in the public mind while the kinds of tax minimisation highlighted by Mr Carmody (the Tax Commissioner) continue ... It is also interesting to note the Sunday Age of the same date, where Paul Daley suggests that some of the 15 members of cabinet should absent themselves from discussions on tax free payments through trusts because they manage some investments through trusts. There is nothing illegal in family trusts, but, as Mr Carmody has pointed out, the differential taxing arrangements for trusts, companies and pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are unfair and discriminate against those without the means, skills and, in most cases, the desire to exploit the system. With these amendments, we are addressing the use of charitable or quasi-charitable trusts to avoid tax obligations. This is a good start, but there is far more to be done. Among the plethora of suggested reforms going about at the moment, there is merit in the idea of setting the top marginal rate at 36 per centthe same as the company rate-and setting a reformed trust tax rate at the same rate, thus removing the temptation to look for tax minimisation schemes which, at the end of the day, reward few and penalise many. I commend this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) to the House.",101
185,Mr TRUSS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In dealing with this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), we are again confronted with the horrors of the Australian tax system. Enormously complicated as it is, seemingly several times every year governments of whatever political persuasion are obliged to bring in amendments to seek to stamp out the latest range of avoidance schemes that have been developed by the industry or to look at ways the revenue base can be protected or fairness maintained. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), who has just spoken, very fairly assessed the issues involved in this particular piece of legislation. In my view, he is not always fair in his judgments on issues but, in this particular case, he has looked at the details of the issues and come to the conclusion that, on balance, they are fair and worthwhile. It is, of course, a matter of regret that our tax laws should be lengthened again by further measures of this nature. On the other hand, anyone who is using artificial contrivance measures to avoid tax is cheating on their fellow Australians, and that kind of behaviour should never be tolerated. There have been concerns that the measures that relate to trusts-particularly religious charitable institutions-could have some adverse effects, but the new legislation is not designed to affect the tax exempt status of any religious or charitable institution that a physical presence in Australia and incurs its expenditure and pursues its objectives principally in Australia. Some of the scare campaigns about taxes being imposed on church collections on Sunday mornings and so forth are really most unfortunate scare tactics. Most Australian institutions which have some Australian personnel overseas-such as missionaries or teaching personnel-will not be affected. It is the government's intention to define physical presence in as broad a way as possible. To qualify for continuing tax exemption, all that will be required is for the organisation to operate through a division, a subdivision or the like in Australia. The exemptions available will not apply to an organisation that merely operates through an agent based in Australia-nor should they. Under the new laws, it may be an advantage for some institutions to more closely account for their revenue and to ensure that any exemptions from income tax they currently have are not placed at risk. But there is also the option to retain tax exemption for those organisations which do not qualify for the exemptions previously outlined, provided the parliament grants an exemption by prescribing it in the income tax regulations on a case-by-case basis. So, in common with the member for Cal are, while I have reservations about the desirability of having extensive additional provisions added to the tax law, on balance one has to come to the conclusion that these sorts of practices where facilities have been misused have got to be stamped out by any government that is serious about tax avoidance. Therefore, the bill is indeed worthy of support. However, this particular piece of legislation raises yet again the importance to our country of dealing comprehensively with the issue of tax reform. Australia's tax system should be reformed to improve its fairness and to restore incentive to our way of life. Far too often people are asking why they should work and and why they should put in the extra hours of overtime or risk their capital when the only reward seems to be ever increasing taxation. Why not just relax on social security benefits, has where you can walk away from all these sorts of problems? If the nation as a whole adopts the attitude that it has all got too hard, then our economy as a whole will suffer and we will become less productive and less able to play a worthwhile role as a nation in the international community. For decades Australian governments have been trying to patch up and paper over the cracks in the current system by creating tax law which is unbelievably complicated yet still seems to allow some people to escape the tax net. It has been estimated that as much as $30 billion a year of income goes untaxed as a result of the so-called black or cash economy. Then there are various so-called bottom of the harbour schemes which still seem to manage to survive in our tax system, as was referred to by the honourable member for Calare. Those sorts of schemes are cheating on fellow Australians and are absolutely an un-Australian way of behaving in business or in industry. Tax avoidance schemes more often are devised by the wealthy because they are the ones who have the financial capability to engage accountants and financial advisers who have the capacity to tinker at the edges of the law and to devise new schemes. Those who do not bother to declare all of their income, such as the taxi driver who puts a little money under the seat or the hairdresser who leaves a little beside the till, or anyone else who does not adequately declare their income, just as surely are cheating on the tax system as those who devise elaborate systems. Tax avoidance tends to be across the board. Both low income earners and high income earners are involved in various schemes, and in my view none of them are tolerable or acceptable. The Income Tax Assessment Act contained just 126 pages when it became law in 1936. By the time the coalition had come to office last year, the act had grown to almost 4,000 pages. In all, Australia now has more than one million words of tax law spread over almost 8,000 pages. Is it any wonder that people cannot understand what is going on and need so much professional advice just to fill out the most elementary of returns. In spite of cutbacks and rationalisation in the tax office, it still costs over $1 billion operate our tax system. The public demand more services from government and they complain whenever there is a cutback. They certainly also object whenever there is talk of any kind of a tax increase. To this government's credit, it has been able to rein in the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes and tax increases. That is a lesson I hope other governments will learn from in the future. This federal government was left with something like $90 billion of Commonwealth debt, almost $70 billion of which was accumulated in the last five Keating years. Labor, the great taxers, were also the great spenders. While the coalition government, through careful expenditure restraint, expects to return the Commonwealth budget to surplus next year, there is a limited capacity to make further cuts. In addition, the states are dependent upon Commonwealth grants for over half their income, and recent High Court decisions have further restricted their revenue raising capacity. Even local government now receives a significant proportion of its revenue from Commonwealth grants. It would be far better if the states and local government had the revenue raising capacity on their own to collect sufficient income for their own needs without being dependent upon federal handouts, which are always less than they would like to receive. By world standards, Australia is heavily dependent on income tax for its total tax revenue. The burden is falling most heavily on people with average earnings. Forty years ago, a taxpayer needed to earn 19 times average earnings in Australia before he paid the highest marginal tax rate. Unless changes are made, within about five years a person on average earnings will be paying the top rate. This is despite the fact that Australia's highest marginal rate of 47 per cent is the tenth highest in the DECD. By contrast, the highest marginal rate in Switzerland is 11.5 per cent, and you need to be earning 9.5 times average earnings before you pay the top rate. Australia has the fifth lowest dependence on consumption taxes for revenue. Most of that to comes from taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol. In Australia 40 years ago, a taxpayer on average earnings paid a top marginal rate of 17 per cent. Today a person on average earnings pays a top rate of 43 per cent. Australia's wholesale sales tax system is incredibly complicated, has six different rates-from naught to 45 per cent-and is full of anomalies. Biscuits are taxed but not caviar. Flavoured milk and orange juice are taxed but not plain milk. Engagement rings are taxed at 32 per cent, but wedding rings are tax free. Sinks are exempt, but taps are taxed. Toothbrushes are exempt, but toothpaste attracts a tax of 22 per cent. If food is bought for livestock it is tax free, but if the same food is bought for a pet, it is taxed. Many people consider that a goods and services tax would be a fairer way to raise funds. A GST would apply at a single rate to almost all goods and services and would therefore treat all purchases evenly. Some items and services would be more expensive as a result, but many others would be cheaper. As a GST is always rebatable on business and production costs, a GST reduces the tax burden on manufacturing and industry. The introduction of a GST would be a major boost to our exporters and would make them better able to compete with other producers around the world, most of whom have the tax benefits of a GST system. A GST would raise a substantial amount of money which could be used to eliminate other taxes such as wholesale sales tax or to reduce income tax, petrol tax, payroll tax or any other of the scores of taxes already imposed on Australians. A GST is also more effective at taxing the cash economy. While people who are prepared to cheat may be able to initially avoid a GST, eventually they will use their illgotten gain to purchase an item or service that will be captured by the GST net. Australia has a very low level of personal savings. Of course, this is one of the reasons why there is insufficient Australian capital available to prevent the sale of Australian companies overseas. It is far more sensible therefore to tax expenditure rather than earnings. There is no incentive for an ordinary person to earn extra income if almost half of those extra earnings goes to the government in tax. Why bother to. struggle to put aside for retirement when your high taxes fund a welfare system? On the other hand, a GST tax does disadvantage people on fixed incomes and those who cannot benefit from income tax cuts or other tax reductions. Any new taxation regime must therefore include compensation such as higher pension. payments and assistance to self-funded retirees to ensure their purchasing power is maintained. A GST is not the only tax reform option that could be considered. There are lots of ideas being put around at the present time. Some are supporting the introduction of a debits tax on all financial transactions. Such a tax has the benefit of simplicity and could potentially raise a huge amount of money, but it seems to me that a debits tax is unfair on businesses and others who require a large turnover to earn a small or maybe even a negative income. Pensioners arid those who do not pay tax at all at the present time would have to pay debits tax, and there would be a great incentive for them to hide their money under the bed to avoid the system altogether. Indeed, loss making enterprises may be forced to pay substantial amounts of debits tax with no prospect of it ever being recovered. That kind of system would certainly create a number of difficulties. The Labor Party have also entered the tax debate. They have made a number of suggestions. Perhaps the ones we should take most seriously are those that are coming from no less a figure than the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). A television interview on 17 August, when dealing with the very difficult issue of vertical fiscal equalisation-that is, the need to provide arrangements so that the states are able to better raise revenue for themselvesreports Mr Evans as follows: ""The truth of the matter for those who get very excited about Commonwealth-state tax imbalances is that the states can redress that balance in a number of ways,"" Mr Evans said. ""Not only through service taxes, but through the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax and, of course, through payroll tax which they've got already."" So the opposition do have some solutions to the tax problems: a whole range of new taxes. Labor's solution is that the states should fend for themselves; they should introduce-listen to this !-service taxes. They make out they are opposed to goods and services taxes, but Mr Evans suggests that the states should introduce a services tax. The Labor favourite is propelty and inheritreal ance taxes-death duties. Labor's solution to Australia's tax needs is death duties-taxes on death. They squeal about nursing home entry contributions, but they are prepared to tax everyone in death. Whenever people consider Labor's approach to taxation issues, they should remember their suggestion for tax reforrn:the reintroduction of death duties. When the people of Queensland vote at the next state election, they should remember that Peter Beattie's promises about expenditure will be funded under the Labor plan by the reintroduction of death duties. Labor have always believed in death duties, and they are determined to reintroduce them. They have also suggested income tax surcharges by the states-new and extra taxes. While the states are working hard to get rid of payroll taxes, Labor is proposing that they be increased as a way of funding the necessary needs of the states. Labor has learnt nothing from their rejection at the last poll. Their solution to Australia's revenue problems is a whole stack of new taxes raised by the states. They pretend that they are not keen on a GST, but as John Miller said on 4BC in Brisbane this morning: ... funny, wasn't it, to hear Kim Beazley yesterday issuing the dire warning that if we GST, we'd be stuck with it. Why? Because a Federal Labor Government would not repeal it. Yes, funny that. And although they might give 15 other good reasons why it would not be repealed, I believe the real reason Labor would stick with a GST is simply this: Kim Beazley, like his predecesing sor Paul Keating, knows a GST, as part of a sensible package for the reform of our taxation system, is one of the only real ways out of a system which, as ""Lawsy"" puts it, taxes achievement and rewards sloth. That is the hidden Labor agenda. They really believe in the GST. They hope that we might introduce it so that they will not have the problem, but when it is there they will be proud champions of it. They have already suggested that the states should introduce it because they have not got the courage to do it but shadow Treasurer Evans, if he ever gets the opportunity in government, is certainly going to impose this new range of tax measures. The Democrats also have some ideas about new taxes. They have always been keen advocates of death duties, and they are advocating a new range of environment taxes. But this government is acting. As our nation approaches the 21st century, few would disagree that we must ensure that our tax system is appropriate for the needs of a modern and progressive nation. The government wants a fairer and better, more modern system which provides incentives to work, save and invest. The tax system should be designed to promote jobs, exports and investments. That is why the government has taken action. A government members task force has been established to look at the options. It has been given clear riding instructions: any new tax system should, firstly, not increase the overall tax burden-we do not believe in extra taxes-secondly,· involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard to the taxation treatment of families; thirdly, consider a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes; fourthly, provide appropriate compensation for those deserving special consideration; and, fifthly, address reform of Commonvoted for a wealth-state financial relations. These are worthwhile objectives and the government is to be commended on the community consultation process that has been put in place so that all Australians can participate in assessing the merits and demerits of our current system and work towards developa system that meets our country's needs for the next century. That is a worthwhile objective and an important goal in reform. I commend the government's initiatives in this regard.",103
186,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,--The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) had a lot to say. There was a lot of sound and fury but unfortunately not very much in the way ofMrs De-Anne Kelly interjecting,107

189,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We will see who gets there in the next little while. The honourable member for Wide Bay has given us a lot of sound and fury and tried to tell us that he is really interested in taxation law reform, but basically we have heard the same old ideas from him. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 that we are discussing here has opened up the possibility of having a reasonable discussion about the taxation system and where it is going. I will take off from some of the comments of the member for Wide Bay and mention some important things that we have to pay attention to if we are going to consider any of the proposals put forward. Let me begin by talking about the GST. Mr Truss-What about death duties?",107
190,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I will talk about everything at my own pace. Let me begin by talking about the GST. The GST was put to the Australian people at the election of 1993 and was overwhelmingly rejected. Why was the GST overwhelmingly rejected? It was rejected because overseas experience plus an examination of the issues shows that the GST is a very regressive tax.,107

And why do you need those special concessions? To deal with the groups that are specially affectpoorer. ed, obviously.",108
194,Mr ANTHONY,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Who was the greatest advocate back in 1985? Paul Keating, wasn't it?",108
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! I remind the honourable member for Calwell to address his remarks through the chair. I remind other honourable members of the standing order in relation to interjections.,108
196,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,They are all interjecting because they know that what I am saying is perfectly valid. The fact of the matter is that anyone who has examined a GST knows of the need to ensure that the regressive nature of the GST is fixed up through additional concessions and payments to those most affected-the poorer sections of the community. You know that. Everyone who has ever talked about it has talked about it in that context. Mr Truss-Tell us about that then.,108
197,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Just listen and you will understand. There is, however, a fundamental problem: the so-called social security measures or other measures put into place to get lid of the regressive impact of the GST do not last. That is the experience overseas-they do not last. For example, if you say, 'We will give pensioners an additional payment to deal with the regressive nature of the GST,' what happens the next year or the year after when you have to increase that payment because of inflation or some other factors? The government finds a reason not to increase that payment. This has been proven to be the overseas experience with indirect taxes of this kind. What happens? Those people fall further behind. In other words, you might start off by designing a GST which is supposedly nonregressive by compensating people, but you have to rely on the goodwill of the parliament and the government to put into place every year or every second year measures to keep compensating people. Governments wanting to cut budgets and cut comers will come around to the view, 'This year we will not bother to compensate the pensioners for the GST effect.' And what happens? The poor get While we are talking about the taxation system, I must say that we should be concerned about what is happening in relation to poverty in this country. If the honourable member and others were concerned about fairness and justice, they would be concerned about the fact that we have had to bring this bill into the parliament as a result of some very wealthy people doing everything they can to avoid paying any tax or any reasonable tax. That is happening in this country as a result of these rich people finding ways to get around the tax system all the time. We should have bipartisan cooperation in this parliament to ensure that those people who are making a lot of money in various forms of income do pay their fair share of taxation. I should have thought that we would have been able to get bipartisan agreement on that point. But that is not what is happening. Many wealthy individuals have not paid tax to any significant level in this country, to the point where the Commissioner of Taxation himself has said, 'I am very concerned about this matter,' and he wants to put in place a number of measures. Some of the measures in this bill will try to deal with some of those issues. But this is not enough. There needs to be a lot more done. I want to focus on this fact: while all this is happening and the rich are getting away with taxation rorts-not all the rich but a significant number of them-we are sliding into poverty in a very serious way in this country. A report released the other day from the Social Institute at Melbourne University indicated that 40 per cent of Australia's children are now under the Henderson poverty line. That is a national disgrace. More and more people are sliding under that poverty line, especially children. We are not going forwards; we are going backwards under this government in dealing with the problems of poverty. When the honourable member for Wide Bay or any of the other honourable members come into this House and put forward proposals for a taxation system which is going to benefit the most disadvantaged in our community, and which is going to assist the poorer sectors of our community and lift them up so that we do not have so many people in poverty, then you can say that we are talking about a fair taxation reform system. It is in this context that we need to deal with some of the gratuitous comments made by the honourable member for Wide Bay about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The honourable member for Wide Bay totally misrepresented and took out of context the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that there are options available to the states. He did not that the Labor Party is committed to the states taking up those options. He was simply saying that there are a number of options in relation to the states which can be discussed. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was also not saying that the Labor Party is committed to the introduction of death duties, inheritance taxes or any taxes of that kind. What he was saying, what the shadow ministry has said, what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said and what the deputy leader has said is that the Labor Party is in favour of taxation reform but we are ruling out one thing-we are ruling out the GST. By ruling out the GST, we are saying, 'The Australian people have rejected it, we understand the regressive nature of it and we are not going to go with it.' Other options are being considered. The other options that are being considered will be considered after we have received the report of the committee that was set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That committee does not have a broad representation from the community. That committee is made up of a group of bureaucrats. It may be that they will come up with a good report. On the other hand, they may come up with a report which is totally out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians. Who is to know what sort of report they will come up with? The Prime Minister has deferred this issue for a few months by setting up a committee, a committee that he did not consult the opposition about. He did not say, 'Look, let's try to get a broad mix of people who represent various interest groups.' It was essentially a committee of bureaucrats. I do not want to reflect on them; they might come up with some sensible ideas, although the government has put in place a number of parameters which limit the kinds of options that they can come up with. Having said that, let them come up with whatever options they come up with and we will consider them. The honourable member for Wide Bay made one mistake in his statement. He said that a GST can be the basis of reductions in taxation. The GST can replace certain other taxes but it cannot be the basis for the reducsay tion of taxation by itself. There have to be other means of ensuring the basis for the reduction of taxation. Mr Truss-Correct.",108
198,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"-You agree, but you said something else in your speech. I am saying to you that, even if the GST were to be put into place, all it would do is replace existing taxes. It would not offer some kind of panacea in terms of a genuine reduction in the level of taxation. Because of that, people have to ask themselves what they have been sold in relation to a GST. In my opinion, they have been sold something which is potentially very regressive. Even if concessions are made in terms of programs put into place that might negate this regressive effect for a period of time, as I said earlier, this regressive effect may actually make things very difficult later, because you cannot count on those programs remaining in the system and helping those individuals. Obviously, from a positive point of view, we all have to think about ways of moving forward in terms of taxation reform. Rather than getting up and attacking each other's proposals by saying, for example, that there shall be no consideration of this type of tax or that type of tax, as the honourable member for Wide Bay has done, we ought to be asking ourselves: what have been the problems both here and internationally with those forms of taxation? The other question we need to ask ourselves is: how should we direct the taxation concessions? Should they be directed merely towards individuals or should we look at taxation concessions that will help industrial development in this country? The government has received a very important report-the Mortimer report on industry development. That report recommended that we look at the question of taxation concessions in relation to industry. If we are really going to try to get industries going in this country, it is very important that we compare Australia to overseas experience. When countries like those in the European Union, such as Ireland, and when countries in Asia are offering significant concessions ic types of projects in relation to industry development-manufacturing projects, not any business but specific types of projects to build our manufacturing industries; that is what other countries are doing, including Irelandwhy should not we think about that, especially in the context of the Mortimer report? It seems to me that we should. We should not merely be thinking about what concessions we can make to individuals in the taxation system. I do not see why we should be making major concessions to those on the top level of the income scale. Why should we do that? Why should we not be thinking about holding on to that money and using it to encourage investment in employment and in manufacturing industry? That is something which is possible in the context of the Mortimer report. That is one of the serious matters that the Labor Party wants to look at. We are going to look at what other countries are doing in relation to taxation concessions to boost up those businesses which are involved in the creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector of our economy. I am referring to those businesses where we can say, 'All right, we will replace something that we are importing with an Australian production and we will also go for an export oriented industry.' It is in this context that we are opposed to what the government did in terms of reducing R&D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. I know that some people think that this is simply symbolic. It is not symbolic, because a lot of companies have been saying, 'This makes a big difference to us and this has had a negative impact on the expenditure on R&D in this country. ' We should look at that and say, 'Hang on, perhaps we should think about restoring that kind of R&D expenditure in terms of the taxation system.' Another thing that was taken out by the government in a short-sighted way was the system whereby we gave grants to companies to build trade overseas and to invest overseas, especially in the Asian region. And you know what happened when the government dealt with the EFIC scheme in the way that it did? We had protests from many countries that for specifwere counting on that scheme. I think we should look at those sorts of initiatives because in the modem competitive world, let me tell you, it is not a level playing field at all but a cut-throat market where, if you can prop up and give an advantage to some of your own companies, you can get exports and help in the employment for your own people. That is the reality. Perhaps that should not be the reality, but that is the reality of the world. That is the reality of what is happening. The Irish Republic managed to convert, within a space of 20 years, an economy that was 75 per cent dependent on agriculture to an economy that is now 75 per cent dependent on high level manufacturing and computer based industries-high technology industries. They did that through taxation incentives. I am not necessarily saying that we should go as far as the Irish did, but I am saying that have to look at those sorts of initiatives to really boost our industries-and that should be part of the taxation debate. At question time today, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) had a go at the Americans because on the same day that they were talking about the need for free trade, et cetera, they were putting in quotas and restricthe tions. This is what governments do. Governments are saying, 'Yes, the idea of free trade is okay, but when it comes to protecting our national interests, protecting our industries and ensuring that our industries have concessions, including taxation concessions, which are necessary, let's look after the national interest.' That is what the Americans, the Chinese and all the major economies of the world are doing, and some small economies of the world are doing that as well. What is Australia doing? Australia is going around saying, 'We have to lead the way in cutting our protection, cutting our tariffs, not support our industries in any way through concessions in the tax system.' All these sorts of things lead to creating more unemployment. The other day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister a question which was not answered. The question was: how do we explain the fact that for the first time in modern Australian history we have had growth in the economy but increases in unemployment? You have to ask yourself why that is happening. It is happening because, in many situations, although we have had growth in certain sectors of the economy, in key areas where a lot of people are employed industries are closing down. They are going overseas; they are going to other parts of the world, especially Asia; they are importing the product back into Australia and workers are losing their jobs. That is the kind of the situation which, of course, can have this abnormal effect where the overall economy grows but where you have serious consequences for key areas of the economy-for example, the manufacturing industries-that employ a lot of people. It is a good thing that we had the decisions on the car industry and the TCF industries, we but that is not going to be enough. We cannot rely on the existing industries. We have to promote investment, especially in the new high technology industries. In that regard, we must do more through the taxation system. I conclude my comments on the bill by saying that we support most of the provisions of the bill that deal with the rorts. We support provisions of the bill that are trying to ensure that wealthy people pay their share in the economy. We support those provisions, but we say that a lot more needs to be done. We need a tax system which protects, boosts and supports the poorer section of our community. We also need a tax system that is going to support industries, especially manufacturing industries, so that we can support employment in our community and the development of our society.

199,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.50 p.m.)-in reply-I will quickly pick up and one or two comments made in the debate by the previous speaker, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I was a little amused at his comments about tariffs, considering the great fall in tariffs which occurred under his government. No doubt, he was a supporter of those cuts in tariffs on textiles and on the motor car industry. I see he is shaking his head. The debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) has been wide ranging, and the involvement by the member for Calwell was certainly very wide ranging. Other people involved in the debate have asked some fairly specific questions, particularly the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). There are some answers I can give the member for Curtin in a range of areas there. This is an omnibus tax bill and it contains a number of measures. The measures include: announcements in the 1996 budget relating to thin capitalisation measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore; an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) concerning eligible finance shares; the announcement in the 1997 budget to freeze the trustee rate. for friendly societies at 33 per cent from the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years; easing the compliance cost burden for employers regarding group certificates for employees ceasing employment; and amendments to give legislative force to administrative arrangements for electronic lodgement of tax returns. In regard to the thin capitalisation measures, they will improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules and counter-avoidance arrangements. For taxpayers who are not financial institutions, they reduce the allowable foreign debt to a foreign equity gearing ratio of three to one to two to one, and in relation to companies they broaden the definition of 'foreign debt' to generally treat certain guaranteed debt from unrelated overseas lenders as 'foreign debt for thin capitalisation purposes'. The ratio assists in ensuring that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia and in protecting Australia's revenue base. The measure was foreshadowed by the Labor government in February 1996 and was adopted formally by the coalition government in the 1996 budget. An exposure draft of the legislation was released for comment earlier this year. In regard to thin capitalisation, I know that the member for Curtin raised a number of issues. In particular, he referred to a submission from the Taxation Institute which raises several issues. In that regard, the Australian Taxation Office has recently received a similar submission from the Taxation Institute and a draft response has been prepared by the Australian Taxation Office, and I would just like to make a few comments in those areas which will also go to the Taxation Institute. In relation to proposed new subsections 159GZF(lA) and (lB), which deal with guarantee debts, you indicate that you consider there is a need to clarify the intended operations of these provisions. It is the intention of the Australian Taxation Office to revise the contents of income tax ruling IT 24/79, 'Application of thin capitalisation rules', and issue a new ruling in its place. It is intended that the issues surrounding the operation of the new guarantee debt provisions will be discussed in the new ruling. The comments that have been raised on new subsection 159GZG(4) highlight the concern that the capital component of trust equity contains an income test. The words 'if regard were had only to the use of the trust property in producing assessable income', in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph A of subsection 159GZG(4); do not act as an income test, as there is no requirement that there be a distribution of income to the foreign controller or its non-resident associates. Rather, the relevant property merely needs to produce assessable income of the foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller. This prevents the foreign controller from gearing off property that does not produce Australian assessable income, such as foreign assets. The operation of this new subsection was carefully considered whilst the amendments were being drafted, and it is not inconsistent with the existing provisions relating to the definition of 'foreign equity for trusts'. The operation of the provision only affects those cases where the related party's foreign borrowings exceed the prescribed ratio and foreigners control the trust property and have a fixed interest in the trust property but redirect the income to non-related foreign persons. The provision, whilst playing an important role, is not expected to have an adverse effect on legitimate tax structures. Your comments in relation to proposed new subsection 159GZG(4B), dealing with asset revaluation of reserves of partnerships and trusts, highlight your concern that the legislation will have a retrospective effect. You submit that asset revaluations of 1 July 1997 should be taken into account as a transitional provision in the 1997-98 year. Both the original announcement by the previous government and a subsequent announcement by the coalition government to amend the thin capitalisation rules clearly stated that asset revaluations by partnerships and trusts would be limited to the market value of the assets and that the revaluations would be required to take place before the income year commences. Taxpayers, therefore, have had in excess of 12 months to prepare for, and react to, the announced changes. The issue of timing was carefully considered by the government when preparing the amendments. Also raised were concerns in relation to the amendments that disallow a foreign gearing ratio for discretionary trusts. This results the fact that the foreign equity of a discretionIV ary trust cannot be measured in a meaningful way since entitlements depend on the exercise of the trustee's discretion. In particular, a foreign beneficiary of a discretionary trust does not have an interest in the corpus or income of the discretionary trust until the trustee makes a distribution of corpus or income to the beneficiary. It is accepted that some discretionary trusts that wish to obtain the benefits of deductions on interests paid to foreign controllers of their non-resident associates may need to convert to a fixed trust so that fixed interests can be measured. The submission indicates that such changes may involve legal costs and have stamp duty and CGT implications. The government was aware that there would be some associated compliance costs associated with the amend.ment but consider that the amendment was necessary to clarify the operation of the provision and to counter some avoidance arrangements. Comments in relation to the operation of a proposed new section 159GZUA highlight concern that the operation of this provision is inappropriate and contrary to the previous announcements made by the government. The government recognises that this measure may adversely affect taxpayers with existing structures in place that intend to comply with the lower debt equity ratio announced in the 1996 budget. Accordingly, the government has removed an amendment to the rules as they relate to foreign investors of Australian partnerships and trusts. Section 159GZUA was withdrawn as a part of these amendments. Lastly in this area, your comments in relation to the repeal of sections 159GZO and 159GZP, and the proposal to instead rely on the general anti-avoidance provisions contained in part IV A, indicate that you do not disagree with that approach. You also indicated that you perceive a need for the Australian Taxation Office to clarify, by way of a public ruling, the way in which it would regard part IV A as having application to back-to-back arrangements. It is intended that a public ruling be issued that will deal with the types from of back-to-back arrangements to which part A would be applied. I hope that gives the member for Curtin some of the information he has been seeking. I have just a few further comments. In regard to the measure to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore and charitable trusts and removal of tax exemption for certain overseas organisations, this measure was foreshadowed by the previous government during February 1996 and formally adopted by the coalition in the 1996 budget with some modification. The measure addresses avoidance arrangements which take advantage of the tax exempt status of charitable trusts and closes off the possibility of certain organisations which also currently enjoy an income tax exemption from being used for tax avoidance purposes. An exposure draft of the legislation was released on 20 February 1997 seeking submissions from interested parties on the proposed measures. Following those representations, modifications were made to the draft legislation concerning the exposure draft requirement that an organisation must be located in Australia and undertaking its work solely in Australia. The bill relaxes the solely in Australia test so that organisations in paragraphs 21, 23E, EA, F, G and J(3), need only pursue their objectives principally in Australia. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) raised one or two points in his contribution to the debate on this matter, and I would like to address them for him. He expressed concern about the effect of removing the tax exempt status of commercial educationally based bodies that do not incur their expenditure and pursue their objectives principally in Australia. The proposed changes will not affect the tax exempt status of educational institutions that have tax deductibility status under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act such as public universities and approved TAFE institutions within the meaning of the Employment, Education and Training Act. This will be the case whether or not these institutions pursue their objectives principally in or out of Australia, and whether those objectives incur commercial activities. The extent of commercial activity undertaken by tax exempt entities outlined raises a much broader issue of whether such organisations qualify for tax exempt status under the existing law. When the tax exemption for these organisations was first provided it was never contemplated that significant business and commercial operations would be undertaken by these bodies. In view of the recent developments in case law and the increased commercial activity of some entities in recent times they might like to consider approaching the Australian Taxation Office to confirm the taxation status of the organisations outlined their letter that came to the Treasurer in that regard. In regard to financial shares, the amendments I will move later will ensure that dividends paid on eligible finance shares, EFS, and widely distributed finance shares, WDFS, are subject to tax by denying them non-portfolio status and a credit for foreign tax paid by non-residents. The amendment will stop tax avoidance schemes which are associated with EFS and WDFS. It was never intended that non-portfolio dividend status would extend to dividends paid on EFS and WDFS. In regard to the rate of tax for friendly societies, the amendments implement the 1997-98 budget announcement that the rate of tax imposed on the life insurance businesses of friendly societies is retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years during the duration of the review of the taxation treatment of life insurance that was initiated in the 1995-95 budget but not completed by the former government prior to the election. The bill removes the requirement imposed on employers to issue a group certificate within seven days of an employer terminating employment to reduce compliance costs unless the employer requests a group certificate. Finally in regard to electronic lodgement and electronic funds transfer, the electronic lodgement of tax returns was introduced in 1990. The service was administered by contracts with participating tax agents. The Australian National Audit Office and the JCPA criticised this practice, and recommended that electronic lodgement be incorporated into tax legislation.The bill amends the income tax laws and fringe benefits tax law to provide for electronic lodgement of returns, applications for amendment and other notices and to allow the commissioner to pay by electronic transfer any refunds to any account nominated by the taxpayer. The member for Curtin did raise some questions about consultation. There was widespread consultation and there was even in consultation which went as far as Western Australia in regard to this matter. It was also raised at the Australian Tax Office electronics commerce forum. So there has been consultation in regard to that. In conclusion on electronic lodgement, I would make these comments. In developing the bill the Australian Tax Office did widely consult with practitioners to develop a system to protect taxpayers and minimise compliance costs. In particular, the Australian Taxation Office met with agents and accountants in Western Australia-who often feel, I think, ignored in a consultative process. So we did go out of our way as a government to consult in Western Australia. The concerns raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants have been put to the Australian Taxation Office. Unfortunately, much of the ICA's concern relates to the inability of one of its advisers to understand some of the provisions in the bill and the requirements in the current law. Two weeks after the introduction of the bill, the Australian Taxation Office met with the taxation director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Following these discussions and meetings with the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the National Institute of Accountants, the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Income Tax Professionals, the government has decided to make amendments to the bill and to make the electronic lodgement of returns better fit the business practices of tax agents. With regard to comments by the member for Curtin that taxpayers are required to keep a copy of returns, that is not correct. There is no requirement in the current law and in the bill for tax agents to keep a copy of the return. Taxpayers will be required to keep a copy of the taxpayer's declaration. This will assist them to prove that they did not make statements in the electronic return transmitted by the tax agent where an error is found. Tax agents will not be required to keep a copy of the declaration. This is one of the changes in the amendments to the bill that come out of consultations with the professional bodies. I thank the members who have participated in the debate. I commend this bill to the House and I will be moving some 37 amendments shortly. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",111

I make the following comments about each of the amendments that are proposed. On thin capitalisation, the amendments go through from (1) through to (9). Amendments (1) and or a (2): a schedule of the bill introduced amendments to the thin capitalisation rules contained in division 16F of part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to improve the effectiveness of those rules. The amendments included the denial of all interest deductions on related party borrowings by foreign controllers of Australian partnerships and trusts. However, some concern has been expressed that the proposed denial of all interest deductions on related party foreign debt by foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australpartnerships and trusts is inequitable and inconsistent with the thin capitalisation regime policy. In response to those concerns, the government has decided to withdraw the provision from the bill that denies all interest deductions on related party foreign debt that is incurred by foreign controllers to invest in an Australian partnership or trust and subject them instead to the new general foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio of 2: 1 proposed by other amendments contained in schedule 1. This will provide foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australian partnerships and trusts some scope for borrowing from related parties to invest in the partnership or trust. The underlying Australian partnership or trust would remain required to comply with the foreign debt to ratio equity. Amendment (3) amends the definition of or a foreign investor so that foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees are no longer excluded from the thin capitalisation rules and will now be permitted to obtain deductions for interest paid on borrowings from related parties up to the 2: 1 gearing ratio. Amendments (4), (S) and (6) amend the provisions dealing with the measurement of the foreign equity in relation to partnership and trusts to remove an element of ambiguity from the amended provisions and to ensure the provisions operate as intended. Amendment (7) will clarify that the equity that a foreign beneficiary has in a discretionary trust will be limited to their fixed interests in the trust, thus denying such beneficiaries a gearing ratio to the extent their foreign equity cannot be measured because of the existence of the trustees' discretion. Amendment (8) is a technical correction that will ensure that all of the thin capitalisation provisions reflect the change in the foreign gearing ratio from 3: 1 to 2: 1 contained in schedule 1. Amendment (9) deletes the provisions contained in schedule 1 which disallow all interest deductions on foreign related party debt incurred by foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees. The amendments apply from the 1997-98 income year. I now move to two amendments to the proposed group certificate provisions affecting terminating employees and one amendment to the provision for group certificates issued in consequence of an eligible termination payment. These are amendments (10) to (12). The bill reduces the current obligation contained in the tax law for employers to issue group certificates to all employees who terminate their employment during an income year. It proposes that the obligation exist only for those employees who request a group certificate during an income year. Employers have seven days in which to issue a group certificate when an employee makes a request. Changed arrangements in relation to the sending of blank group certificates by the ATO to employers may have made the sevenday period difficult for employers to meet in certain circumstances. Blank group certificates are now sent to employers late in a financial year rather than at the beginning. Amendments (10) and (11) replace '7th' in proposed new paragraphs 221F(SCA)(d) and 221F(SCA)(e) with '14th'. The change will provide employers with sufficient time to meet their obligation under the law. Amendment (12) makes a similar change to existing subsection 221F(SH) that relates to group certificates in respect of eligible termination payments. The amendments will apply from the twenty-eighth day after the bill receives royal assent. Measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore relate to amendments (13) to (1S). Since the bill was introduced, there have been a number of representations concerning the requirement for charitable trusts to change their trust deeds before July 1998 to prohibit distributions overseas if they are to retain their income tax exemption. The concern is that this requirement may be onerous, especially where a will creating a testamentary charitable trust cannot be amended because the living testator is no longer capable of conducting his or her own affairs. In response to those concerns, the government has decided to amend the provisions to remove this requirement. (Extension of time granted) The amendments will also make it clear that charitable trusts which have gift deductibility status and are permitted to distribute funds offshore-for example, overseas aid funds-will remain eligible for the income tax exemption. Electronic lodgement of tax returns is covered in amendments (16) to (37). Following consultation with tax agent representatives, the government has decided to make amendments to the bill to the reduce the costs that would otherwise be imposed on the tax agent. The provisions as currently drafted impose an obligation on a tax agent to keep a copy of the taxpayer declaration authorising the transmission of the return. Tax agents are also required to give a copy of the transmitted return to the taxpayer. The amendments will remove these obligations. They will also enable a tax agent who does not have electronic facilities to furnish a return by electronic transmission through the services of another person who has the facilities. I commend the amendments to the House.",115
201,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As we are becoming increasingly used to, the government has circulated a large number of amendments to this bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4). There are 37 separate amendments being moved, indicative of the fact that the government just cannot get its legislation right. Almost every bill in this portfolio which comes before this chamber has to be extensively amended by this government. This shows a complete inability to properly consult and to properly think through issues and potential impacts. The amendments cover four separate areas: the thin capitalisation provisions, the group certificate provisions, the exempt entities provisions and the electronic transaction regime for the tax office. On the first group of amendments, the thin capitalisation provisions, this is a same-day backdown. The bill as introduced amended the thin capitalisation provisions to completely deny discretionary trusts a gearing ratio, the extent that their foreign equity cannot be effectively measured because of the existence of the trustee's discretion. This seemed a reasonable approach to the opposition. By treating discretionary trusts in the original manner-that is, in accordance with trust law-the flexibility and distribution which are afforded by the trust are offset somewhat by the fact that the thin capitalisation rules were much more severe-that is, the government had apparently decided that there can be both tax benefits and tax costs to using trusts. However, the government has now decided to amend its own law, which will actually facilitate the use of trusts-this being done within two weeks of the Commissioner of Taxation bringing to public notice the potential tax avoidance consequences. So, no sooner had we praised this government this afternoon than it backed off. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to explain why this decision has been made and where the public benefit is in loosening the rules to allow foreign investors to pay less Australian tax than they otherwise would. We want to know why the change is being made, who lobbied the government to make this change and how much the change will cost in tax not collected. On the same day, we hear reports of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assuring his backbench that preferential tax treatment will be retained for trusts. The position of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has become increasingly untenable. The Commissioner of Taxation, who is in a unique position to know what is happening in the tax system, has clearly indicated his preference for a change in the law to eliminate some aspects of inequity in the tax system. It was reported today, by George Megalogenis in the Australian, that Mr Carmody's tax speech is believed to have been authorised by the Treasurer's office. There is a review of the taxation of trusts announced in the budget, currently examining the issues raised by Mr Carmody. The Prime Minister has now improperly pre-empted that review by ruling out any meaningful reform. Why does he want to to do this? Who is he trying to protect? What are the public servants who are conducting the review of the taxation of trusts supposed to do now? They are going to read these press reports and it will be difficult for them not to be influenced by them. Where is the Treasurer on this issue? It is his processes which are being overridden, and responsibility for this issue lies with his portfolio. It would seem that the real agenda of the government is to pretend to improve the equity of the system but to protect privilege, rule out meaningful reform and then throw up their hands and say, 'It is all too hard. We have to have a GST.' We, on this side of the House, ask: how can the Prime Minister tax food, clothing and the basic necessities of Australian families yet rule out fair changes to business taxation because they might offend some powerful interests? We are interested in pursuing this issue between now and the time when the legislation is debated in the Senate to get proper answers to these questions. The secpnd group of amendments, amendments (10) to (12), relate to the group certificate provisions and propose to vary those new group certificate provisions. Basically, the maximum time for an employer to be able to provide a group certificate to an employee who leaves employment during a financial year is to be increased from one week to two weeks. Briefing of opposition staff by the tax office has indicated that these amendments are necessary to allow time for the employer to obtain blank group certificates from the tax office. We accept this explanation at face value and have no objection to the proposal at this time. If any representations are made to us about this modified proposal, we will raise those in the Senate. The third group of amendments relates to the changes to the anti-avoidance provisions of tax exempt entities. Amendments (13) to (15) attempt to deal with an issue I raised in the second reading debate, namely, the impact of the bill on wills and other trusts which may tion. have power to distribute moneys offshore. The bill, as it stands, currently requires that the trust deed must prohibit distribution overseas in order to retain its tax exemption, unless the trust was established by will prior to the 1996-97 budget announcement. (Extension of time granted) This requirement in the bill would, in many cases, have necessitated trustees of charitable trusts to amend their trust deeds if the deeds permitted overseas distribution. However, the government has realised that there would have been significant difficulties in actually amending the trust deeds, for example, where the testator is no longer capable of conducting his or her affairs and where no valid power of attorney has been executed. On first blush, these amendments will overcome what is a valid concern. However, we have to be convinced that this represents a completely adequate solution. I guess the question here is: could these amendments be rorted? We will not be voting against the measure. We will be looking closely at the implications of these amendments prior to the bill's consideration in the Senate. Finally, amendments (16) to (37) deal with some technical amendments to the legislative regime covering electronic lodgement and the payment of moneys electronically. The amendments seem reasonable to the opposition and we will not be opposing them. The first amendment allows agents to lodge electronically through a third party. This is a sensible amendment which will allow greater flexibility for tax agents and hence for those taxpayers who use tax agents. The second amendment discontinues the obligation on the tax agent to keep a copy ·of the declaration relating to an electronically lodged return. Instead, it continues the obligation on the taxpayer but allows the tax agent to hold the declaration on behalf of the taxpayer. This is a sensible amendment which is supported by the opposition. The other three amendments lessen the otherwise overly onerous record keeping and other documentary requirements which are being placed on tax agents. These are all non-contentious and are supported by the opposi",118
202,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The amendments to schedule 1 proposed by the government attract my attention. But before I comment I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) for the answers he has been able to provide to matters of concern that I raised on behalf of myself and others during the second reading debate. Whilst I did listen carefully to his second reading summing up, I will not have picked up all the detail. I will not have absorbed it all and probably something I say in these remarks will have been answered. That is just a demonstration both of the complexity of the legislation in total and of the lateness of the notice and details of the amendments which we are now discussing. Subsection 159GZG(4B) has been widely criticised because of its retrospective effect on the thin capitalisation provisions. There does not appear to be anything in the government's amendments which reverses the impact of clause 13 of schedule 1. If I am right in that assumption, those businesses which finalised their accounts for the 1996-97 year prior to the announcement of the government's intention to alter the thin capitalisation ruling will be penalised unfairly, in my view. Although the government has conceded some changes to subsections 159GZG(3) and (4), there has been no decision that I could pick up in what has been said this evening to put in place a transitional measure. In fact, I think the parliamentary secretary specifically excluded that possibility on the grounds that the parties had adequate notice. I am not sure if that is an accurate appreciation of the situation, but I will have to leave it at that. The Tax Institute of Australia called for a review of the calculation that it would see that part dealing with the proportion of the capital superimposed with an income test. I understood the parliamentary secretary to say that the income test does not come into play. I think I have it in its right section; if so, all well and good. Despite the fact that it would almost certainly cause a disparity if it has not been attended to in the treatment of trusts on the one hand and partnerships on the other, it may well be that the government does intend to push ahead with what I believe to be a flawed amendment. The TIA has made it very clear that they hold deep reservations about other ambiguities that pervade this bill, and not all of those have been addressed by the parliamentary secretary. I made reference to a couple of examples in schedule 1, specifically to the loose wording of subsections 159GZF(lA) and (lB). However, the definition of the word 'guaranteed' as it appears in subsection 159GZF(lA) has not received attention in the government's supplementary amendment. Nor has the government, as far as I am able to gather through listening to what has gone on tonight, chosen to provide a clarification as to how the Commissioner of Taxation will determine whether thin capitalisation provisions will be extended to those resident companies which borrow amounts from a prudent arm's length lender subject to certain constraints. As I indicated, the TIA and others believe that the clear implication in the bill is that an amount can be excluded if: ... a prudent ann's length lender would have lent the amount regardless of whether or not the prudent arm's length lender would have required a tee or security. That is in marked contrast to the information provided in the initial explanatory dum and, as far as I can determine, this ambiguity has not been dealt with properly in the supplementary memorandum. The final point I want to make in relation to the amendments to schedule 1 is in reference to the repeal of sections 159GZO and 159GZP.

In that reference I cited 52 nights in relation to the spouse entitlement which had been refunded even though the minister was perfectly entitled, under the regulations, to have that additional payment. The reference to the 52 nights was based on written advice I had been given by the Department of Administrative Services. That department has now informed me that it made a mistake in the advice it gave me and that the number of nights was not 52 but 111, although they say that that has made no difference to the amount of money that was refunded and it has made no difference to the merits of the issue.

206,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As I was saying, the Taxation Institute of Australia called on the ATO to explain how part 4A of the Income Tax Act will apply to thin capitalisation. There is no reference to either section in the government's amendments that I can discover. As I understand it, the ATO has not obliged the tax community with any further information on that particular point. The government has been make aware by the TIA of the potential for anomalies in the strict application of back-to-back rules, but apparently-again I qualify it to the extent of what I am able to pick up out of tonight's proceedings-it has decided to ignore that warning when drafting amendments. I want to go on now to schedule 5. As with schedules 1 and 7, the concerns expressed by independent analysts about schedule 5 in the bill stem from a lack of specifics in the wording of the schedule. On 20 August 1996 the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made it clear that the coalition meant to follow the lead of the former Labor government and introduce changes to legislation affecting tax exempt organisations distributing funds offshore. The fact that two successive parliamentary reports into tax exempt entities revealed exploitation of the charitable trust exemption suggests that change has to occur, and that is not argued against. However, I am not convinced that this amendment is as well drafted as it ought to be. For example, the Treasurer's media release of 20 August 1996 made repeated references to the fact that bona fide or genuine charities would not be affected by the proposed legislation. Certainly, if the powers to prescribe exemption status are applied in a way that allows bona fide organisations to qualify, this will be the outcome. But, as the Taxation Institute of Australia pointed out: The material in the earlier exposure draft indicates that these powers would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, there is a need for clarification of an intention to use the power to prescribe in an appropriate fashion on a general basis to exclude bona fide organisations and not only in exceptional circumstances. Section 23(j)(ii) removes the exemption provided for funds that have been established by will or by instrument of trust for public charitable purposes that are located offshore. Interestingly, this provision requires that a fund must pursue its charitable purposes solely in Australia, while every other provision of the schedule utilises the words 'principally in Australia'. The tax institute also believed that the term 'distribution overseas', as it appears in section 23(j)(ii) of the schedule, is not clear in its meaning. These may be only minor points but they are a further demonstration of a seeming lack of consistency and accuracy in the drafting. The institute pointed out that subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D) of section 23(j)(ii) appear as if they are alternatives because of the use of the word 'or' at the end of each explanation. Consequently, a charitable trust may find that it no longer qualifies for exemption if it is used for more than one purpose, despite the fact that each purpose in isolation would allow it to qualify. The institute seems on good ground to assert that there does not appear to be any sound policy reason for such a restriction. If in fact a charitable trust can be used for more than one purpose and still qualify for exemption, this needs to be clarified by the government. Either way, the authors of the bill are guilty of poorly worded legislation. The Treasurer's media release on budget night 1996 stated that the measure to remove the tax exempt status for certain organisations located offshore would 'not impact on any entity which is a resident for Australian tax purposes'. But the Taxation Institute of Australia pointed out that the measures as presented to the House do not contain that exclusion. It is suggested that any exclusion should be included where appropriate in the legislation where the taxpayer is a resident in Australia. (Extension of time granted) The final observation I want to make about schedule 5 relates to information contained in the compliance cost impact statement. The explanatory memorandum tells us: The measures are being enacted primarily to prevent tax avoidance. However, the requirements are consistent with the existing accounting and standards of other areas of taxation. That begs the question, so what? Whereas the other compliance cost impact statement in the bill gives some insight into the associated cost to business of the proposed changes, this tells us absolutely nothing about the costs tax exempt entities can expect to incur. That omission undermines the whole intent behind including such impact statements in legislation, and it should be totally unacceptable. The amendments to schedule 5-the amendments to the amendments, that is-appear to be restricted to removing the requirement that a trust deed of a charitable trust must prohibit distribution overseas after 1 July 1998 in order for it to retain its income tax exemption. That is a welcome amendment. However, the bulk of the concerns raised by some of those who have communicated with me in regard to the original bill have not been dealt with by these amendments. The Taxation Institute of Australia observed that the wording of the original bill requires that a fund must pursue its charitable purposes solely in Australia, whereas the term 'principally in Australia' is used in every other provision in the schedule. The government's amendments do nothing to explain this or to correct it, if indeed it is the anomaly it appears to be. Further, the supplementary memorandum fails to clarify the term 'distribution overseas' as it appears in section 23(j)(ii) of schedule 5, despite the fact that organisations like the TIA have criticised the lack of specifics. Nor do amendments alter the wording of section 23(j)(ii) subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D), as I think I have already noted. I also noticed earlier in this debate that those subparagraphs are written as if they are alternatives, because the word 'or' is used at the end of each explanation. The impact of this could be quite devastating for charitable trusts because, while each of these subparagraphs may in isolation extend tax exempt status to an organisation, a charitable trust may discover that it is no longer exempt if it is used for multiple purposes. The government is well aware of this, I think, but I do not see anything in what it proposes that will do practices anything about it. Another important omission is the absence of an amendment relating to the issue of the impact of the bill on entities which are residents for tax purposes. On budget night 1996 the Treasurer was quite specific that such organisations would not be affected by its decision to remove tax exempt status for certain entities located offshore. However, neither the original government bill nor the amendments now before the House include any such assurance or exclusion. I want to tum now, briefly, to schedule 7. The amendment to remove the requirement for tax agents to keep a copy of the declaration over a five-year period and to provide the taxpayer with a copy of their return or application for amendment-that is, furnished electronically-is a good one. Had this amendment not been made, this provision would have resulted in a massive increase in administrative work load for all accountants practising in the field. The new proposal should have a more favourable impact on tax agents in time saved and reduced compliance costs. The Institute of Chartered Accountants was concerned about whether the proposed penalty provisions against tax agents who did not conform to this requirement were consistent with the current code of practice of tax agents. I think I am reassured by what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) had to say on that, but, given the government's decision to remove these obligations' it does now appear that that expressed concern is no longer a valid one. The ICA also registered its concerns about the lack of information relating to the electronic transfer of funds to third parties in the original amendment. (Extension of time granted) There is nothing in the supplementary explanatory memorandum to clarify whether the ATO will require that a transaction of this kind be made only into a trust account operated by tax agents. Another point I wish to raise about schedule 7 is the fact that the government has neglected, it seems, to provide any certainty about the use of electronic signatures in its amendments. Despite the fact that several tax organisations requested that the coalition issue further information as to what kind of electronic signatures the ATO will rely on under the new system and what certification arrangements it proposes, there is nothing mentioned in the government's amendments about either. The coalition is tightening up procedure for the transmission of returns without a tax agent's signature, but this, I suggest, is a separate issue from the one involving the authorisation of a statement by a taxpayer. There is still nothing in the legislation-as it will be-that suggests what a taxpayer might do to show that a statement was not authorised by him or her. That, surely, is not acceptable.",121
207,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (6.42 p.m.)-I have a couple of very quick comments. One is that the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) made some requests. I found it a little unusual that the member should say that the government was only interested in the rich end of town when he was one of the people who did not support the super guarantee levy, which was about getting the wealthier people in our community to contribute more to tax funds. I think it does Tuckey. show up a difference in approach by the government in talking about sectional interests within the community. The government has a view that we make decisions. We listen, we consult, and in this particular area of taxation we have consulted quite extensively and quite widely and we believe we have acted in the common good for all Australians. In regard to some of the comments which have just been raised by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I would-particularly in regard to the thin capitalisation comments he made-refer him back to the comments which I made earlier in summing up, because I do not think he did fully understand. I can appreciate that. Anybody who has been listening to this debate or trying to follow it will realise that it is a very complex area of legislation. I do refer him to what I have already said in regard to thin capitalisation. In regard to some of the other areas which are pertinent to the debate, I will seek advice from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and get in touch with the member for Curtin.",123

210,Ms MACKLIN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I move the following second reading amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for the closure of Medicare offices, the threat of further closures as a result of this bill, and reducing access to Medibank Private retail outlets; (2) is appalled that the Government is risking higher premiums for Medibank Private members due to separation costs and loss of economies of scale and higher fees for other private health funds if the competitive force exerted to date by Medibank Private is weakened; (3) calls on the Government to fully protect the job security of all staff at the Health Insurance Commission including those at Medibank Private; (4) deplores the additional cost to taxpayers caused by the separation, including: (a) replicating computer and information systems; (b) a massive upheaval in branch office networks for both Medicare and Medibank Private offices; and (c) staff transfer and re-Iocation costs; and (5) deplores the Government's total mismanagement of private health insurance which has seen $1.7 billion of taxpayers money swallowed up by massive premium rises approved by the Health Minister and the Prime Minister"". The Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Billseeks to make two major changes: the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and the widening of the role of the Health Insurance Commission. The Labor Party does not support the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. However, I would like to put on record that the opposition does recognise the excellent work done by the Health Insurance Commission and its leading role in data and claims processing and is not opposed in principle to changes which would enhance this role, provided that they do not in any way threaten existing Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits scheme roles. The opposition opposes the separation of Medibank Private for a number of reasons. The first is that we fear this is the first step in privati sing the fund. The government has put a number of provisions in this bill to prevent full privatisation without new legislation. That is good in theory, but in practice the fund has to be separated before it can be sold off. So this separation is a necessary first step. Also, the government has reversed its earlier decision to close a loophole which would allow the effective privatisation of the fund without any new legislation. In the Senate committee hearing on this bill, the chairperson, Senator Knowles, informed the committee: . . . the bill is being delayed by one week in the House of Representatives to enable further consideration on tightening the provisions which would prevent any possible future privatisation of Medibank Private without necessary parliamentary approval. She went on to ask a question of one of the witnesses: I am interested to know . . . which party or parties you see would be the advocates of privatisation, given that it is the coalition that is actually amending the legislation that way. However, the government is no longer proposing any such amendment. Given that Senator Knowles was so convinced that the amendment indicated the coalition's commitment not to privatise, one must now wonder about the significance of the decision to abandon that amendment. Perhaps the biggest reason for our concern about the eventual privatisation is the lack of any good reason for these changes. It is clear who is driving health policy in this matter. It is the same group who is driving so much of the rest of this government's health policythe private health funds. The private health funds want to see Medibank Private privatised. The Australian Health Insurance Association's submission to the Industry Commission inquiry said: The Commonwealth has no more role in operating a private health insurance organisation than in running an airline. The Industry Commission report also indicated the views of one National Mutual Health Insurance. It said that they 'considered that Medibank Private should be de-linked from Medicare and privatised'. Australian Unity 'considered that Medibank Private could first be corporatised and then ultimately privatised'. So the cat is out of the bag. The second reading speech begins with the statement that the purpose of the separation to 'ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds'. This extraordinary statement says a great deal about this government and its health policy. It says a great deal about the extent to which it has been completely captured by the private health funds. It is a very sad state of affairs when the nation's chief health policy maker starts openly making policy at the bidding of the health funds on the basis of their perceptions-perceptions, I might add, that have been repeatedly refuted before the parliament. Previous consideration of cost apportionment between the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1992, for example, found 'no evidence that crosssubsidisation occurs between Medibank Private and Medicare'. On top of this, the current cost apportionment principles were determined in consultation with the Treasury and have been considered acceptable by the Commonwealth Attorney-General. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) it was admitted that he is ing the self-interested advice of the health funds over that of the Treasury. This is the same minister who gave the health funds $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money, ripped out of the public health system in the most catastrophic health policy for decades. This massive diversion of public health money to the funds has been criticised by a very broad range of groups: the Australian Medical Association, the Industry Commission and even the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Kennett, who described it as 'money down the drain'. This minister is not the minister for health but the minister for health funds. Just like the failed $1.7 billion of so-called incentives, the separation of Medibank Private may serve the interests of the health funds, but it will do very little good for anybody else. The Industry Commission report into private health insurance found that Medibank Private generally had lower than average premiums. This highlights one of the most is important reasons for maintaining the current arrangements. If Medibank Private is able to offer lower premiums than other funds, this is of direct benefit to Medibank Private members. It also places pressure on the other funds to keep their fees down. It is not surprising that the other funds want to nobble Medibank Private. I hate to think that we would see the possibility of yet another round of premium increases, but it is extraordinary that they are able to force the government to cave into their special pleading. As was the case with the government's privatisation of Australian Hearing Services, this government's version of competition seems to involve sabotaging public providers for being too cheap and too efficient to make it easier for the private sector to compete with them-an extraordinary view of efficiency. The government has already made it clear that it intends to dismantle the network of Medicare offices around Australia. The closure of 44 offices has already begun, and the number would have been double had it not been for massive public pressure. One of those offices is in my electorate in Heidelberg, and the consequences of the closure of favour- this office are very significant. In the first instance, it will affect the local traders in the shopping mall in which this office is located. The traders in the mall are already suffering significant hardship as a result of declining retail turnover. They have indicated that the closure of the Medicare office will have a detrimental impact on their businesses, as the Medicare office draws people to the centre. Many local residents will also be severely disadvantaged, particularly our older residents. The minister has suggested that they mail their claims or use the nearest Medicare office, but many of them cannot afford to wait for reimbursement by mail, and attending another office will be very difficult for those who are old or frail. I have received many telephone calls and letters about this closure. I have also received a petition signed by 2,000 residents of Heidelberg protesting against the closure of this office. I have written to the minister for health asking that he reconsider the closure of this office, and I very much look forward to a favourable response on behalf of the residents of Heidelberg. Given that the government's intentions are so clear, we are extremely concerned about the forced separation of Medicare and Medibank Private offices. There will obviously be significant costs for both organisations in reorganising their branch network, and a Senate committee was told that Medibank Private will establish only 70 branches instead of the current 270. Once again, the government is penalising Medibank Private members to please the other funds. The separation will also force another reorganisation of the beleaguered Medicare office network, as many offices will be forced to relocate to smaller areas or pay higher rents. It is another example of the familiar pattern that sees Medicare customers penalised to please the funds. Another concern the opposition has with this bill is the long-term impact upon staff. The bill provides for staff transferred from Health Insurance Commission to the nominated company which will run Medibank Private to retain their terms and conditions of employment and other rights and entitlements. These are defined in the bill. Staff will also be allowed to transfer back to the Health Insurance Commission during the first year of the new company's operations. However, the bill also gives the minister power to transfer staff from the Health Insurance Commission to the new company against their wishes and to retransfer them back to the Health Insurance Commission against their wishes. We are particularly concerned that the bill seeks to limit staff mobility rights to 12 months. In recent similar situations, including the ACT Public Service, the Civil Aviation Authority and Australian Defence Industries, staff moving to the new body have been able to retain their ability to move back to their original employer for three years if they were to be terminated by the new employer. The government's attempts to undermine the conditions and job security of over 1,000 Health Insurance Commission staff who will move to the new Medibank Private if this bill passes is not acceptable and would seta very unfortunate precedent. The opposition will also be seeking to ensure that the current Health Insurance Commission staff get the right to apply for jobs within the Australian Public Service and will retain those rights. The opposition will steadfastly resist attempts by this government to undermine the rights of public sector workers through this sort of staff shuffling trick. The job security of staff employed by both the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private will be undermined by these changes. We have already seen numerous examples of staff rationalisation or sackings in other public sector organisations by this government prior to privatisation, and one can understand the anxiety now being felt by staff at Medibank Private who fear for the security of their jobs in the longer term. Their concerns are no doubt heightened by the general environment in which these changes are being introduced, with public sector jobs the being contracted out all over the country. The hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the area of public sector jobs is absolutely astounding. On Monday in question time he said: . . . no policy objective of the government assumes greater importance than that of job security. Yet in a mere 18 months his government has destroyed 62,000 public sector jobs. Is it any wonder that we have grave concerns for the future of the staff of the Health Insurance Commission? The explanatory memorandum to the bill claims that the separation will be at no cost to the taxpayer. It seems perfectly clear to us on this - side of the House that there will at least be significant transitional costs and that these costs will be borne by the taxpayer to please the health funds. Information provided to the Senate committee confirmed that there will be significant costs for fit-out alone. The answer provided by the department estimated the fit-out costs for a new Medibank Private office will be $80,000. Even if Medibank Private drastically reduced the number of offices to 70, this will still be a cost of around $5 million. In the face of this evidence from the department, are we still asked to believe that there will be no costs associated with removing and relocating 270 Medibank Private offices and leaving Medicare offices in locations which are too large? Are we to believe that separating and in some cases duplicating the computer networks will not cost anything at all? Are we to believe that there will be no cost to moving and possibly re-moving thousands of staff? Or is it perhaps that the government is not prepared to be open about how much the taxpayer will be forced to pay to satisfy the whims of the private health insurance funds, or will the extra costs be offset by savings elsewhere-as yet undisclosed-closing maybe another 40 Medicare offices as planned last year? I would appreciate it if the minister, in any future contribution that he might make to this debate, could itemise the cost of these and other elements of the transfer-both the transitional and long-term costs-and inform the House and the public whether the explanatory memorandum is wrong about a nil financial impact or whether there are other offsetting savings which have not been made public. In conclusion, there is a long line of losers and very few winners from this legislation, which makes it very hard for us to understand why it is being enacted, other than for the reasons we have outlined-that the private health insurance funds do not like Medibank Private being where it is. The losers are the staff at the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private, who will be subjected to considerable upheaval and uncertainty. A question mark remains over the long-term security of their jobs. Medibank Private members will have fewer retail outlets and may face higher fees if the economies of scale that now apply are lost through separation from the Health Insurance Commission and declining membership resulting from contracting outlets. Other private health fund members may suffer rising charges if the competitive force exerted to date by Medibank Private is weakened. Taxpayers will be required to contribute to the costs of replicating computer and information systems, re-arranging branch networks and managing the transfer of more than 1,000 staff. Taxpayers will also be the losers if Medibank Private is eventually privatised. And the only reason the government can offer in the face of all these disadvantages is that they wish to address Medibank Private's 'perceived' advantage over other private health funds. There is no evidence of actual advantage; it is 'perceived' advantage over the private health funds. It is an unfortunate thing that it seems to be the case that the health minister is nothing more than a puppet of the private health funds and that his complete policy failure on private health insurance and on the funding of public hospitals is hurting all Australians. We will be moving substantive amendments in the Senate. In the meantime I commend the second reading amendment to the - House.",123

213,Dr NELSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"It gives me great pleasure to speak to this Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill 1997and even more pleasure to speak against the amendment that has just been moved. In speaking to the bill I wish to address the issue specifically of the separation of Medibank Private from the Medicare offices in the Health Insurance Commission but I also intend to make some comments about the recent concern in the community about increases in private health insurance premiums. I spoke earlier today about the things I do not like about politics. I suppose I can put up with cheats, liars and people who are deceitful-that is part of our day-today work in this business-but the one thing that I have great difficulty with is hypocrisy, and I have just heard another illustration of it. In 1991 when the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was running what was euphemistically known as the 'national health strategy' I attended one meeting at which she said-I am sure she will correct me if I am wrong-that the role that she envisaged for private health insurance was to simply provide a private room for somebody if that is the kind of thing they thought they might need. Now we have the member for Jagajaga railing against the idea that we might separate Medibank - rivate, which covers 26 per cent of the health insurance market, from the Health Insurance Commission. Her new-found concern for the survival and viability of insurance companies is something that I admire. I realise that members on the other side of us reminding them of it, but what of the Commonwealth Bank? One thing about the member for Jagajaga and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) is that at least they are consistent. They are not individuals who would have been enamoured of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. At least they are very consistent on these sorts of things, but there seems to be inconsistency creeping in here. The member for Jagajaga is obviously having a very tiring time over there because there are not many carrying the intellectual load; mind you, there is not a lot to carry there. To say that Medibank Private derives a perceived advantage from being collocated with Medicare offices and then go on and argue that there are going to be huge increases in costs, technology, relocation and staffall of these things which are not true-you are saying that there is an advantage that is being given to Medibank Private at the moment. I remind the members on the other side that when they were in government and it was put to them repeatedly by sensible individuals in the community that there was a problem with Medibank Private being collocated with Medicare offices, they repeatedly said that there was no economic or other advantage being bestowed upon Medibank Private with its collocation. In fact, therb_ is not, and we are about to find out when this bill is finally passed, notwithstanding amendments that may be made. The other thing that I would like to point out in the amendment that has been put up to this bill is that the opposition is condemning the government for the closure of Medicare offices. Again, you have to ask yourself: where do we draw the line? The opposition is refusing to allow us to focus on those reforms which are necessary to lift this country's productivity by arguing against taxation reform, against necessary reforms in the labour market, against reforms in government regulation and in turning the government's finances into a surplus, as we had up until the pre-Whitlam era. They rail against that and now they are saying, 'You can't close tire Medicare offices.' The closure of Medicare offices has absolutely nothing to do with this issue. We are closing 43 offices in city areas across Australia where they are relatively close to other Medicare offices, where patients will continue to have access to mailing claims, where we are soon to introduce electronic processing from doctors' surgeries and where people can travel a reasonable distance to another Medicare office. The member for Jagajaga has had 2,000 signatures opposing the closure of a Medicare office in Heidelberg. I have had 9,000 signatures about the closure of a Medicare office in St Ives in my electorate. What I have said to those people who have signed that petition and the 400 people who wrote a letter is, 'We need to remember that in other parts of Australia some Australians don't have work. There are people who have known nothing other than poverty and debt in their lives. Having to travel eight kilometres to the next Medicare office, if you don't want to mail your claim form, and to keep them open in rural and regional areas where country towns are literally dying, is perhaps not such a major sacrifice to make.' Once I made these statements, the complaints stopped coming in. Ms Macklin-Ha, hal",127
214,Dr NELSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"It might seem like an innovative thing to remind one's constituents that their own concerns, which are understandable, cannot easily be divorced from the national interest. One of the things that really aggrieves me about politics is the rampant self-interest you find in day-today lifepeople priming local parish-pump issues and coming down here and saying all sorts of things because it makes them hairy-chested in their own electorates, instead of giving some thought as to what might actually be in the national interest. The $5.2 million that is being saved by closing those Medicare offices is a lot of hard earned taxes paid by a lot of hard working people. With 80 per cent of general practitioner's services being bulk-billed in many parts of our city areas, there is a questionable need for those offices, but that is another issue. This bill provides for the establishment of Medibank Private as an independent statutory corporation. It arises from a recommendation of the Productivity Commission and its inquiry into the regulation of the private health insurance industry. Medibank Private will be a separate legal entity from the Health Insurance Commission with its own board, its own assets and offices separate from Medicare offices, with which we are all too familiar. The bill will also ensure preservation of public sector mobility and the rights of staff to go from one place to another to the new Medibank Private Corporation. It will also facilitate the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the two entities. There is a perception in the private health insurance industry that, because Medicare and Medibank Private share premises, the nation's largest private health insurer is seen to gain a competitive advantage from one-stop shopping and economies of scale achieved through the shifting of administrative costs to the government funded HIC infrastructure. The bill simply gives effect to the government's commitment to competitive neutrality in the industry, as Medibank Private will now be seen to be subject to the same competitive pressures as other funds. As a result of this separation, the Health Insurance Commission and its board will now be able to focus on the core functions of processing Medicare benefits and pharmaceutical benefits in addition to the subsidiary payments services such as childcare rebates. The purpose of a Medicare office is not to keep politicians elected to come up here. It is not to keep public servants employed. The role of a Medicare office is to process Medicare claims, pharmaceutical benefits and child-care cash rebates, at least at the moment. That is the primary purpose. If we are running a company, Australia Incorporated, and we are trying to return the finances of this country to surpluses, as we are determined to do, you have to look at everything. You have to look at the core activities of Medicare offices. The core activity of a Medicare office is not to support a private health insurance company, albeit in perceptual terms. This is not a sell-off, as has been suggested, but rather it will maintain Medibank Private as a wholly owned government business enterprise. We have not gone as far as the Labor Party did with the airlines or the Commonwealth Bank and sundry other things that they privati sed. Medibank Private cannot be sold without further amendment of the act by parliament. I notice that opponents have' argued, amongst other things, that Medibank Private will now endure higher costs. However, Medibank Private and the previous Labor government constantly argued that Medibank Private was in no way subsidised by the Health Insurance Commission. I am sure that they were right, and the veracity of those assurances will now be tested. You cannot say one thing in government for 13 years and then suddenly go into opposition-into opportunistic opposition, I might add-and suddenly reverse the arguments, as we hear day to day. Is it any wonder that the Labor Party lacks credibility in the community when they maintain these kinds of views? The bill will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to take on additional functions such as health payment services and the provision of health information. A possible future expanded role for the commission could be as a national payments agency for all government funded transactions in the health sector, as recommended by the National Commission of Audit. I understand at the moment that the government has no plans to do this, but it remains, nonetheless, a possibility. The payment of the child-care cash rebate will probably be transferred to the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. In its recent report on private health insurance, the Industry Commission found that Medibank Private achieved lower management costs per membership than the rest of the industry but was unsure to what extent this reflects a statistical artefact, genuinely higher technical efficiency or cost shifting to Medicare. Again, to counter the arguments that are being put up on the other side, it stands to reason that an insurer that has 26 per cent of the market must, by definition, have better economies of scale than one that might be covering only 20,000 or 30,000 contributors. The General Manager of Medibank Private, Mr Ken Macdougall, was reported in the West Australian on 24 April this year as saying that Medibank Private's links with the Health Insurance Commission were 'neither holding back Medibank Private nor putting it a step ahead of other insurers'. If you cannot trust the person who is in charge of Medibank Private, if this person cannot be relied upon to give us accurate statements, then what in the blazes is the opposition on about? The General Manager of Medibank Private has said that he does not believe that the relationship with the Health Insurance Commission is either holding it back nor, more importantly, giving it any kind of market advantage. He has written to Medibank Private contributors assuring them that premiums would not rise as a result of the yearlong process of separation. There are pressures on premiums, which I will get to in a moment, but they will not be due to the separation of Medibank Private from Medicare. Many Australians would obviously ask themselves why the government is in the business of running a private health insurance company when there are others who are literally working the marketplace as private operators. The Productivity Commission report in terms of private health insurance premiums made a number of comments. On page 196 the report said: Average hospital insurance premiums increased by around 75 per cent from the years 1989-90 through to 1995-96. The consumer price index increased by 18.7 per cent over the same period leaving a increase in private health insurance premiums of around 46 per cent. The reason I make emphasis on that point is that in government at the time was the Labor Party, now opposition. When private health insurance premiums were increasing at a critical rate, and when the most sensible health minister they had, Graham Richardson, was arguing it was important to maintain a critical mass in private health insurance of around 40 per cent, premiums were increasing, on average, 12 per cent per year, not one of those applications for a premium increase had been rejected by the Labor Party in government and there was an 18.7 per cent real increase in the first five years of this decade. The hypocrisy that really gets in my craw about people in opposition now criticising the minister and the government for private health insurance premium increases gives me cause not to sleep too easily. I also find it rather hypocritical that the ideologues of the Labor Party-and I know the member for Jagajaga could never be described that way-against all that was sane, sought to undermine private health care either deliberately or through wilful neglect. There are a series of things that were done by the Labor Party in government that have brought us to the position that we are in now. Firstly, they said that Australians did not need private health insurance, but now they are here today complaining about the fact that we are going to separate Medibank Private from Medicare. It reached a crescendo during the 1993 election campaign when, from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the then Prime Minister,  the time was estimated to be $5 million, said to the rest of Australia, 'You don't need private health insurance because Medicare and the public hospital system can look after you.' On the same day, one of my patients· in a public housing estate in Hobart, who worked as a volunteer cleaner for a then Labor minister, said to me, 'Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for it.' In other words, what the Labor Party was doing was ignoring the very real thing that the blue-collar working men and women of Australia knew to be right. They knew that our health care system had evolved from egalitarian principles and a health insurance ethic. If you read the newspapers you will find that what certain individuals from the Labor movement were doing every Christmas was booking into some of the most prestigious private hospitals in Australia. In Christmas 1995, we had the Keatings, the Whitlams, the Hawkes and a whole string of these people table. ?ooked in-o one of the best private hospitals m AustralIa-and I applaud them for doing that. I am not in the least bit critical of They have every right to do it. But what really made me angry was that those same people were out there saying to the families in Australia earning less than $40,000 per year, the 850,000 pensioners and the a million people on health care cards that did not need private health insurance. At my first meeting with the member Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was the health minister and I was the President of AMA, an organisation not known for its leftfor wing views-and this is one of the reasons why I am here; if she had taken a different approach, I would still be living a decent life-do you know what she said to me? She said, 'People are wasting their money having war. private health insurance.' She said that people were wasting their money having private health insurance and that they ought to do what - he did. When I asked what she saId, 'Well, I've been in hospital a couple of times in the last 18 months and I paid cash.' That is a perfectly legitimate do. But as I listened to this, I thought to myself, 'Hang on, that's all very well for people who are ministers, whatever the political colour of the government, but what about the people who struggle, really struggle, to pay their private health insurance?' They are the kinds of values of the now opposition who are trying-they think, with some credibility-to attack this particular measure. Then, add to that the removed their subsidies from the reinsurance pool which were worth $220 million in 1996 dollars. They then in 1987 forced the private health insurance funds to pay 25 per cent of the Medicare benefits schedule fee-$215 million in 1996 dollars added to the cost of private health insurance. They then withdrew their private hospital bed day subsidy-another $230 million added to the cost of private health insurance today. They then turned around and, as I said, politically kept saying to people, 'You don't need it.' They forced --pensive prostheses, like hip replacements, Jomt replacements, and so on, onto the basic Everything they did was to push the cost of private health insurance up. It was governthat. ment policy under Hawke, and then Keating, to increase the cost of private health insurance. Why did they want to do that? Because million they are running a class war. Talk about back to the future! The member half for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who I notice was they promoted in the Good Weekend magazine recently as the next Labor Prime Minister, is continuing to run a class war. He is supposed for to have been mentored by Gough Whitlam, - ho has many endearing qualities and a great the mtellect, of course. But here is the member Werriwa describing my constituents, who carry themselves and half the country, as the enemy. That is what we do not need. And what we do not need in Australia, and what we certainly do not need in health, is a class The Labor Party at the 1996 election actually tore down the Berlin Wall. They had an that was, inadequate policy but, nonetheless, a policy - hich recognised they would begrudgingly gIve some financial assistance to private thing to health insurance. - hat the Labor Party has to do now is get behmd the fact that we are providing financial assistance for low income people, who used to vote for the Labor Party. We are going to help them keep their private health insurance. We are changing the regulations under which the private health insurance industry works. - nd a part of that, a common sense part of it, IS to get Medibank Private out of Medicare offices and into the marketplace with the rest fact that they of the industry. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Williams) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. National Australian Football Super Rules Carnival",128
215,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Corio) (7.27 p.m.)Over the past week in my electorate, around 700 players have successfully participated in the National Australian Football Super Rules Carnival. The carnival draws players from every state and territory in Australia, and is held over three match days in the carnival week. This year 28 teams have participated in the supers, masters and seniors divisions of the competition. To qualify to play, one has to be over 35 years of age, and there is no upper limit to the age of the participants. would obviously qualify you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pull the boots back on for the odd run, if you so desired. As a playing member of the Geelong Super Rules Club, I participated in two matches last Thursday and Sunday-and, of course, I am still sporting the bruises and the strains of those two competitive encounters against South Australia and the President's team. Those who play super rules and seek to extend their football life do so for many reasons. It is not only the desire to keep fit which motivates them but also their deep love of the game that now occupies a central and pre-eminent place in the sporting culture of this nation. Super rules is very competitive. But those who play uphold the finest traditions and values of our Australian football code, and treasure the companionship and mateship of the super rules family, which not only includes the players but wives, children and friends as well. This year's carnival was sponsored by the Victorian Health Foundation, under their active for life program, as well as the Geelong Advertiser, the Gordon Technical College and Bay City Plaza. I acknowledge the support of those sponsors as well as the City of Greater Geelong and the Geelong Football Club in bringing this national event to my electorate. It is estimated that the event has brought 1,500 people to the Geelong region and has injected around $2 million into the local economy. The participants and their families have enjoyed not only the match days but also a range of activities which have included family picnic days, golf days, social evenings and local tours. It is this community's social dimension which brings many participants back to the carnival each year. Each sport has members who not only are outstanding participants but are unselfish contributors to our great game in their later years. On Monday night at Kardinia Park in Geelong, National Super Rules inducted nine players into its Inaugural Hall of Fame. I would like to mention these players here tonight: Mick Morrow from Victorian Country, Doug Junior Jones from Queensland, That Barry Edwards from Tasmania, Herman Rodding from the Northern Territory, Steve Eurell from New South Wales, Boyd Warrilow from Western Australia, Bill MCDonald from South Australia; Tony Mathews from Victorian Metro, and Brian Sterling from the ACT. It is a well-deserved award for those players, and I congratulate them and thank them for their magnificent contribution to Australian football down through the years. The carnival has been a resounding success. My congratulations must also go to the organising committee from Geelong Super Rules, who worked tirelessly to stage this event. To John Edsall, Brian Mewha, Laurie Evans, Mark MCPherson, Peter Corkran, Charlie Adornetto, Ray Hocking and Tom Williams, may I express my thanks to you from all the players who were privileged to participate in this national sporting event. They were ably assisted by many people who did the one per centers plus that made the carnival tick over, such as organising time keepers, score board attendants and doing team sheets-people such as my long standing friend Greg Finn, Tony Marinelli, Peter Marie and their legion of helpers. To the central boundary and goal umpires, a job well done and a special mention to Ed Ritchie, who typified the spirit of the carnival, who ran the boundary for four matches during one day and who, I believe, was still at it this afternoon when the teams were still playing. An interesting article in the Bulletin, speculating about the rise in the popularity of Australian Rules, said: But football fans attribute this as much to the excitement of the game itself. It's fast, wild and sexy. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, we are wild and sexy-but in Super Rules we ain't all that quick. (Time expired) High School Students: Visit to Canberra",132
216,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"This week it is my privilege to have two young people from high schools in my electorate visiting Canberra. These two young people are in the gallery tonight and have each written a short speech about what they see as the future of the youth of today. James Field is in year 12 and a student at Wavell High School and Shannan Murphy is in year 11 and at Kedron High School. They were selected by their respective high schools to accompany me to Canberra, based on their scholastic achievements and the interest they have shown in the area of political studies. I would like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Ansett Airlines in flying the students to Canberra for this week's work experience and I would like to read the speeches they have written. James has said: The youth of today are the future of tomorrow. It is not until you stop and really think about this statement just how important a reality it is. We are the generation who will probably see more change in our life than any other. We are the generation who will make decisions about global warming, sustainable development and possibly rules governing Mars. We are entering an age of uncertainty where the only thing that is certain is change. Luckily, we are a more educated generation in world affairs and in the moral and social issues affecting us all. This is probably why we feel dissatisfied at times because often our idealism is shattered with realism. Many youth will turn towards materialism out of frustration and feeling alienated. Many of us aspire at least to finish school, if not complete some tertiary education. We are taught not to always take things at face value but to be critically aware of the world. This may make us openly question traditionally held beliefs and appear to be just rebelling for the sake of rebelling, but what we are doing is expressing our view of ideal. We are often criticised for this view when what we are really doing is thinking, something youth should not be criticised for. If we are to tackle the major changes in our lifetime then we need to have an open mind and consider all possibilities. This is not to to the elders in our life. Some of these decisions we will make will have a great impact not only on ours, but on future generations. We are faced with a life of great choice, incompatible to the past generations who have had their lives planned for them. We the youth should look at this choice as a positive in life and seize the opportunity, rather than seeing this choice as a constant pressure. We the youth are more concerned about the environment, we want to live with a better future, we dislike war and we tolerate our fellow human beings. We are the generation who would rather talk things through than fight them out. The youth have a future ahead of them which will involve decisions on issues abroad and those concerning us at home. We will lead the world into an era of change within the 21st Century. Shannon says: What do I want for and what do I want from my generation? Utopia That's all. Actually, that's what I demand. Well, as perfection-and thus Utopiaare only ideals, what I want from my generation is a constant battle for Utopia, for without ideals nothing can ever improve. Youth today has a bad name. We are labelled as dole bludging, substance abusing, society destroying no-hopers, simply because we do not conform to the morals which some of the older generations wish to force upon us. We are different. We rebel and think differently-and this is what is necessary for the continual development of society. Without it Australia would stagnate. I hope to see, in the future, each generation's different morals, beliefs and ideals become an integral part of that generation's government, legal system and society. Think of racial equality, sexual equality and homosexuality. Fifty years ago these were unheard of and unacceptable and only now are they becoming socially acceptable and protected by the government. Still, sometimes they are not. Conservatists would tell us that these go against the very basis on which this nation was founded. The tradition. Tradition is only another word for fear of change. Apathy helps no-one: not youth and not the people we are challenging. The best advice I can offer is, if you're going to complain-do it loudly. Protest. The right to protest is one of the basic principles of democracy. Why do you think it is the first right taken away by totalitarian regimes? We want Utopia. Whether or not we ever achieve this doesn't matter. What is important is realising a perfect world starts within. By taking personal responsibility for changing things we don't like instead of wallowing in apathy we can achieve what we want. There is an ancient law-do what thou wilt but harm no-one. This is the road to say we should not listen Utopia. These comments by these young people give us hope for our future. These young people have a vision. If our future is to be handed to young people like these, Australia is going to be in very safe hands. Freedom of Speech",133
217,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my concern about matters relating to the publication of an article entitled 'The art of shoplifting' in 1995 in the Latrobe University student newspaper Rabelais, which was edited by Michael Brown, Melita Berndt, Ben Ross and Valentina Srpcanska. My concern is that the four editors of this student newspaper are facing the prospect of criminal charges associated with the publication of this article. They are currently pursuing an appeal in the Federal Court with respect to the censorship code, seeking to overturn an initial decision in the Federal Court which did not offer them an absolute defence to criminal charges by ruling that the censorship code did not apply to the publication that they were involved with. In my view, there is a fairly important issue of free speech involved in this issue. Obviously I do not condone the content of the article, but I think it is worth pointing out that the article is essentially a satirical one. It was intended to make a political point about the living standards of many students who have to live in circumstances where they have very little money and therefore obviously the point was that shoplifting was a viable and necessary alternative because of their lack of funds. As I said, I do not condone that but there is a question here about where a line is drawn when the state is interfering in free speech, whether it is through the judicial system or whether it is through regulation. There are a number of examples that we could consider by way of analogy to see how difficult this becomes, including some of the things mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) in her contributi0J?-articles, for example, about picketing where that may be in some ways illegal; articles describing how to use illicit drugs safely, including how to inject yourself safely; or indeed-and I note the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is in the House tonight-articles about how to conduct euthanasia. Although I, like the honourable member for Menzies, am an opponent of euthanasia, I certainly would not agree with the state intervening to prevent anybody from publishing an article saying, 'This is how you can go about euthanasia.' Ultimately, as euthanasia involves death, I think we would all agree that it is a far more serious activity than shoplifting. So I would be interested to know the honourable member for Menzies' views on the matter that I have just raised, but I would hope that he would agree with me that, regardless of our views on euthanasia, we should not interfere with free speech in this way. Clearly, a serious incitement to major crime is something that should be a criminal offence. I think it is worth noting that I supported the former government's racial vilification legislation, which had in mind incitement to things like racial violence and the like as a criminal offence. I am a former student newspaper editor and therefore I think I can say that people in the general community and in this House should not take student newspapers too seriously, also particularly in this instance. As I have said, you have got a satirical point being made-a political point being made-and the response that has occurred is way over the top. The Rabelais article was wrong, but it was not that wrong that the state should intervene to ban it or to charge the publishers or the editors with criminal offences. It is indeed ironic that in 1992 the High Court determined that there was an implied right of free speech in the Australian constitution in the political advertising case. Paraphrasing Anatole France-who I think was the person responsible for the quote-the court decided that the poorest citizen and the most enormous multinational corporation both have equal rights to lodge political advertising on television. It is indeed peculiar that we can live in a society where the constitution holds that giant corporations have freedom of speech that cannot be interfered with by regulation of political advertising on TV but that students who write in a student newspaper satirical, political material telling people this is how you go about shoplifting are susceptible to criminal charges and to their publication being banned. That seems to me to be an outrageous infringement of freedom of speech. I do not condone the publication but I think it is a gross overreaction for the state to intervene in the way that it has. If freedom of speech is to be protected, it is absurd that things like bad taste, irresponsible satire and just plain silly articles should be the subject of criminal charges or direct government intervention. So I would hope that other members of this House would have a serious look at this issue because it does raise some serious questions about where censorship and freedom of speech may head in this country. (Time expired) Citrus Industry Mr mCKS (Riverina) (7.42 p.m.)- Mr answers Speaker, as you and most of the members of this House would be aware, the citrus industhe try, particularly in the Riverina, is going through an extremely tough time. Although for many years the industry has faced high and low points, the present low period been brought about by a number of unfortusituation nate circumstances all seeming to occur at the same time. The main problem is the present low world parity price for frozen concentrated orange juice brought about by a large quantity of Brazilian FCO] being available on the world market. In the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, because of environmental conditions this season, there has been a large overrun small fruit that is only good for juicing and the crop, much of which could have been tries exported, has suffered severe frost damage. In the past, governments would have been able to take corrective action to support industry but, because of the previous government's action to have primary industry considered under the umbrella of the World Trade Organisation-the general thrust of which I do not criticise-the present government has very little room in which to manoeuvre if it does not wish to have penalties imposed on its other primary industry exports. However, it is difficult for growers in the Riverina to accept this situation when most are receiving $30 to $50 a tonne for their product, which takes $150 to produce. The reason for the $30 to $150 a tonne is the ever-present threat of the Brazilian juice. Many are finding it difficult to survive and, while they are being told to diversify, it is common knowledge that it costs money to do this and, if they have small holdings, it is difficult to know what they are going to diversify into to make a living. If they are to replant other citrus varieties, it would take at least seven years for those trees to be fully productive and, due to the vagaries of the marketplace, they could no sooner change their orange varieties, or change to grapes or some other crop, when markets for these could also drop. I have made many representations on behalf of the Riverina citrus growers but the only I receive from government are those that my suggestions are not compatible with World Trade Organisation parameters. After a great deal of thought, I believe one of the few areas of direct assistance that government can give is that of reducing or eliminathas ing tax on pure orange juice-the same that applies to milk, which is also a food. I have been led to believe that removing the tax from fresh orange juice that is not made from concentrate would not be in compliance with World Trade Organisation regulations and therefore it would have to be removed from all 100 per cent fresh orange juice, whether Australian or imported. The recent decision of the government to of slow down the reduction of tariffs in the current textiles, clothing and footwear indushas caused dismay in the citrus industry, and growers believe they have been sacrificed on the World Trade Organisation altar in the order to benefit other sectors. If every TCF worker is being subsidised, as is suggested, to the tune of $20,000 each per annum by the community, should assistance not be provided to citrus farmers, who work up to 12 or 15 hours a day, seven days a week? The citrus farmers are also Australians and believe they should be treated in the same way as other working Australians. Presently, the government is proposing to provide funding to the Riverina region through a rural partnership program similar to the one already operating successfully in the Sunraysia and the Western Division of New South Wales. The program provides an opportunity for communities to· put their collective knowledge, skills and experience together to deliver sustainable development in their regions. It aims to achieve: productive and professional farm business management that has the capacity to embrace climatic, economic and social change; sustainable natural resources and conservation management so that business and communities will be viable in the long term; robust and selfsufficient communities with a reasonable level of services to support a good quality of life; and a local capacity for comprehensive, coordinated and community based planning into the future. I believe the citrus industry has a tremendous future if we can just get over this short period when all these difficulties have come together. Its export trade is increasing, and that is the way the citrus industry is heading. I believe the quality of citrus in the Riverina is second to none, but we do have to get over this short difficult period. While not a cure, the rural partnership program will help. In the short term, I am asking the government to look at reducing tax on 100 per cent citrus juice as a means of assisting industry out of its present serious situation. Greenhouse Gases",134
218,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Once again, the government has made Australia look out of place and out of step with the thinking of the rest of the world. This time the issue is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions where Australia's position is fundamentally at odds with the rest of the world. As well as irking the Americans and the Europeans, Australia has now beat up on and bullied into submission the Pacific Island nations, whose very existence is threatened by global warming. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims that the jury is still out on the scientific for the greenhouse effect and, therefore, it is not something to be taken seriously. I have always maintained that it is possible to have a scientific debate about the nature and extent of climate change while, at the same ,time, undertaking measures to reduce greenhouse causing emissions. The planet simply cannot afford to wait until there is 100 per cent conclusive evidence either way. Furthermore, the reduction in greenhouse gases has other significant environmental pluses .. Air pollution as a consequence of greenhouse emissions can have as varied results as the decline in productivity of agricultural and forestry land to additional costs of cleaning, repair and maintenance of affected property. For example, the annual cost of pollution in terms of cleaning buildings has been estimated at around $13 million per annum in Sydney alone. This is all without even mentioning the costs to health and the health system. By decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, Australia would be encouraging alternative, renewable sources of energy and environmentally sustainable infrastructure and technology. Wind energy in California and in Denmark is at a level which is competitive with fossil fuels. These are all reasons to get started on reducing greenhouse emissions now. The world did not wait for absolutely conclusive scientific evidence with regard to ozone depletion before chlorofluorocarbons were banned. Action was taken then, and action on climate change must be taken now. Just look at the devastating scenes this week of street vendors selling schoolchildren face masks in Malaysia. Increasingly, experts in the field here in Australia are joining with their counterparts overseas in denouncing the Prime Minister's assertions on greenhouse as completely baseless. In today's Age, Professor Peter Nixon, the director of Monash University'S Centre for Policy Studies, said that the Prime Minister's claim-made in question time yesterday-that 90,000 jobs would be lost if Australia agreed to the greenhouse targets would not be supported by any economic model that he was basis aware of. The truth is that, while the Prime Minister bemoans what might happen based on his unsubstantiated views, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has indicated, 60,000 real full-time jobs have been lost in the past year. These are 60,000 real, existing jobs-not the Prime Minister's baseless assertions. The costs of failing to prevent the degradation of the environment are completely ignored by the government. One European Union study has estimated that global warming costs the national income 1.6 per cent for each degree of warming. Furthermore, a study by Bent Sorensen, published this year, estimates that the external costs of expected climate change, taken over the whole of the 21st century, is about $USlO,OOO billion each year. While the government claims that greenhouse emission reductions cost jobs, the truth is that environmental policies have the potential for major employment benefits. In 1994 the environment industry in the United States was responsible for providing more than one million jobs. In addition to this, the number was growing at twice the rate of total employment overall. Decreasing reliance on nonrenewable sources of energy means a shift towards a sustainable economy relying more on building human skills and less on consuming energy and resources. The State of the environment report released last year-which the government tried to bury-states that an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia suggests that land clearance may be contributing up to 20 per cent of total greenhouse emissions; yet the government continues to allow the clearing of native vegetation at a rate of 600,000 hectares per year. There is a myth that environmental degradation affects everyone equally, rich and poor alike. This is not correct. If no action is taken now, protection from and adaptation to climate change will be costly for individuals. When the individual has to meet these costs, the wealthy will be insulated from the effects more so than the poor. The Prime Minister speaks about a differential greenhouse target for· Australia as if we did not live in the same global environment as everyone else. As the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said, Australians' grandchildren are just as affected by climate change as everyone else's. Failure to act now will result in a greater inequity imposed on future generations. British Telecom",136
219,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"In recent weeks and months the financial press has carried reports of a proposed merger between British Telecom and MCI Communications Corporation, an American company, to form what is being described as one of the largest, if not the largest, telecommunications companies in the world. A recent report in the Australian said: 'BT and MCI officials insisted that breaking into the recently deregulated $US 100 billion local phone market in the United States remained a strategic priority for them.' Given this statement, it is worthwhile looking at the track record of BT in Australia. BT formed BT Australasia Pty Ltd, which I will refer to as BTA, in 1987 as a wholly owned subsidiary. In November 1992 BTA successfully tendered to the New South Wales government to design, build and operate a new digital telecommunications network for the government. BTA then established Sydney as its Asia-Pacific regional headquarters and committed to a range of investment and other procurement and development projects. In early 1994, BTA decided that it should become a preferred supplier of telecommunications services to the Australian business community. It proposed to capture this market through the sale and provision of its Option 6 and Option 8 products. It appointed another company to market these products and to obtain, with its assistance, the endorsement of approximately 40 employer associations and other buying groups, including the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Hotels Association. Option 8 offered to provide organisations and their members with Telstra and Optus services at a significant discount and to provide them with a comprehensive range of additional benefits and services. BTA also offered to pay these organisations royalty and sponsorship payments based on the volume of business they and their members and customers provided to BTA. After careful consideration, a number of organisations accepted the submission because its telecommunications services offer was competitive and comprehensive. Organisations which accepted the Option 8 offer and signed an agreement with BTA then publicly endorsed BTA's offer to their members and customers by letters and mail-outs. BTA authorised, printed and distributed brochures throughout Australia to approximately 60,000 businesses and, as a result, approximately 8,000 businesses assigned their telecommunications services to BTA. This business totalled $138 million per year. BTA did not provide the discounts and services to its customers which were obtained by marketing through these organisations. The discounts and services that BTA represented and contracted to provide formed the basis of these organisations' acceptance of BTA's Option 8 offer. Further, I am advised that BTA did not pay the royalty and sponsorship payments to the organisations with which it had agreements. In fact, I am advised that BTA unilaterally cancelled its five-year agreements with these organisations after 12 to 18 months. It unilaterally cancelled its provision of telecommunications services to these organisations and to the customers they introduced to BTA and then transferred the remainder of these customers' accounts to Telstra for an undisclosed fee. Prior to this massive national endorsement, British Telecom and BTA were largely unheard of in Australia by the business community. In July 1995, BTA cancelled the New South Wales government contract and sued the New South Wales government and Te1stra. I am advised that BTA did not fulfil a vast majority of its commitments to its customers. BTA continued to offer its products and accept orders for these products with the full knowledge that it was not providing its customers with offered discounts and other services. There is also evidence that, from about October 1995, BTA did not intend to provide these discounts and services and that it tinued to offer its products, knowing that it was not fulfilling its obligations, until September 1996 when it unilaterally withdrew from the market. It then cancelled its services and sold the customer base, as I said, to Te1stra. After this it employed debt collecting techniques with small business customers that had signed up. None of these customers had received the benefits or all of the benefits that BTA offered them, nor were they able to defend themselves. In light of this, a complaint was made to the ACCC in July 1996 and I believe this has been supported by a number of business organisations, including the Victorian Employers Chamber ()f Commerce and Industry. I urge the ACCC to look at this matter in great detail and I also bring this to the attention of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). Hearing Test Companies",137
220,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to also pick up the theme of products that are advertised and services that are not delivered. In this case it involves hearing test companies which telephone Canvass people, and offer them free hearing tests and the prospect of compensation from their former employers for hearing loss. As a result of a campaign that I and others have been waging against these companies, we have seen legislation introduced in Victoriaand indeed there has been legislation in New South Wales-which disallows touting for claimants by agents in relation to claims for industrial hearing loss compensation. Following the passage of that legislation, a couple of companies went out of business. That also had quite a lot to do with the fact that many claims had been lodged against these companies, EarCare and BetterCare, in Victoria's Small Claims Tribunal by the many people who had been ripped off for sums of money like $250 and $400, which they had paid but for which they had received nothing in return. Recently I followed up with the Victorian WorkCover Authority some aspects of the shutting down of these operations. I am disturbed by the response I received, which confirmed some of the fears that I have held. con- From the Chief Executive of the WorkCover Authority just yesterday I received advice that, although BetterCare had closed down, at its former place of operation, in my own electorate in Sydney Road, we now find a new company established: National Hearing Centres Pty Ltd. At the same address is the law firm of Anders Salwin and Sal win. As the Victorian W orkCover Authority points out to me, Mr Mark Anders Salwin, a solicitor, is the common factor among these three particular entities. The chief executive says that the law firm of Anders Salwin and Salwin is currently engaging in telephone canvassing within Victoria for hearing loss compensation claims. I would urge any Victorians and people who are contacted by agents or representatives of Anders Salwin and Salwin to take a good hard look before they attend meetings to discuss their hearing loss because, if their experience is anything like that of others who have been to BetterCare before them, they will be ripped off and will not get any hearing loss compensation whatsoever. I also encourage people in South Australia who are contacted by representatives of such companies and, in particular, BetterCare to avoid these people like the plague. The letter from the Victorian WorkCover Authority to me says: The introduction of hearing loss entrepreneurs to South Australia is not surprising, given that is yet to introduce controlling legislation. It goes on to note that the workers compensation authority in that state is currently drafting legislative remedies in line with the New South Wales and Victorian statutes. In the meantime I would urge South Australians not to part with their hard-earned cash in response to overtures by BetterCare or other similar companies suggesting that there is a pot of compensation gold at the end of the rainbow because, if the experience of hundreds of others who have gone before them is any guide, they will get nothing back. What will happen is that their money will be taken by these shonks and charlatans.",138

Only in the USA ... and Canada is replaced by a GST only tax, would reduce the (current) litre to around 40 cents for private consumption We are talking about, in broad terms, a reduction of over 40 per cent, which the Deputy Prime advocating within the government, and doing publicly.

If that is the case, it is a most loath to criticise the High Court, but what they that the rule of law is absolutely fundamental where you have the case that citizens cannot afford denied, that is human rights denied and it must be precious to us.

271,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mfairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation (the Corporation) is incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (the Act), which is administered by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. The information outlined below has been provided by the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. (1) Section 71 of the Act gives the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations the power to appoint administrators to Corporations incorporated under the Act. The Registrar appointed an administrator to the Corporation on 22 August 1997. The appointment of the administrator to the Corporation was made by a selective tendering process. (2) The following criteria was used for the statutory administrator appointment: qualifications and experience, experience in communicating sensitively and effectively with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, demonstrated knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander societies and cultures, experience in dealing with the affairs of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Corporations, tender price for the appointment, and NA . agreement to carry out the administration in accordance with specified terms of reference. (3) (a) Ms Shirley A MCPherson was appointed administrator of the Corporation, pursuant to Section 71 of the Act. Her appointn)ent as administrator of the Corporation was cancelled on 10 December 1997. Ms Shirley A MCPherson's experience and qualifications which she brought to the position include: Qualifications CPA-Australian Society of CPA's Associate-Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia Experience Extensive experience in and knowledge of current programs, policies and Aboriginal aspirations in Aboriginal Affairs. Extensive experience in both the private and public sector in the areas of Administration, Accountancy, Management and Feasibility Studies. Ms MCPherson is an Aboriginal person who has worked extensively in Aboriginal Affairs both in the Federal and State Government and as a consultant. She has extensive experience in communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, demonstrated knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies and cultures, and extensive exposure to Aboriginal Corporations. (3) (b) The total amount paid to Ms Shirley MCPherson for the administration of the Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation was $60,110. This cost comprised of time spent by the administrator on the administration, and the time spent by her project team, in assisting with the conduct of the administration, during the period 22 August 1996 to 10 December 1996. Overseas Aid Budget 1996-97 and 199798 (Question No. 1835) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (1) What funds have been allocated for overseas aid in the (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95, (c) 1995-96, (d) 1996-97 and (e) 1997-98 Budgets. (2) Has his attention been drawn to comments made by Mr L. Arnold, Chief Executive of World Vision Australia, that because of the Commonwealth's cuts to overseas aid in its 1996-97 and 1997-98 Budgets, the charity organisation has had to abandon the (a) Likimsi and Abella project in Ethiopia to improve the health of 41 000 people through clean water and improved sanitation, (b) Nankumba project in Malawi to provide HlV/AIDS education and home-based care support to 62 000 people, (c) Zomba District project in Malawi to improve seed supply and increase farmer yields and food security for 30 000 people, (d) Bunyole development project in Uganda to help 10000 people affected by HlV/AIDS and (e) Maciene and Derre projects in Mozambique to improve the health of 20 000 and 37 000 people, respectively, by improving water supplies and sanitation facilities; if so, what is his response to the comments; if not, will he acquaint himself with Mr Arnold's comments and provide a response. (3) Has he (a) received correspondence or (b) been approached by charitable organisations, including World Vision Australia,and their representatives, pointing out the consequences of the Commonwealth's cuts to its overseas aid program in its past two Budgets; if so, what (i) organisations have made official representations to him regarding the cuts and (ii) has been his response to the concerns. (4) If he is not able to divulge which organisations have approached him, is he able to say how many l:1ave contacted him to voice their concerns; if not, why not. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following funds have been allocated to overseas aid: 1993-94 $1410.80 million; 1994-95 $1483.70 million, 1995-96 $1567.30 million, 199697 $1445.80 and 1997-98 $1429.90 million. (2) I am aware of the claim by the Chief Executive of World Vision Australia, Mr Lynn Arnold, that a number of the agency's projects will not proceed because of cuts to the official aid program in 1997-98. I understand that Mr Arnold's concerns are directed in particular at the decision not ceed with the proposed Africa NGO Program (ANGOP). Mr Arnold's claim in respect of the World Vision projects is misleading. Total funds sought by non-government organisations (NGOs) under ANGOP was over $34 million. This was almost four times the amount of money notionally available. In such a competitive environment there was no guarantee that any of the World Vision projects would have been funded. Funding available for the AusAID/NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP), the central NGO funding mechanism, was increased by $3 million in the 1997/98 budget. World Vision will receive a significant proportion of these additional funds. It can allocate these funds to projects in Africa if it so chooses. My Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Andrew Thomson MP, and I responded to Mr Arnold's concerns, on 20 June 1997 and 22 July 1997 respectively. Mr Arnold wrote to me on 28 July regretting the capacity for misunderstanding in the World Vision commentary on the ANGOP decision. (3) (i) I have received correspondence and representations from charitable organisations, including World Vision with regard to cuts to the overseas aid program in the past two budgets. 1996-97 Budget: (a) AusAID's records indicate that 44 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were: Amnesty International, Anglican Board of Mission, Anglican Church Office (Synod), Archbishop of Melbourne's International Relief and Development Fund, Appropriate Technology for Community and Environment (APACE), AUSTCARE, Australian Baptist World Aid Inc, Australian Catholic Relief, Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Executive Service Overseas Program (AESOP), Australian Lutheran World Service, Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA), Canberra PLANNERS, Christian Children's Fund, Community Aid Abroad, Family Planning Tasmania, Family Planning WA, Family Planning Australia, Global Education Centre, Global Learning Centre, Institute of Sisters of Mercy, Interplast Australia, Interserve Australia, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Institute of Sisters of Mercy, International Women's Development Agency, Marist Mission Centre, National Council of Churches (Australia), Overseas Service Bureau, One World Learning Centre, Parramatta Diocesan Commission for Justice and Peace, Paulian Centre, PLAN International Australia, Quaker Service (NSW), to proSudan Interior Mission (SIMAID), Tasmanian Council of Churches, TEAR Australia, Save the Children, World Vision Australia, National Council of Women of Australia, the Population Council, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, World Wide Fund for Nature (Australia), and Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). (b) I also had meetings with the Executive Director and Executive Committee of ACFOA, the Overseas Service Bureau and the South Australian Council of Churches during which representations were made to me regarding the 1996-97 aid budget. 1997-98 Budget: (a) AusAID's records indicate that 12 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were: Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Expert Service Overseas Program (AESOP),: African Enterprise, Australian Baptist World Service, Australian Lutheran World Service, Canberra PLANNERS, Community Aid Abroad (CAA), International Women's Development Agency, OZ.Child, Quaker Service, World Vision Australia, and World Wide Fund for Nature. (b) I met with ACFOA and World Vision during which representations were made to me regarding the 1997-98 aid budget. (ii) My response has been to note that Australia's aid budget, $1430 million in 1997-98, is a very good outcome in the prevailing budgetary circumstances. Australia's Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) is·expected to be 0.27 per cent in 1997-98, which is above the latest average for all Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor countries (0.25 per cent in 1998). This is a considerable commitment to the reduction of poverty in developing countries. The 1996-97 aid budget strengthened the overriding humanitarian focus of our aid program and the 1997-98 budget builds on those changes. Assistance to NGOs through the AusAID-NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP) will be increased in 1997-98 by $3 million or nearly 20 per cent. This increase to the central NGO program in a reduced aid budget is a firm indication of the Government's commitment to a genuine partnership with NGOs. The Government indirectly supports NGOs by offering tax deductibility for financial from members of the public to eligible agencies. This concession is estimated to cost up to $50 million annually in revenue forgone, and represents further recognition by the Government of the valuable role played by NGOs. (4) According to AusAID records, all organisations that have contacted me have been noted above. Ramsey Health Care: Electoral Division of Chisholm (Question No. 1925) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) Is he able to say whether the Member for Chisholm's post office box address appears on the Liberal Party of Australia's 1995-96 electoral disclosure. return as the business address of Ramsey Health Care (Vic.) PIL; if so, will he investigate. (2) Is he able to say when Ramsey Health Care made a donation to the Liberal Party. (3) What are the guidelines relating to post office box services to Members provided by his Department. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, I am informed that this is no longer the case. I understand that the inclusion of the Member for Chisholm's electorate post office box in the return was a clerical error made by the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party of Australia. The error has since been corrected. (2) February and March 1996. (3) The Post Office box and other facilities provided to Members for the operation of their electorate offices are for activities associated with Parliamentary and electorate business. Department of Industry, Science and Tourism: Boards, Councils, Committees and Advisory Bodies (Question No. 1942) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) What boards, councils, committees and advisory bodies fall within the Minister's ministerial responsibilities. (2) For each body referred to in part (1), (a) who are the members and (b) when does the term of each appointee expire. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable contributions member's question is as follows: (1) As Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism I am responsible for the following twenty-five boards, councils, committees and advisory bodies: Department of Industry, Science and Tourism Australian Industry Development Corporation Australian Marine Industries and Sciences Council Australian Tourist Commission Board Automotive Manufacturing Council Indicative Planning Council For The Housing Industry Industry Development Working Group Industry Research and Development (!R&D) Board !R&D Board-Biological Committee IR&D Board-Engineering & Manufacturing Committee !R&D Board-Fund Management Committee !R&D Board-Information Technology & Telecommunications Committee !R&D Board-R&D Start Committee IR&D Board-Tax Concession Committee Infonnation Industries Taskforce Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Australia Committee Light Metal Industry Development Strategy ing Committee Oil and Gas Consultative Group Pooled Development Funds Registration Board Supennarket to Asia Council TCF Advisory Board Tourism Advisory Council Tourism Forecasting Council Tourism Forecasting Council Technical Committee Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Attachment Member Australian Industry Development Corporation Mr Malcolm Geoffrey Irving  Mr Russell Allan Higgins Mr Stephen Thomas Sedgwick Mr Ian Bruce Morison Mr Christopher Skilton # CEO of AIDC-appointed by the Minister ## Secretary-appointed by the Minister Australian Marine Industries and Sciences Council Mr Lance Edwin Hockridge Mr Eoin Michael Asker Dr Lesley Joyce Borowitzka Mr Michael Alfred Burgess Mr Ronald John Eagle Mrs Anne Lillian English  Mr Brian Jeffriess Mr Anthony Papaconstuntinos Dr Peter Edward Power Mr John Rothwell Australian Tourist Commission Board Mr Donald Malcolm Morris Mr Anthony James Clark AM Mr John Noel Morse Mr Gregory James Daniel  Mr Russell Allan Higgins Mr John Herbert Morris Mrs Marylyn Elizabeth Rodgers Ms Bee Ho Teow Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Board Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (2) I submit a list of these portfolio bodies which Steer- details each body's membership and each individual's expiry of tenn.

(2) Will the Government amend those complaints procedures; if so, what changes are being considered. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Commercial radio and television services are covered by their respective industry codes of practice. For commercial television the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice (FACTS Code) (Section 6) deals with the classification and placement of commercials and is intended to ensure that television commercials are classified and broadcast appropriately, in the light of current community attitudes and of the need to limit the exposure of children to material intended for adult viewing.  written complaints about the content of television commercials (as distinct from their placement or the amount of commercials broadcast) will be referred to the Advertising Standards Council (which no longer exists) or, in the case of advertiscode ing directed to children, to the ABA.  revised Code is with the ABA for registration. I understand that the revised Code refers broadcasters to any relevant industry codes of practice and therefore for taste and decency matters in advertising members of the public will be able to complain to the new Advertising Standards Board announced by the Australian Association of National Advertisers on 28 August 1997. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB) Commercial Radio Code of Practice covers advertising and also includes procedures on how the stations will handle complaints. (1) (b) Part 11 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) provides for procedures for complaints about program content on commercial radio and television programs. Complaints alleging offences against the Act and breaches of licence conditions can be made direct to the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA). Complaints concerning program content or alleging breaches of codes of practice are made to the broadcaster in the first instance. If the broadcaster does not respond within 60 days or the response is inadequate, a complaint may be made to the ABA. The ABA is required to investigate provided the complaint is in good faith and is not frivolous or vexatious. Licensees are to provide regular on air information about the code and its complaints procedures.  procedures for handling oral complaints. It provides that licensees will record the substance of telephoned comments and to respond directly to callers who provide their name and contact details. Viewers who complain by telephone about material broadcast which is alleged to breach the code, and who wish to pursue the complaint further, are advised to complain in writing. Licensees are not obliged to respond to written complaints made more than 30 days after a broadcast (Clause 7.6). If the complaint is made within the 30 days period, licensees must seek to provide a substantive response within 10 working days. Where that is not possible, the licensee will undertake in writing to provide a substantive response within a further 20 working days. If a complainant is not satisfied with a response to a written complaint, and raises the matter further in writing to the licensee, the licensee must either reply substantively to the further letter and advise the complainant that he or she may take the complaint to the ABA. It is the ABA's role to assess whether industry codes provide adequate safeguards, to judge the seriousness of a breach and decide on an appropriate course of action. If the ABA is satisfied that a of practice is not operating to provide appropriate community safeguards or there is no code registered, the ABA may determine a standard (s.125 of the Act). Compliance with program standards is a condition of licence (Schedule 2). If the ABA finds that a breach of a code of practice has occurred, this does not represent a breach of licence condition nor of the Act. Compliance with codes is not a condition of licence unless the Authority imposes such a condition. The ABA is also required to investigate alleged breaches of licence conditions set out in subclause 7(1) of Schedule 2 and has a range of sanctions available to it including penalties from $200,000 for commercial television licensees. However it is required to use its powers in a 'a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the breach' (s.5(2». Other options available include the imposing of a condition of licence on the broadcasters requiring compliance with the code of practice. The ABA can issue notices under s.141 and failure to comply may result in penalties ranging from $2M for a commercial television licensee to $50,000 for a commercial radio licensee. Under s.143 the ABA can suspend or cancel a licence and s.125 empowers the ABA to impose a program standard that would apply to all broadcasters in the sector. In addition, the Parliament may amend standards and codes under s.128. (2) The Government is not considering amendments to Part 11 of the Act. Changes to complaint procedures set out in industry codes of practice are a matter for the industry organisations representing the different broadcasting sectors, subject to the Act and registration by the ABA. Imports: Dumping (Question No. 2089) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article appearing in the Sun Herald on 29 June 1997 at page 34 entitled ""Risk to jobs highlighted"". (2) If so, do penalties exist for a company found guilty of dumping; if so what. (3) Was a penalty sought in the case reported in the article; if not, why not. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Under Australia's anti-dumping legislation, action may be taken against dumped imports only if it can be established that such dumping has caused or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods. Penalties may take the form of dumping duties or, under certain circumstances, the Minister may accept a price undertaking from the exporter. (3) In the case referred to in the article, dumping duties were sought by Faber-Castell against highlighters dumped from Germany. In its report on this matter, the Anti-Dumping Authority found that the goods had in fact been dumped, but that the Australian industry producing like goods (FaberCastell) had not suffered material injury caused by dumping and that there was not a threat of material injury from dumping of highlighters from Germany. As a result, the Authority recommended to the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs that no action be taken and the Minister accepted this recommendation. Higher Education Contribution Scheme Refunds (Question No. 2099) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: How many persons are now required to refund money with respect to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) as a result of the Government's retrospective imposition of a lower threshold for the repayment of HECS. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The first point to make is that the lowering of the minimum income threshold for compulsory HECS repayment, while applying to all people with an outstanding HECS debt, is not a retrospective measure as it only applies to income earned from the 1997-98 income year. While individuals with an outstanding HECS obligation will be required to commence repaying sooner, they will not face any increase in their outstanding HECS obligation. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has advised me that the number of individuals with an outstanding HECS debt who will earn an income in the 97-98 income year which is above the minimum income threshold for compulsory HECS repayment is expected to rise by an estimated 156,722 to 409,038 as a result of the lowering of the minimum income threshold to $20,701. However, individuals with an outstanding HECS debt who have a spouse or dependent children, and who would otherwise be required to make repayments as a result of the lowering of the repayment threshold, will be exempt from making repayments if they receive an exemption or reduction of the Medicare levy because of low family income. This has the potential to benefit more than 14,000 people with an outstanding HECS obligation who would otherwise be expected to make a repayment in 1997-98. Australian Defence Force: Crockery (Question No. 2117) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Has a Western Australian company, Australian Fine China, been replaced by overseas companies as supplier to the Australian Defence Force (ADF) of crockery. (2) If so, which overseas companies provide for ADF crockery needs. (3) Will cost savings be achieved; if so, what. (4) Will the companies involved be able to deliver goods to the ADF in the event of a conflict arising in this or any other region. (5) Does the decision reflect the Government's commitment to - improve Australia's unemployment situation; if so, how. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A standing offer for the supply of crockery to the ADF for the next three years was approved on 4 August 1997, replacing the previous standing offer with Australian Fine China, awarded in 1990. (2) The standing offer was awarded to Sirway Asia Pacific. (3) Cost savings in the order of 63% will be achieved from this standing offer. (4) The standing offer allows the Commonwealth to .source its requirements from another source in the event of a state of emergency. (5) The decision is a result of application of the Commonwealth's purchasing principles. It was made on the basis of an accountable tendering process and reflects this Government's commitment to credible, open decision making. As to employment, I understand that the Defence contract was a small proportion of Australian Fine China's business. (Question No. 2128) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for assistance Industry, Science and Tourism upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Are steps being taken to protect Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) export companies which do not support a further reduction in tariffs between the 2000 and 2005; if so, what. (2) Has the Government received submissions seeking a pause to enable a catch-up from regional and international trading competitors from (a) AMCO, (b) Australian Country Spinners, (c) Australian Weaving Mills, (d) Austrim, (e) Bartex Fabrics, (f) Blundstones, (g) Bonds Industries, (h) Bradmill Undare, (i) Brintons, G) Country Road, (k) DuPont, (I) Godfrey Hirst, (m) Leading Spinning, (n) Macquarie Textiles, (0) Melded Fabrics, (p) National Textiles, (q) Rocklea Spinning Mills, (r) Shaw Industries, (s) Sheridan Australia, (t) SportsgirllSportscrafi Group, (u) Tascot Templeton, Victoria Carpets, (v) WM Ritchie, (w) Yakka, (x) Yarra Falls and (y) YKK. (3) Has the Government responded to the export companies referred to in part (2); if so, what was the response. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) The Government announced the policy arrangements for the Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industries to apply beyond 2000 on 10 September 1997. These have the full support of the TCF industries and provide a predictable policy framework for firms to plan to meet their investment, production and export objectives well ahead of 2000. (2) The companies listed made submissions to the Industry Commission. Many companies copied their submissions direct to various Ministers: (c) Australian Weaving Mills, (d) Austrim, (e) Bartex Fabrics, (f) Blundstones, (g) Bonds Industries, (h) Bradmill Undare, (k) Du Pont, (1) Godfrey Hirst, (p) National Textiles, (q) Rocklea Spinning Mills, (r) Shaw Industries, (s) Sheridan Australia, (w) Yakka. (3) The Government noted all received submissions and responded foreshadowing the process that was finalised with the Government's 10 September 1997 announcement. Telstra: Directory Assistance Call Charges (Question No. 2138) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications Tariffs and the Arts, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Will Telstra introduce charges for directory calls; if so, will the Government ensure that all Telstra business offices and every post , office in Australia and its territories is provided with a complete set of telephone directories for each State and Territory. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra will not be introducing charges for directory assistance calls. On 2 July 1997, Telstra made a formal submission to the Government proposing a charge a charge of 50 cents for 'non-genuine' directory assistance inquiries, in return for a $5.40 reduction in annual line rental, and exemptions for disadvantaged groups. In accordance with the notification and disallowance procedures under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, the Minister referred Telstra's proposal to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for its report. The ACCC reported to the Minister within 30 days. The Government is fully committed to the availability of an effective directory assistance service and is concerned with the effects of overuse. However, after careful consideration of the ACCC report and bearing in mind the Coalition's pre-election commitment, restated by the Prime Minister in Parliament earlier this year, the Government has decided to. reject the proposal. The Minister has advised Telstra accordingly. Australia Post has an agreement with Telstra to provide public access, at official post offices, to the white and yellow pages for the local telephone district, contiguous telephone districts, and for each of the State and Territory capital cities. In addition, each GPO and selected larger post offices are required to stock a full national set of telephone directories. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander . Commission: Staff Training (Question No. 2159) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 27 August 1997: (1) What sum is spent by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on staff training. (2) Does the training have a travel component; if so, what is it. (3) What is the State by State break up of (a) training costs and (b) training costs per capita.",179
272,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) $1,278,188 (2) No. (3) State by State break up of (a) training costs Central Office NSW Vic Qld SA WA Tas NT (b) training costs per capita Central Office $1,461.69 NSW $1,282.92 Vic $717.16 Qld $1,569.08 SA $1,371.61 WA $503.92 TAS $1,403.31 NT $876.28 ATSIC: Strelley and Nomads Organisations (Question No. 2161) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to part (1) of question No. 1929, (Hansard, 3 September 1997, page 7457), what Funding, in total, has been provided to the Strelley Housing Society and Nomads Charitable and Education Foundation Incorporated. (2) Is the Minister able to say what action the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has taken or will take following the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's (ATSIC) referral of a copy of the Duesburys report to the ASC. (3) Has ATSIC recovered surplus grant funds from the Strelley Housing Society and Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation Incorporated; if so what.",193
273,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following details of funding provided to the Strelley Housing Society and Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation since the inception of ATSIC: 1990/91$1,121,866; 1991192-$1,048,955; 1992/93$1,115,309; 1993/94-$62,586. (2) ATSIC has received the following advice $488,205 from the ASC: $174,478 The ASC can only inspect books of a related $30,121 third party which are required to be kept under the $221,241 Corporations Law. $106,986 The ASC, in conducting an inspection, has no $84,155 express right of entry onto premises. If a related $26,663 party denies entry to its premises the ASC will be $146,339 unable to use its inspection powers to enter these premises. The ASC has no power to release to ATSIC any information it may find from the inspection of books of a related party. In view of the response provided by the ASC, ATSIC has no other avenues available to it to undertake any further investigation into the affairs of Strelley/Nomads. (3) ATSIC has recovered all surplus grant funds it was entitled to recover from Strelley/Nomads. ATSIC further advises that the amount of funds recovered was $227,844.72. Fire Brigades: Universal Couplings (Question No. 2167) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: (1) Is he able to say whether the Australasian Fire Authorities Council represents all Australian and New Zealand agencies with a responsibility for the protection of life and property from fire and other emergencies. (2) Since his answer to question no 403 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3318), what progress has been made by the Council and Standards Australia towards (a) manufacturing the Storz-type fire-hose coupling locally and (b) replacing other couplings currently in use with the Storz-type coupling. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australasian Fire Authorities Council represents the majority of Australian and New Zealand agencies with a responsibility for the protection of life and property from fire and other emergencies. (2) The Australian Fire Authorities Council at meeting in April 1996 endorsed the development of a national standard design for a Storz-type coupling which could be manufactured locally. I am advised that neither the Australian Fire Authorities Council nor Standards Australia is able to fund the work required to support the development of a national standard design. In the interim, one of the Australian Fire Authorities's committees is currently undertaking a review of the couplings in use by member agencies with a view to developing accurate costing for the widecscale replacement by the Storz-type coupling. Australian Research Council: Assessors (Question No. 2168) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 28 August 1997: (1) What proportion of assessors chosen to review Australian Research Council (ARC) grant applications in 1995 came from (a) the University of New South Wales, (b) the CSIRO, (c) other public research organisations and (d) private sector organisations. (2) What proportion of members of. the Large Grant panels in 1996 came from the (a) 17 Australian universities established after 1987 and (b) so called ""group of eight"" universities. (3) What policy has the ARC adopted with regard to the use of assessors from outside the university sector. (4) What procedures does the ARC use to prevent conflict of interest on the part of (a) assessors (b) panel members. (5) What guidelines has the ARC published for appeal procedures against decisions where it has decided not to award grants. Dr Kem-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Departmental records regarding assessors used for each application are maintained on individual files and other paper based documents. To provide the figures for 1995 would require excessive use of Departmental resources and effort and therefore cannot be provided. However, for the 1998 Large Research Grants, Research Fellowships and the Strategic Partnership with Industry-Research and Training (SPIRT) Program, as of 5 September 1997, 6,599 out of 12,167 assessments were undertaken by assessors its outside the Australian Unified National System (US) Institutions during 1997. Of the assessments undertaken by researchers in Australian US Institutions, the University of New South Wales undertook 9% overall, compared to 8% overall by the University of Melbourne and 9% overall by the Australian National University. Researchers in US institutions made· under 50% of all assessments. The other assessments were carried out by other Australian researchers and researchers from the international community. (2) Advisory Panel members have been appointed to ARC panels because of their research expertise, their high standing in the research community and their ability to provide expert and timely research advice in areas of greater breadth than their own specialist experience. Of the 37 Large Grant Discipline panel members in 1996, approximately one third came from the 17 Australian universities established after 1987 and less than two thirds came from the ""group of eight"" universities. During 1995, the National Board of Employment, Education, and Training (NBEET) commissioned a review of the ARC's procedures for appointments to its Committees and Discipline Panels. The report of this review, carried out by Ms Dunn of MI Murren Enterprises, was published in early 1996. The Dunn Report recommended formalising selection procedures and making the nomination and selection process more transparent and accountable. As a result changes were introduced in 1996 to the process for nominating and selecting committee and panel members for 1997. Changes in the selection process included: development of selection criteria for all committees and panels covering tise, research experience, professional and academic standing and committee skills; establishment of a Selection Group to recommend appointments to committees and Panels to the Chair of the National Board and Minister; development of a formalised nomination process which included the nomination of one male and one female for each vacancy for which there were suitable nominees; and committees and panels were asked to provide three nominees for each vacancy in their group, with the final recommendations on membership being determined by the Selection group. (3) The ARC selects assessors on the basis of their expertise. As outlined above, over half of assessments were undertaken by assessors outside the Australian US Institutions. The ARC policy is that Panels may seek assessments from independent assessors drawn from the Australian and international research community. This is outlined in the guidelines of the various schemes. (4) (a) The Large Research Grants Scheme Guidelines require that the Applicant nominate up to three assessors who are qualified to assess the project. The assessors nominated must not be close family members of the applicant, and normally must not be from the applicant's own institution. They should not have worked or published jointly with the applicant in the past five assessors should not be involved in drafting or commenting on the application prior to submission. Nominated assessors must not be members of the ARC, the Research Training and Careers Committee (RTCC) or ARC Discipline Panels. Applicants may identify a particular researcher(s), who should not be approached to provide an assessment, with an explanation for the exclusion requested. Panels may disregard assessments which are heavily biased in favour or against the applicant. In the Assessor guidelines, Assessors are required to disclose any conflict of interest. Any allegations of conflict of interest are investigated. Similar provisions are contained in other program guidelines. (4) (b) NBEET Conflict of Interest Guidelines for holders of public office apply to all members of ARC Committees, Panels and Working Parties, including persons co-opted to assist the work of these bodies. The guidelines require a member to declare direct pecuniary interest, indirect pecuniary interest or potential conflict of interest. The Members and Administrators Handbook also sets out Conflict of Interest Guidelines (attached). (5) Under ARC Large Research Grant Scheme discipline exper- Guidelines: ""If an applicant is notified that hislher application is unsuccessful, the applicant will have an opportunity to appeal against selection process by notifying the ARC Chair, through the institution Research Office, in writing. Appeals must be lodged within 28 days of the date on the letter of notification of outcome from the Director, Individual Grants Section. All appeals must be sent to: The Appeals Officer, Research Branch, Higher Education Division, Department of, Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, POBox 9880, Canberra City ACT 2601. Appeals will be heard only against process issues. Appeals will not be heard against evaluative Committee decisions or assessor ratings/comments. An applicant may appeal only where there is clear evidence that the process followed has contravened the Program Guidelines. All appeals will initially be referred to the Chair of the relevant Panel and the Chair of the RGC. The Panel Chair and the Chair of the RGC will provide comment for consideration by the Appeals Committee, which is comprised of people who have not been involved in the decision making process for the Large Research Grants"". Similar provisions are contained in other program guidelines. APPENDIX 5(g) NATIONAL BOARD OF EMPLOYMENT, years. Nominated EDUCATION AND TRAINING NA NA Scope These guidelines apply to all 'members', defined as: (a) fulland part-time holders of public office appointed by the Governor General to the National Board and its constituent Councils under the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 ('the Act'); (b) part-time members of committees and panels appointed by the Board Chair under Part IV of the Act; (c) all members co-opted to assist the work under (a) and (b) above on working parties, working groups, steering committees, advisory panels and the like; and (d) Counsellors appointed by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs under Part IX of the Act. These guidelines supplement those already existing for the ARC Committee and panel members. Legislative requirements and policy Conflict of interest arises inevitably from time time but must be disclosed and dealt with. The legislative requirement to disclose pecuniary interests is contained in Section 60 of the Act. Sections 20(2)(b) and 35(1) require the Governor General to terminate a Board or Council member's appointment for failure to disclose interests without reasonable excuse. Other appointments may be terminated similarly by the Minister or Board Chair as appropriate. Non-disclosure also puts at risk any consultancy contract, grant or other award. The following guidelines do not attempt to cover all cases where a conflict of interest may occur. Members may find themselves in situations that are not clear cut-where there is a genuine doubt as to whether a conflict of interest should be declared. In such circumstances, members should err on the side of caution and declare a potential conflict of interest. The procedures outlined below for declaring an indirect pecuniary interest should then be followed. Direct pecuniary interest A direct pecuniary interest should be declared wherever there is potential for a member to gain financially from the results of discussions or decision-making processes. This may include a company directorship or shareholding; as financial investment; a consultancy or research or other grant, involving personal financial gain; or such a consultancy or grant involving financial gain to the member's employer (eg a company, community organisation, TAFE college, school system, school, or higher education institution) in circumstances where the member will benefit directly from the consultancy or grant. In applying the Section 60 provisions, it is Board policy that members not only (a) not take part in any decision to which the potential conflict of direct pecuniary interest applies; but also (b) physically absent themselves from all or any part of a formal meeting or other discussion at which the matter in question is being discussed. All declarations of conflict of interest are to be recorded in the minutes of the relevant meeting. An indirect pecuniary interest may arise from members' employment, professional interests or from their personal relationships. In the case of employment/professional interests, members who hold a formal position of authority in a non-commercial. organisation such as an educational institution should be considered to hold an indirect pecuniary interest in a wider range of circumstances than would be the case for those without such a position. A university Deputy ViceChancellor (Research), for example, should declare to an interest in any project, grant or consultancy for which a member of the university has applied, and a head of department should similarly declare an interest wherever departmental members are involved. In the same way, a school principal should declare an interest in applications from any staff member. With respect to members' personal relationships, an indirect pecuniary interest may involve, for example, an application for a consultancy or grant from a member's partner or relative, a close personal friend or a close professional colleague. In cases where a member declares an indirect pecuniary interest, the prescribed body or relevant authority (as specified in Section 60) should determine the extent to which a member may be involved in the discussion or decision concerning the matter involving the potential conflict of interest. All declarations are to be recorded in the minutes of the relevant meeting. Non-pecuniary conflict of interest Section 60 does not cover actual or potential non-pecuniary conflict of interest that may arise from a member simultaneously having an appointment to, or employment or consultancy or other involvement with, another organisation or body in some way involved with portfolio policies or programs. The situation may arise if the interests of NBEET and the other body or organisation are in conflict, or if access to information arising from NBEET membership could be used to unfair advantage if divulged to the other organisation or body. In certain circumstances the member may need to consider resigning NBEET membership, or severing links with the other organisation or body as appropriate, to avoid an ever present conflict of interest. In less extreme cases, the member may need to refrain from participating in, or to constrain participation in, relevant discussions or activities the other organisation or body in order to protect NBEET's interests. Avoiding a conflict of interest The Board recognises that in certain specialised areas of research or consultancy, there may be a very limited number of individuals, project teams or organisations with the expertise and knowledge required. The above requirements for declaring an interest must nevertheless be applied if a conflict of interest actually arises or may be seen to have arisen. However, it may be possible to foresee a potential conflict of interest at some future time and to take steps to prevent it from actually arising. For example, a steering committee or working party of may decide to develop a brief for a consultancy or research project in an area in which a member of that committee/working party is expert. In such cases, the member may wish at the outset to state an inability to take any part either in developing the brief or in evaluating proposals received in response to it, thereby enabling herlhim to tender for the project without conflict of interest. Declaration of financial interests Board and Council Chairs and Counsellors also declare any relevant financial interests on a prescribed form. These are retained in the custody of the Director of NBEET and are available for reference if required by the Minister or other authorised person.",193
